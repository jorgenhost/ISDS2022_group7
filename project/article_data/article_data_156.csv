Fact-checking White House criticism of CBO health care analysis
","As the Congressional Budget Office prepares its assessment of the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the White House is already casting doubt on the agency’s credibility. During a segment on ABC’s This Week, White House Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney pointed to the CBO’s track record on the ACA as evidence that the agency isn’t capable of assessing a large piece of legislation. ""If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are,"" Mulvaney said March 12. ""So, I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard. They do. Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing."" This talking point has been popping up a lot in the last week.   Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, painted a less-than-rosy picture of the CBO’s track record on Fox News Sunday on March 12. In addition, at a March 8 press conference, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, said ""If you’re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place."" Mulvaney has a point that the CBO’s projections for how many people would gain coverage through the ACA was higher than reality, but that criticism isn’t enough to undermine its ability to analyze the Republican repeal-and-replace bill. CBO predictions versus reality The CBO — the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress — released enrollment projections for the health care law in March 2010. It estimated that 21 million people would purchase coverage through the new insurance exchanges by 2016. At the end of 2016, more than 11.5 million individuals actually signed up for 2017 coverage, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That’s a difference of 9.5 million enrollees, even more than the figure Mulvaney provided. It's also possible Mulvaney was referring to CBO's March 2010 estimate of the reduction in the number of uninsured people. The CBO predicted 30 million fewer people would be uninsured in 2016 because of the ACA. However, in March 2016, the CBO reduced its estimate of the same quantity to 22 million. That's a difference of 8 million people on the mark.  Still, experts said CBO’s forecasts were reasonable at the time. ""With respect to precise quantitative point estimates, the differences between CBO's estimates and actual experience are well within the range that I would expect given the scope of the change CBO was being asked to analyze,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. Fiedler also noted that CBO's ""big picture"" assessment of the impact of the ACA on insurance coverage was on point. Specifically, the agency estimated a significant decrease in the number of people without health insurance that would leave the uninsured rate at a historic low, which is what occurred, he said.  In addition, the figure ignores the fact that the 2010 prediction couldn’t account the Supreme Court decision about Medicaid expansion that allowed each state to decide for itself. Nineteen states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility. According to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, the CBO overestimated enrollee total, but still offered projections closer to reality than four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group). Importantly, the CBO reduced its projection of how many people would get health insurance this year through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces, from 21 million to 13 million. Initially, CBO analysts believed exchange enrollment would be higher in part because employers would drop insurance plans in favor of the marketplaces. That has not occurred. ‘They’re not capable’ Just because the CBO overestimated one measure of the Affordable Care Act in the past is not a reason enough to believe that they will miss in the same direction in the future, Fielder said. In fact, the CBO continuously adjusts their projections to incorporate new data, research, and experience, so if anything they shouldn’t repeat the same mistakes. With respect to the House bill, the CBO has the advantage of having just seen how implementing the ACA impacted insurance coverage. ""That experience will be particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of rolling back provisions of the ACA, meaning that, if anything, one should probably expect estimates of this legislation to be more accurate than CBO's estimates of the effects of enacting the ACA,"" Fielder said. No prediction will ever be perfect, but for the most part, experts who have studied the CBO have found their projections to be largely sound. For example, the National Tax Journal in 1988 concluded that short-run projections from the CBO do not contain bias. A 2000 report comparing the forecasting of the CBO and the Federal Reserve Board concluded that, ""The most accurate forecasting is done by the CBO, with the Fed a close second."" Even the CBO released its own report in November 2015 that looked at how accurate their predictions have been, as well as what factors have contributed to forecasting errors. On average, between 1982 and 2014, the CBO overestimated two-year revenue forecasts by 1.1 percent and six-year projections by about 5.3 percent. Our ruling Mulvaney said, ""If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are."" Mulvaney went on to say that the CBO may not be capable of assessing the GOP’s replacement plan. The initial CBO analysis of the Affordable Care Act did forecast that more people would participate in health care exchanges than actually did, but the CBO has revised those estimates. Moreover, independent analyses, as well as experts agree that the CBO offers some of the best estimates given the information available at the time. Mulvaney’s statement is partially accurate, but misses context that would give readers a different picture of the CBO. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809726AB40>],/factchecks/2017/mar/12/mick-mulvaney/fact-checking-white-house-attack-nonpartisan-cbos-/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Public Health', 'Missouri', 'Caleb Rowden']","
Caleb Rowden mostly right about Missouri Medicaid costs
","A hot-button topic in Missouri this year has been the state budget, a large part of which goes to social services, primarily Medicaid. With more budget cuts looming, funding these services may be hard to maintain. That’s what state Sen. Caleb Rowden suggested in mid-January before Gov. Eric Greitens unveiled his proposed state budget. At a legislative breakfast Jan. 20, Rowden said, ""This would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget."" Rowden then said maintaining this current level of spending for social services is not an option given the revenue shortfalls officials expect. Ten billion dollars is a massive amount of money, and the figure piqued our interest. We wanted to know if this level of Medicaid spending could be correct. Where does the state gets its money for Medicaid? Before diving deeper into Rowden’s claim, it’s important to get some background on the Medicaid program. Medicaid is designed to provide health coverage for lower-income families, people with disabilities, senior citizens, pregnant women and newborns, blind and visually impaired, uninsured women, families, kids, and women with breast or cervical cancer. As of November 2016, 69 million people nationwide were covered through Medicaid. Missouri disperses Medicaid to participating residents through its MO HealthNet program under the Department of Social Services. A document by the Missouri Budget Project explains how Missouri funds Medicaid. The majority of funding for Medicaid — 83 percent — comes from the federal government through two programs. One program called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, matches federal government dollars to state dollars spent on health care services based on a percentage rate. Missouri's FMAP rate for fiscal year 2018 is 63.21 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. This means that for every dollar Missouri spends on health care — not just Medicaid — the federal government gives $1.72.  Of the total money Missouri receives from the FMAP program, only a certain amount goes to Medicaid. The rest goes toward other health care services the state provides. Fifty-one percent of Missouri's Medicaid spending is funded through FMAP.  The other program — Federal Reimbursement Allowance — along with other capital reserves, covers another 32 percent of Missouri’s spending on Medicaid. Missouri has been participating in this program for 25 years. So this leaves Missouri picking up only 17 percent of its own Medicaid bill. This money comes from collected state revenue.  Dan Haug, acting budget director for the state, told us in a phone call that he expects Medicaid to cost the state $10.21 billion in the coming fiscal year. This would make Rowden’s statement true, but we wanted to check the budget to see where all the Medicaid money went. Figuring out Medicaid Finding Medicaid spending in the state budget is complicated. The bulk of Medicaid spending falls under the Department of Social Services. In the last fiscal year, the state approved $9.2 billion for the DSS, $7.7 billion of which went toward Medicaid. At first glance, this seems like this is the total budget for Medicaid in the state. There are really no other places in the budget where Medicaid is clearly defined as an expense. So Rowden’s claim about the Medicaid budget is false, right? Not so fast. In fact, Medicaid money is spent by more agencies than just the DSS. It is used for other services spread throughout the state budget, most notably in the Department of Mental Health. Traci Gleason, the director of communications and public engagement at the Missouri Budget Project, confirmed that nearly 20 percent, or $2 billion, of the Medicaid budget goes toward mental health services, driving the total budget of Medicaid closer to that $10 billion figure. Where does the rest of Medicaid spending go? Even an expert such as Gleason said that’s very tricky to determine. Part of the reason for this is because portions of the Medicaid budget are listed as MO HealthNet, which is the health care system Missouri switched to in 2007. Through the MO HealthNet name, a series of supplemental appropriations sections are added at the bottom of the state budget document. Some of the services funded through supplemental appropriations, such as pharmacies, physicians and premium services, fall under the Medicaid budget. When you add all the supplemental appropriations together for services that fall under Medicaid, it comes out to $10,023,904,918. While this falls short of Haug’s estimate, it does make Rowden’s statement about the Medicaid budget correct.  ""It’s really hard to drill down (the Medicaid spending) because it’s spread over all sorts of different departments and programs,"" Gleason said. ""Overall, though, Sen. Rowden is correct with his totals."" Nevertheless, because the state is responsible for funding only 17 percent of the total on Medicaid, the total amount Missouri will spend is $1.7 billion from state revenue.  Our ruling Rowden was trying to illustrate that Medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels. According to Greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018, the budget for Medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget. Despite the growing concern from Republicans on the cost of Medicaid spending, Greitens has recommended $10.7 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018, an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017. However, it’s important to note that ""we"" — as in the state of Missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion. Because of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage and the Federal Reimbursement Allowance programs, the state only has to spend approximately $1.7 billion of state revenue on Medicaid. So while Medicaid spending will exceed $10 billion of the nearly $28 billion budget, not all of the money is coming directly from the state. Rowden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True. Supervising editor is Mike Jenner.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F4A200>],/factchecks/2017/mar/12/caleb-rowden/rowden-mostly-right-about-medicaid-costs/

Donna Howard says condoms 'used to be tax-exempt' in Texas
","An Austin legislator talking up her proposal to exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax asserted that condoms were sold tax-free in Texas for a spell. Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard, speaking to reporters for the Dallas Morning News during a Facebook Live presentation, brought up condom tax history just after suggesting that ever-costly diapers also should not be subject to the state sales tax of 6.25 percent; local governments are allowed to levy up to 2 percent more of sales tax. Condoms, Howard went on, ""used to be tax-exempt here in Texas until we changed something in the statute; the wording was such that it ... put them back out there where they were taxed."" We wondered about that, ultimately finding changes in law against a governor’s wishes resulted in a type of condom not being subject to sales tax for more than seven years--though no longer. To gauge this claim, we mostly relied on the Texas state comptroller’s office, which oversees state tax collections. By email, spokeswoman Lauren Willis pointed out that a tax-cut package signed into law by Gov. George W. Bush in 1999 included language exempting condoms from the Texas sales tax. Bush’s desire, comptroller’s ruling That’s what was reported at the time, we confirmed, though the tax details rest on a medical angle. Willis emailed us a web link to a March 2000 news story stating that contrary to Bush’s campaign-trail intentions, condoms would soon rank among products not subject to the state sales tax. Starting April 1, 2000, the Morris News Service story said, ""Texans won't have to pay sales tax on non-prescription medications, ointments to treat sunburns, laxatives or condoms."" Before his re-election in 1998, the story said, Bush had proposed a $400 million tax-cut package including a sales tax break on over-the-counter health items although Bush, an advocate of abstinence education for teenagers, had said the cut wouldn’t apply to condoms. Seeking re-election, Bush said in September 1998 that his proposed tax cut would not extend to nonprescription contraceptives, including condoms, the Morning News reported. ""The governor is being touted by some in the GOP has a potential presidential candidate in 2000,"" the story said, ""and some social conservatives have taken a strong stand against promiscuity and premarital sex."" But in March 2000, State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced she had no choice but to include condoms among items made tax-exempt in the tax-cut measure passed into law the year before. Calling her decision a ""matter of law,"" Rylander pointed out the new law required a drug, medicine or health care product to be exempt from taxes if it has a drug code number issued pursuant to FDA regulations. National drug codes, or NDCs, are three-digit segments that serve as universal product identifiers, the FDA says. Condoms as medicinal A March 2000 Houston Chronicle news story said the legislated tax exemption would apply to all 100,000 nonprescription products carrying an NDC. That story noted that the original legislation, Senate Bill 441 by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, would have exempted only children’s nonprescription medicines from the sales tax but was expanded in Senate-House negotiations to include adult over-the-counter medicines--with the FDA code limitation intended to preclude tax breaks for herbal and folk remedies not sanction by that agency. We confirmed, from SB 441 signed into law by Bush, the inclusion of language exempting from the sales tax any drug or medicine with an FDA-issued ""national drug code."" We suspect, though, that not all condoms had the codes. When we checked with the FDA about condoms having NDCs, spokeswoman Deborah Kotz replied by email that the agency considers condoms to be ""devices"" that don’t need NDCs, unlike medicines. Kotz later emailed that regardless, some condom manufacturers have put NDCs on condoms sold over the counter, ""often for reimbursement purposes."" Some condoms, Kotz said, still have the numbers. Meantime, Willis shared a December 2000 letter from Rylander to a Victoria resident outlining another reason condoms became tax-exempt. Rylander wrote that as agency staff pinned down what would be exempt from the sales tax due to the 1999 law, they recognized that some drugs and medicines didn’t have NDCs. So in building the list of exempt items, Rylander advised, agency staff relied on an FDA list of drugs and medicines and also included items, such as condoms, that fit the state’s statutory definition of a drug or medicine as ""an article or substance applied to, ingested, or inhaled by humans marketed for the use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, illness, injury, or pain."" Rylander’s conclusion: The ""medicated prophylactic devices, which aid in the prevention of disease, qualify for the exemption. However,"" she wrote, ""prophylactic devices that are not medicated are not exempt."" Willis confirmed, when we asked, that only condoms containing medication ended up being tax-exempt. No longer Lawmakers didn't immediately restore taxation of all condoms. Willis said, and we confirmed, that the NDC language was removed by a 2001 law yet Senate Bill 1125 left spermicidal condoms tax-exempt by simultaneously adding language exempting products ""labeled or required to be labeled with a ‘Drug Facts’ panel in accord"" with FDA regulations. By email, Klot separately told us condoms, mostly regulated as devices and not medicines, might have ""facts"" panels, but the FDA hasn’t required as much. A 2007 change in law limited items exempt from the sales tax to products required to have the ""Drug Facts"" panels, Willis told us by email, which ended the condom tax exemption as of September 2007. In the fiscal year through August 2016, Willis said, the state sales tax on condoms yielded an estimated $7 million in revenue. Our ruling Howard said condoms ""used to be tax-exempt here in Texas."" Under a tax-cut measure approved by lawmakers and Bush in 1999, condoms containing spermicide were exempt from the state sales tax starting in April 2000. Another change in law ended that exemption as of September 2007. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Tom Price']","
HHS chief Tom Price mostly correct that ER use is up since Obamacare
","One of the arguments Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price made about why substantial changes in federal health care law were needed was that the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, had failed in one of its goals -- to cut down on emergency room use. Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away, they can become a health care provider of last resort, even for more minor conditions that could be handled just as well -- and more inexpensively -- in a doctor’s office. ""One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms,"" Price said at a White House briefing on March 7, 2017. ""In fact, they did just the opposite."" Is Price correct that emergency room usage has gone up -- not down -- since passage of the law? Our research suggests that Price has a strong case. Did Obama say the law would lower emergency room use? He certainly expressed hope that it would. He mentioned it during an address on health care to a joint session of Congress, and during a nationally televised town hall on health care on June 24, 2009. During the town hall, Obama said this: ""One of the areas where we can potentially see some saving is -- a lot of those patients are being seen in the emergency room anyway, and if we are increasing prevention, if we are increasing wellness programs, we're reducing the amount of emergency room care, then that frees up doctors and resources to provide the kind of primary care that will keep people healthier, but also allow them to see more patients and hopefully give more time to patients, as well."" Has emergency room use gone up since the law has gone into effect? Different pieces of data vary somewhat, but all in all, there’s strong evidence that emergency room usage hasn’t declined much, if at all, since the law largely took effect in 2013. There’s also evidence that it has increased. Here are some examples of studies that looked at this question. • May 2015: A survey of more than 2,000 emergency-room physicians by the American College of Emergency Physicians asked whether the volume of patients in their emergency room had dropped or risen after the law took effect. The results: 28 percent said it had ""increased greatly"" and 47 percent said it had ""increased slightly."" Combined, that means three-quarters of emergency room doctors saw an increase. • February 2016: A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the change in emergency room use between 2013 (which was largely before the law) and 2014 (which was largely after the law took effect). ""ER use overall has not changed significantly after the first full year of ACA implementation,"" the report concludes. • August 2016: A study in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine looked at emergency room use in Illinois by adults between 2011 and 2015, separating out patterns of visits before and after the law took effect. The study found that emergency room visits in the state ""increased after ACA health insurance expansion. ... A large post-ACA increase in Medicaid visits and a modest increase in privately insured visits outpaced a large reduction in (emergency room) visits by uninsured patients."" So the studies pointed toward a modest increase in ER use. Two other recent studies looked at state-based scenarios that mirrored the types of expansions of coverage in Obama’s law. Both of them -- a March 2014 study of Massachusetts and an October 2016 study of Illinois -- found increased emergency room use after coverage was expanded. Why isn’t emergency room use going down? Experts cite a mix of reasons. Medicaid reimbursement rates are lower than those for private insurance, so appointments at doctors’ offices may be hard to obtain for those who received Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, ""two-thirds of emergency visits occur on weekends and when doctors’ offices are closed,"" said Laura Gore, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Demographics may play a role, too. Senior citizens are growing as a percentage of the population, and older Americans are likelier to have chronic health problems that require an emergency room visit, Gore said. In fact, the trend of growing emergency room use predates the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. ""Emergency department use has been rising since they were popularized after World War II,"" said Scott M. Dresden, a physician and assistant professor at Northwestern University who co-wrote the Illinois study. ""Research on health services use since the 1970s has shown that providing patients with assistance for health care costs, such as insurance, leads to increased health services use. So it's not particularly surprising that providing patients with insurance didn't decrease emergency department use.""   But the biggest factor may be force of habit. ""Old habits are hard to break,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""People who were used to seeking care in ERs may continue to go there for a while. When Kaiser first started taking Medicaid patients, many continued their use of the ER for routine care like they had always done. It took a while to wean them away."" Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the Oregon study, agreed. ""Expanding health insurance coverage leads to greater use of care across many settings, including the doctor's office, the pharmacy, the hospital, and the emergency room,"" she said. ""This is what one might expect from the basic economics: Medicaid took health care that was expensive and made it free, so people used more of it."" Our ruling Price said the Obama administration said ""they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite."" While the data varies a bit from study to study, the findings generally fail to provide any evidence that emergency room use has decreased after the law took effect. Indeed, several studies found increases in emergency room use, though modestly. Price overstated the case slightly, but he's basically correct. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C474EC0>],/factchecks/2017/mar/10/tom-price/hhs-chief-tom-price-correct-er-use-obamacare/

EPA head Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not 'primary contributor' to global warming
","The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming. ""Do you believe that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?"" CNBC anchor Joe Kernen asked Pruitt in a March 9 interview. ""No, I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,"" Pruitt responded. ""So no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."" Scientists around the globe generally conclude that human activity is the leading cause of climate change because humans have exacerbated the Earth’s greenhouse effect, mainly by producing carbon dioxide. Compare Pruitt’s statement with one on his agency’s website, for example: ""It is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming,"" and then, ""Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change."" Environmental activists opposed Pruitt’s nomination, in part because in his former role as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times over air and water pollution regulations. However, Pruitt has said he believes in climate change and that human activity is contributing to that change, though he is unconvinced of the extent of human-caused factors. ""The climate is changing, and human activity impacts that,"" he said in his Senate confirmation hearing. When we reached the EPA for comment, they did not provide us with information to back up Pruitt’s claim. The normal environment of the earth is that several types of gas stick in the atmosphere and trap excess heat, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide, making a natural ""greenhouse."" Since the Industrial Revolution in the early 1800s, humans have changed the composition of the greenhouse — leading to climate change — by releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the air primarily through burning fossil fuels. ""Pruitt is incorrect. CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. That fact is not in dispute among climate scientists,"" said Anne Slinn, executive director for research of the Center for Global Change Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that even though the earth has experienced fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels throughout its history, there’s more carbon dioxide now than there has been in at least 400,000 years.  The previous peak carbon dioxide concentration was about 300 parts per million, 300,000 years ago. Today, the count is more than 400 parts per million. By the end of the 1970s, before global warming was readily apparent, scientists had already formed a consensus that human-produced carbon dioxide would cause the climate to change. And by the mid-1990s, scientists understood that global warming had already occurred over the past 100 years, and carbon dioxide was a substantial cause, said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Center at the University of California, San Diego. ""Administrator Pruitt’s statement means that he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus,"" said Stephen Pacala, co-director of Princeton University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative, pointing to a 2013 report out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We reached numerous climate experts, all of whom reiterated the view that Pruitt’s claim is contrary to the prevailing scientific thought. For a perspective outside the norm, we also reached out to Roger Pielke Sr., an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, who has argued that carbon dioxide is one of many human-caused factors contributing to long-term changes in the climate, but it’s not the dominant one. For example, the release of black carbon (soot) or land use changes might have a larger effect on the climate relative to carbon dioxide than is currently believed. In Pielke’s view, a more accurate version of Pruitt’s statement would be: ""I would not agree that CO2 is the only contributor to changes and longterm variations in climate."" Our ruling Pruitt said carbon dioxide is not ""a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."" The prevailing scientific consensus is that human production of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution is a leading cause of climate change. Some scientists may quibble over how much of the change can be attributed specifically to carbon dioxide, but there is no doubt that it plays an important role.

In debate over iPhone vs. health care costs, Gavin Newsom’s claims are Mostly True
","California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom seized on comments by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, this week after the congressman made a controversial comparison between the cost of an iPhone and healthcare. Here’s what Chaffetz said in a CNN interview on March 7, 2017 when asked about the potential that the GOP’s Obamacare replacement plan could leave lower-income Americans uninsured: ""Well we're getting rid of the individual mandate. We're getting rid of those things that people said they don't want. And you know what? Americans have choices. And they've got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They've got to make those decisions for themselves."" After his comments caused a stir, Chaffetz said on Fox News later the same day that he could have made his point a different way. ""What we're trying to say -- and maybe I didn't say it as smoothly as I possibly could -- but people need to make a conscious choice and I believe in self-reliance. And they're going to have to make those decisions."" In response to Chaffetz’ iPhone-to-healthcare comparison, Newsom sent out a tweet that’s since garnered quite a bit of its own attention: Newsom’s tweet had received more than 20,000 retweets, or shares, and more than 33,000 likes on Twitter as of the time we published.   The Democrat is running for California governor in 2018 and has strongly opposed GOP plans to replace the Affordable Care Act. We wanted to know if Newsom got his numbers right and whether he accurately described the iPhone vs. health care comparison made by Chaffetz. Our research We started with Newsom’s $399 figure for iPhones. Apple’s iPhone SE, one of the company’s smallest iPhones with a 4-inch display, is listed at $399 on apple.com. It’s the cheapest of the five iPhone models featured on Apple’s website. The most expensive is the new iPhone 7 Plus listed at $769. Newsom’s campaign spokesman told us the lieutenant governor was referring to the SE model. Of course, iPhones require a monthly service charge. Neither Chaffetz nor Newsom, however, made any specific claims about that cost. Health care costs To back up Newsom’s claim that one-year of healthcare costs $10,345, his spokesman pointed to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It projected that the nation’s overall health care costs would hit hit $3.35 trillion in 2016. In turn, that meant the nation’s health care costs would surpass $10,000 for every man, woman and child for the first time ever, landing at $10,345, according to a summary of the report by the Associated Press. That figure, however, is not the end of the story. Like so much in the healthcare industry, it’s complicated to determine how much the average American actually spends on healthcare. Here’s how the Associated Press further explained the figure: ""The $10,345-per-person spending figure is an average; it doesn’t mean that every individual spends that much in the health care system. In fact, U.S. health care spending is wildly uneven. About 5 percent of the population — those most frail or ill — accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to a separate government study. Meanwhile, half the population has little or no health care costs, accounting for 3 percent of spending."" Experts weigh in Two health care policy experts pointed to the $10,345 figure as the best available. ""That’s an accurate number,"" said Joy Melnikow, director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research. ""That number is as good as any."" While the government and private business pay for the bulk of the nation’s health care costs, Melnikow noted the government gets its money from taxpayers: ""That’s all of our money. We’re paying for it."" A spokesman at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health policy, also pointed to the $10,345 figure as the best available. The Washington Post’s Wonkblog looked at the iPhone vs. healthcare cost another way, by examining the cost of the most expensive iPhone (about $800 with tax) against the cost of a health plan through Obamacare’s individual market. Here’s what it found: ""... (A) year of individual insurance coverage on the open market will run you about $393 per month, or $4,617 per year, per eHealth. For the purpose of this comparison we'll assume you're a healthy individual who doesn't have to worry about deductibles (which run over $4,000 for these plans), and that that $4,617 is all you have to pay. Even in this expensive-iPhone no-deductible scenario, the typical annual cost of an individual market plan costs is about six times as costly as Chaffetz's ""new iPhone."" Of course, not everyone is so healthy and many pay high deductibles before their insurance kicks in. Combining the annual $4,600 in premiums with $4,000 in deductibles under the Obamacare plan cited in the Washington Post would total about $8,600. That’s less than Newsom’s figure, but it’s in the ballpark when considering additional out-of-pocket expenses such as co-payments We also examined Newsom’s final claim that Chaffetz had compared the iPhone and health care costs ""as if they are the same."" Chaffetz’ comments, particularly his phrase ""Americans have choices. And they’ve got to make a choice,"" leave the impression that obtaining health care is as simple as sacrificing the purchase of a smartphone. Our ruling Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom caused a stir with his response to a controversial comparison of the costs of an iPhone and healthcare made by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. Newsom claimed iPhones cost $399 while one-year of health care costs $10,345. The lieutenant governor is right about the phone cost, though he selected the cheapest iPhone featured on Apple’s website. In coming up with his health care cost estimate, Newsom’s spokesman cited a federal report showing the nation’s overall health care costs were expected to surpass $10,000 per capita for the first time in 2016. That figure does not necessarily mean everyone is spending $10,345 on health care. Costs vary greatly among individuals. About 5 percent of the population — those who are most frail or sick — accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to the Associated Press. Still, two health care policy experts told us the $10,345 figure is the best available for assessing average health care costs. Another look at the iPhone vs. health care cost comparison by the Washington Post shows plans in the Obamacare market would cost an individual about $8,600 in premiums and deductibles annually, which when combined with out-of-pocket expenses might not be far from is the $10,345 figure Newsom cited. In the end, we found evidence to back up Newsom’s figures. We also found Chaffetz made enough of a connection between iPhones and health care costs to back up Newsom’s claim that the congressman compared them ""as if they are the same."" Newsom’s overall statement is accurate, though it needs some clarifications or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Tony Evers']","
Tony Evers says graduation rates surpass 90 percent. Not so fast
","Few states top Wisconsin’s K-12 graduation rate -- and the rate has gone up in recent years. State School Superintendent Tony Evers boasted on his Facebook page on Feb. 13, 2017 that ""Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent"" since his election. Evers is seeking a third term in the April 2017 election against challenger Lowell Holtz, a former school superintendent and principal. When asked to back up the Facebook claim, the Evers campaign pointed to graduation rates published by the agency Evers oversees, the Department of Public Instruction. The reports, they say, show a rate of 85.7 percent in 2009-10 (Evers’ first year) that rose to more than 90 percent in subsequent years. Case closed? No. Let’s put our red pencil and green eye shade to work. How rates are tracked The state and federal governments employ two methods to track changes in the four-year graduation rate. The first method -- dating to the 1960s -- estimates the four-year graduation rate from aggregate figures on enrollment and graduate counts. It shows Wisconsin’s rate was above 90 percent before Evers even took office. The latest figure reported under that method: 92 percent, in 2011-12. The second method, which is newer and more accurate, tracks detailed student-level data. That method dates to 2009-10 in Wisconsin. It shows a rising rate from 85.7 percent in Evers’ first year up to 88.4 percent in 2014-15. So neither approach backs up Evers’ claim. For the record, the state’s rate of 88.4 percent for on-time graduation (four years) ranked 6th-highest nationally by the latest numbers, which is actually a drop from No. 2 four years earlier. Behind the claim So where do the numbers cited by the Evers campaign come from? Those numbers look at how many students from a 9th-grade class graduate over five or six years, not four years. Wisconsin began tracking so-called ""extended-year graduation"" in Evers’ first year; dozens of other states also collect it. Viewed this way, Evers campaign says, the class of 2009-10 four-year graduation rate for the class of 2009-10 was 85.7 percent. It rose to 89.5 percent after five years and to 90.4 percent after six years. A similar growth pattern appears in later years, when you track an individual class. But we can’t judge if the same thing was happening before Evers, because the collection of the extended-year graduation rate didn’t start until his second year. So we can’t fully evaluate whether these figures show that ""Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent"" since he took over. But, even if they did, it would apply to the less-used ""extended-year rate,"" not the more conventional 4-year rate that is better known to the average person. Our rating Evers claimed on Facebook: ""Wisconsin’s graduation rates have grown to over 90%"" since he became state school superintendent. By the traditional measure -- graduation in four years -- Wisconsin’s rate is one of the best in America, but still below 90 percent using one approach. Using the other, it topped that mark before Evers even took office. Meanwhile, the extended-year graduation rate provides an element of truth to the claim. That puts it at  Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3E1840>],/factchecks/2017/mar/10/tony-evers/tony-evers-says-graduation-rates-surpass-90-percen/
"['State Budget', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Rauner's budget-balancing claim doesn't come close to adding up
","In his annual budget speech, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner said he was presenting a balanced budget. ""Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation"" the governor said. The next morning, his campaign sent an email underscoring that he had offered a balanced budget proposal for the next fiscal year. ""Governor Bruce Rauner yesterday outlined a plan to balance the budget that reforms Illinois and builds a new economy,"" the email read. It included a link to a new, Rauner-funded website, www.budgetandreform.com. The website features a campaign ad that repeats the claim that the governor, who is embroiled in an unprecedented budget stalemate with majority Democrats, has proposed a balanced budget. The ad’s narrator says, ""Bruce Rauner's plan to balance the budget reforms Illinois, builds a new economy, freezes property taxes, caps spending, pays down the debt and term limits politicians' power.""  With so many assertions that Rauner, who has yet to sign a budget into law since his election in 2014, had proposed a balanced revenue and spending plan, we decided to check it out. Balancing the rhetoric Article 8, Section 2a of the Illinois Constitution states, ""The Governor shall prepare and submit to the General Assembly, at a time prescribed by law, a State budget for the ensuing fiscal year. … Proposed expenditures shall not exceed funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year as shown in the budget."" Illinois has not had a full budget enacted into law since 2014. In 2015, Rauner vetoed the budget bills majority Democrats approved, except for the bill that funded pre K-12 education. His 2017 budget proposal is his third since taking office after winning election in his first run for a public position. He previously worked as a highly successful private equity financier. Since his 2017 budget speech last month, Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance. Page 30 of the budget book released the day of the speech by the governor’s office of management and budget includes a fiscal year 2018 summary page that has a line that says the budget is balanced with $4.57 billion by ""working together on a grand bargain."" The ""grand bargain"" refers to efforts by Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, and Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont to strike a complicated, 12-bill compromise on several major topics that combine new or increased taxes to generate revenue along with business and political reforms aimed at strengthening the state economy and boosting public confidence in government. To date, such a bargain has not come to fruition. The governor’s press office referred questions about the balanced budget claims to Illinois Republican Party spokesman Steven Yaffe. Asked via email to provide the original source for the statement that the governor’s budget proposal was balanced, Yaffe said, ""As stated in his budget address, Governor Rauner's plan to balance the budget includes freezing property taxes, capping spending, paying down the debt, and term-limiting career politicians."" When asked again for the original source of that statement, Yaffe said, ""His plan to balance the budget includes these four items. That's what the advertisement is saying. These four items are keys to passing a bipartisan balanced budget plan in the General Assembly. The final plan is obviously still being negotiated, but these reforms are critical."" Despite repeated requests, Yaffe did not offer an original source but said, ""The ad is accurate."" In his speech, the governor acknowledged he expected Democrats to attack him for not proposing a balanced budget and noted the Legislature’s controlling party has not approved a balanced budget for years. ""It’s not going to help us move forward if right after this speech, Democrats run to the media claiming we’ve never proposed a plan to balance the budget,"" he said. ""And it’s not going to help us move forward if Republicans run to the media to point out that the Democratic legislature’s never passed a balanced budget. People want to see us get something done – to get a balanced budget to change our broken system."" Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, noted the concept of a balanced budget has been a difficult one for many Illinois governors and legislators over many years. ""The word ‘balanced’ seems to have become a politically malleable term. And not just with Rauner,"" he said, noting former Democratic Govs. Pat Quinn, Rod Blagojevich and others have bent the meaning. ""It is in some sense institutionalized and hidden by all the special funds. So does the proposed budget have expenditures equal to revenues in clear, concrete and plausible terms? It doesn’t look like it. ""I think the term has been stretched so far by both sides of the aisles and both branches over recent years,"" Mooney added, that he would ""hardly blame"" the governor for ""playing this ongoing political word game."" Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning think tank, didn’t concern himself with rhetoric. ""The FY2018 General Fund budget proposed by Governor Rauner cannot be considered balanced by any objective standard for two reasons: first, it relies on over $1 billion in unspecified and unlikely savings from ‘pension reforms’ that are not only unlikely to pass, but if they did, would likely be ruled unconstitutional; second, and even more troubling, is the $4.572 billion in ‘savings’ the governor anticipates from ‘working together on a grand bargain’ -- which is so ambiguous that it cannot credibly be valued at all."" Sheila Weinberg, a certified public accountant and the founder of Truth in Accounting, a government finance think tank said, ""Our elected officials have been claiming ‘balanced’ budgets for decades, but the state owes more than $187 billion. Mostly likely the governor is not including all of the state’s employee compensation costs in his calculations."" Our ruling Gov. Rauner said he proposed a balanced budget. ""Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation"" the governor told lawmakers. Yet, the budget book produced by the governor’s office of management and budget suggests the budget is balanced by ""working together on a grand bargain."" A so-called grand bargain budget compromise, though, has not been achieved or enacted. Illinois government finance experts agree Rauner’s proposal is not balanced.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Sanders: GOP health care plan gives wealthiest a $275 billion tax break
","Sen Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., put a different spin on the Republican House’s plan to overhaul the health care system. Speaking on MSNBC, Sanders said the House plan isn’t really a health care plan at all. It’s a tax cut package, he says, that overwhelmingly helps the wealthy. ""Look at it as a tax plan with $275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more,"" Sanders said on All In With Chris Hayes March 8. He said the change amounted to a transfer of wealth from working families to the wealthiest. Is that true? Sanders’ office told us they got their tax numbers from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional committee that lawmakers rely on for core fiscal data. The committee estimated the impact of repealing two taxes on the wealthy in the Affordable Care Act. One is a 0.9 percent payroll tax on earnings and the other is a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income for individuals with incomes over $200,000 and couples with incomes over $250,000. In the decade between 2017 and 2026, the committee said dropping both measures would cut taxes by $274.9 billion. The Tax Policy Center, a joint fiscal analysis project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, confirmed Sanders’ number for the total tax cut. Two caveats First, Sanders’ fixation on the top 2 percent is not quite right. According to the latest survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, households making $250,000 and above accounted for the top 4.4 percent. Sanders’ office cited an op-ed from two advocacy groups that asserted that those making that much fell into the top 2 percent. Second, Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said Sanders left out a couple of ""nuances."" The House Republican plan includes other forms of tax relief that will benefit a broader swath of Americans. ""Repealing ACA taxes delivers small tax cuts to most people throughout the income distribution,"" Mermin said. Plus, he added, removing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance would benefit people regardless of income, though for low and moderate income families, ""the overall average impact is small,"" Mermin said. Our ruling Sanders said that the Republican House health care plan would cut taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent by $275 billion. While Sanders didn’t specify the time frame, that is a 10-year estimate from a neutral congressional committee. Estimates that look a decade ahead are typical in budgeting circles. The one point where Sanders erred most was in labeling the affected taxpayers as the ""top 2 percent."" According to government data, a more accurate number is 4.4 percent. But that’s still a small sliver of the population. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973DA980>],/factchecks/2017/mar/09/bernie-sanders/sanders-gop-health-care-plan-gives-wealthiest-275-/

Did Sen. Bill Nelson flip-flop on use of filibuster for a Supreme Court nominee?
","A conservative group misfired in its attack on U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., for being inconsistent on the use of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. America Rising Squared, the policy arm of the conservative America Rising PAC, said in an online post that Nelson, up for re-election in 2018, committed a ""filibuster flip-flop"" on President Donald Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch. ""In 2006, Nelson opposed the use of a filibuster for the nomination of Justice (Samuel) Alito, but now has adopted a different stance,"" said America Rising Squared, a group advocating for senators to support Gorsuch. We decided to look at whether Nelson flip-flopped on using the filibuster for a Supreme Court nominee on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. Experts told us America Rising mischaracterized Nelson’s record. Samuel Alito and the filibuster process As proof of its claim, America Rising Squared points to Nelson’s votes in January 2006 on the nomination of Alito, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to succeed retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Democrats fought against Alito’s nomination mainly due to his criticism of Roe vs. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion nationwide. But in the weeks leading up to the vote, Democrats, including leaders Harry Reid and Charles Schumer showed little interest in using the filibuster to block his nomination. (Reid and Schumer would ultimately go along with the filibuster.) Under Senate rules, a minority of senators -- even just one -- can filibuster, or hold up, a Supreme Court nomination, effectively requiring 60 votes for a motion to end debate and move on to the nomination itself. When the minority party filibusters an initiative, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours. Days before the vote on Alito, Reid said, ""Everyone knows there is not enough votes to support a filibuster."" Massachusetts Democrats John Kerry and Ted Kennedy led a filibuster effort anyway, drawing interest from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as they contemplated a presidential bid. But the effort failed, as almost half of the Senate's Democrats — including Nelson — voted against it on Jan. 30. We found no statements by Nelson at the time about his opinion on the use of the filibuster, but he didn’t go along with it. The Senate voted 72-25 to end debate on Alito's Supreme Court nomination. A ""yes"" vote was a vote to end debate, while a ""no"" vote was a vote to filibuster Alito’s nomination. Nelson was one of 19 Democrats and 53 Republicans to vote ""yes."" The next day, the Senate held an up-or-down vote on Alito’s nomination. Nelson was one of 42 senators to vote against Alito while 58 voted in favor. Nelson told reporters that he viewed Alito as being against the ""little guy"" in the face of big corporations and government. Nelson’s statements about Gorsuch process Since the Republicans currently hold 52 Senate seats, it means the GOP needs eight Democrats to schedule a final vote on Gorsuch, assuming no Republican defections. (Then the nomination itself needs only 51 votes to pass.) It will likely be difficult for Republicans to sway eight Democrats, so it’s possible that the GOP will use the ""nuclear option."" Related to Gorsuch’s nomination, Nelson’s spokesman Ryan Brown pointed to Nelson’s interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. (The Times is PolitiFact’s parent company.) Nelson told the Times he stands with Democrats in insisting on a 60-vote threshold. ""You bet I do. The filibuster has always forced the political extremes to come of the middle to build consensus,"" Nelson said, adding it was a ""mistake"" for Reid to lower the threshold on other nominees that were stymied by Republicans. Brown told PolitiFact Florida that Nelson doesn’t support the ""nuclear option,"" a procedural shortcut known as the ""nuclear option"" that would enable Senate Republicans to sidestep the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations. ""In 2006, Nelson voted for cloture - that doesn’t mean he supports changing the Senate rules,"" Brown said. ""Just because you vote for cloture, doesn’t mean you support the so-called ‘nuclear option.’ "" See our explainer on the ""nuclear option"" We asked three political science professors to review America Rising’s argument against Nelson’s actions. All three said they saw no inconsistencies in Nelson’s actions. ""There is a huge difference between voting for cloture in 2006 (utilizing a process in the existing rules) and not wanting to see the Senate change its rules in 2017,"" said Gregory Koger at the University of Miami. ""Indeed, there is a high level of consistency between these actions: Both affirm the use of the existing cloture rule to address filibusters against Supreme Court nominations."" Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political science professor, said that favoring the 60-vote threshold is not inconsistent with voting for or against cloture or the confirmation in any particular case. ""In this case, a senator has a point of view about the best rules for the Senate and, under those rules, exercises his judgment in different ways on different issues,"" Smith said. ""There is nothing inconsistent about that."" In Alito’s case, Nelson wanted the Senate to vote on the nomination even though he opposed Alito, said Burdett Loomis at the University of Kansas. ""Now he says he supports 60 votes (to overcome a filibuster) to bring Gorsuch’s nomination forward,"" Loomis said. ""This is exactly what he did with Alito, even though he might well vote differently in this instance. And this has nothing to do with the nuclear option."" One final point: Nelson’s stance related to the process of Gorsuch’s nomination isn’t complete. Nelson, who met with Gorsuch on March 7, has ""not yet decided how he will vote on cloture or confirmation,"" Brown told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Nelson did not join a failed effort by some of his Democratic nominees to filibuster Alito’s nomination in 2006. He voted to end debate and then voted against Alito’s nomination. Gorsuch’s nomination hasn’t reached a vote yet, and Nelson hasn’t said how he will ultimately vote on cloture or confirmation. But he has said he stands by the 60-vote threshold. Nelson made No Flip.

Image of Obama in handcuffs for wiretapping Trump is fake photo
","A photograph in a fake news story purporting to show former President Barack Obama standing before a judge in handcuffs is a crude composite image made up by a joke site.

Are Americans gaming the system to get cheaper Obamacare coverage?
","Some Republicans who want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have recently argued that the current law encourages beneficiaries to game the system to get 12 months of coverage for the price of nine. The idea is that the law bars insurers from cutting off beneficiaries from their coverage during the first three months after they have stopped paying their premiums. This provision was intended to protect beneficiaries from being caught without coverage due to sudden financial crises or paperwork errors. But this provision does, in theory, allow people to stop paying their premiums after nine months, not paying for three, but then signing up for a new plan again. The first time we noticed this talking point was when former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., mentioned it during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union in late February. ""The reality is today that thousands, maybe approaching millions of Americans, are paying nine months for insurance,"" Santorum said. ""Why? Because you pay for your insurance for nine months, there’s a provision in Obamacare that says you can’t be thrown off your plan for three months."" Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., echoed this point on March 7, as House Republican leaders were touting their new bill to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. ""One of the issues we found is that some people were gaming the system with guaranteed issue,"" Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said at a news conference. (""Guaranteed issue"" bars health insurers from denying coverage for such factors as pre-existing conditions.) ""It's not that they had a pre-existing condition necessarily,"" Walden continued. ""It's they'd pay for nine months of insurance, get 12, the other three for free, automatically come back in the market. That was part of what's causing this spiral downward."" We wondered: Are significant numbers of Americans intentionally gaming the system, even though it would almost certainly mean additional paperwork and bureaucratic hassles, in order to save three months’ worth of premiums a year? What we found is that while such a loophole exists, there is no direct evidence of people intentionally gaming the system in this way -- and even the maximum universe of people who could theoretically be doing this represents a small proportion of the law's beneficiaries. Walden’s office directed us to a May 2016 study by McKinsey & Company's Center for U.S. Health System Reform. The study is based on roughly 16,000 interviews conducted in eight rounds between 2013 and 2016. Those interviewed are uninsured and individually insured consumers but does not include those eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. One of the study’s findings, headlined at the front of the report, was this one: ""Nearly a quarter of consumers stopped payment on their premiums in 2015, yet most repurchased an exchange plan in 2016 and many repurchased the same plan."" Superficially, this seems to bolster Walden’s point -- but looking only at the headline obscures some important nuances. For instance, while Walden painted this as an example of nine months in, three months out, the reality is that the study found a more complicated picture. Among those who stopped paying, 30 percent stopped in the first quarter of the year, 13 stopped in the second quarter and 22 percent stopped in the third quarter. Only 29 percent stopped paying in the fourth quarter -- the closest scenario to what Walden described. (Another 17 percent didn’t know what quarter they stopped paying.) And it’s important to remember that these percentages don’t refer to all people who have a plan through the Affordable Care Act -- they refer only to the 21 percent of those surveyed who said they stopped paying their premiums. And 29 percent of 21 percent works out to 6 percent of all survey respondents. Six percent is a pretty small share of people who could be gaming the system -- but it’s also important to note that we don’t know whether these people actually are gaming the system on purpose. The 6 percent figure is a maximum universe of possible system-gamers. In reality, the percentage is probably well below that, judging by other data from the same survey. The survey found that 36 percent of those who stopped paying did so because they gained other coverage. Those people certainly can’t be accused of gaming the system. If you exclude them, the 6 percent figure drops to 3.8 percent. Another 26 percent said they could no longer afford insurance. For some people, affordability isn’t inconsistent with gaming the system; it may be the reason they decided to do so. Still, it seems likely that some fraction of these people were genuinely cash-strapped and dropped out without expecting to sign up again. So the maximum universe of possible system-gamers is probably in the neighborhood of 2 percent to 3 percent. And it’s important to remember that this is the maximum possible universe of people gaming the system based on this data. The actual number of people gaming the system -- a behavior that can only be triangulated through the data -- could be well below this 2 to 3 percent baseline. Bottom line: Gaming the system probably happens, but it’s pretty rare. ""The number of people gaming the system appears to be small, based on the McKinsey study,"" said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute Health Policy Center. ""That fits my general sense -- that most consumers are really confused about marketplace coverage and not really in a position to game the system. Some can do so, but the proportion is small."" Donald H. Taylor, a health policy specialist in Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, agreed. Given the ""empirical holes"" in the data, Taylor said, ""the congressman overstated the case."" Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the lack of survey data on the specific question of gaming the system makes it hard to speak to motivations. Walden’s statement ""is by its nature speculative because the data we have remains so poor,"" she said. The experts did agree that even if a small number of people are taking advantage of the loophole, it’s reasonable to discuss methods for closing the loophole through changes in the law. That said, Taylor added that ""churn"" among the insured population has been a longstanding concern even before the Affordable Care Act was passed. ""That is why it is a tricky problem to address,"" he said. ""If it was the same people all the time, it would be relatively easy to fix."" Our ruling Walden said, ""One of the issues we found is that some people were gaming the system"" by paying ""for nine months of insurance, get 12 -- the other three for free."" A nine-month loophole exists, and experts say it’s fair to assume that some people might be exploiting it. But among the universe of people who have purchased insurance under the law, the percentage doing so is almost certainly small.

Yes, Florida really is the only state to tax commercial leases, as Gov. Rick Scott said
","At his State of the State address, Gov. Rick Scott once again promised to cut the state's tax on commercial leases, something he says is unique only to Florida. ""Florida is now the only state in the nation to tax commercial leases,"" Scott said March 7. Florida does levy a 6 percent sales tax on the total rent paid for any commercial property, including storefronts, offices and warehouses. But is that the only state-level tax of its kind? Scott’s team sent over an October 2015 report from Florida TaxWatch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending with an eye toward long-term savings. The report says that Florida ""is the only state to impose a standard, statewide sales tax on commercial real estate leases."" It cites as evidence a Nov. 24, 2014, research memorandum from the Florida Legislature’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, which is nonpartisan. The OPPAGA memo concluded that Florida is the only state that imposes a sales tax on commercial real estate leases. ""In 45 states, there is either no sales and use tax or state law applies only to tangible personal property,"" it reads. The OPPAGA report details a few other places with similar instances of limited taxation of commercial rents. For example, New York City imposes a 6 percent tax on commercial real estate leases, but it only applies to companies that pay at least $250,000 in rent every year. Hawaii imposes a 4 percent general excise tax on income, which can include income from rentals. New Mexico has a gross receipts tax that varies from 5.125 percent to 8.9 percent depending on the location. Commercial rents are included in gross receipts but a deduction for those leases is allowed, effectively eliminating the tax, the report says. And then there’s Arizona, which has no state tax on rent, but does have five cities that impose a particular tax on commercial real estate leases. Still, those laws don’t change the fact Florida is still the only state with a specific sales tax on commercial leases, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research. National experts at the Tax Policy Center said to the best of their knowledge Scott was correct. So did Carla Markowitz, an attorney who specializes in Florida commercial landlord representation speaking on behalf of the Building Owners and Managers Association, or BOMA. In his second term, Scott promised to phase out commercial leases, and has made attempts to do so as far back as 2014. Most recently, in his 2017-18 recommended budget, Scott proposed to reduce the tax on commercial leases by 25 percent, which his office says will cut off $454 million in the state sales tax levied on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said that ""Florida is now the only state in the nation to tax commercial leases."" Scott's claim is rooted in a research memo that said Florida is the only state to have a sales tax on commercial leases. The report noted that other states and municipalities have similar taxes, but none of them are comprehensive sales taxes like Florida’s. We rate Scott’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA86C0>],/factchecks/2017/mar/08/rick-scott/florida-only-place-state-nation-tax-commercial-lea/

Greitens is mostly right on Veterans Treatment Court graduation rates
","In his August Facebook Live video, Gov. Eric Greitens encouraged viewers to submit their questions. One viewer asked, ""What do we do for our veterans except use them as our reason to get mad when it fits our agenda?"" In response, Greitens touched on providing jobs for veterans, in addition to citing the rate of veterans graduating from treatment courts in Missouri. ""Our veterans in our veterans court, are graduating — 73 percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts,"" Greitens said. ""By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans."" We were wondering: Are 73 percent of veterans graduating from treatment courts? While we never heard back from Greitens’ spokesman, a Supreme Court of Missouri spokeswoman pointed us in the direction of where those numbers came from. According to the Missouri Courts website, treatment courts began as a way to battle increasing substance abuse problems. Treatment courts have existed in Missouri for nearly 25 years. The first treatment court was started in 1993 in Jackson County. Legislation in 2013 established the first veterans treatment courts programs, which ""are hybrid drug and mental health court dockets that use the treatment court model to serve veterans struggling with addiction, serious mental illness and/or co-occurring disorders,"" according to a treatment courts fact sheet. As of August 2017, there were 147 treatment court programs throughout the state. Of those, 12 are veterans treatment courts, with the remaining being adult, juvenile, family and DWI courts. Veterans can be accepted into treatment courts for drug-involved offenses and DWI offenses, Beth Riggert, communications counsel for the Supreme Court of Missouri, wrote in an email. According to the treatment courts fact sheet, ""The graduation rate for all programs in fiscal 2017 exceeds 61 percent."" However, the most recent data on veterans treatment courts is from calendar year 2016, Riggert said. In that time frame, there were a total of 247 veterans participating in veterans treatment courts in the state, Riggert said. However, because the program is rolling, only a total of 82 veterans exited the program in 2016. Of those, 60 successfully graduated the program and 22 did not. That translates to a success rate of 73.17 percent, or just about what Greitens said. Since 2011, the graduation rate from veterans treatment courts has steadily been increasing as more veterans have gone through the program. Greitens also said, ""By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent."" Because we were unable to reach Greitens’ spokesman for comment, we are unsure which specific treatment courts program Greitens was referring to when he said ""the very good drug court program."" However, Riggert elaborated on the graduation for other treatment court programs. In the same period, the graduation rate from adult drug courts was 52 percent, and the graduation rate from DWI courts was 90 percent, Riggert said. While Greitens is correct that the veterans treatment courts’ graduation rate was higher than some, such as the adult drug court’s rate, it is still not as high as the DWI court’s graduation rate of 90 percent. However, Riggert said it may not be accurate to compare graduation rates between treatment courts to prove one program’s success. ""The various types of treatment court programs are distinct, and so it is not helpful to try to make a side-by-side comparison,"" Riggert said. While 73 percent of veterans exiting the program did graduate in 2016, it is unclear how many veterans who graduate from the program have to return for additional treatment. ""Because veterans treatment courts are relatively new, we do not yet have sufficient quantifiable data from which to determine recidivism rates for these programs,"" Riggert said. Greitens said, ""73 percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts. By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans."" While the overall numbers are small, Greitens is correct that in 2016, 73 percent of veterans successfully completed treatment court. Over the same time period, the overall graduation rate from adult treatment court was 52 percent, officials say. However, officials also pointed out that the two programs are not identical, which makes comparing them imprecise. In addition, while graduation rate is one measurement of success, it’s not the only one, and as Riggert noted, veteran treatment courts are so new that no data on recidivism rates have been collected. We rate Greitens’ claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809730DC80>],/factchecks/2017/oct/21/eric-greitens/greitens-mostly-right-veterans-treatment-court-gra/
"['Abortion', 'Women', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
State birth control rule doesn't cover all insurance plans in New York
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says women in New York state don’t have to worry about new Trump administration rules ending a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The new rules exempt employers from the Obama-era mandate if they have religious or moral reservations to the coverage. But Cuomo said contraception will still be covered in New York state. ""This year, we ensured that whatever happens at the federal level, women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care,"" Cuomo said in a statement. States can set certain insurance standards beyond what the federal government requires. New York state told insurance companies in January they are required to cover birth control and abortion services. That condition still stands, but is Cuomo right that women in New York state are not affected by Trump’s decision? Limits to state regulation State regulations, like the one from January, do not apply to all plans. The state Department of Financial Services regulates everything sold on the state health exchange, called New York State of Health. That includes plans sold to individuals and companies with 100 or fewer employees. The agency says the state’s birth control mandate covers 1.35 million residents in those plans. Health care offered through companies with more than 100 employees is more complicated. Companies that go the traditional route of buying health coverage through an insurance carrier must adhere to the rules. About 2.5 million people in that category are covered by the state’s birth control mandate. But companies that are self-insured, where the employer assumes a large part of the costs, are not regulated by the state, meaning they need not adhere to the state's birth control mandate. About 60 percent of private sector workers in the U.S. who get their health coverage through an employer were enrolled in a self-insured plan in 2015. That’s up from 46 percent in 1996, according to research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In New York state, about 54 percent of private sector employees who get health insurance through their employer had a self-insured plan last year, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The option is most popular for companies with at least 1,000 employees. Eighty percent of private sector employees at companies that size in New York state are enrolled in a self-insured plan. What about public health insurance? The federal government sets the baseline for what services are covered under Medicaid. Government workers are covered under state regulation, but Medicaid and Medicare enrollees are not.States can add to that list. The list of services covered by Medicaid in New York state goes well beyond the federal standard. New York is one of multiple states where Medicaid covers birth control and abortion services. About a third of the state’s population alone is on Medicaid. Our ruling Cuomo said women in New York state ""will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care"" because of an action the state took earlier this year. But not every woman is in an insurance plan regulated by the state. It’s possible a self-insured large employer in New York state could apply for an exemption from the federal birth control mandate. If granted the exemption, the company would not have to provide health coverage for birth control to its employees. Those exemptions are not expected to be widespread, but they are possible. Cuomo’s statement needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974E4800>],/factchecks/2017/oct/21/andrew-cuomo/state-birth-control-rule-doesnt-cover-all-insuranc/

Ted Cruz flip-flops on requiring 60 Senate votes to end a filibuster
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, famous and infamous for his 2013 filibuster-like talk-a-thon that included his reading a Dr. Seuss story to his daughters watching from home, no longer favors preserving a rule that makes it hard to stop filibusters. Did the Texas senator flip-flop? We inquired. In the 100-person Senate, a filibuster (from a Dutch word meaning pirate) can’t be broken unless the senator in the spotlight gives way or foes raise 60 votes to invoke ""cloture,"" bringing debate to a close. Senators set that threshold, which breaks out to a three-fifths majority, in 1975. For decades before, according to a Senate web page, it had taken a two-thirds vote to invoke cloture. Cruz, a Republican lawyer, said in 2015 he wouldn’t support elimination of the 60-vote hurdle--even to advance his goal of repealing the Obamacare law put in place by Democrats. According to a Roll Call news story, Cruz initially told Heritage Action’s Jan. 12, 2015, policy summit that Republicans should do ""everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare."" But, the story said, Cruz said afterward he believed Senate Republicans, while in the majority, shouldn’t eliminate the filibuster as a tactic to get more legislation to then-President Barack Obama. ""No, we should not,"" Cruz said. ""We should preserve the procedural protections in the Senate for the rights of the minority."" Cruz then borrowed an analogy used by the framers of the Constitution by saying the Senate is ""like the saucer under the tea cup to cool deliberations, and I think those checks and balances were inspired. And one of the ways to limit rash decision-making is the requirement in the Senate of a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster."" In September 2017, though, according to a Texas Tribune news story, Cruz said at a Texas tea-party forum that he’s changed his mind and now favors an end to the 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster. At the forum, the story says, Cruz was asked whether, like President Donald Trump, he supports ending the filibuster rule. The story said Cruz called for ending the filibuster rule, acknowledging it is an ""issue on which I’ve changed my mind over the last five years."" We asked Cruz spokesman Phil Novack if Cruz’s position had changed. Yes, Novack replied, pointing us by email to a Facebook-posted video of the Sept. 30, 2017, NE Tarrant Tea Party meeting where Cruz was asked about eliminating the 60-vote threshold. At the meeting, Cruz replied, to applause: ""Long and short out of it, I would end the 60-vote filibuster right now."" His answer went on: ""Now let me give you some context on that because that’s actually an issue on which I’ve changed my mind over the last five years. ""So if you’d asked me five years ago, I would have had a different answer.  And the reason is as follows: I think over time, the 60-vote threshold for legislation has had a small ‘c’ conservative effect in that it has slowed down the operation of Congress. Since World War II, we’ve had three Democratic super-majorities: the first gave us the New Deal; the second gave us the Great Society; the third gave us Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. ""So, getting rid of the filibuster means any time there’s a Democratic majority, you have a Democratic supermajority. So a lot of bad legislation would pass without the 60-vote threshold. So, if you’d asked me five years ago, I would have said no, I don’t think we should get rid of it because it slows down bad legislation at a time when the Democrats are in control. ""Why have I changed my mind? Because I don’t believe Democrats will be bound by it. I ...think the next time the Democrats have a majority, particularly with a Democratic president, I think they’ll end the filibuster in a hurry. So if I believed it were a credible threat, that it actually would restrain Democrats in the future, then I might well support keeping it now. I don’t."" Cruz’s reply closed with a comment including a word we couldn’t make out: ""I think it’s stupid that it’s a one-way (unintelligible), that it only limits us, it doesn’t limit them."" Our ruling Cruz once favored keeping the 60-vote requirement to end a Senate filibuster. He no longer does. On the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, that’s a FULL FLOP.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Do moderate-income families benefit more from the state and local tax deduction?
","As Congress moved toward consideration of a major tax overhaul, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., raised a warning about one element of President Donald Trump’s proposal -- ending the deduction for state and local tax payments. ""This is striking: 50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K – & now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away,"" Pelosi tweeted on Oct. 12. This is striking: 50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K – & now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away.   Pelosi’s point is that the deduction helps a lot of middle- and lower-income taxpayers, meaning it should be preserved. A reader wrote us to suggest that we take a closer look at this assertion, so we did. We found that Pelosi’s numbers are on target. But the suggestion that this deduction primarily helps lower-earning Americans misses the mark. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they cited data from the Government Finance Officers Association. A table in the group’s report does indeed say that 54 percent of households that claimed the deduction earned $100,000 or less. But that’s more a reflection of how many households earn $100,000 or less, rather than an indication that the state and local tax deduction is a targeted benefit for lower earners. Lower-income taxpayers are less likely to itemize their tax returns and therefore less likely to benefit from the state and local tax deduction, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow and director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""But because there are so many more taxpayers in these income groups, they make up a majority of taxpayers claiming it,"" Reuben said. As Reuben indicated, higher-income households are much more likely to take the deduction than lower-income taxpayers are. But this is only part of the picture. Most other data shows the deduction skewing toward higher-income taxpayers. According to the same report Pelosi’s office cited, between 91 percent and 93 percent of households earning $200,000 and up take the deduction. By contrast, 53 percent of taxpayers with between $75,000 and $100,000 in income used the deduction, and the lower income bands used it at rates significantly less than that. Here’s a summary chart from the report:   Second, the dollar amounts saved through deduction skew heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum. So, if anything, removing the deduction will disproportionately hurt higher earners. According to the same report, households up to $100,000 in income accounted for about 23 percent of the dollar value of the deduction -- far from the majority implied by the statistic used in Pelosi’s tweet. Indeed, almost 20 percent of the dollar amount saved from the deduction went to taxpayers with more than $1 million in income alone. And the benefits at the upper end of the income spectrum aren’t just larger in an absolute sense, but they’re also bigger as a percentage of the taxpayer’s income. For income bands under $100,000, the amount saved from the state and local deduction ranged from 2 percent to 4 percent of adjusted gross income. But for taxpayers earning $200,000 and up, the percentage saved was 7 percent to 8 percent of adjusted gross income. Here’s the summary chart from the same report.   Part of this stems from the reality that a $1,000 deduction would be worth $396 to someone in the top 39.6 percent tax bracket, while the same $1,000 deduction would be worth $250 to someone in the 25 percent bracket, said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""So not only do the wealthy claim more of the deduction, they get more value for the deductions they do claim,"" Newton said. When we presented this additional data to Pelosi’s office, a spokesman said that Pelosi’s tweets were intended to remind people that many moderate-income working families do benefit from the state and local deduction -- a reality often overlooked in the debate, he said. ""I think you have to note that even the comparatively lower utilization rate in the lower brackets amounts to millions and millions of households losing a deduction that is a pretty big deal in terms of their family budget,"" said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman. ""Often, that gets lost when you go to the aggregate number of deduction value."" Pelosi tweeted, ""50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K."" The data says that 54 percent of taxpayers who claim the deduction make $100,000 or less. But, in reality, this is a tax deduction that disproportionately benefits higher-income taxpayers -- not the group Pelosi highlighted in her tweet. Pelosi's claim is accurate, but it comes with that caveat. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809730D900>],/factchecks/2017/oct/20/nancy-pelosi/do-moderate-income-families-benefit-more-state-and/

Fact-checking John Kelly on Frederica Wilson's 2015 speech
","The White House continues to criticize U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., for publicizing a private phone call by President Donald Trump to the family of a slain servicemember. Wilson, a family friend, had been listening to the call from Trump in which he allegedly said Sgt. La David Johnson ""knew what he signed up for … but when it happens it hurts anyway."" Johnson was killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in the west African nation of Niger. After the call, Wilson told the Miami Herald, ""I think it’s so insensitive. It’s crazy. Why do you need to say that? You don’t say that to someone who lost family, the father, the breadwinner. You can say, ‘I’m so sorry for your loss. He’s a hero.’ ""   A few days later, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly appeared behind the press room podium on Oct. 19 to offer the White House’s perspective on the call. In closing, he zeroed in on Wilson for criticism, citing the 2015 dedication of an FBI building in South Florida. Here are his comments in full, the emphasis is ours: ""I was still on active duty, and I went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami. And it was dedicated to two men who were killed in a firefight in Miami against drug traffickers in 1986. … Jim Comey gave an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to those fallen men and to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve our country so well, and law enforcement so well. There were family members there. Some of the children that were there were three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their lives. ""And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the $20 million -- to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned. Stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned. But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said, okay, fine."" Wilson responded by saying Kelly wasn’t telling the truth. ""That’s a lie. How dare he,"" Wilson said on CNN. Luckily, a video can help settle this specific back-and-forth. A video unearthed by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel of the April 10, 2015, event preserved Wilson’s speech. While it does portray Wilson speaking animatedly and indulging in some braggadocio -- she is known as a colorful, outspoken politician with a soft spot for fashionable hats -- Kelly mischaracterized her remarks in significant ways. The effort she bragged about was initially requested by the FBI itself, and her actions were made in service of honoring the memory of the two slain agents. She also shared the credit, saying it could not have been accomplished without the help of her Republican colleagues, including then-House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Perhaps most notable, the video doesn’t show Wilson boasting about securing money for the building, which had been obtained before she was even in Congress. The video shows Wilson telling the audience that shortly before the dedication of a new FBI building in Miramar, Fla., the FBI approached her to see whether she could help name the building after FBI agents Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove, who were killed during a 1986 shootout with bank robbers south of Miami. Naming federal buildings is typically a responsibility of Congress. ""The ribbon-cutting has been scheduled in four short weeks,"" Wilson recalled being told. ""The dedication is on the government’s calendar and cannot be changed. One problem: The FBI wants to name this gorgeous edifice at the same time, in four weeks. Everyone said that’s impossible -- it takes at least eight months to a year to complete the process, through the House, the Senate and to the president’s office. ""I said, I’m a school principal and I said, excuse my French, ‘Oh, hell no!’ We’re gonna get this done. Immediately I went to attack mode. I went to the Speaker, Speaker Boehner, and I said, ""Mr. Speaker, I need your help. The FBI needs your help, and our country needs your help and we have no time to waste.’ (Boehner) went into attack mode, and in two days pulled it out of committee, brought it to the floor for a vote."" At that point, Wilson said, she ""dashed it over to the Senate,"" where Florida Sens. Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio helped get it to the floor in two days. ""And guess what? The president signed the bill into law this past Tuesday, April 7, 2015, with a bang, bang, bang."" Wilson did not mention anything about securing funding for the building, nor did she brag about using her influence with Obama. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Wilson called ""crazy"" Kelly’s notion that she claimed she had gotten the money. ""That building was funded long before I got to Congress. I didn’t say that. I have staff, people who write the speeches. You can’t say that."" The Herald reported that the General Services Administration ""had already bid out a $144 million construction contract for the project in September 2010, just a few months before Wilson won her congressional seat. The bidding for federal projects takes place after Congress has secured the funding."" The Herald also reported that the 380,000-square-foot pair of glass towers cost $194 million to build, much higher than the $20 million figure Kelly had mentioned. In reality, most of Wilson’s speech consisted of praise for the FBI and the slain agents. The quick action on the naming ""speaks to the respect that our Congress has for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the men and women who put their lives on the line every single day,"" Wilson said. ""And today we’re providing a boost to our nation by naming this fantastic building in honor of Special Agent Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove, who died valiantly … in what is still considered the bloodiest gun battle in the storied history of the FBI."" She then urged everyone in law enforcement and first responders to stand up so the audience could applaud. ""Stand up! We are proud of you,"" she said. Wilson then spent several moments specifically praising agents Grogan and Dove and telling their story. She continued, ""Today, it is our patriotic duty to lift up Special Agent Benjamin Grogan and Special Agent Jerry Dove from the street in South Florida and place their names and pictures high, where the world will know that we are proud of their sacrifice, their sacrifice for our nation."" Wilson concluded, ""It is only fitting that their names should be placed on the same mantle with the letters ‘FBI,’ because special agents Grogan and Dove embody the sacred motto for which the agency has become known. Please repeat it after me: Fidelity, bravery, and integrity. God bless you, God bless the FBI, and God bless America."" Just hours after the Sun-Sentinel posted the video, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House was standing by Kelly’s characterization of Wilson’s remarks. A reporter at the daily White House briefing asked, ""Does Gen. Kelly still stand by the statement he made yesterday that he felt (Wilson) was grandstanding and that she was taking credit for funding?"" Huckabee Sanders responded, ""Absolutely. Gen Kelly said he was stunned that Rep. Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As Gen. Kelly pointed out, if you’re able to make a sacred act honoring American heroes all about yourself, you’re an empty barrel."" When asked whether she had seen the Sun-Sentinel video, Huckabee Sanders said she had, and that it didn’t change her view. Wilson ""also had quite a few comments that day that weren’t part of that speech and weren’t part of that video that were witnessed by many people that were there,"" Huckabee Sanders said. However, she declined to provide supporting evidence for that claim. When PolitiFact inquired with the White House, they did not provide any additional information. Kelly said that Wilson ""stood up there ... and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money -- the $20 million -- to build the building. And she sat down."" However, in her speech, Wilson didn’t mention funding for the building, much less claim credit for it or tell the audience how she leveraged influence with Obama to secure it. Wilson did describe how she helped secure legislation to name the building for two slain agents, but Kelly’s description leaves out that the FBI pressed her to make that effort and that she shared credit with several other lawmakers, including the Republican House speaker and Florida’s Republican senator. Wilson also spoke at some length about the bravery of the slain agents and the FBI in general.

Lloyd Doggett says 80 percent of Republican-sought tax cuts flow to wealthiest 1 percent
","A Texas Democrat told congressional colleagues that President Donald Trump’s outlined plan to cut taxes would hugely--and mostly--benefit America’s wealthiest. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district runs south into San Antonio, said in his Sept. 30, 2017, House floor remarks: ""Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this proposal go to the top 1 percent--that is, people making more than $730,000 a year."" Doggett made his claim three days after Republicans issued a framework outlining a proposed tax system with just three tax brackets, at tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, down from the current seven tax brackets. For personal income-tax filers, the framework calls for doubling the standard income-tax deduction while repealing most itemized deductions, including personal exemptions for dependents. The framework further says that the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee ""will work on additional measures to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle-class."" Put another way, the legislation itself had yet to debut. The framework also lists big intended changes in business taxation including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Doggett points to news story Doggett, asked the basis of his claim, pointed to an Associated Press news story citing a preliminary review of the framework that was issued Sept. 29, 2017, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. According to the AP report, the center found ""that about 80 percent of the tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent — with income above $730,000 annually — by 2027."" We confirmed that’s what the center’s analysis, ""A Preliminary Analysis of the Unified Framework,"" concluded for the year 2027. However, the center pegs the top-1-percent income figure for 2027 at $912,100 in 2017 dollars; it separately lists $730,000 as what the top 1 percent would earn in 2018 when about half the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent, the analysis says. Generally, experts told us that no other reports on the plan’s effects on taxpayers came public before Doggett spoke. A few days later, though, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy --  a research group that partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for the tax interests of middle- and lower-class families -- predicted that in all but a few states, at least half the framework’s tax cuts would flow to the wealthiest 1 percent of residents. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation plans to issue a detailed impact analysis once the tax legislation firms up, an official there told us by phone. ""As an organization, we decided that the unified framework was not yet detailed enough,"" Scott Greenberg said. He noted that among unsettled variables were the size of a revised standard deduction and an increased child tax credit. Center’s preliminary analysis Let’s get to details in the center’s analysis. For starters, the center’s estimates presume that the plan takes effect in 2018 and would decrease federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over 10 years. ""In 2018,"" the analysis says, ""all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts."" According to the center’s estimates, the top 1 percent of Americans would get 53 percent of the plan’s benefits at the start--though reap 79.7 percent of the benefits in its 10th year, 2027. That is, in 2018, 53 cents of every dollar in tax savings would go to the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent of residents and in 2027, nearly 80 cents of every dollar in savings would accrue to the top 1 percent, the center estimates. A pause: Chris Edwards, a tax expert for the libertarian Cato Institute, cautions against solely considering the share of tax reductions potentially enjoyed by the super-wealthy. His nudge: Folks should be aware that the same Americans consistently account for a great deal of tax revenue. In 2014, according to IRS data posted by the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes, 39.5 percent, than the bottom 90 percent combined, 29.1 percent. The same year, per the government, the share of personal income earned by the top 1 percent of taxpayers rose to 20.6 percent. The center’s analysis of the Republican framework says: ""Between 2018 and 2027, the average tax cut as a share of after-tax income would fall for all income groups other than the top 1 percent."" In 2027, it says, the overall average tax cut would be smaller than in 2018, increasing after-tax incomes 1.7 percent. That year, the center says, about ""80 percent of the total  benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top 1 percent, whose after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent,"" the analysis says. Under the plan, the center says, the number of taxpayers paying more in taxes would generally rise over time. ""This is because the plan would replace personal exemptions, which are indexed for inflation, with additional credits for children and non-child dependents that are not indexed for inflation,"" its analysis says. ""In addition, indexing tax brackets and other parameters to the slower-growing chained Consumer Price Index means that over time more income is subject to tax at higher rates,"" it says. A center researcher, Joe Rosenberg, advised by phone that the conclusion that the wealthiest Americans would reap more of the tax benefits in the tenth year traces to other Americans bearing more tax losses as a result of losing itemized deductions, especially deductions for paying state and local income taxes. Rosenberg also singled out the proposal to end the personal exemption, indexed for inflation, with a child tax credit not indexed for inflation. Rosenberg said the center did not analyze the ""distributional"" effects of the outlined plan for other years, meaning there are no projections of the degree of benefits absorbed by any subset of earners for years other than 2018 and 2027. After the center posted its analysis, a White House adviser, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, questioned the validity of the projections given multiple assumptions made by the center. Rosenberg, asked about that critique, pointed out that the center’s analysis says up front that many aspects of the framework ""were unspecified or left to be determined by the tax-writing committees in Congress."" Doggett stands by statement We informed Doggett that he didn’t say in his claim that he was speaking solely about 2027 and he also gave the wrong figure for what the top 1 percent are projected to earn that year. Doggett replied by email: ""In my remarks, I specifically noted that the tax breaks would go to those making ‘more than’ $730,000 a year. You correctly note that the number increases (more than), not decreases (less than) in future years, which further bolsters my point that the benefits go to the very wealthy few. Since if anything, I understated how inequitable this proposal is, I am pleased you are focusing on the inequity."" Doggett also said that last he checked, the AP news story he shared with us (posted online by the Austin American-Statesman) hadn’t been updated to the 2027 dollar amount. Our ruling Doggett said ""80 percent of the tax breaks in"" President Trump’s frameworked tax-cut ""proposal go to the top 1 percent, that is, people making more than $730,000 a year."" The analysis Doggett referenced indeed indicates benefits will accrue to the very wealthy over time. Yet in the first year of changes, the top 1 percent are projected to draw a little over half the tax savings. The threshold of 80 percent going to the top 1 percent is projected for the tenth year. Also, Doggett’s stated figure for incomes is too low; it ties to the first year of implementation. We rate Doggett’s floor statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Is the Alamo consistently listed among nation's most disappointing landmarks?
","A website intended to defend the master plan for spiffing up the Alamo says tourists remain far from wowed by the historically revered site. We paused at this specific claim in point No. 3 on the Alamo Truth site, which is funded by Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush’s political campaign: ""The Alamo has been consistently listed as one of the most disappointing landmarks in our nation."" The point closes: ""It is our simple goal to improve the visitor experience for guests and all Texans, including our students."" No doubt, the Alamo has ragged edges. It’s old, man. Has it consistently been named one of the country’s most disappointing landmarks? Bush, a Republican seeking re-election in 2018, has been overseeing redevelopment of the Alamo along with the private Alamo Endowment and San Antonio city officials including Mayor Ron Nirenberg, who has said, for instance, that he favors moving the cenotaph honoring defenders who died there from its place in front of the entrance to another spot on the site. Aide: Do a Google We inquired into how Bush reached his conclusion about the Alamo as a disappointment. Brittany Eck, a General Land Office spokeswoman, initially urged us to Google the words ""Alamo,"" ""disappointing"" and ""landmark."" Eck said: ""We have routinely heard feedback from people who came to the Alamo, folks saying: ‘Is this all there is?’"" When we ran that web search in mid-October 2017, we landed several web posts describing the shrine from the Texas Revolution in unflattering ways, though positive statements also surfaced. We noticed that three Texas stories including a May 29, 2017, post by Austin Culture Map headlined ""Legendary Texas landmark dissed as worst tourist trap,"" keyed off a story published May 19, 2017, on the Business Insider website specifying each state’s worst tourist trap. ""Remember the Alamo?"" the Texas part of the tourist-trap story says. ""More like, spend a day at the Alamo and you'll remember to never go back. The building's remains are so small they consistently disappoint visitors. ""History buffs might get a kick out of it for an hour or so,"" the snippet closes, ""but looking at a picture will suffice for most."" In contrast, a San Antonio Express-News rebuff of that story pointed out that as of May 2017, the Alamo, by one measure, was the most-Instagrammed Texas tourist site, far outpacing the Johnson Space Center. The Culture Map story further noted a May 8, 2017, commentary by Alyssa Morris of the Texas Architect, published by the Houston Chronicle. During an Alamo visit, Morris wrote, she noticed that few of the site’s original features remained aside from its iconic chapel and long barracks. ""But these buildings seem curiously out of place and ignored by the high-rises and parking lots of the modern metropolis that grew up around them,"" Morris wrote. ""I texted my co-worker: ‘I don't get the Alamo. There's so little educational information here. It refuses to teach me about itself.’"" In May 2015, our search showed, the Thrillist website listed the Alamo among nine ""disappointingly small"" tourist sites including Mount Rushmore, Plymouth Rock and the Mona Lisa. Its story said: ""The legendary last stand at the Alamo has achieved mythical status in American/Texas history, causing most people to picture the complex as a sprawling fortress. In reality, not so much -- at least not any more. The original part of this Catholic mission that everybody visits is pretty much an underwhelming 75ft by 62ft building."" Also from our web search: Comments and ratings of the Alamo as a tourist site posted on the TripAdvisor.com website including, at the top of the comments when we peeked: ""It's a landmark. It's history. It's also in the middle of town and not that informative. We thought there would be more to see. Glad there are other activities in the area."" Generally, still, the site says that 14,300-plus visitor reviews have led to the Alamo averaging better than a four-star rating (out of five possible stars). Our search at Eck’s nudge otherwise turned up mixed comments about the Alamo on a 2007 Democratic Underground thread of comments including: ""I went to see it during a day pass while I was in basic training. It was one of the great disappointments of my life."" Six years later, also from our search, responses on neogaf.com about disappointing sites included this post about the Alamo: ""Look at it for 5 seconds, then cross the street to eat overpriced tacos."" So, the Alamo has proved disappointing to some visitors and to writers for a couple of online publications. Documented disappointment Following up, Eck shared an undated document she described as compiling feedback about the Alamo fielded by elected officials and others; negative articles and reviews from online publications; deeper analysis of the TripAdvisor.com ratings of the Alamo plus screenshots of negative ratings including expressions of disappointment; and negative reviews of the Alamo posted on Yelp and Facebook. For our part, we also queried Douglass McDonald, CEO of the Alamo Endowment. By email, McDonald said the Alamo is on his personal list of ""the most disappointing historic sites in the United States. The commercialization of this area has compromised the most important historic site in Texas,"" McDonald wrote. By phone, McDonald called the Alamo the most compromised significant historic site in the nation. He asked: ""Can you imagine having Ripley’s"" Believe It or Not ""150 feet from the front door at Mount Vernon? Or an ice cream vendor 50 feet in front of Monticello?"" McDonald also emailed us an undated document he described as created in response to our queries. The document presents more than 30 individual comments posted online about the Alamo from September 2016 into September 2017, all on the negative side. Per the document, one person wrote: ""Very crowded and underwhelming. Go to say you have, but don't expect it to be earth shattering."" Another: ""Glad it's free. Really not much to see. 20 minutes and you are done."" And: ""We did the audio tour and it just wasn't interesting. Of course, you can't go to San Antonio without seeing The Alamo. It was disappointing."" McDonald summed up: ""As a museum professional, all of this is disturbing, it should be disturbing to every Texan."" Our ruling The campaign-funded website says: ""The Alamo has been consistently listed as one of the most disappointing landmarks in our nation."" We’re persuaded that plenty of visitors have commented on the Alamo’s surprising small size and how quickly a visit can pass, fueling disappointment. Of late, though, it looks like only the Business Insider and the Thrillist listed the Alamo among the nation’s most disappointing landmarks. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

Breitbart’s False and inflammatory claim about deadly Wine Country fires
","As authorities continued to investigate the cause of Northern California’s deadly wildfires this week, they refuted what they described as false claims started by the conservative website Breitbart about their investigation. A Breitbart article on Oct. 17, 2017 said Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, ""was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.""  Sonoma County sheriff's officials tell a much different story and have called the Breitbart report ""completely false.""  Even so, the article quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report, which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News. The series of wind-driven fires that started Oct. 8, 2017 has destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings and killed at least 42 people across Northern California. It is the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. While there’s a strong desire for answers about what caused the fires, the investigation is still in its early stages. We decided to fact check Breitbart’s controversial claim that Gonzalez is now the target of an arson probe connected to the deadly fires, despite arguments to the contrary by authorities. Our research We started by reviewing comments by Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano at a press conference on Oct. 17, 2017, the same day Breitbart’s article was published. The sheriff said his deputies arrested Gonzalez two days earlier on a felony arson charge for allegedly starting ""a small fire"" that was unconnected to the larger blazes and was quickly put out. Gonzalez, a Sonoma Valley man who sheriff's officials described as homeless, told deputies he lit the fire to stay warm. A statement by federal immigration authorities indicates Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Here’s the sheriff’s statement at the press conference: ""There’s a little rumor control issue. We, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office, arrested a man on Sunday for arson in the Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There’s a story out there that he’s the arsonist for these fires. That’s not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. CalFire is doing an investigation into how these fires started. We don’t even know if it’s arson.""  Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano press conference Oct. 17, 2017. Cal Fire, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, is in charge of battling the wildfires and is the lead investigative agency. Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire’s assistant deputy director, told PolitiFact California on Oct. 20, 2017, that its investigation was ""ongoing"" and that it has ""not yet determined any specific causes."" He declined to comment specifically on Gonzalez, saying Cal Fire would work with the Sonoma County sheriff’s office to investigate anyone suspected in the large fires. ""There’s a lot of speculation on what may have started the fires. People want to know who is to blame,"" Berlant said. ""When we have an arson suspect, that’s going to be made public immediately."" Berlant clarified that the agency has yet to determine whether arson is even the cause of the large fires, adding there are a host of other possibilities. ""Completely false, bad, wrong information"" Sgt. Spencer Crum, spokesperson for the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, was blunt in describing Breitbart’s role in fueling false rumors. Breitbart is run by Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist.  Crum told BuzzFeed on Oct. 19, 2017 that the rumors about Gonzalez are ""completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public in a very strong way."" Crum added in the BuzzFeed article that a Breitbart reporter called the department only to inquire about Gonzalez's race and if ICE had placed a detainer on him. ""After they published that story we started getting a lot of calls,"" he added. ""There is no indication Mr. Gonzalez is connected to the wildfires. None. Breitbart made that up themselves."" The Breitbart reporter who wrote the article did not respond to our request for comment. In the article, Breitbart also reported that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, issued ""a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail"" for Gonzalez. Giordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, confirmed through a statement posted online on Oct. 19, 2017 that ICE made that request. He added that Gonzalez remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. Half of that is for a misdemeanor drug warrant from Ventura County, he said. The sheriff also detailed what he described as several misleading comments by ICE when that agency released a statement this week about past detainer requests it made to the Sonoma County sheriff’s office related to Gonzalez. Our ruling An article on the conservative website Breitbart recently claimed that Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who federal officials have indicated is an undocumented immigrant, ""was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents."" Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordono said deputies arrested Gonzalez for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. The sheriff added that ""there is no indication he is related to these fires at all."" A Cal Fire spokesman said the agency has not identified an arson suspect nor has it determined whether arson was the cause of the deadly fires. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials have pointed to Breitbart for fueling false rumors about their investigation. At this point, there’s been no suspect identified and no arrests made tied to these deadly fires, contrary to the website’s inaccurate and irresponsible claim. We rate Breitbart’s claim False.

In Wisconsin, thousands on probation commit new crimes but don't get probation revoked?
","Reports have documented that each year, thousands of people in Wisconsin who have previously been convicted of crimes are locked up again even without having been convicted of a new crime. They are people who violate rules of what is generally known as community supervision, which includes probation, parole or extended supervision. Another side of that coin -- people living in the community on supervision who commit new crimes -- is what riles state Sen. Leah Vukmir. The suburban Milwaukee Republican is running in the 2018 race for the seat held by first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat. Vukmir addressed the issue during an Oct. 12, 2017 interview with conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Touting a bill pending in the Legislature that is aimed at offenders who are on supervision, Vukmir stated: ""In 2016, there were 5,570 people who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked."" Probation is often used as a blanket term that also includes parole and extended supervision. Taking that into account, Vukmir is partially on target: But the number is an estimate, not an actual count. And the estimate refers to people on probation who have only been charged with another crime -- not convicted, as she suggested. The law, the bill Under current law, if people are suspected of violating a condition of supervision, a state probation-parole agent has discretion on whether to recommend the supervision be revoked. If revocation is recommended and a state administrative law judge agrees, the person goes to prison. Under the plan advanced by Republican lawmakers, if the person on supervision is charged with a new crime, the state would require probation-parole agents to recommend revocation. The state public defender’s office has raised concerns, saying the bill would remove the ability of probation-parole agents to review cases based on individual circumstances. There is also concern about a change in the burden of proof: A person on supervision charged with a new crime could be sent to prison based on probable cause -- the standard for charging a crime -- rather than based on guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for a criminal conviction. The number As for the number part of Vukmir’s claim, it comes from a memo on the bill from the state Department of Corrections. The department estimates that in fiscal year 2016, which ran from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016, there were 5,570 people on supervision who were charged with a new crime but were not revoked. The department said it made the estimate based on data from the Circuit Court Access Program (CCAP) on the number of people on supervision who were charged with a new crime during that one-year period. The memo said the department also assumes that if it had recommended revocation in those 5,570 cases, revocation would be approved for half of them, and the cost to the state prison system would be about $149 million per year. Our rating Vukmir says that in 2016, there were 5,570 people in Wisconsin ""who committed crimes on probation and they were not revoked."" Vukmir’s probation reference appeared to include people who are on other forms of community supervision -- parole and extended supervision. Her claim is partially on target, but goes too far. The 5,570 figure is a state Department of Corrections estimate, not an actual count. And, importantly, it is for the number of people charged with a crime, not convicted.

Emanuel plays fast and loose with fast growth boast
","Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s 2018 budget address included a series of statements highlighting the city’s economic growth under Emanuel’s leadership. Emanuel noted the building boom that has dotted the city’s skyline with ""58 cranes"" and a surge in corporate relocations as well as heavy foreign investment in Chicago. He topped it with a claim about the city’s economy as a whole. ""And over the last six years,"" Emanuel said, ""Chicago’s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average."" This has become a standard talking point that Emanuel has repeated often in interviews and public settings. We’ve heard it often, yet we’ve never heard an explanation of what constitutes the economic growth Emanuel claims. We thought it was time for a closer look. Emanuel’s claim covers a lot of ground, so we contacted his office to find out whether it’s based on specific data, studies or reports. Despite several attempts and an assurance that we’d hear back with an answer, we never did. So our next stop was the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is the official source for measuring economic growth nationally and regionally. The numbers there present a mixed bag on Emanuel’s statement. Using gross domestic product as a yardstick from 2011 through 2016 (the most recent year available), Chicago’s economy grew 7.4 percent, which was better than Washington, D.C., (3.8 percent) but lower than that of New York (7.6 percent) and the U.S. as a whole (10.9 percent). Chicago also led Washington but trailed New York and the nation when using growth in personal income as a standard, said BEA economist Jeff Newman. Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, emeritus director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois, found largely the same results but offered a caveat to judging Emanuel’s statement. ""The main problem is that generalities like this depend upon context. Clearly, there is little appreciable difference in the economic performance between Chicago, (New York) and the U.S. as a whole; Chicago does do better than D.C.,"" Hewings said in an email. ""However, given the fiscal problems in Illinois, it is surprising that Chicago has done as well as it has and of course, the city of Chicago has faced significant fiscal challenges as a result of rather creative accounting manipulations in the last decade."" Another potential measure of economic growth is unemployment, the standard measure of which is gauged by Metropolitan Statistical Area rather than by individual cities. Using the latest full-year average unemployment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found metropolitan Chicago reduced its unemployment by 41 percent -- from 9.9 percent to 5.8 percent -- between 2011 and 2016. That’s better than Washington’s 37 percent but behind New York’s 44 percent and the United States’ 45 percent reduction in unemployment during that time. In September 2017, greater Chicago’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.1 percent and its year-to-date average is 4.7 percent, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security. But a report by Moody’s Analytics in June noted that Chicago’s declining unemployment, which this year dipped ""below the national rate for the first time in a decade,"" may not be cause for celebration. ""The decline over the past year is larger than that in all but a handful of metro areas and divisions in the country. However, it occurred only because the labor force is contracting,"" wrote Moody’s analyst Sarah Crane. Crane cautioned, however, that Emanuel’s claim still has some merit.   ""Chicago’s economy is advancing,"" Crane said in an email, ""but its relative performance to New York, D.C. or the U.S. depends on which economic measures are considered."" Emanuel said that ""over the last six years, Chicago’s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average."" We don’t know exactly what criteria Emanuel bases this statement on because his office did not respond to repeated requests for specifics. But the most obvious benchmarks for judging economic growth don’t back him up. Chicago did better than Washington, D.C., on certain metrics, but we found no evidence of it out-performing the New York or national economies over an extended period. We find this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A4380>],/factchecks/2017/oct/20/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-plays-fast-and-loose-fast-growth-boast/
"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Roy Moore']","
Is it ‘against the law’ for NFL players to kneel for the national anthem, as Roy Moore said? No
","Roy Moore, Alabama's Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, introduced a new dimension to the debate over NFL players’ protest by claiming that kneeling during the national anthem is illegal. ""It’s against the law, you know that?"" Moore said in an Oct. 16 interview with Time magazine. ""It was a act of Congress that every man stand and put their hand over their heart. That’s the law."" Given his controversial role as the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore’s claim caught our attention. We’ve previously looked at the history of athletes protesting the national anthem, but this is the first time we wanted to explore what the law says — and doesn’t say — on the matter. Moore cited Title 36, Section 301 of the U.S. Code, which designates the Star-Spangled Banner as the national anthem. It also instructs military members and veterans on how to properly comport themselves while the anthem plays, before addressing civilian etiquette. ""All other persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart,"" the law states, ""and men not in uniform, if applicable, should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart."" So Moore is correct in one sense: Congress indeed passed a law dealing with decorum during the national anthem. But the etiquette is merely a suggestion, not a legal obligation. We know this because lawmakers used the word ""should"" — not ""shall"" — with regard to their patriotic guidance. The word ""should"" implies ""usually no more than an obligation of propriety,"" according to the authoritative legal reference Black’s Law Dictionary. In other words, ""should"" does not create a legally enforceable duty. ""When laws are binding they use the word ‘shall.’ Shall is non-negotiable, and not discretionary,"" said Catherine Ross, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in First Amendment law. "" ‘Should’ is a recommendation. That is, in the context of patriotic ceremonies, it’s what a civilian should do if they want to follow best practices."" Moore’s statement may give the impression the law is binding, when in fact it’s toothless — at least with regard to non-military members. It contains no mechanism to force the average civilian to stand at attention during the national anthem, and contains no penalties for those who opt to sit or kneel. The absence of such consequences reinforces that the law is simply a protocol or ideal, as opposed to a legal mandate, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at UNC School of Law. Because the law contains no enforcement mechanism or penalty, it’s difficult to imagine a civilian who knelt for the national anthem being hauled into court. But for argument’s sake we asked legal experts how a judge would handle such a case. ""In spite of whatever the law says,"" Gerhardt said, ""there is strong Supreme Court precedent protecting people from being compelled to express a message they do not approve."" Ross said two Supreme Court cases virtually ensure a court would find that the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem. In 1943, the court ruled in West Virginia vs. Barnette that the First Amendment protects people from being forced to participate in patriotic ceremonies that offend their conscience or beliefs. In the 1989 case of Texas vs. Johnson, the court protected the the right to burn the American flag as a form of symbolic speech. ""If the Constitution protects the right to burn the flag and the right not to participate in the pledge as aspects of free speech,"" Ross said, ""it must also protect the right to kneel respectfully during the national anthem or the pledge of allegiance."" Moore said NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem is ""against the law."" Moore's basis is that a law on the books describes patriotic etiquette during the national anthem. But his statement gives the false impression the law is binding, when in fact it’s merely guidance that carries no penalty. Additionally, legal experts told us the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem. We rate this False.

Jeff Sessions claims asylum system rampant with fraud and abuse
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed the U.S. asylum system swelled with false cries for help during the presidency of Barack Obama, suppressing genuine claims and overloading the immigration system. Sessions said the the Obama administration allowed most immigrants who passed an initial credible fear review to be released into the United States pending a full hearing. ""These changes — and case law that has expanded the concept of asylum well beyond congressional intent — created even more incentives for illegal aliens to come here and claim a fear of return,"" Sessions told the Executive Office of Immigration Review on Oct. 12. ""The consequences are just what you’d expect. Claims of fear to return have skyrocketed, and the percentage of claims that are genuinely meritorious are down."" Sessions and President Donald Trump share a goal of changing the asylum process. In his October list of immigration principles and policies, Trump outlined tighter controls of the asylum process, including elevating the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews. On the question of fewer meritorious asylum claims, however, there is no data that plainly speaks to that trend. Sessions pieced together an argument that relies on assumptions and ignores the growth of refugees. ""Indeed, there has certainly been an increase in asylum claims — but this corresponds with the increase in refugees around the world,"" said Lindsay M. Harris, an assistant professor of law and co-director of the immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of the District of Columbia, David A. Clarke School of Law. She continued, ""One of the humanitarian crises producing refugees happens to be south of our border, and this accounts for the exponential increase in asylum claims and individuals seeking protection in the U.S. through the credible fear system, rather than a sudden increase in fraudulent claims."" Thousands of Central Americans have left their countries in recent years due to gang violence and poverty. Asylum in the United States may be granted to foreign nationals based on persecution or fear of persecution back in their home countries or last country of residence on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. To Sessions, the process in which asylum officers find individuals have a credible fear of persecution ""has become an easy ticket to illegal entry into the United States."" Laws were ""never intended to provide asylum to all those who fear generalized violence, crime, personal vendettas, or a lack of job prospects,"" Sessions said. The Obama administration in 2009 announced policy changes to automatically consider for parole individuals who had a credible fear of persecution or torture. (Previously, parole had to be requested in writing) The change became effective in January 2010. Harris said there’s been no evidence to suggest that the policy change influenced people to flee their homes and seek protection in the United States. The increase in people seeking asylum was ""very much based on the humanitarian crisis in central America,"" she said.   Federal data do show a significant spike in credible fear cases from 2009 to 2016. But it is not a simple comparison. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in fiscal year 2016 decided on nearly 93,000 credible fear cases, and fear was established in about 78 percent of the cases. The agency in fiscal year 2009 reviewed more than 5,000 cases, but that data does not specify in the number where fear was established. This information, however, would not answer whether the findings of credible fear were genuinely deserving. That is difficult to quantify, experts said. Sessions said that many individuals who are released after a credible fear determination never show up to their immigration hearings or even file an asylum application once they are in the United States — suggesting ""they knew their asylum claims lacked merit and that their claim of fear was simply a ruse to enter the country illegally."" The assessment that not applying for asylum is an indication of fraud is ""absolutely not true,"" said Harris, the University of the District of Columbia professor. Asylum seekers are released with ""very little orientation"" of what’s expected next and many even think they have already applied by having articulated their case to asylum officers. Some even think they have already been granted asylum upon released, Harris added. Additionally, Sessions noted that in 2016 there were ""700 percent more removal orders issued in absentia for cases that began with a credible fear claim than in 2009."" But a failure to appear before a judge doesn’t necessarily mean the asylum claim was baseless, experts said. In-absentia orders and individuals’ failure to go to court may also be attributed to other factors, such as errors in address reporting by the respondent, errors in addresses in the notices from the courts to the respondents in proceedings, lack of education and inability to receive mail, said Geoffrey A. Hoffman, director of the University of Houston Law Center Immigration Clinic and a clinical associate professor. Individuals represented by counsel are also much more likely to attend court, Hoffman said. ""The issue of fraud in individual cases should not overshadow the reality which is that grants of asylum are extremely low, especially for applicants who are not represented by counsel,"" Hoffman added. Federal agencies have limited capabilities to detect asylum fraud. Applicants may have fled their countries without a passport or birth certificate, may have left countries where ""documentary evidence was not available,"" or may have fled using fraudulent documents in order to hide their identity and escape persecution, said a December 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. ""As such, asylum officers and immigration judges must make decisions, at times, with little or no documentation to support or refute an applicant’s claim,"" said the GAO report. ""Like any administrative system, there has long been fraud in the asylum process. I don’t think anyone knows how widespread it is, but the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate at USCIS has been in place since 2004 and has been successful in weeding out at least some of the fraud,"" said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, an immigration law expert and professor at Temple University. Sessions said, ""Claims of fear to return have skyrocketed, and the percentage of claims that are genuinely meritorious are down."" The number of claims by immigrants citing credible fear to return to their home countries has significantly increased from 2009 to 2016. While there has been fraud in the asylum system, it’s uncertain and difficult to determine whether the percentage of ""genuinely meritorious"" credible fear claims is down, experts said. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809728F540>],/factchecks/2017/oct/19/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-claim-about-asylum-system-fraudulent/

Haley wrongly says Congress had no input on Iran nuclear deal
","Defending President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley said Congress now has a voice on the issue that it didn’t have in the past. Trump’s decision allows Congress to potentially kill the agreement or tack on new conditions. ""He's saying to Congress, can we make it better?"" Haley told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on an Oct. 15 broadcast of This Week. ""And I think that his engagement with Congress is something that never happened under President Obama. They were never allowed to debate it. They were never allowed to discuss it. So, now Congress is going to be fully engaged on the threats of Iran."" This was an early criticism of the agreement. After the United States, Iran and other foreign governments came to an agreement on the framework for the Iran deal, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress appealed to Obama to let them have a say in it before the final deal was reached. Here, we are fact-checking Haley’s claim that Congress was ""never allowed"" to debate or discuss the agreement. Much of the responsibility for U.S. foreign policy falls under the authority of the executive branch. Congress does play a significant role, however, in foreign trade and commerce, immigration, foreign aid, the defense budget and any declarations of war. The Senate authorizes treaties and confirms the president’s cabinet nominees. To avoid needing Senate approval for an agreement with a foreign power, the president can simply avoid calling the agreement a treaty. The Obama administration said the Iran deal was neither a treaty nor an executive agreement. Instead, the State Department said in a letter that the deal ""reflects political commitments"" between the seven nations involved. When the president negotiates a deal that is not deemed a treaty, Congress -- if it wants a say on the deal -- must convince the president to give the legislative branch the power to approve or block the final deal. That’s exactly what Congress did when it passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, a bill that had bipartisan support and allowed Congress the right to review any agreement reached in the negotiations. Obama initially threatened to veto the bill but did not. Senators considered a separate, and ultimately unsuccessful, measure that would have given them the the power to block the agreement through a resolution of disapproval. A procedural vote on the resolution fell short of the 60 votes needed to override a Democratic filibuster. Despite the resolution’s failure, by passing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, Congress was able to have some authority and say in the final agreement. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who spearheaded the bill, has touted the legislation for taking ""power back from the president"" and forcing the executive office to be transparent. ""There’s no question the prior administration made every effort to bypass Congress and implement the agreement without congressional review or approval,"" Corker said in an emailed statement. ""That is why we overwhelmingly passed INARA, which required the administration to submit the full details of the agreement to Congress and established a process for a debate and vote on the deal."" It should also be noted that Obama administration officials went on the record about the Iran deal during congressional hearings and briefings, allowing members of Congress to bring up questions and concerns with the White House in a public debate setting. Further, the review act imposed a requirement that the president recertify the deal every 90 days. In other words, every three months the president must ensure the following: Iran is abiding by the rules of the agreement, Iran hasn’t taken action to advance its nuclear weapons program, the waiver of sanctions on Iran are still appropriate. ""This kind of ongoing management I think is unusual and represented quite a compromise by President Obama,"" said John Glaser, the director of foreign studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. Glaser pointed out that the Obama administration would not have been able to handle ""all of the subtlety, secrecy, and nuance that was required"" to negotiate the Iran deal if it had involved Congress from the beginning. Haley, we should note, backtracked a bit in an interview on Meet The Press, when moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that the reason the Iran deal has a certification process is because Congress added constraints. Haley responded: ""And Congress did that because President Obama didn't give them the authority to be a part of that decision. So they did it to try and control the situation and not let it get to a bad problem."" She didn't add similar caveats during the ABC interview. Haley said Congress was never allowed to debate or discuss the Iran nuclear agreement while Obama was in office. Though Congress had to fight for the right to disapprove of the deal, the passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 allowed Congress to not only vote on the deal but to also hold public hearings and debate. The Senate ultimately did not have the votes to block the deal, but the act included a requirement for the president to frequently monitor Iran’s progress in meeting the agreement’s conditions. So Congress did have input, even if Obama initially tried to avoid it. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C44B080>],/factchecks/2017/oct/19/nikki-haley/haley-wrongly-says-congress-had-no-input-iran-nucl/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio says child tax credit is key in amount of tax relief working families receive
","The Trump administration and Senate and House leaders have revealed a framework for tax legislation that proposes tax cuts for business, a reduction in tax brackets, and the elimination of several tax breaks. What the plan means for Americans remains to be determined. But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., recently said that the amount of tax relief working families receive under the plan is entirely dependent on one thing: what happens to the child tax credit. ""The child tax credit, if we don't do it, there will be no tax relief for working families,"" Rubio said on WFLA on Oct. 15. ""How much tax relief working families get under tax reform is entirely dependent on whether or not we put in place an increase to the child tax credit."" We wondered whether increasing the child tax credit will be the only way that working families can gain under the framework. What we found is that the child tax credit is indeed central in the current tax proposal. However, the plan is so tentative that it’s premature to say that will be the only way ""working families"" will see relief. Rubio’s team sought to back up his assertion with a press release that included two charts. Both charts relayed the same message: In order to help working families, a tax plan must increase the child tax credit and make the credit refundable. So in Rubio’s mind, expanding — not just increasing  — the child tax credit is key in seeing working families prosper. The Trump-backed tax framework proposes increasing the credit from the current amount of $1,000 and raising the current income threshold at which the credit phases out. Experts agreed that expanding the child tax credit is one of the central provisions that will shape the impact that middle-income households will experience under the framework. Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation, said the existing, $1,000 child tax credit is already quite large. Parents with children under the age of 17 are eligible for a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child. If they owe more than $1,000 in taxes, then the credit lowers their tax liability, or the total amount of tax left on their income. If parents owe less than $1,000 in taxes then the tax liability is reduced to zero. In its current form this tax credit is nonrefundable. Greenberg said that under current law, a married household with two children making $60,000 would owe about $3,733 in individual income taxes before taking the child credit into account. After taking the child credit into account, the household’s individual income tax burden would fall to about $1,733. (His math assumes that the household takes the standard deduction and does not claim any other major credits, exclusions, or other provisions.) Still, it’s not just about increasing the credit. Transforming it into a refundable credit is also important. In 2015, Rubio and Mike Lee, R-Utah, released a tax plan that connected the child tax credit to the payroll tax, which would have increased the refundability rate. At the time, experts were unsure whether this would have benefitted low-income families because it didn’t include an expansion for them. Another reason why expanding the child tax credit is important is because the current framework eliminates the personal exemption — that is, the untaxed income pegged to the number of dependents on their return. This provision disproportionately benefits households with children. To compensate for eliminating it, the plan proposes increasing the child tax credit. ""It looks like they’ll pay more under the current framework, but that’s where the child tax credit comes into play,"" said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. ""It does its magic and wipes away that tax liability."" It’s worth emphasizing that the details of the child tax credit are a work in progress. Right now, the plan does not specify how much the credit would increase or which incomes level would qualify. More broadly, little is known about the thresholds of new income tax brackets, which could greatly affect the distribution of benefits. ""From the sketchy details we have of the basic (framework), it’s pretty fair to say the child tax credit is key,"" said Edward McCaffrey, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California. As a result, the credit has emerged as one of few options available to policymakers looking to change the tax burden on middle-income households. Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, bemoaned the focus on a specific tax break such as the child credit, favoring instead overall tax simplification. In that context, Edwards said, policymakers have lots of ways to cut taxes on moderate-income Americans. Maag, meanwhile, pointed to proposals outside the framework that would expand the earned income tax credit. For example, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., introduced a very large increase in that credit -- a refundable credit targeted at low-income working Americans -- that would provide benefits to low- and middle-income families  Rubio said if tax reform efforts don’t expand the child tax credit, ""there will be no tax relief for working families."" That’s a bit overstated, since the tax proposal is in its early stages. That said, judging by what’s in the initial framework, experts say that the child tax credit is one of the few levers that could significantly affect the size of the tax burden for middle-income households. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A2B80>],/factchecks/2017/oct/19/marco-rubio/rubio-says-child-tax-credit-key-amount-tax-relief-/
"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'California', 'Antonio  Villaraigosa']","
Did LA’s violent crime drop by nearly half during Villaraigosa’s time as mayor?
","During his time as mayor of Los Angeles and now in his campaign for California governor, Antonio Villaraigosa has repeatedly highlighted the city’s drop in violent crime. Villaraigosa, one of the top Democrats vying to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018, spoke in detail in a late July interview on MSNBC about LA’s reduction in violent crime and the steps he claims led to that result. ""In the eight years that I was mayor, (there was a) nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime, gang crime — crime went down because we grew our police department, we focused on constitutional community policing, we did some of the most innovative prevention, intervention, job re-entry programs in the nation.""  Villaraigosa makes his claim on MSNBC at about the 0:50 minute mark here.  He made a similar claim on Capital Public Radio on October 4, 2017. ""When I was mayor of Los Angeles … we reduced our violent crime rate by 49 percent."" We wanted to know whether Villaraigosa’s claim about this big drop in violent crime stood up to the facts. We also wanted to know whether there was evidence supporting his explanation that growing the police force and focusing on community policing really led to the decline. We set out on a fact check. Our research To support the claim, Villaraigosa’s campaign pointed us to crime statistics and past news articles discussing the former mayor’s crime initiatives. We started by reviewing FBI crime data. Here’s what we found: According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics, the LAPD reported the violent crime rate per 100,000 people declined from 820.6 in 2005 -- the year Villaraigosa took office -- to 426 in 2013, the year he left office. That represents a 48 percent reduction in the violent crime rate, homicide, rape, robbery and assaults. That matches with his claim of a ""nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime"" made on MSNBC in late July. It also tracks with his more recent statement on Capital Public Radio. In addition to looking at the violent crime rate, we also reviewed the raw number of reported violent crimes over Villaraigosa’s tenure. That total was nearly cut in half from 31,767 in 2005 to 16,524 in 2013, LAPD statistics show. Beyond the numbers Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California at Irvine, reviewed Villaraigosa’s claim at our request and told us ""the numbers do check out."" Kubrin added, however, that the more difficult challenge is determining how much of an impact Villaraigosa’s initiatives had on crime. ""It’s noteworthy that violent crime was going down well before 2005,"" Kubrin said. ""So there’s some question as to whether these are continuing trends or there’s something new about the time period he went into office."" For some perspective, violent crimes in LA dropped nearly 50 percent in the decade before Villaraigosa was elected mayor. They totaled nearly 73,000 in 1992 and had decreased to less than 38,000 by 2002. Who gets credit? Robert Stern, former president of the Los Angeles-based Center for Governmental Studies, said Villaraigosa should get some credit for his successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers. But, Stern said, ""The main credit has to go to the police chief Bill Bratton. And also the fact that what we saw across the country was a reduction in crime in almost all the major cities. So, it was a trend that LA participated in. But I think the mayor can claim some credit at least for increasing the police force."" Violent crime rates fell by 50 percent nationwide from the early 1990s through 2015, according to an analysis of data compiled by the Pew Research Center. Looking at another large city, New York, during the specific period of Villaraigosa’s tenure, we found only a 7 percent decline in the violent crime rate. But looking at a broader period, from 1995 through 2013, New York saw a nearly 60 percent decline. Breaking from the long-term trend, California and the nation saw an increase in violent crime rates in 2016 and 2015, according to state and national figures. Criminologists credit factors from the economy to demographic changes to incarceration rates for driving crime trends nationally and in California. As mayor, Villaraigosa had limited influence over many of these factors. Kubrin said Villaraigosa’s expansion of the police force, by itself, was probably not the main driving force behind the crime reduction. Instead, she cited the strategy executed by the police as a more important element. The LAPD’s focus on community policing and crime prevention and intervention during Villaraigosa’s tenure likely helped reduce crime, Kubrin said. Researchers have found those police strategies are likely to reduce crime, the professor added, though their impact is limited. Praise from LAPD chief Villaraigosa’s campaign additionally pointed to praise from current LAPD Chief Charlie Beck in a 2013 Los Angeles Daily News article. Beck was paraphrased in the article as saying the violent crime drop during Villaraigosa’s tenure was ""unprecedented."" Beck ""attributed it largely to the outgoing mayor’s steadfast commitment — even during the Great Recession — to expand the LAPD during his tenure,"" the article said. Beck said the mayor’s public safety strategy was effective, the article continued, ""because it also included diverting at-risk youth from gangs; recruiting gang members to prevent conflicts between rival gangs from flaring up; and handing out grocery store gift cards in exchange for guns."" LAPD statistics on gang crime during Villaraigosa’s tenure were not immediately available. In his statement on MSNBC, the former mayor specifically cited gang crime as one category of violent crime that had dropped. News articles generally back up this statement. An investigation by VICE News in 2015, however, sheds light on a more nuanced change in LA gang crime in recent years. It found that while ""gang crime is down in the city, many experts cautioned that gangs haven't disappeared."" ""Gang members and gangs altogether have gone underground, pure and simple,"" Jorja Leap, a UCLA professor who researches gangs and criminal justice, told VICE News. She noted that social media has allowed gang members to retreat indoors, and that they have become more involved in lucrative illicit activities such as human trafficking. ""They have not disappeared but become more knowledgeable."" Our ruling Villaraigosa’s claim about a nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime during his time as LA mayor is backed up by LAPD crime statistics. His explanation for why this drop in crime took place is more difficult to evaluate. Experts we spoke with noted that violent crime had been falling well before Villaraigosa took office. They also said that key factors that drive crime trends, such as the economy, changing demographics and incarceration rates, are largely out of the control of a mayor. Villaraigosa’s statement does not include this context.   Still, the mayor’s successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers and focus on community policing is generally accepted as having, at the very least, some impact on reducing crime in the city. Additionally, the current LAPD chief has praised Villaraigosa's strategies for reducing gang violence, saying they helped reduce violent crime. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.

Raleigh mayor says she debated opponent 'multiple times'
","Charles Francis wants to stand on stage with Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane and debate the best ways to address the city’s issues. Francis on Sunday called for a runoff against McFarlane after the mayor, in municipal elections on Oct. 10, fell about 2 percentage points short of reaching the 50 percent required to secure the win. Francis, who trailed with 36 percent of the vote, says the two candidates have yet to debate. McFarlane, reacting to Francis’ announcement, on Monday challenged the idea that they haven’t debated. ""We debated multiple times,"" McFarlane said. ""I’m not sure why he keeps bringing up this narrative that we’ve never debated. We had multiple forums. There were maybe five."" How can one candidate say he’s still waiting to debate while another says they’ve debated ""multiple times?"" Because they appear to have different definitions of the word ""debate."" Francis, an attorney, says McFarlane has declined his offer to stand on stage with him in a televised event where they argue the issues one-on-one. ""Debates are important so that voters can better see the clear alternative that they have in this race,"" he said in a statement. ""Mayor McFarlane has now tentatively agreed to a televised debate during the runoff election. I believe that this debate will point out the clear differences for voters to make an informed decision."" McFarlane, a longtime pharmaceutical business owner, considers it a debate if the two candidates are in the same location at the same time explaining their political positions to voters. Her campaign notes that Francis has twice referred to events they attended as debates: in closing comments during the Aug. 15 Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum; and on his Facebook page when he referred to a Sept. 28 forum as a debate. That may be true. But that doesn’t necessarily mean either candidate’s definition of ""debate"" is accurate. Defining debate Merriam-Webster defines ""debate"" as ""a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides"" and Dictionary.com says it’s ""a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints."" By those definitions, McFarlane certainly has a case. Both candidates have been in the same location at the same time answering the same questions. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonprofit group that has organized debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates in every general election since 1988. The commission doesn’t offer a definition for a ""debate"" or list requirements to hold one. Instead, it offers a wide range of formats that can be used in debates and suggests that political debates should be structured and allow for rebuttals. The aforementioned descriptions are so vague that they don’t necessarily help us in this situation. So we asked experts on political science, communication and forensics (which means debate) what they consider to be a true political debate. Key components They all suggested political debates include three elements: a stage, a large audience, and a format that allows for two candidates – and preferably no more – to engage each other in a way that allows for claims and rebuttals. The experts cast doubt on McFarlane’s claim that forums qualify as debates. Forums where candidates answer the same questions could qualify as debates if the candidates are given time to engage each other, said David McLennan, professor of political science at Meredith College in Raleigh. But typically, they don’t. ""Unless they’re addressing one another in the same venue, it wouldn’t be a political debate,"" McLennan said. Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University, researches argumentation theory, political communication and presidential rhetoric. Louden referred to forums not as debates but as ""joint appearances."" He says debates are supposed to inform the public about key policy differences between candidates and that, by allowing candidates to challenge each other, face-to-face arguments are the best way to do that. He noted that the size of the audience matters. Debates ""are not much good if you don’t have an audience."" Robert Imbody, director of forensics at the University of Alabama, said he doesn’t think any of the events qualify as a traditional political debate. He echoed McLennan and Louden in saying there’s got to be ""crossfire."" ""When we talk about what is a debate, we’re talking about an organized clash,"" Imbody said. ""‘If there’s no clash or discord, then there’s nothing to debate. You’re just giving speeches."" So let’s look at the events McFarlane and Francis attended together. McFarlane’s campaign says she and Francis attended seven events together between Aug. 15 and Sept. 28. Three stood out to PolitiFact. Raleigh events On Aug. 15, McFarlane and Francis both attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. James Sonneman, a spokesman for McFarlane’s campaign, said the mayoral candidates were interviewed separately from council candidates. ""During the mayoral portion, only Francis and Nancy participated and were given ample room to engage in a discussion regarding questions posed by community members,"" Sonneman said. The event was not televised or streamed online. A recording provided by Sonneman includes audio of McFarlane and Francis answering the same questions, one at a time, and occasionally asking the moderator for a chance to respond to the other candidate. In closing comments, Francis said, ""I want to thank you all for your attention in the debate tonight."" On Sept. 18, Sonneman says they attended a similar event: the Wake County Voter Education Coalition Forum at Garner Rd. Community Center. ""As I understand, it had a very similar agenda to the RWCA forum in that Mayoral and Council candidates went separately and that an engaging discussion between Nancy and Francis was fostered,"" he said. On Sept. 28, Francis and McFarlane attended a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters and WakeUP Wake County Forum at Avent Ferry United Methodist Church. The event, where mayoral and City Council candidates were asked the same questions, was streamed online at wral.com. The video shows McFarlane and Francis often taking turns answering the same question. In Monday’s press conference, McFarlane pointed to the WakeUP event as a debate. Karen Rindge, executive director of WakeUP, said the format allowed for the candidates to engage each other. ""They could have raised a point about their opponent if they chose,"" Rindge said. ""However, I would not describe our candidate forum as a structured debate."" Our ruling McFarlane said she has debated Francis ""multiple times."" The candidates were indeed in the same place and exchanged ideas back-to-back. And Francis referred to a couple forums as debates. But political experts say most of the events she’s referring to didn’t include the key elements often needed for a fair, informative political debate. So we rate this claim Half True.    ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F1680>],/factchecks/2017/oct/18/nancy-mcfarlane/raleigh-mayor-says-she-debated-opponent-multiple-t/
"['National', 'Taxes', 'Donald Trump']","
Once again, Trump overstates U.S. tax ranking
","As he presses for sweeping tax reform, President Donald Trump continues to paint the nation’s current tax burden in superlative colors. And he continues to struggle to get it right. In an interview, Mike Sacks, national political correspondent for E.W. Scripps, brought this up with Trump. Here’s that exchange: Sacks: ""You've repeatedly said that we're the highest taxed nation in the world when that's been seen as objectively false. With the credibility you need to pass tax reform, why --"" Trump: ""Some people say it differently, they say we're the highest developed nation taxed in the world."" Sacks: ""Then why don't you say it that way?"" Trump: ""Because a lot of people know exactly what i'm talking about, and in many cases they think I’m right when I say the highest. As far as I'm concerned I think we're really essentially the highest, but if you want to add the ‘developed nation,’ you can say that, too. But a lot of people agree that the way I'm saying it is exactly correct."" Does adding the ""developed nation"" label make the claim more accurate? No. When Trump has said before that America has the highest corporate tax rate, he’s on pretty firm ground and we’ve rated him Mostly True. The statutory tax rate for corporations is 35 percent, the highest among countries like Japan, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other European nations. Now to be clear, the tax rate on paper and the effective tax rate are two different things. Thanks to the thousands of deductions and exemptions in state and federal tax codes, according to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report, the effective average corporate tax is 22 percent. That puts the country in the middle of the pack among our economic peers. As for the tax burden across the board for individuals and companies alike, economists generally rely on a couple of yardsticks. One is the total tax burden compared to the size of the economy and the other is the tax burden per person. The most recent numbers come from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for 2015. The countries it compares include the group that are generally seen as ""developed nations."" As a percentage of GDP, the U.S. tax burden -- covering all levels of government -- ranks 28th out of 32 countries. We ran the numbers based on federal revenues alone, and the rankings stayed about the same. On a per-person basis, America ranks 13th out of 31 nations. We asked the White House if they had other numbers. We didn’t hear back, but if we do, we’ll update this fact-check. Trump said that the United States is ""the highest developed nation taxed in the world."" Looking at tax collections relative to the size of the U.S. economy and the number of people, the numbers tell a different story.
