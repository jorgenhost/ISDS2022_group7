Group makes bogus attack on HR 1 over congressional salaries
","Members of Congress already earn six-figure paychecks. A conservative group says that a Democratic-backed bill would allow them to earn a second paycheck worth even more.  But that’s bogus. The claim from Act for America pertains to H.R. 1, the For the People Act. The bill combines previous proposals that aim to make it easier to vote, and it changes campaign finance rules to help Americans who aren’t rich run for federal office. The House is expected to vote on the bill in March. Act for America wrote a plea for Congress to reject the bill. In a claim about proposals for the use of campaign funds, the group said that based on an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, ""members of Congress will be able to draw a SECOND salary from that money worth an estimated $600,000 per year!"" This would be ""on top of the generous taxpayer-funded paychecks and perks they already give themselves!"" the group said.  But there’s no such provision in the bill, and Act for America did not reply to our requests for evidence. After we inquired about the claims, we noticed that the webpage no longer included the $600,000 figure. Act for America calls itself the ""nation’s premier national security grassroots organization."" The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League say the group is anti-Muslim. The Campaign Legal Center, a group that supports H.R. 1, said that there is no provision in the bill to pay lawmakers $600,000. ""I’ve tried to figure it out, but I can’t find anything,"" said Brendan Fischer, the center’s director of federal reform. ""There are going to be some claims about H.R. 1 that are misstatements or statements of opinion, but these claims are just made up."" The Congressional Budget Office analysis of a previous version of the legislation also makes no mention of a ""second salary."" A section in the bill about ""personal use services"" states that candidates can use campaign money for child care, elder care or health insurance premiums so they can campaign, but the provision does not apply to incumbents.  The goal of this provision is to help Americans who aren’t rich to run for Congress. Many lawmakers are millionaires who have wealth and incomes above many of the residents they represent. Current federal law bans candidates from using campaign funds for personal use. The Federal Election Commission, which can rule on whether an expense is legitimate, has given the go-ahead in recent years for candidates to use campaign funds for child care. H.R. 1 doesn’t change a longstanding policy that allows non-incumbent federal candidates to use campaign funds to pay themselves a salary. The salary has to be whatever is less: the candidate’s income for the previous year or $174,000, which is what current members of Congress earn. In 2002, the FEC voted to allow candidates running for Congress or president to pay themselves a salary using campaign funds. When commissioner Michael Toner, a Republican, sponsored the measure, he said, ""candidates of modest means too often have been crowded out of running for office. It may allow people like blue-collar workers, schoolteachers and others who don't make six-figure salaries to run for office.''  But candidates rarely pay themselves a salary. The Center for Public Integrity found that 22 candidates running for Congress collectively paid themselves $155,000 during the 2018 election cycle.  FreeRoots, the hosting platform where Act for America posted its message, responded to an inquiry from PolitiFact, but did not provide any evidence that members of Congress would be able to draw a second salary worth up to $600,000.  Act for America said H.R. 1 will allow members of Congress to draw a second salary ""worth an estimated $600,000 per year!"" We found nothing in the legislation that would allow members of Congress to earn a second salary. There is a provision that allows non-incumbent candidates to use campaign funds to pay for expenses such as child care so they are able to run for office.  H.R. 1 does not change an existing policy that allows candidates to draw a salary of up to $174,000 from campaign funds. That policy doesn’t apply to those who are already in Congress. We rate this statement False.

No, Biden is not separating families entering the country
","Conservative pundit Glenn Beck wrongly claimed on Twitter that President Joe Biden’s administration was doing the same thing that the Trump administration was rebuked for: separating families at the southwest border. Here’s what Beck tweeted Feb. 23: ""Just for the record, the Biden Administration IS separating children and parents, and building trailer park cages to hold those children. Where is the outrage from the left. We will interpret your silence as confirmation you never actually cared about kids ‘in cages.’"" Just for the record, the Biden Administration IS separating children and parents, and building trailer park cages to hold those children. Where is the outrage from the left. We will interpret your silence as confirmation you never actually cared about kids ‘in cages.’ @AOC https://t.co/gHFse4ZGfX Beck’s tweet tagged Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who spoke out against the family separations during the Trump administration. It also included a link to a Washington Post story — which did not report what Beck claimed. An increasing number of unaccompanied children are arriving at the southern border and being put in temporary custody. From October to January, U.S. Border Patrol reported encounters with about 20,000 unaccompanied children at the southern border. For context, there were about 33,000 such encounters from Oct. 1, 2019, through Sept. 30, 2020. Typically, children are placed in state-licensed shelters. But due to space constraints at shelters during the coronavirus pandemic, the Biden administration has begun placing some of these children at a temporary facility in Texas. That decision has been criticized by immigrant advocates and people in Biden’s party who say that such temporary facilities are not suitable. Beck’s tweet was wrong on a major point: These children were not separated from their parents at the border. They arrived alone. Biden’s administration rescinded the Trump-era policy that led to systematic family separations. He established a task force to reunite families that were separated under the Trump administration. PolitiFact reached out to Beck through his website and Twitter but did not hear back. Children who arrive at the border without a parent or legal guardian are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of U.S. Health and Human Services. That office is responsible for their temporary care until they are placed with a sponsor, who is usually a parent or close relative in the U.S. HHS reopened a temporary facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas, to respond to the influx of unaccompanied children and comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, such as social distancing. (That site was also used for about a month in mid 2019.) The Washington Post story that Beck cited was about this facility, which is housing children ages 13 to 17. ""Youth who have traveled to the U.S. alone are being placed in this shelter while case managers can locate family or sponsors in the U.S.,"" says a sign outside the facility. Both Amnesty International USA and Kids in Need of Defense, an advocacy group for unaccompanied migrant and refugee children in the U.S., urged the Biden administration to move children out of the temporary facility and into the homes of vetted sponsors or licensed shelters. ""Temporary facilities are an imperfect stopgap solution,"" said Denise Bell, a researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA. Beck’s tweet said that children were being held in ""trailer park cages,"" and he cited a Washington Post tweet that had a picture of portable buildings, or trailers. HHS told PolitiFact that the structures depicted are ""portable offices equipped with air conditioning, paneling, tile flooring, table and chairs, telephones, computers and video conferencing capability."" The portable offices are used by attorneys and mental health clinicians providing services to minors, HHS said. According to HHS, the Carrizo Springs facility has ""soft-sided structures'' — rigid frame structures with a canvas-like covering — used in areas for taking in children when they arrive, dining and indoor recreation, and serious health care needs. Dorms, classrooms, health care clinics, the barbershop and hair salon are inside buildings, HHS said. Beck said, ""Just for the record, the Biden Administration IS separating children and parents."" Beck linked to a Washington Post article that does not corroborate his claims about family separations. Immigrant rights groups and the federal agency that takes temporary custody of immigrant children said that they were not separated from their parents, they arrived unaccompanied.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Pennsylvania', 'Tom  Wolf']","
Fact-checking Gov. Tom Wolf’s statement that Pa. is the only state without a natural gas severance t
","Gov. Tom Wolf this week pushed for a severance tax on natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to help finance infrastructure improvements and a plan he hopes will put residents who lost their jobs in the pandemic back to work. He touted the proposed tax by describing Pennsylvania as an outlier in taxing natural gas drilling.  ""We’re the only major gas-producing state in the U.S. that doesn’t have a severance tax,"" he said, referring to a tax on raw materials extracted from the ground. We wondered if that’s true.  Wolf is right. Among the 34 states that produce oil or natural gas, Pennsylvania is the only one that doesn’t tax the extracted resources. (They’re called ""severance"" taxes because they tax materials severed from the ground.) Instead, Pennsylvania charges an annual impact fee for every gas well that’s drilled.  The difference between the taxes levied by other big natural gas producers like Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, and the fee Pennsylvania charges is the revenue they generate.  The left-leaning Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center has estimated that while the state’s impact fee will continue generating up to $227 million a year, a severance tax could bring in an additional $1.7 billion over five years.  The particulars of the severance taxes imposed elsewhere vary by state.  For example, Texas charges a 7.5% tax on the market value of oil and natural gas extracted within its borders. Oklahoma charges 7% of the gross value of oil and gas production, in addition to a fee on new wells drilled. Louisiana’s gas severance tax rate adjusts annually but never falls below 7%.  Wolf first proposed a severance tax on natural gas drilling when he ran for governor in 2014, and he pitched one with the budget each of his first four years in office. All those efforts failed, so in 2019, after winning reelection, he tried a new approach — a tax whose revenue would be earmarked for infrastructure projects. But that effort stalled, too.  At issue is the widely held belief among lawmakers from Southwestern Pennsylvania — where much of the state’s natural gas fracturing, or ""fracking,"" takes place — that a severance tax would cripple an important industry in the state.  One Republican lawmaker from Beaver County recently told the Beaver County Times that Wolf’s latest attempt to impose a severance tax on natural gas production would be ""dead on arrival"" in the Republican-controlled state House. Even Democrats who represent the region have called Wolf’s tax ""misguided.""  Wolf said Pennsylvania is ""the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn’t have a severance tax."" That’s correct. Pennsylvania does not tax the materials extracted from the ground, as many other gas-producing states do. We rate Wolf’s statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCAA980>],/factchecks/2021/feb/25/tom-wolf/fact-checking-gov-tom-wolfs-statement-pa-only-stat/

No, Biden didn’t cancel a child sex ring operation started by Trump
","President Joe Biden’s early actions in office have generated plenty of false claims. A new one circulating on social media criticizes the commander in chief for supposedly doing away with a Trump-era investigative operation into child sex rings. ""Biden cancels Trump’s child sex ring operation which saw thousands of arrests last year. Why would he do that?"" the Facebook post reads. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not clear what the post is referencing. But we know that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently postponed a program known as ""Operation Talon,"" which was created to target undocumented immigrants with known criminal activity related to sex offenses. The operation’s focus was not only on child sex-related crimes, and there’s no evidence it amassed thousands of arrests in 2020, as the post claims. That’s because Operation Talon was initiated in the final weeks of Trump’s administration. ICE in early February shelved the program, one of a number of actions that signaled a shift in enforcement plans as it awaited guidance from newly appointed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. An agency spokesperson said that the Biden administration had nothing to do with the suspension. It’s unclear whether or when Operation Talon will be operational. Operation Talon was meant to target immigrants who are in the country without legal immigration status and who had pending criminal charges with known criminal activity related to sex offenses. It was a new effort under the agency’s Sex Offender Alien Removal initiative, or SOAR. That initiative is still ongoing, and ICE also investigates sex offenses involving U.S. citizens and noncitizens through its Homeland Security Investigations division.  There is no evidence that Operation Talon was up and running, let alone that it had managed to make ""thousands"" of arrests in 2020, as the Facebook post claims, given that it was created just weeks before Biden took office. Claims that Biden canceled the program appear to have started after a Washington Post story examined some forthcoming changes that the agency announced Feb. 18.  A Facebook post says Biden canceled a child sex ring operation that started under Trump and saw ""thousands of arrests last year.""  This isn’t accurate. Operation Talon was not focused on child sex offenders; it was created to target immigrants in the country illegally who were convicted of sex crimes. It was put on pause by ICE officials as the agency awaits new operating guidelines from the Biden new administration.  The agency still investigates sex offenses through its Sex Offender Alien Removal initiative, or SOAR,"" and through its Homeland Security Investigations division. There’s no evidence that the program, which was said to have started weeks before Trump left office, was already in operation or responsible for thousands of arrests.  We rate this False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF66300>],/factchecks/2021/feb/25/facebook-posts/no-biden-didnt-cancel-child-sex-ring-operation-sta/

Is Illinois outpacing other large states on vaccinations this month?
","Illinois kicked off February with one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, fueling frustration among many over the program’s sluggish start. Nearly three weeks later, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state was making progress thanks to increased supply from the federal government and the efforts of local health departments: ""As a result, for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country,"" Pritzker said in a prerecorded video address, which aired Feb. 17. Has Illinois come as far on vaccinations this month as the governor claimed? We found Pritzker's statement was supported by one metric measured over a few days, but glossed over an otherwise spotty vaccination record. There are many yardsticks to measure states’ progress getting their residents vaccinated against COVID-19. Illinois performs well on some metrics this month but still ranks low on others. Illinois started off the month 43rd in the nation for total doses administered when adjusted for population, according to Our World in Data, a University of Oxford-based project that has been tracking vaccine statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the time Pritzker’s address aired, the state had improved to 34th nationally — and sixth place when only the 10 most populous states are considered. The state is also performing better on a different metric: the share of residents that have received at least one dose of the vaccine. By Feb. 17, Illinois had taken a narrow lead over the other nine most populous states, and it has occupied first, second or third place in that group each day since. That measurement goes hand in hand with another, though: the share of people fully vaccinated. There, Illinois ranked last among the 10 largest states — and has continued to rank at or near the bottom nationally each day. Experts say it’s tricky to compare states on this measure, however, due to differences in state policies on how much vaccine to earmark for second doses. Given these mixed results, we reached out to the governor’s office to find out what Pritzker was referencing when he said Illinois was the ""vaccination leader"" this month among large states. Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said that, per capita, Illinois leads the most populous states in vaccinations administered in February — and has done so ""for the vast majority"" of the month. Experts said it is fair to compare states based on the total doses administered and adjusted for population. They were split, however, on whether it makes sense to focus on a few weeks in February. Hemi Tewarson, a senior fellow at the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the February snapshot might be helpful to show recent improvement after a sluggish start because of issues outside state control, such as delays with the federal pharmacy partnership program created to vaccinate those in nursing homes. ""If they started out slow back in December or early January, it's hard to catch up,"" she said. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that while month-to-month data is important for gauging a state’s progress internally, it’s not as useful for making comparisons because it doesn’t provide a full picture of a state’s vaccine rollout. Regardless, by Pritzker’s metric Illinois’ lead among large states on total doses administered per capita in February amounted to just a few days out of the month, based on our analysis of CDC figures catalogued by Our World in Data. To support Pritzker’s claim, Abudayyeh sent us a screenshot of a spreadsheet containing figures she said the governor’s office had taken from the CDC’s COVID-19 vaccination tracker. The spreadsheet compares how many doses were administered from Jan. 31 through Feb. 11 per 100,000 residents in the 10 most populous states. Those numbers could not be directly verified because the CDC’s tracker only makes available a current cumulative total on each day. So to check the governor’s figures we turned to Our World in Data again, which makes previous days’ CDC tallies available for users to download. Those numbers matched the governor’s analysis. Day to day, however, Illinois claimed first place three times out of the first 11 days of the month, hardly the ""vast majority"" of February as Pritzker’s spokeswoman claimed. The state’s lead was narrow, and by the time the governor’s address aired, Illinois had fallen back to second place behind Florida. So Priztker’s claim was accurate as of Feb. 12, the last day of his office’s analysis. It was not accurate when his speech first aired five days later. Pritzker said that ""for the month of February, Illinois has been the vaccination leader among the 10 most populous states in the country."" There are many different ways to measure how states compare when it comes to vaccinating residents against COVID-19. On some, Illinois ranks high and on others it ranks low. Pritzker’s office pointed to one very specific metric: total doses administered per capita during the month of February alone. The key issue with Pritzker’s claim is that Illinois only took the lead on that metric for a handful of days prior to the governor’s prerecorded address — and had already fallen back to second place by the time it aired. We rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

No, Capitol security is not only Pelosi’s responsibility, but she bears some
","More than six weeks after supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, posts spread on Facebook claiming that one person was to blame: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. One widely shared post claimed in all capital letters: ""ONLY ONE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAPITOL ON 6 JANUARY — ‘NANCY PELOSI’ — SECURITY AT THE CAPITOL IS HER JOB!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post echoes the sentiment in a Feb. 15 letter to Pelosi from four top GOP House members. It suggested the California Democrat was at least partly at fault, asserting that ""the Speaker is responsible for all operational decisions made within the House.""  The post is wrong: Security at the 1.5 million-square-foot U.S. Capitol building does not fall solely to the speaker. Though Pelosi does have a role in the hierarchy overseeing security, there is no indication she controls its day-to-day operations. Capitol security is provided by the sergeants-at-arms , who are the chief law enforcement officers for the House and Senate, in coordination with the Capitol Police, a federal law enforcement agency. The House sergeant-at-arms reports to the speaker of the House, or Pelosi at the time of the attack. The Senate sergeant-at-arms reports to the Senate majority leader; in the days leading up to and including Jan. 6, that was Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell.  Security of the Capitol Complex is the direct responsibility of the four-member Capitol Police Board, which includes both sergeants-at-arms, said Jane Campbell, president and CEO of the United States Capitol Historical Society. On Jan. 6, a joint session of Congress was held in the House chamber to officially count the electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election. The proceedings were interrupted by a mob protesting the election results that showed Joe Biden winning over then-President Donald Trump. The attack left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer, whose death the following day is still under investigation. Former House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving resigned after the attack, as did former Senate sergeant-at-arms Michael Stenger and Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund. Irving told Sund ahead of the riot that he did not want National Guard troops at the Capitol on Jan. 6 because of bad ""optics,"" the Washington Post and the New York Times reported. In Feb. 23 testimony before lawmakers, Irving said that ""optics"" did not play a role in his decision. He said he, Stenger and Sund agreed the intelligence they received didn't warrant the troops. The Times reported that at 1:09 p.m. on the day of the attack, minutes after protesters had burst through the barricades and began using the steel debris to assault the officers, Sund asked Irving for help from the National Guard. Irving called Sund back an hour later and said congressional leaders had approved the request; the article does not identify the leaders. But another hour passed before Defense Secretary Christopher Miller gave final approval to the request. In his testimony, Irving said he didn’t recall receiving a call from Sund until shortly before 2 p.m. Sund testified that the call was made shortly after 1 p.m. The delay in deploying the National Guard was caused by communication breakdowns, inaction and confusion over who had authority to call for the National Guard, the Times analysis found. Pelosi called for an independent 9/11-type commission to review and investigate the Capitol attack. She also tapped retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré to investigate security failures that day. McConnell has blasted Pelosi’s proposal as ""partisan by design."" A widely shared Facebook post claimed that only Pelosi is ""responsible for what happened at the Capitol"" on Jan. 6, ""security at the Capitol is her job."" Responsibility for Capitol security is shared, it is not solely the responsibility of the Speaker.  Security is provided by the sergeant-at-arms of the House, the sergeant-at-arms of the Senate and the Capitol Police. The House  sergeant-at-arms reports to the House speaker, Pelosi. The Senate sergeant-at-arms reports to the Senate majority leader, then McConnell. The Capitol Police is overseen by a four-member board that includes both sergeants-at-arms. News reports indicate that before the attack, the House sergeant-at-arms resisted calls from the Capitol Police to bring in the National Guard for extra security at the Capitol because of ""optics,"" but he said intelligence reports didn’t warrant the extra security. The chain of command for Capitol security does include Pelosi, but it does not fall solely to her as this post claims. Others in the chain of command include the Senate majority leader and the Capitol police chief.

Misleading video takes Pelosi out of context on smear tactics
","Social media users are claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted she used smear tactics to demonize political opponents. According to these users, a YouTube video even shows her saying so in her very own words.  The video, an excerpt from a June 22, 2017, press briefing, began circulating in 2018 after allegations of sexual assault dominated Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. Conservative activist groups, pundits and conspiracy outlets all asserted that it showed Pelosi describing the ""smear"" tactics that Democrats had used on Kavanaugh.  More recent posts have claimed that the clip shows Pelosi describing the tactics Democrats used to attack former President Donald Trump. Here’s why you shouldn’t believe these claims: The video takes Pelosi out of context and misleadingly captions her remarks, making it seem like she’s explaining a political tactic called the ""wrap-up smear"" that she and other Democrats have deployed in the past. ""It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Pelosi says in the clip, which has been viewed on YouTube more than 60,000 times. ""You demonize, and then you — we call it the wrap-up smear. You want to talk about politics? It’s called the wrap-up smear. You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest, and then you merchandise it, and then you write it, and they’ll say ‘See, it’s reported in the press that this, this, this and this,’ so they have that validation that the press reported the smear, and then it’s called a wrap-up smear. ‘Now I’m going to merchandise the press’s report on the smear that we made.’ It’s a tactic, and it’s self-evident."" The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because the clip cuts out both the question that Pelosi was responding to and the first part of her remarks. A longer version of the video shows that Pelosi was accusing Republicans of using the ""wrap-up smear"" against Democrats running for office in the 2018 midterms. She was not laying out a blueprint of how to smear Republican opponents.    Here’s a transcript of the relevant passage from Pelosi’s press briefing, complete with the question she was answering when she made her ""wrap-up smear"" comment.  Reporter: ""Is it worth it to try and I guess like rehab your image in some of these Republican districts, which would sort of present what you’ve done, or are you guys more focused on just–"" Pelosi: ""Well, people say to me all the time, ‘you raise more money than anybody,’ maybe not the Obamas and the Clintons, but I’ve not run for president. ‘Why don’t you spend some of your money on yourself? Go out there and say what you did, this, this and this.’ But you know, it’s just not… Maybe I should, but the fact is, what I want to do is have these members present themselves. Because basically at the end of the day that’s what people are interested in — their representative and what their representative is going to do for their district. Republicans are afraid of that contrast in a race. Because they’re going to go there to be involved in trickle-down economics, shutting down hospitals, and the rest of it. So they don’t want them to see that contrast, so they focus on something else. And it’s a diversionary tactic. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. You demonize, and then you — we call it the wrap-up smear. You want to talk about politics? It’s called the wrap-up smear. You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest, and then you merchandise it, and then you write it, and they’ll say ""See, it’s reported in the press that this, this, and this,"" so they have that validation that the press reported the smear, and then it’s called a wrap-up smear. ""Now I’m going to merchandise the press’s report on the smear that we made."" It’s a tactic, and it’s self-evident."" This was not the first time that Pelosi spoke disapprovingly of the ""wrap-up smear."" In a March 6, 2017, interview on CNN, Pelosi accused Trump of using ""wrap-up smears"" against former President Barack Obama.  A YouTube video appears to show Pelosi describing how to demonize political opponents through a tactic called the ""wrap-up smear.""

Fox Nation host’s unsupported claim that helicopters sprayed oil on frozen Texas wind turbines
","As Fox News broadcasters pushed the misleading narrative that frozen wind turbines were to blame for Texas’ crippled energy system, Fox Nation host Lara Logan suggested that fossil fuels were coming to the rescue. Helicopters, she claimed, were spraying turbines with oil to defrost them. ""The reality is here that you’re flying helicopters, using fossil fuels, to put oil on wind turbines to defrost them,"" Logan said Feb. 19 on the Fox News program ""Outnumbered."" Logan’s claim echoed online rumors, widely debunked, that claimed a photo showed a helicopter spraying chemicals on a frozen wind turbine in Texas.  ""Oh the irony,"" said one of many Facebook posts sharing the photo. The post featured a screenshot of a tweet that read: ""A helicopter running on fossil fuel spraying a chemical made from fossil fuels onto a wind turbine made with fossils fuels during an ice storm is awesome."" The photo, from years ago, actually shows a helicopter defrosting a turbine with hot water in Sweden. ""This is our helicopter back in 2015,"" Mats Widgren of Alpine Helicopters, the Swedish company responsible for the photo, told the Associated Press. The same photo appeared in Swedish news articles from that year, and also in two separate Alpine Helicopters presentations on airborne de-icing methods for wind turbines. The Swedish company heated the water with an oil burner, but it did not spray chemicals. Despite those facts, social media posts claiming the photo showed Texas spread widely. They were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A viral tweet wrongly claimed that an image showed a helicopter spraying chemicals on a frozen wind turbine in Texas. Logan did not cite any evidence to support her own claim, which asserted more broadly that helicopters were being flown in Texas to defrost ice-coated wind turbines with oil. But PolitiFact found no proof that such a practice was taking place in Texas. Fox News did not offer comment for this fact-check. A spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages more than 90% of the state’s electric load, said she had not heard of such rumors until PolitiFact reached out. While frozen wind turbine blades can be manually de-iced, the extreme weather would have made it difficult to do so in Texas, where several airports were closed during the storm, said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute. ""No one I’ve asked in the Texas wind industry has heard of any aircraft de-icing of wind turbine blades,"" said Krane, who recently wrote about the need to winterize Texas’ energy system. ""Most wind turbines here don’t have any de-icing equipment, since it’s rare to have need for them here,"" added Daniel Cohan, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Rice University, and a colleague of Krane’s. RWE Renewables Americas operates more than a dozen wind farms in Texas. Its Roscoe Wind Farm, a few hours west of Fort Worth, has more than 600 turbines. The company said Feb. 18 that icing and grid issues put part of its onshore wind fleet out of service. But spokesperson Matt Tulis denied using helicopters in the way Logan described. ""We are not using helicopters to spray oil on our turbines to defrost them,"" Tulis told PolitiFact. ""We don’t apply any kind of de-icing agent to the turbine or turbine blades."" Turbines in places that regularly see low temperatures are often designed to withstand the cold. Some have ice-resistant coatings or heaters built into the blades.  Those technologies used elsewhere in the world allow wind turbines to produce electricity at temperatures as low as 22 degrees below zero, Krane and his colleagues at the Baker Institute wrote for Forbes. But they make turbines pricier. Manual de-icing, which can be done by aircraft-based sprayers or by technicians who climb up the turbine towers, can involve chemicals, Krane and his team wrote in the article. After a rare blast of Arctic air hit Texas, Fox News hosts repeatedly claimed that frozen wind turbines were solely or mostly to blame for the power outages around the state. But experts and state energy officials said early on that the crisis was largely due to problems at thermal power plants, including those powered by natural gas. ""Wind’s failure was a small part of the overall Texas blackout,"" Krane said. Krane told PolitiFact that it shouldn’t be unexpected for renewable energy sources to rely on fossil fuels, which remain the main source of energy in the U.S.  ""Avoiding their use, even in renewable power generation, is impossible,"" Krane said. Logan said, ""The reality is here (in Texas) that you’re flying helicopters using fossil fuels to put oil on wind turbines to defrost them."" Logan’s claim resembled debunked claims that said an image showed a helicopter spraying chemicals on a wind turbine in Texas. The image was actually taken years ago in Sweden. Aircraft-based sprays are one way to manually defrost turbines that haven’t been winterized, but experts we consulted said they hadn’t heard of that practice being used in Texas. One company that runs several wind farms in Texas said it isn’t using helicopters to spray oil on its turbines. The burden of proof is on the speaker, and Logan provided none.

","Since landing on Mars on Feb. 18, NASA’s Perseverance rover has beamed images from the planet back to Earth.

Brent Europe was last in the $25 range on May 11, 2020, when it was $25.53.

Mitt Romney ad charges Obama said, 'If we keep talking about the economy, we’re going to lose'
","
On the eve of a presidential trip to New Hampshire on Nov. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney’s campaign released an ad targeting President Barack Obama. In the ad, the Romney campaign used a quote that prompted an immediate counterattack from the Obama camp, which argued that it had been taken out of context.

The 60-second ad, called ""Believe in America,"" is designed to contrast ""candidate Obama from 2008 with President Obama of today,"" highlighting ""his failures in between,"" according to the Romney campaign.

The ad contrasts a 2008 campaign speech by Obama with text on the screen that criticizes Obama’s economic record, including, ""Greatest Jobs Crisis Since Great Depression,"" ""Record Home Foreclosures"" and ""Record National Debt.""

The ad then has a clip of Obama saying,""If we keep talking about the economy, we’re going to lose.""

The clear implication is that Obama believes that his economic record is so bad that he will lose in 2012 unless he can steer the conversation away from the economy.

But the Obama camp, among others, immediately charged that the clip was taken out of context. Was it?

Here’s what Obama said in the October 2008 speech, which came about two weeks before he defeated Sen. John McCain:

""Even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time, even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes, my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to ‘turn the page’ on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead,"" Obama said in the speech. ""Sen. McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, ‘If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.’""

So the comment is drastically different than the way it's portrayed in the Romney ad. Obama was actually saying that his opponent’s campaign three years earlier had said, ""If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."" That context is not included in the Romney ad -- and leaving it out sends a profoundly different message.

The Romney camp seems to have anticipated this complaint. In a blog post published around the time the ad was released, Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho acknowledged that, ""Three years ago, candidate Barack Obama mocked his opponent’s campaign for saying, ‘If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.’"" She went on to say Obama is trying to distract voters from his economic record.

Our ruling

We certainly think it’s fair for Romney to attack Obama for his response to the economy. And the Romney camp can argue that Obama’s situation in 2011 is ironic considering the comments he made in 2008. But those points could have been made without distorting Obama’s words, which have been taken out of context in a ridiculously misleading way. We rate the Romney ad’s portrayal of Obama’s 2008 comments Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9B92400>],/factchecks/2011/nov/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-said-if-we-keep-talking-abo/

Republican lawmakers classified pizza as a vegetable for school lunches, Democrats say
","
You may have heard the uproar by now: ""Pizza is not a vegetable!""

Democrats used the rallying cry in a mass e-mail Nov. 17, 2011, alerting partisans that, ""House Republicans are ramming through legislation this week to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches.""

We wondered: Pizza as a vegetable? We had heard rumblings on social networks about magical pizza seeds and pizza gardens — all in response to Congress' action — and we had to know. Was it true?

Here's more from Democrats' message: 
Then it linked to a message for folks to send from MyDemocrats.org/Pizza. (The message: ""Dear House Republicans, Pizza is not a vegetable. Sincerely, America."") 
We could have a lot of fun with this.

We asked the source of the e-mail, Brad Woodhouse at the Democratic National Committee, to back up his statement. 
He sent us a CBS News/Associated Press article from Nov. 15, 2011, ""Congress pushes back on healthier school lunches."" The topic? A spending bill that forces the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ignore a proposed change from the Obama administration about how to credit tomato paste. (Congress simply won't fund implementation of the new rule.) The House and Senate both approved the bill Nov. 17, and the president signed it the next day.

The new law doesn't mention pizza.

What it does is allow just two tablespoons of tomato paste to continue to count as a serving of vegetables. The USDA had proposed requiring a full half-cup of the concentrated tomato spread before it would count as a fruit or veggie — a standard ""serving"" by volume — far more than you'd find slathered on a slice o' school cafeteria pizza. 

(And, yes, we're aware the tomato is technically a fruit. The federal regulations cover both fruits and vegetables, but most folks in this debate are referring to tomatoes as vegetables. Just roll with it.)

How crazy is considering tomato paste on a pizza as a vegetable? One Washington Post Wonkblog reporter said that it's not as nuts as you might think. Sarah Kliff pointed out that two tablespoons of tomato paste offer up a nutritional profile comparable to a half-cup of apples or other fresh fruit. It offers more than a gram each of fiber and protein and more calcium and potassium than the apples.

It also packs beta carotene and the antioxidant lycopene, according the the USDA.

We should also note that the slices kids get at school aren't exactly the greasy, meat-laden marvels they might pick up at a pizza parlor. Federal nutrition standards require that school meals get no more than 30 percent of their calories from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. Schwan Food Co., which makes 70 percent of school-lunch pizza, started adding protein and whole grains to crusts and pushing down fat and salt to meet school standards.

Not to mention, if that slice doesn't have at least two tablespoons of tomato paste on it, it's not going to fly. No creamy white or pesto pizza gets automatic credit. (Well, unless that pesto's made from enough basil or spinach ... but we digress.)

Still, Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director for Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a Nov. 15 press release that, ""if finalized, this legislation may go down in nutritional history as a bigger blunder than when the Reagan Administration tried (but failed) to credit ketchup as a vegetable in the school lunch program. Pizza should be served with a vegetable, not count as one.""

She's right that if the tomato paste didn't count as a serving of vegetables, kids would benefit from tomato-paste-covered pizza plus an additional serving of a vegetable.

But is this the great Reagan ketchup debacle?

The same amount of ketchup, according to the USDA, sneaks in about 10 times the sodium, contains just a third of the protein, less than a tenth of the fiber and more carbs and sugar. It offers smaller traces of vitamins, and half the beta carotene and lycopene. Tomato paste is not ketchup.

Still, frozen pizza manufacturers and the frozen food industry did push hard to keep the vegetable designation for the tomato paste on the pizza. When it does, that's one less vegetable the school has to buy and a cheaper deal for school districts. 
Fewer vegetables for kids may not be exactly a win for America. But did House Republicans try ""to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches""? They did fight for the classification for the sauce on the pizza and blocked a move by the Obama administration to boost the amount of tomato paste needed to count as a serving of vegetables. But they didn't try to classify ""pizza"" as a vegetable. And even the amount of tomato paste required, just two tablespoons, packs nearly the nutritional punch of a half-cup of other foods we consider healthy. That's a pretty important detail to omit. We call the Democrats' claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA52F40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/22/democratic-national-committee/republicans-pizza-vegetable-school-lunch/

Rick Perry says he's sent more than $400 million to the border for Ranger recon teams
","As he campaigns for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks often of his experience in directing security dollars and operations along the Texas/Mexico border. Repeatedly in the first three months of his bid for the White House, Perry has mentioned sending $400 million to the border.

Sometimes he states it broadly; e.g., ""a total of $400 million of state security operations."" But often, he pegs the amount to a force he helped create in 2009: Texas Ranger Reconnaissance Teams.

At an Oct. 1, 2011, event in Hampton, N.H., Perry said, ""I have sent over $400 million to the border of Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger recon teams."" He’s used such a formulation at least three times since he entered the race in September -- including onstage at the Sept. 12 GOP debate -- so we decided to dig in.

Rewind: On Sept. 10, 2009, Perry announced the recent creation of Ranger Reconnaissance Teams that he said would operate in high-traffic, high-crime areas along the Texas-Mexico border -- a move he described as the state’s latest effort to fill gaps left by the federal government’s ""failure to adequately secure"" the border. Perry said the recon teams would be ""individuals that can stay on the move. We can stay one jump ahead of the cartels and beat them at their own game.""

According to a subsequent Department of Public Safety report, the teams were being used for ""emergencies and other situations that require a specialized law enforcement response ...  to locations throughout the state to"" head off or deal with ""criminal or terrorist incidents that could impact public safety."" The report also says the teams are trained in tracking, night-vision equipment, air operations and surveillance; can operate for extended periods in remote, rugged areas; and can include National Guard counter-drug and other personnel.

More details proved hard to come by. An Aug. 26, 2010, Associated Press news story says the DPS declined to share mission reports, citing operational security.

And what about Perry’s proclaimed $400 million for those boots on the ground?

Perry’s campaign and his state office provided budget figures indicating that he signed into law nearly $415 million in spending on border security covering September 2005 through August 2013, meaning fiscal years 2006 through 2013. Lucy Nashed in Perry’s state office directed us to the agencies that received the appropriations for details.

Most of the money flows through DPS, and agency spokesman Tom Vinger gave us figures indicating that Texas allocated border security funds for 2006-13 (with the 2011-13 amounts being estimated) totaling $475.6 million, and spent $462.1 million.

That amount is spread over a wide range of border operations, not just Ranger recon.

Legislative Budget Board spokesman John Barton found us figures for the totals spent on Ranger border security operations in 2009 ($0.4 million) and 2010-11 ($2.6 million). Of that, Barton said, $1.8 million was spent in 2010-11 to create 10 Ranger recon team positions.

According to state budgets, there were no dollars appropriated specifically for border operations by Rangers in 2006-07; such appropriations in subsequent years were: 2008-09: $982,595 for five officers’ salaries and costs. 2010-11: $2.8 million -- $1.8 million for 10 new Ranger positions; $1 million for five officers’ salaries and costs. 2012-13: From $38.9 million in border security funds and $48.9 million in local border security, an unspecified amount for Ranger positions. 
The State Auditor’s Office said in a 2009 report that as of Nov. 30, 2008, Texas had spent just over half the dollars set aside for border security in 2006-09 -- that is, $79 million of the $142.3 million appropriated in those two budgets. However, the audit says, between $7.6 million and  $10 million was spent outside the border on officers, new vehicles, radio security devices and a helicopter.

So although more than $140 million was targeted for border security in 2006-2009 budgets, not all made it to the border. Spokesman Michael Stiernberg told us the auditor’s office has not examined more recent spending.

Let’s tote up what we have. Texas has spent more than $1.8 million on Ranger recon teams, but well below $400 million. So when Perry uses a formulation like ""$400 million … in the form of Ranger recon teams,"" he’s way off.

As we closed out this research, Nashed said Perry consistently says the $400 million was spent on border security overall, but at the Hampton stop, he left out some of what that spending has covered.

We agree. And while we could not pin precisely how much has been spent on the border reconnaissance teams, we’re comfortable concluding it’s nowhere near the $400 million aired by the governor.

"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'D.A. King']","
Did Rick Perry propose a bi-national health care plan with Mexico?
","
The term ""Obamacare"" is used by critics to describe the health care overhaul that President Barack Obama signed into law last year.

And some conservatives derisively use the phrase ""Romneycare"" to slight Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and the changes he approved to Massachusetts’ health care system when he was governor there.

How about ""Perrycare""? That’s Georgia anti-illegal immigration activist D.A. King’s term for what he contends was an effort by Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry to impose a binational health care plan between his state and Mexico. King even has a website dedicated to highlight Perry’s stance on immigration issues.

King is one of the most vocal voices in Georgia’s ongoing debate over illegal immigration.

""Granting instate tuition to illegals is only a small part of Perry’s problematic record,"" King, president of the Dustin Inman Society, which is opposed to open borders between the U.S. and Mexico, wrote in a recent op-ed to the Marietta Daily Journal. ""We noted that Perry had dismissed any consideration of a state immigration enforcement law such as Arizona, Georgia and other states struggled to put in place; had proposed a binational health insurance program with Mexico (Perrycare?); has expressed his support for legalizing the fugitive illegals who have escaped capture at American borders (it’s not amnesty, it’s a guest worker plan!); and refused to use the power of his office for any E-Verify legislation in Texas. So what if that state has one of the highest number of illegals in the country?""

King made a number of points, but we decided to look at the Perrycare charge because the presidential candidate’s immigration policy has come up in a number of other forums.

Some Perry critics describe him as being soft on illegal immigration because of his position on allowing students who are illegal immigrants to pay instate tuition at colleges in Texas. The criticism has hurt Perry’s standing among some Republicans. So we wondered if King had found another case in which Perry could be criticized as soft on illegal immigrants.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas recently examined this issue when another GOP presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, said Perry supported binational health insurance. Santorum’s claim was rated Half True.

King dismissed the PolitiFact Texas ruling, forwarding us an e-mail with a widely circulated speech by Perry on the issue. The Texas governor urged lawmakers there to pass a telemedicine program that allows ""individuals living on the Mexican side of the border"" to get care from a specialist hundreds of miles away. Telemedicine is using forms of communication such as video conferences to provide health care, according to the American Telemedicine Association.

Perry also mentioned a study to look at the feasibility of binational insurance.

""This study recognizes that the Mexican and U.S. sides of the border compose one region, and we must address health care problems throughout that region,"" Perry said.

Those comments were made in August 2001, two weeks before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

The study guidelines were outlined in House Bill 2498, passed by the Texas Legislature in 2001. It begins by stating the interest of the state to deliver affordable health care services to citizens ""on both sides of the Texas-Mexico border.""

The 141-page report, released in 2003, found some legal problems with the idea and logistical challenges, such as there are no laws in Mexico preventing a doctor from performing the duties of a specialist. The report found other problems. Some Texas health care providers were concerned that medical care in Mexico did not meet their standards, the medical equipment in Mexico was not as advanced and some medicine approved in Mexico may not meet Food and Drug Administration guidelines.

The report offered several options if Texas wanted to move forward with the idea. Perry and state lawmakers didn’t act. A spokeswoman for Perry noted to PolitiFact Texas that the Legislature took no further action on the topic.

Still, some websites have bashed conservative media for not being more critical of Perry.
""However, in spite of the Legislature’s failure to act, Perry made clear his willingness to funnel Texas’s assets to Mexico,"" an item in the New American website said. It then had excerpts from Perry’s August 2001 speech. The website failed to note that the speech was made two years before the study.

By signing the bill that allowed the study, and through his 2001 speech, we can see how some find seeds for Perry’s support of a binational health insurance program with Mexico. But the governor never acted on the study, and he hasn’t appeared to talk much about the subject since 2001.

Still, Perry pushed for the study, which implies his interest in the idea.

We rate King’s claim about Perry as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA52EC0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/22/d-king/did-rick-perry-propose-bi-national-health-care-pla/

John Kerry says Simpson-Bowles proposal raised $2 trillion in new revenues
","
On the Nov. 20, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was grilled about the congressional ""supercommittee"" of which he’s a member.

At the time the show aired, a deadline was looming for the supercommittee, which was created by the August 2011 deal to increase the debt ceiling.

Host David Gregory asked Kerry about some of the negotiations over handling the growth of Social Security and Medicare -- programs dear to the hearts of many Democratic lawmakers, just as low taxes are dear to many Republicans.

Kerry said that ""a whole bunch of things were on the table for the right amount. If people wanted to do a $4 trillion deal, there were discussions about dealing with the major sacred cows of our side. I'm just telling you, every one of them was on the table, and they know it. And it will be documented, ultimately, in papers that I know will come out of this. But I don't want to get stuck there right now. The answer is, every one of them are on the table.""

The problem, Kerry said, is that Republicans ""would not do the revenue."" To draw a contrast, Kerry cited details from a few other deficit-reduction proposals, including one known as Simpson-Bowles, after the panel’s co-chairs, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. The Simpson-Bowles commission was a bipartisan panel convened by the White House that produced a final recommendation in December 2010.

""Look, put it in a perspective,"" Kerry told Gregory. ""Simpson-Bowles worked for thousands of hours. Bipartisan, Republican, Democrat, people outside of the Senate and elected politics. They came out and said, in order to do a deal you need $4 trillion, and you need $2 trillion of it as revenue.""

By making this point, Kerry was attacking Republicans for their unwillingness to join with a bipartisan group in accepting significant tax increases. But is Kerry right that the Simpson-Bowles plan would have raised $2 trillion as revenue? We turned to the group’s final report to find out.

The panel’s summary table shows that the plan’s total deficit reduction between 2012 and 2020 would be $3,885 trillion. That’s slightly lower than the $4 trillion Kerry cited, but the Simpson-Bowles report itself rounded that up ""nearly $4 trillion"" in its summary, so we think Kerry is on safe ground for that figure.

But Kerry is off-base on the revenue side. Of the $3.885 trillion in total deficit reduction, the panel proposed cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending totaling $2.217 trillion and estimated interest savings of $673 billion. The remainder of the deficit reduction total involves new revenues -- a combination of closing tax loopholes and increasing in certain types of taxes and other revenue streams. The new tax revenues work out to $995 billion over that period -- slightly less than half of the level Kerry said and, in absolute terms, a difference of more than $1 trillion, which isn’t pocket change.

We asked Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, if we were missing anything with our analysis. He cited two caveats.

The first is that the commission proposed changes to the Social Security system, including payroll taxation of 90 percent of wages by 2050. That’s more than the 86 percent of wages subject to the payroll tax in 2009 and the estimated 83 percent that would be subject to the tax by 2020.

The report recommends that the Social Security changes be made for their own sake, and not for the explicit purpose of deficit reduction, so the panel didn’t include these changes in its deficit-reduction math. But we can extrapolate how much additional revenue would come from Social Security by reverse-engineering from data elsewhere in the report.

The maximum of all net changes from Social Security reforms is $229 billion through 2020. This figure actually includes more than just the payroll tax provision we cited above. But even if all of the $229 billion represented revenue increases, it would still not bump up the total revenue increases under Simpson-Bowles close to the $2 trillion that Kerry cited.

The second caveat, Ellis said, is that other analyses based on the Simpson-Bowles proposal suggest that tax revenues could indeed reach $2 trillion by 2020. One was published by the Republican majority on the House Budget Committee, and another was published by the conservative Heritage Foundation.

They get to this alternative number by using a different baseline. A ""baseline"" is the current budgetary level to which future deficit savings are compared.

We asked Kerry’s office to clarify what he meant, but we did not hear back. Ellis, for what it’s worth, said he thinks it’s unlikely that Kerry was basing his comment on either of the two alternative analyses by the House Budget Committee Republicans and by the Heritage Foundation, both of which are Kerry’s ideological opposites.

Our ruling

While it’s possible to get to $2 trillion using the alternative baselines, we think the best way to analyze Kerry’s comment is to use the commission’s own math. After all, in Kerry’s words, Simpson-Bowles ""came out and said, in order to do a deal you need $4 trillion, and you need $2 trillion of it as revenue."" But the Simpson-Bowles report didn’t come close to suggesting $2 trillion in new revenue. The actual figure is slightly less than half of that. We rate his statement Mostly False. 
EDITOR’S NOTE: After our story was posted, Kerry’s office got back to us. Press secretary Whitney Smith confirmed that the senator understood that the choice of baseline determines how much revenue the proposal generates, as our story indicated. However, we stand by our position that the best number to use in this context is the one the Simpson-Bowles commission used itself, so we’re sticking with our ruling of Mostly False. 
SECOND EDITOR’S NOTE: A few days after our story appeared, we received a letter from Ed Lorenzen, executive director of the Moment of Truth Project, a project co-chaired by Simpson and Bowles to carry on the work of their commission. Lorenzen argued that even though the committee did not use the $2 trillion figure in its report, it was fair for Kerry to have used it in the context of comparing Simpson-Bowles to subsequent deficit-reduction proposals. His comments are detailed, so we’ve provided them separately here. However, we’ve decided to stick to prior our ruling of Mostly False, based on another point Lorenzen made — that if Kerry were to use the $2 trillion figure, then applying the same counting methodology to the total deficit reduction figure would result in a reduction of $5 trillion. That would have made incorrect the other half of Kerry’s statement, in which he said Simpson Bowles would have produced $4 trillion in deficit reduction.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA47240>],/factchecks/2011/nov/21/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-simpson-bowles-proposal-raised-2-t/

Facebook post says Congress has disproportionate share of millionaires
","
Over the past two months, the Occupy Wall Street movement has spread to cities around the country, and those other movements are busy putting out messages that protest against income inequality. 
A reader recently sent us an example from Facebook, which was an online message credited to Occupy D.C. The posting says: 
""1 percent of Americans are millionaires."" 
""47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires."" 
""56 percent of Senators are millionaires."" 
""What would the country be like if our representative government was actually representative?"" 
The reader asked us to check it out, and we were curious ourselves if the division of wealth between the country as a whole and our elected leaders was quite that stark. So we decided to unpack the numbers. 
We’ll take it in two parts. 
""1 percent of Americans are millionaires."" 
A millionaire is a person whose net worth is $1 million or more. Net worth is cash, home value, stocks, bonds and other property minus any debts owed. 
The Federal Reserve Board conducts a Survey of Consumer Finances every three years. Its last survey was in 2007, with an update in 2009. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute analyzed that data and determined that the average wealth of the top 1 percent was close to $14 million in 2009, down from $19.2 million in 2007 (in part because of a decline in housing values). Still, many in the top 1 percent clearly were multimillionaires. 
A 2011 study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services estimated there are around 10.5 million households in the U.S. in 2011 with net worth of more than $1 million. 
That's around 9 percent of all households, which is far larger than 1 percent. 
If you measure how many individuals have incomes of $1 million or more, the Occupy D.C. posting was closer to the mark. 
The Internal Revenue Service recently released income statistics for 2009. It found the top 1 percent of the country included people who made adjusted gross income $343,927 and up. But adjusted gross income can leave out some types of income, particularly types of income not subject to tax. 
For a fuller pictures, we turned to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. It created an economic analysis of total cash income for 2011, not just taxable or adjusted income. The center found that the top 1 percent in 2011 had an average income of $1.5 million a year. However, some elites made slightly less the a million. The least wealthy of the top 1 percent had cash income of $532,613. 
Interesting, but income only doesn't define millionaires. 
""47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires. 56 percent of Senators are millionaires."" 
Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate are paid $174,000 annually, with leadership positions paid slightly more. But many members of Congress were wealthy before they arrived and have substantial net worth. 
Members of the House and Senate are required to file financial disclosures that include their assets and liabilities, and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics compiles those disclosures. 
The representatives and senators are not required to disclose precisely how much they are worth, but they do have to indicate a range of amounts for their assets and liabilities. The center calculates the midpoint between these high and low estimates, then uses that midpoint to rank-order lawmakers from richest to least rich. 
According to the center’s most recent analysis, 183 members of the House had a midpoint net worth estimate of at least $1 million. Meanwhile, the center calculated that 67 senators had a midpoint net worth estimate of $1 million or higher. These numbers were for the calendar year 2010. 
The wealthiest member of Congress was Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""Issa's minimum estimated net worth in 2010 was $195 million, while his maximum estimated net worth was more than $700 million,"" the center said in its analysis. The midpoint estimate in that range is $448 million. 
Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., is the least wealthy member of Congress. Hastings’ liabilities exceed his assets; the center reported that his minimum estimated net worth is negative $7.3 million while his maximum estimated net worth is negative $2.1 million. 
The median net worth of House members was an estimated $756,765, while the median net worth of a senator was $2.63 million. 
So, using these estimates -- and remember, these are only estimates -- 42 percent of House members are millionaires, while 67 percent of senators are millionaires. 
Our ruling 
The Facebook posting from Occupy D.C. said, ""1 percent of Americans are millionaires. 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires. 56 percent of Senators are millionaires.""  One recent study found that around 9 percent of all U.S. households have net assets of more than $1 million. So the claim on Facebook significantly understates the wealth of individuals. 
It's closer if you look only at income. The top 1 percent of Americans has an average income of $1.5 million. But the relevant figure would be net worth. 
As for members of Congress, the most recent estimate shows that 42 percent of House members and 67 percent of senators are millionaires in net worth. That means the Facebook post is a bit high in its estimate of House millionaires and a bit low in its estimate of Senate millionaires. 
The numbers support the underlying point of the Facebook post -- that members of Congress are disproportionately wealthy. But not on the scale suggested. We rate the Facebook post Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB815D80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-congress-has-disproportionate-s/
"['National', 'Financial Regulation', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Newt Gingrich says Dodd-Frank is destroying community banks
","No politician will ever lose votes by coming down on the side of community banks. Unlike the mega-banks of Wall Street that helped fuel the world’s dive off an economic cliff, community banks have a better reputation. They avoid exotic financial deals and, for the most part, stick to their knitting.

GOP hopeful Newt Gingrich offered himself as their defender when he spoke to supporters at campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H. ""Community banks are 12 percent of the banks right now and 40 percent of  the loans to small business,"" Gingrich said. ""And they are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank.""

Dodd-Frank is the financial overhaul bill passed by Congress in 2010. Gingrich says it should be repealed, in part because of its impact on these local banks.

We asked the Gingrich campaign to give us the data that informed the former House speaker’s belief. Staffer R.C. Hammond replied ""It was his observation. How do you source an opinion?""

But Gingrich didn't say, ""I think community banks are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank. He asserted it as a fact.

The first thing to note is that one year after the passage of Dodd-Frank, community banks are healthier. By convention, any bank with assets of less than $1 billion is a community bank.  According to the latest report  from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for that group of banks, a key measure of profitability,  return on assets, has doubled in the past year, growing from 0.26 percent a year ago to 0.57 percent in the second quarter of 2011. Return on assets has been higher this year than in any quarter going back to the start of 2008 before the great meltdown.

While it wouldn’t be fair to give Dodd-Frank full credit for that improvement (the improving economy is probably a factor), neither is it accurate to credit the law with the demise of the industry when the reports of that demise are premature.

Not only are they not dead, ""community banks on the whole are healthier than they were last year,"" said Chris Cole, senior vice president of the Independent Community Bankers of America.

The trade group that represents some 5,000 of these smaller banks views Dodd-Frank as a mixed bag. Cole said it has done some good things. High on the plus side, it will save his members about $4.5 billion over three years in the fees they pay to the FDIC.

""The assessment rates was a big benefit,"" said Cole. Community banks have ""experienced 30 to 40 percent decreases in their assessments. For many community banks, Dodd-Frank has not been all that bad,"" he said.

In a letter marking the one-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank, ICBA’s President Camden Fine also praised the law for making inroads in supervising the mega-banks and putting non-bank financial firms, which can range from insurance companies to hedge funds, under more of a regulatory microscope.  

ICBA is not head-over-heels in love with the financial reforms. It doesn’t like the limits the new law puts on the fees banks can charge each time a customer uses a debit card.  Initially, the rate was capped at 12 cents per swipe. Regulators later changed that to 21 cents.  

If there is one overarching fear that smaller banks have with Dodd-Frank, it is the prospect of new regulations. ""We are expecting compliance costs to increase dramatically,"" Rose Oswald Poels, president of the Wisconsin Bankers Association, told the Milwaukee BizTimes  The president of the American Bankers Association, Frank Keating, warned in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece of a ""mountainous regulatory burden"" that will overwhelm small banks.

""Federal regulators have issued 4,870 Federal Register pages of proposed or final rules affecting banks, "" Keating wrote. ""Many more are still to come—for a grand total of more than 240 rules.""

What Keating fails to mention is that many of the rules under Dodd-Frank specifically exempt community banks.

""A lot of the stuff in Dodd-Frank is really meant to be targeted at the big guys, not the small ones,"" said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University Law School who testifies regularly on Capitol Hill on banking issues. Wilmarth said many more rules could exempt smaller banks depending on how they are written. The ultimate decision on debit card fees is a good example. Not only did regulators raise the allowable fee, the law exempted all banks with assets under $10 billion from the new rule.  

The ICBA's Cole makes a larger point -- that one should hold judgment on the new law. ""The implementation of Dodd-Frank is just halfway through,"" he said. ""It’s too early to say what it is.""  Cole said so far, regulators have been very responsive. ""They’ve been willing to listen and reach out to us.""

A major goal of lobbyists for community banks was to pass a law that treated small banks differently from large ones, and the ICBA  says they achieved that in Dodd-Frank. One sign of this divide: when the ICBA -- representing small banks -- and the ABA -- representing banks both large and small --  listed their lobbying priorities for 2011, there was virtually no overlap.

The ABA for example wants to change the oversight of derivatives, but small banks rarely touch derivatives trading. And the two organizations totally part ways on deposit insurance. The ABA wants to trim back the Dodd-Frank changes, while the ICBA members want to keep the savings they gained from the law.

Wilmarth and others criticized Dodd-Frank for not going far enough to deal with banks that are to big to fail, but, in most ways, it is tougher on the big banks than it is on the small ones, they said.

Our Ruling:

Gingrich said that community banks ""are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank."" But as a whole they are healthier than a year ago. No doubt the improvement in the economy has helped, but community banks also have benefited from a reduction in fees paid to the FDIC as a result of Dodd-Frank.

From the point of view of community banks, Dodd-Frank is imperfect and still unfolding. But it has exempted community banks from many new regulations. That said, the shape of the rules to come will make a big difference in its final impact on them.

To say that this industry is being destroyed by Dodd-Frank is untrue and unlikely to be true in the future if regulators continue to respond to the concerns of small banks. We rate Gingrich's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1ce81073-8a07-4eda-83a2-70e02ed776fe",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA41D80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-dodd-frank-destroying-community/
"['Message Machine 2012', 'Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'Crossroads GPS']","
Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategy claims $1.9 million of stimulus money went to African ant research
","
A new TV ad by a Republican-aligned advocacy group starts by taking aim at Democratic U.S. senate candidate Tim Kaine, but then veers off onto on an unusual topic: African ant research.

The ad from Crossroads Grassroots Policy Studies features Kaine talking about how the 2009 federal stimulus was important to getting people back to work.

The ad then gives short shrift to the stimulus, saying it funded things like ""studying ants in Africa,"" a project that the ad says cost $1.9 million.

PolitiFact Virginia has found numerous times that stimulus did indeed save or create many jobs nationwide -- including thousands of positions at school divisions across Virginia.

But did the stimulus really provide $1.9 million for African ant research? We couldn’t resist checking this one.

Some political attacks are recycled year after year, and the ants analogy is one of them.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon examined the backstory behind the ants research in a Sept. 17, 2010 article.  The story noted the stimulus bill doesn’t even mention the words ""ants"" and didn’t directly pay for the ant research, but added that the stimulus legislation gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which in turn decided which projects to fund. The ant research of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa was one of them.

Brian Fisher, the project’s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, told PolitiFact Oregon that ants offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. He also said the project helped employ 16 people.

PolitiFact Oregon was weighing in on a claim that Democratic Senator Ron Wyden voted for $2 million in ant research because he voted in favor of the stimulus. That was ruled False because when Wyden voted for the bill, the ant research wasn’t yet funded by the measure. The stimulus sent money to the National Science Foundation, which funded the ant project later on.

But the Crossroads ad we’re examining words its ant claim a bit differently. The latest claim said that stimulus money went to study ants in Africa.

That is indeed where the money ended up going. Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, said pointed to the National Science Foundation synopsis of the project, which shows that the stimulus put $1.9 million towards the 5-year ant research project.

Still, political ads often cite eye-catching facts without providing much context.

We weren’t able to reach Fisher for an update on how things are going a year later, but we did speak with Philip Ward, an entomology professor at the University of California at Davis, who is also taking part in the research project.

Ward said the project has a number of benefits. First is the scientific pursuit of gaining a better understanding of the organisms on the planet, he said.

The research could have an economic benefit by helping find ways to deal with invasive pest ants, Ward said. He noted that one such pest ant, commonly called the Big Headed Ant, is believed to originate from Africa and is a nuisance in Hawaii and Florida.

""Some ants are pest ants, and to better understand and better control pest ants, you need to understand where they come from like where they organize, what their ecology is like in their original range, and what natural enemies they have,"" Ward said.

Our Ruling:

The Crossroads ad says that $1.9 million in stimulus money went to study ants in Africa.

Officials working on the project have said the research could help provide insight into climate change, the spread of disease, natural disasters and could also help findings ways to control pest ants in the United States.

But there’s no dispute that ant research is indeed where the money is going. We rate the claim True.

"['Regulation', 'Guns', 'Wisconsin', 'Donna Seidel']","
Seidel says untrained people would be allowed to carry guns after Republicans softened concealed-carry rules
","
The latest turn in Wisconsin’s long path to becoming the 49th state to allow carrying concealed weapons featured a Republican attorney general watching helplessly as Republican lawmakers tossed out several specific firearms training rules he drew up.

When the smoke cleared, Democrats protested that GOP lawmakers went too far by eliminating a set amount of safety training (four hours) and instructor-signed proof of graduation from a firearms course before a permit could be issued.

""Suspending these requirements is an abuse of power that will endanger the lives of Wisconsinites across our state,"" said state Rep. Donna Seidel, D-Wausau,  the Assembly’s assistant minority leader.

Her Nov. 7, 2011, statement continued: ""This would allow untrained individuals to carry guns into public spaces where children are present, but rather than protect Wisconsin’s children, Republicans chose to pay off their friends in the gun lobby with another gift.""

We knew Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen argued the changes could make it tougher to prove fraud by firearms course instructors and students.

But would people without any training at all be able to get a state permit?

We asked Seidel to back up her claim, and her office pointed to Van Hollen’s testimony at the hearing before a legislative rules committee. In Madison, legislators write laws, which prompt agencies to pen specific rules to carry out the Legislature’s intent. A joint legislative committee reviews the rules and has the power to alter them.

Let’s start with Van Hollen’s written testimony and his oral remarks on the rules and the changes, as well as documents on the Department of Justice website.

He spoke shortly before the panel: 
Van Hollen said the rewrite of his rules, sought by the National Rifle Association, would make Wisconsin’s law among the most lenient among states that require permits. PolitiFact Wisconsin found the same thing in our reporting on an earlier item on the training requirements.

States typically do one or more of the following: certify the training organization, their instructors or their courses; mandate specific topics for training; set a minimum number of hours; require the instructor to sign the training certificate.

Wisconsin now requires none of those.

The requirement to get an instructor-led safety course and provide a graduation certificate is still in effect, but Van Hollen told lawmakers the changes would ""effectively gut"" the training requirement because proving fraud would be next to impossible.

The law, with the rules changes, is too vague to determine whether applications meet any meaningful standard, he said.

""We can create as many laws as we want, but if we don’t have the ability to prove and prosecute them, they’re meaningless,"" Van Hollen said.

""In a very real sense,"" Van Hollen wrote in written testimony, ""an individual who has been certified by a ‘national or state organization’ could stand on the street corner and after a short conversation on firearm safety could hand out certificates for a fee.""

The state would risk legal challenges if it denied applications because only vague and subjective training criteria are left, he said.

So what was the bottom line? Did Van Hollen say untrained individuals could slip through?

He told the committee: ""In essence, we will accept every application at face value without determining whether substantive and meaningful training has occurred.""

He concluded: ""If the four-hour training requirement is removed from the statute and rules as they exist today, that effectively eliminates our ability to screen applicants … to determine whether anybody actually really met a training requirement or not."" Van Hollen said his office would be forced to be ""very liberal"" in approving permits.

Legal experts concurred that Van Hollen would be in a difficult spot if he tried to reject applications based on questions about meeting the ill-defined training requirement.

Former Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager said Van Hollen is probably correct that if he denies applications based on questionable training that the state would get sued. And could well lose, she added.

""I think he was left without anything to enforce,"" Lautenschlager said.

Speaking generally about the appropriate role of an attorney general dealing with lawmakers, Jim Tierney, a former Maine attorney general, said: ""This is an attorney general doing his job. You have to keep the elephants inside the ring. You have the constitution and due process and procedures that have to be followed. It’s an essential part of democracy.""

Finally, we spoke to Jim Franklin, executive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs Association. In that state, county sheriffs investigate and issue permits for concealed carry. The state law, in contrast to Wisconsin’s, requires safety instructors to submit their courses to the state for certification. The average course is 4 to 6 hours. The instructors have to sign off. The course curriculum is laid out by the state.

We asked Franklin whether he could evaluate applicants’ training without those requirements in the law.

""It would be much more difficult,"" he said. ""It would be not impossible but certainly more difficult. We negotiated these things to avoid many of those pitfalls and strengthen the confidence of the public that good checking is going on.""

Our conclusion

Seidel said a Republican-led weakening of firearms training rules means that ""untrained individuals"" would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. As support, she cited comments by Van Hollen.

We found his comments, at the very least, strongly suggest that people faking the training could still get permits. Others back up Van Hollen’s assertion that he would be in a weak position, and it’s clear Wisconsin’s rules would be among the most lenient among states requiring permits.

The law is still on the books requiring an instructor-led training course, but it’s hard to prove that someone skipped it. So the door is open to ""untrained"" individuals getting a permit.

We rate Seidel’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACB15C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/21/donna-seidel/seidel-says-untrained-people-would-be-allowed-carr/
"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Leonard Lance']","
Leonard Lance says when national debt hits $15 trillion it will equal $47,900 for every living American
","
A balanced budget amendment can help restore order to the nation’s fiscal house, according to Rep. Leonard Lance.

A proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to prohibit the federal government from running a budget deficit, unless three-fifths of Congress signed off on the spending, failed Friday in the House. On Wednesday, Lance (R-7th Dist.) spoke on the House floor to support the measure, opening his remarks with a rundown of the nation’s gross debt. 
""As of November 14, 2011, the United States’ national debt is $14.973 trillion, according to the Department of the Treasury. With pending security auctions this month, it is inevitable that the national debt will reach the unprecedented level of $15 trillion in the coming weeks,"" Lance said. ""When the national debt reaches $15 trillion, it means that U.S. debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio will reach 99.7 percent of our debt and this is $47,900 for every living American.""

As a committee attempts to reach a deal to reduce the deficit before its deadline this week, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check Lance’s claims about government debt.

Lance’s statistics differ slightly from what we found. Todd Mitchell,  Lance’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that ""the discrepancy is simply the result of the fluctuation of debt and GDP stats.""

The government’s total debt actually surpassed $15 trillion a day before Lance gave his speech, according to Treasury Department data.

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis measures the gross domestic product, which is the value of all goods and services, or basically the size of the economy. In the third quarter of 2011, the most recent quarter for which data is available, the nation’s gross domestic product was nearly $15.2 trillion.

By those measures, the nation’s total debt represents nearly 99 percent of the nation’s economy.

Mitchell said he confirmed Lance’s statistics on a website called www.usdebtclock.org the day Lance gave his speech. The website, which updates constantly, put the ratio at 99.8 percent on Thursday.

The website doesn’t list a phone number and we got an automatic response to an email, but the difference appears to be that the clock has a gross domestic product, as of Thursday, that is more than $170 billion less than the figure listed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

We should note that there is another measure of government debt called ""public debt,"" which some economists prefer. This calculation does not include debt the government holds itself, such as in the Social Security trust fund. By that measure, the debt to gross domestic product ratio is smaller, currently at about 67.8 percent.

Thomas Michl, a professor of economics at Colgate University in New York, argued that the debt held by the public is more meaningful because ""It shows how much the government has been borrowing from the private sector.""

""However, there are arguments that gross debt conveys some information (such as the future liabilities of the social security system), so no, you can't say that using gross debt is an obvious mistake,"" he said.  

Now let’s look at Lance’s claim that the debt equals $47,900 for every living American. Mitchell said he also got those numbers on www.usdebtclock.org.

The amount listed on the website was at $47,990 on Thursday.

We also did our own math by dividing the gross debt by the number of U.S. residents, which the Census Bureau puts at more than 312 million. That’s about $48,000 in national debt per person.

Our ruling

In a speech supporting a balanced budget amendment, Lance said when the national debt hits $15 trillion, it will represent 99.7 percent of the nation’s economy and equal $47,900 for every living American.

The total national debt changes constantly. Lance’s statistics were based on a website called www.usdebtclock.org. Those numbers back Lance’s statement. Using federal data we calculated the statistics and reached similar results.

And both sets of numbers illustrate the same point: the nation’s debt is nearly the size of the nation’s economy.

We rate the statement True.

County claims sewer work will create up to 4,000 jobs
","
DeKalb County has peered deep into its sewers and found a trove of jobs.

The county needs $1.35 billion in water system upgrades to replace mains, aging tanks, and build or repair other infrastructure. Through its recently-announced ONE DeKalb Works program, which they bill as a ""local stimulus program,"" they hope to keep many of those contracts and jobs in the county.

""As a result of these ground-breaking partnerships, ONE DeKalb Works will create up to 4,000 direct jobs per year at peak production, many of which will be set aside exclusively for DeKalb residents,"" the program’s brochure said.

Oh, job estimates. We’ve tackled them many times before. The numbers are typically miscast or overstated.

We can’t resist a job estimate.  We switched on our Truth-O-Meter let it spin away.

According to county documents, the program will work like this:

DeKalb County’s Department of Watershed Management plans to upgrade its water system from 2013 through 2017. The county’s First Source ordinance, which was updated this year, requires all contractors with contracts worth $50,000 or more to make a ""good faith effort"" to fill half of the jobs their projects create with DeKalb residents, it says

DeKalb Workforce Development, a division of the county that helps job seekers get training and connects businesses with applicants, keeps a list of pre-screened workers that contractors can use to find qualified candidates.

Contractors who don’t make a good faith effort to reach the 50 percent goal may become ineligible for future projects. The National Urban League will monitor four of these contracts as part of a pilot project to make sure contractors comply with the ordinance.

The League will have the authority to check contractor payroll records, and will report on how well contractors are meeting county hiring goals.

Since the revised ordinance went into effect in late summer, DeKalb has referred 149 possible employees to 65 contractors who won their bids, county spokesman Burke Brennan said. The county has confirmed contractors hired seven of them, but it’s still collecting data.

So it’s accurate to say that DeKalb has an ordinance that requires contractors try its best to hire a certain amount of locals. The county also has specific plans to monitor contractors and sanctions in place should contractors violate the statute.

But saying that these jobs will be available ""exclusively"" for DeKalb residents is a bit of an overstatement. Contractors must simply make a good faith effort.

Now on to the ONE DeKalb Works’ job estimates. They were issued by the University of Georgia Carl Vinson Institute of Government, which often generates economic impact studies.  We looked at their study and found they used two standard, widely-accepted models.

The study calculated how many ""direct"" jobs the project will create. These positions are for people working directly on improving the county’s water system. Each job equals one position lasting for one year.

It also estimated ""indirect"" jobs, which are created when the county purchases materials for the project, and ""induced"" jobs, which is when workers create jobs by using their earnings to buy clothes or lunch and the like.

The average reader often looks at job estimates for a major project and gets the impression that they represent jobs for people who are actually building it. In fact, some governments add direct jobs to indirect and induced jobs to get the totals that they release to the press. This can give an inflated sense of how many jobs a project will create.  

Another mistake is governments sometimes add together the number of jobs per year created in each each year of the project. This can artificially inflate job numbers as well. For instance, if a project lasts for five years, and a particular worker is set to work on it for all five years, his one job would count as five jobs under this method.  

DeKalb avoids these problems, by and large. In information that accompanies the brochure online, it lists jobs for each year separately. It doesn’t add direct, indirect and induced jobs together.

When work is in full swing in 2015, there will be 3,670 jobs assigned to work directly on the sewer project, according to one economic impact model. Using the second model, UGA found that number is 4,170 direct, indirect and induced jobs in DeKalb county.

""We can be fairly sure that the impact in DeKalb County is somewhere between the two estimates and the actual impact will be determined by the amount of materials purchased from firms in the county,"" the UGA report concludes.

Overall, DeKalb does well with its jobs claim. We think it’s reasonable, if optimistic, to say ""up to"" 4,000 jobs directly will created by the project when it’s at its peak.

The county does run into a little trouble when it claims some of the ONE DeKalb Works jobs are set aside ""exclusively"" for locals. This overstatement would be a serious concern, given that DeKalb has only confirmed that seven workers have been hired under the current First Source rules.

But it’s not a serious concern in this case. The First Source ordinance is brand new and the county is still collecting hire data.  Also, the ordinance appears to have real teeth since the county established a pilot project to monitor ONE DeKalb Works contracts.

We therefore rate DeKalb’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD90840>],/factchecks/2011/nov/21/dekalb-county/county-claims-sewer-work-will-create-4000-jobs/

Ohio unemployment 'significantly higher' than right-to-work states, says chief of 1851 Center for Constitutional Law
","
Just days after a two-to-one margin of victory for a ""health care freedom"" amendment to Ohio’s constitution on the November ballot, the band of Tea Party activists and other conservatives behind that initiative announced a new amendment they would seek.

Next up would be a petition drive to get a new issue on the ballot that the group describes as a ""workplace freedom amendment,"" but which is usually called a right-to-work issue.  

This proposed amendment would forbid forcing a person to join a union as a condition of employment, and it is similar to a proposed amendment that was stomped at the ballot by Ohio voters in 1958.

At the well-attended Statehouse news conference Nov. 10, supporters of the amendment argued that not having a right to work law was hurting Ohio’s economy in competing for jobs and hurting the state’s economic growth.

One of those speaking on behalf of the right to work bill was Maurice Thompson, the executive director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, the author of the proposed amendment. During his remarks, Thompson attempted to make the case that economic conditions were better in right to work states than in Ohio, citing the Buckeye State’s unemployment rate.

""We’re hovering around 9-10 percent unemployment at any given time, which is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it’s always been that way,"" Thompson said.

Just minutes later—at a separate statehouse news conference—House Democrats argued much the opposite -- that unemployment rates in right to work states actually aren’t any lower than Ohio’s.

So it seemed like a good time to check into Thompson’s statement. Had Ohio’s unemployment rate ""always"" been higher?     

It’s fairly easy to compare unemployment rates in different states thanks to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which diligently tracks and compiles the information each month.

Politifact asked Thompson for a source listing right-to-work states and sent us a link to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, which lists 22 states primarily in the south and west which have right-to-work statutes on the books. The fund has a database to the relevant section of law in each state so the fund’s information on what states have the laws looked to be unbiased.   

We compared Ohio’s unemployment rate of 9.1 for September 2011 to those 22 states and found that eight right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates, 13 had lower unemployment rates and one was precisely the same (Arizona). For what its worth, Ohio’s rate dipped to 9.0 for October, but we’re sticking with the September figures here, as they were the most current numbers available when Thompson made his claim.

Three of the 13 states with lower unemployment rates in September were within one percentage point of Ohio’s — Idaho at 9.0 percent, Texas at 8.5 percent and Arkansas at 8.3 percent. If the jobless rate in Ohio is less than one percent greater, does that count as ""significantly higher,"" as Thompson said? We’re not convinced.

Thus, we are left with 10 of 22 right-to-work states with ""significantly"" lower unemployment rates than Ohio.

The tail end of Thompson’s statement makes a second claim — that Ohio has always had an unemployment rate higher than right-to-work states. To test this portion of his statement, we looked at both the high and low water marks for Ohio’s unemployment rate over the last decade to give a s snapshot of how Ohio stacked up against right-to-work states during both good and bad economic times.

When Ohio had its lowest point of unemployment in the state’s history — 3.8 percent in January 2001 — there were still eight right-to-work states with lower unemployment. Fourteen had higher unemployment rates.  

When Ohio had the highest rate of unemployment over the last decade — 10.6 percent in Feb. 2010 — 18 states had lower unemployment rates. Four right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates.

We think it’s likely that Ohio has ranked somewhere between No.5 and No. 15 in highest unemployment rates when compared to the 22 right-to-work states.

Thompson also forwarded information from Stanley Greer, a staffer with the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, who argued that on the average right-to-work states have slightly lower unemployment rates than states without the laws. Greer also produced statistics that argue that private employment has fallen in non right-to-work states but grown in right-to-work states over the past decade.

Frankly, we don’t think that information is pertinent to evaluating the truthfulness of Thompson’s claim, which focused solely on the unemployment rate in Ohio as compared to right-to-work states. So let’s return to that.

Thompson flatly stated that Ohio’s unemployment rate was ""significantly higher"" than the rates in right-to-work states and has ""always"" been that way.

But figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that 12 of 22 right-to-work states have unemployment rates that are very similar to Ohio’s or greater. Less than half have ""significantly"" lower unemployment rates.  

As for Ohio ""always"" having had a higher unemployment rate, a check of Ohio’s rate at its highest and lowest points over the past decade shows 14 of the right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates than Ohio when the rate was at its lowest. And when Ohio’s rate was at its highest, there still were four right-to-work states with higher jobless rates. Ohio’s unemployment rate is not higher than all right-to-work states and very likely has never been.  

Thompson’s claim is not accurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD7A740>],/factchecks/2011/nov/21/maurice-thompson/ohio-unemployment-significantly-higher-right-work-/

U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson no longer champion of controversial research
","When U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson gave remarks at a Vatican conference on adult stem cell research, he portrayed himself as a strong proponent of that work while seeming to brush aside embryonic stem cell work -- despite the fact that he previously championed both types of research.

The former Wisconsin governor, one of three Republicans seeking the 2012 GOP nomination, has fought criticism that he is not conservative enough.

Has Thompson changed his position on embryonic stem cell research, a practice a recent poll shows is opposed by far more Republicans than Democrats?

This is a question for our Flip-O-Meter, which determines not whether any move is good politics or good policy, but whether a political figure has changed stances on an issue.

The apparent shift in Thompson’s views was raised in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article on Thompson’s Nov. 9, 2011 speech at the Vatican, which opposes embryonic research.

Before we examine Thompson’s stance on embryonic stem cells, we’ll note three points we’ve made in previous PolitiFact Wisconsin items about stem cells: Let’s start with Thompson’s early involvement with embryonic stem cell research.

August 2001: Kevin Keane, a longtime Thompson aide, tells the Journal Sentinel that Thompson had decided in 1998 to back embryonic stem cell research and was criticized by anti-abortion groups in 1999 for praising University of Wisconsin-Madison scientist James Thomson in his ""state of the state"" message as governor.

The UW biologist was the first person to isolate and grow human embryonic stem cells.

Keane also said Thompson, who left the governor’s office in early 2001 to become U.S. health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush, offered to develop and announce the Bush administration’s policy allowing federal money to be used for research on existing lines of embryonic stem cells.

September 2001: Thompson tells the Journal Sentinel ""I was very active,"" in Bush's decision to allow that limited federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.

""I've been active in stem cells ever since Jamie Thomson discovered them,"" Thompson said. ""I've been very, very supportive of the science. I think it has great potential.""

September 2008: Thompson recounts how, at an August 2001 lunch, he lobbied Bush to approve federal funding -- which was already supporting adult stem cell research -- for embryonic stem cell research.

""If it were not for that lunch I feel that research on those first lines of stem cells would not have taken place,"" he said at the World Stem Cell Summit in Madison.

Bush in August 2001 announced he would allow federal funds to be used for research on existing embryonic stem cell lines, ""where the life-and-death decision has already been made,"" but not on new lines that would require the destruction of an embryo.

So, it’s clear that Thompson backed embryonic stem cell research as early as the late 1990s, and advocated for it as a Bush cabinet member starting in 2001.

So, how does that compare with Thompson’s remarks at the Vatican?

Speaking to reporters a day before the conference, Thompson was quoted as saying science had moved beyond destroying embryos.

""Why destroy an embryo?"" he asked. ""We are in a new science of adult stem cells that are pluripotent,"" or able to differentiate into other tissues.

(An important note here: Thompson is suggesting that a scientific advance with adult stem cells eliminates the need to use embryonic cells. It’s true that scientists can change body cells into an embryonic state. But as the Los Angeles Times reported a month before Thompson’s remarks, these pluripotent cells can raise a cancer risk and make it more difficult to safely treat diseases. Scientists also are not certain that these changed or reprogrammed cells will behave exactly the same as embryonic stem cells.)

Back to Thompson’s comments.

At the Vatican conference, he went further with his statements about embryonic stem cells, according to prepared remarks furnished by his campaign.

Thompson said: ""I just don't believe that man can engineer something superior to what the good Lord has already given us. That's what I love about adult stem cells -- we're using the divine wisdom inside each of us to supercharge our bodies and wipe away disease. And as we do this, not a single human embryo is destroyed.""

He also said ""we can surely unite to return health to the hundreds of millions of people suffering needlessly throughout the world.  And we can do so without destroying one human life.""

So, Thompson is emphasizing how treatment of disease can be done with adult stem cells and without destroying an embryo.

We asked Thompson campaign spokesman Darrin Schmitz whether Thompson has changed his position. Schmitz referred us to comments he made to the Journal Sentinel about Thompson’s speech at the Vatican. He said then that Thompson’s position is consistent with the policy he helped develop with Bush.

""As a pro-life Catholic, Tommy Thompson has always sought to protect new and existing life,"" Schmitz said. ""Thompson fully supports adult stem cell research, which does not require the destruction of embryos and has yielded new advancements in regenerative therapies.""

That’s a far cry from the strong support Thompson expressed for embryonic stem cell search while serving under Bush.

Our conclusion

Thompson has gone from being a leading advocate of embryonic stem cell research at the highest levels of government to arguing it is no longer necessary to destroy embryos in order to make scientific advancements with stem cells.

While he hasn’t come out against the embryonic work, he has suggested it is no longer necessary given advancements in adult stem cell research -- even though that is far from settled science.

PolitiFact defines a Half Flip as ""a partial change of position or inconsistent statements."" That’s how we rate Thompson.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD1D300>],/factchecks/2011/nov/20/tommy-thompson/us-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-no-longer-champ/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Michael Doherty']","
Nearly 160,000 students in New Jersey’s school lunch program are ineligible, state senator says
","
The school board president and two other individuals connected to the Elizabeth school district have been accused of illegally signing up their children for the federal school lunch program, but according to state Sen. Michael Doherty, that’s just the ""tip of the iceberg.""

Standing before members of the East Jersey Tea Party, Doherty suggested the state auditor had determined that nearly 160,000 students across the state were receiving free or reduced-price meals when they shouldn’t be.

""We have 428,000 kids in the state of New Jersey signed up for free or reduced-price lunch. Our state auditor checked the records, and you know what he found?"" Doherty (R-Warren) said during the Nov. 3 appearance. ""He found, out of 428,000, when he checked the records, 37 percent of the students that were signed up were actually ineligible.""

After checking the auditor’s report, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Doherty's math was a bit overwrought. 
Here's why. 
Each year, according to state and federal officials, schools are required by the federal government to audit three percent of the total number of the school lunch applications they receive. They are instructed to focus on the ones that are within $100 of the household income that qualifies children for a free or reduced-cost lunch. The logic, state and federal officials say, is that since there are 428,000 kids in the program across New Jersey, you can't check them all. So concentrate on the ones that seem close to the income limit. 
In 2010 the state auditor looked at the three percent analyzed by each school and found that 37 percent did not actually qualify for the program, which translated to 2,723 erroneous applications. 
There was never an attempt to analyze the entire 428,000 so there is no way to know what the real number of improper applications actually is. 
""I stand by the accuracy of my statement,"" Doherty told us.

But the state auditor, Stephen Eells did consider what the overall number of erroneous applications might be. 
In his report, Eells projected that 58,000 of the 428,000 students may be ineligible, if the results of the analysis conducted by his office are reflective of all approved applications.

Our ruling

Doherty claimed the state auditor found that 37 percent of 428,000 students in the school lunch program were ineligible, but the 37 percent does not apply to the 428,000.

The 37 percent applies to a limited number of questionable applications subject to verification, which translates to about 2,723 ineligible applications. The students behind those applications were not among the 428,000 students cited by Doherty.

We rate his statement False. The abuses in the school lunch program are bad enough as they are without any fuzzy math, senator.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says Obama has a new Christmas tree tax
","
Weeks before Thanksgiving, the Internet was abuzz with holiday news that no doubt would turn Santa Claus' smile upside down: President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy Christmas trees. 
A headline on the Los Angeles Times’ website asked: ""Is President Obama 'the Grinch who taxed Christmas' trees?"" And a Republican congressman from Louisiana posted a press release slamming the president for trying to ""sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees."" 
In Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott and others took to Twitter the same day — Nov. 9, 2011 — to express their opposition. Abbott's tweet: ""Obama = Scrooge. Obama has new Christmas Tree Tax."" 
Really? 
Christmas trees are a big business in Oregon, so our PolitiFact colleagues there jumped on this claim. 
Included in Abbott's tweet was a link to a Nov. 8 blog post by David Addington on the conservative Heritage Foundation's website titled ""Obama couldn't wait: His new Christmas tree tax."" The post cited an entry in that day's Federal Register — which publishes information on regulations — announcing an effort to help the Christmas tree industry promote itself. 
It's what’s known as a ""checkoff program"" — under which producers of a commodity are required to pitch in money for ad campaigns, market research, product development and consumer education efforts. Some of the most familiar checkoff programs are for beef (""it’s what’s for dinner"") and pork (""the other white meat""). 
According to the Federal Register entry on the Christmas tree program, it was sought by an industry group called the Christmas Tree Checkoff Task Force. Proponents of the program say the Christmas tree industry needs a sustained national marketing campaign to compete with advertising by sellers of artificial trees. 
To fund the program, growers and importers of Christmas trees will pay a ""15-cent assessment"" on each tree sold, and the money will go to a board made up of 12 Christmas tree sellers, who will direct the research and marketing efforts. Board members will be nominated by the industry and selected by the U.S. secretary of agriculture. Growers and importers who sell fewer than 500 trees a year are exempt from that 15-cent assessment — which Addington dubbed a tax in his blog. 
A day after the Heritage blog posted, criticism of the program exploded across the Internet. By the end of the day, the White House was telling reporters that the administration would delay the Christmas tree checkoff program. No new start date was given. 
Justin DeJong, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, told us that the program is on hold because ""misinformation"" about it had created confusion for consumers shortly before the start of the Christmas season. 
DeJong disputed the labeling of the 15-cent assessment as a tax. ""What’s being talked about here is an industry group deciding to impose fees on itself to fund a promotional campaign, and there are many success stories in every sector of the industry (milk, beef, pork, etc),"" he wrote in an email. 
Official notice that the program had been delayed indefinitely appeared in the Nov. 17, 2011, Federal Register. The entry says that the program is on hold ""to provide additional time for the department to reach out to the Christmas tree industry and the public to explain how a research and promotion program is a producer-driven program to support American farmers."" 
Betty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who led the task force that submitted the request for the program to the Agriculture Department, told PolitiFact Oregon that she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by Obama. 
""We’ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years,"" she said. ""The industry has talked about this for 20 years. This started long before Obama"" was president. 
According to the task force's proposal, filed with the Agriculture Department on Aug. 12, 2009, sessions to gauge interest in the establishment of a checkoff program among growers were held in Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania in 2008 — when George W. Bush was president. 
Not everyone in the industry embraces the idea. According to the Nov. 8 Federal Register entry, the Agriculture Department received more than 550 responses about the checkoff program proposal during its 65-day designated ""comment period."" Of the total, 398 were in favor while 147 were opposed. 
In Texas, Marshall Cathey, president of the Texas Christmas Tree Growers Association, with more than 100 members, said the group voted against supporting the checkoff program proposal. 
We talked with two Texas Christmas tree farmers opposed to the program. Bob Childress, whose farm is about 40 miles east of Abilene, said he considers the program an example of government reaching inappropriately into the marketplace. 
Marc Nash, co-owner of Elgin Christmas Tree Farm, agreed and said he objects to being forced by the government to pay into an industry promotional campaign. Nash also said Texas growers, which primarily have small farms in rural areas, won't benefit from the checkoff program because its marketing efforts would most likely take place in major, urban areas where any increased sales would help large Christmas tree wholesalers. 
Next, we looked into whether the 15-cent fee would be passed on to tree buyers and whether it amounts to a tax, as Abbott says. 
The National Christmas Tree Association, a supporter of the program, said in a Nov. 9, 2011, press release that ""the program is not expected to have any impact on the final price consumers pay"" for trees. However, Addington, in his blog, writes that ""of course, the Christmas tree sellers are free to pass along the 15-cent federal fee to consumers who buy their Christmas trees."" 
Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association, told PolitiFact Oregon that it's unclear whether the fees would ultimately be the responsibility of buyers. ""It doesn’t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it,"" he said. 
PolitiFact also found disagreement about whether the tree charge is a tax. The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn't go to the government. 
The national tree association agrees with the Agriculture Department that the 15-cent assessment isn't a tax. Again, Addington's perspective is different. In his blog, he writes: ""The federal government mandates that the Christmas tree sellers pay the 15-cents per tree, whether they want to or not. The federal government directs that the revenue generated by the 15-cent fee goes to the board appointed by the secretary of agriculture to carry out the Christmas tree program established by the secretary of agriculture. Mr. President, that's a new 15-cent tax to pay for a federal program to improve the image and marketing of Christmas trees."" 
For other perspectives, PolitiFact consulted national experts. 
""It certainly doesn't smell or quack like a tax,"" said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation who was an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. 
On the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, says ""a coercive levy is a tax."" 
Our ruling 
Opinion is split on whether the 15-cent fee on Christmas trees — if it goes into effect — would be a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. 
Setting that eye-of-the-beholder issue aside, the claim that Obama was behind the tree charge suggests he came up with the scheme. That's not correct; the idea originated with the industry before he became president. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE45380>],/factchecks/2011/nov/20/greg-abbott/texas-attorney-general-greg-abbott-says-obama-has-/

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says U.S. spends 18 percent of its GDP on healthcare, far more than other nations
","
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, was one of several speakers at  a Sept. 21 health care forum in Washington on the future of health care in the United States. Not surprisingly, much of his speech focused on how much the nation spends on health care.

The forum was organized by the nonprofit Washington-based Partnership for Quality Care, whose members, according to its website, include physician groups, health plans, employers, hospitals, consumer groups and policymakers.

One point Whitehouse made caught our attention.

""The American health care system burns 18 percent of our national GDP. Nobody else is close,"" he said.

We knew our spending was high compared with other industrialized nations, but we wondered whether he got his facts right.  

First, we contacted Whitehous'’s spokesman, Seth Larson, to find out where the information came from. He sent us links to two websites.

The first link took us to the site for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

There, we found this statement: ""Total health expenditures reached $2.5 trillion (in 2009), which translates to $8,086 per person, or 17.6 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product."" The most recent comparisons are for 2009.

(Gross Domestic Product, the market value of the nation’s production of goods and services, has since been revised for 2009, so the share of health care spending that year was actually 17.8 percent of the GDP, said Thomas Dail, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Either way, it still rounds to 18 percent, as Whitehouse said.)

Next, we followed the second link to check how the United States’ health care spending compares with spending in other industrialized countries.

The international data came from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based organization with 34 member countries. The organization, which has an office in Washington, D.C.,  is funded by contributions from its member governments.

Under ""Frequently Asked Questions,""  we found a link to a spread-chart that shows annual health expenditures by country as a share of GDP.

In 2009, the most recent year with complete data, the industrialized country with the next highest health expenditure per GDP is the Netherlands, at 12 percent, followed closely by France, Germany, Denmark, Canada and Sweden -- all above 11 percent.

(It should be noted that many countries that spend far less on health care than the United States get better results on such measures as life expectancy, access to care and treatment of heart attacks and other health problems.) 
Our ruling

Whitehouse said that U.S. health care spending accounts for 18 percent of the national GDP, far outstripping other countries. He got his facts right, accurately summarizing two reports based on federal government data.

We rate his statement True.

Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategy claims $39 million of stimulus money paid for renovations of politicians' offices
","
Nothing suggests a boondoggle like tens of millions of federal dollars spent on office upgrades for politicians.

At least that’s the impression left by an advertisement that started running in Virginia this month.

The spot, which takes aim at Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine, comes from Crossroads Global Policy Studies, a Republican-aligned advocacy group.

The ad shows footage of Tim Kaine referring to stimulus funding passed under president Barack Obama.

""The stimulus is critically important to put people back to work,"" Kaine says.

Then, with no small hint of sarcasm, the ad says stimulus money went to ""critically important projects"" such as ""office upgrades for politicians."" The 35-second spot then lists $39 million as the price tag of that endeavor.

Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, told us in an e-mail that his group’s claim is a reference to the latest phase of a renovation of the Kansas state capitol building.

This is a familiar claim for PolitiFact, which debunked a similar charge that surfaced in the 2010 New Hampshire U.S. Senate race.

Since it’s popping up again, we decided to weigh in on it once more.

Hodson pointed to a July 7, 2010, story in The Bond Buyer, which notes the state took out a $39.7 million Build America Bond to help pay for the the latest phase of a decade-long renovation of the capitol. But that doesn’t mean, as the ad implies, that $39 million of federal stimulus money was spent directly on the project.

""That’s not the case at all,"" said Marilyn Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Administration, which oversees the capitol building.

The Build America Bonds were created as part of the 2009 stimulus -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A U.S. Treasury Department summary notes that the federal government pays 35 percent of the interest costs on the bonds, and the state or local government issuing the bond pays the rest of the interest.

The idea is to give states a lower interest rate and thereby boost infrastructure projects and the economy.

The state sells the bond to investors, and it’s the state -- not the federal government -- that pays back the principal on the bond, Jacobson said.

The costs for the federal government to finance its share of the interest over the life of the bond -- which matures in 2030 -- would be a fraction of the $39 million cited in the ad.

Jim MacMurray, vice president of finance at the Kansas Development Finance Authority, estimated the federal government’s total cost of paying for its share of interest would come to $8.8 million over the life of the 20-year bond.

There’s another problem with the Crossroads claim -- the contention that this is simply a project to ""upgrade politicians’ offices.""

It’s true that office space renovations have been part of the project. But Jacobson said that’s just one part of an overall restoration to completely overhaul the state capitol, which is more than 100 years old. Work includes replacing the leaky limestone exterior, installing new heating and air conditioning systems as well as getting rid of century-old electrical wiring, she said.

""Office space is a very small piece of the whole thing,"" Jacobson said.

Our ruling

The Crossroads ad says that $39 million in stimulus money went to ""office upgrades for politicians,"" a reference to the latest phase in renovating the Kansas state capitol building.

First of all, the $39 million is not a direct payment for the renovation. That’s the amount the state will repay along with most of the interest through a bond program started by the 2009 stimulus.

The federal government pays for some interest costs, but those expenses are nowhere near $39 million.
