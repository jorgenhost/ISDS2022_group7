Wisconsin is weeks from using anywhere near the listed coronavirus testing capacity
","Gov. Tony Evers has said expanded testing capacity is one of the benchmarks needed to begin a phased re-opening of Wisconsin in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Testing has been a key chokepoint in Wisconsin and nationwide, with some people initially unable to get tested despite serious symptoms and officials scrambling to increase access. Republicans in the state Legislature — who are suing to block an extension of Evers’ ""Safer at Home"" order — honed in on this piece of the plan. An April 20, 2020 joint statement from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald listed a series of criticisms, including this one:  ""The governor also wants to postpone reopening until we increase testing when we are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity."" Is Wisconsin really only using 20% of its testing capacity? The claim implies the state could be conducting five times more tests if it chose. It’s a key question since the testing volume is one of the key areas of improvement Gov. Tony Evers has said we need before Wisconsin can take steps toward re-opening. It’s part of a general outline he presented in his Badger Bounce Back plan April 20. It set a goal of 12,000 tests per day. We found testing is a lot more complicated than how this claim presents it. Let’s start with the basics of what goes into a coronavirus test. There are two elements to the test — the part done at the clinic or testing site by a health care worker, and what is done at the lab. Here’s the breakdown from Dr. Alana Sterkel, assistant director of the Communicable Disease Division of the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She’s one of the people coordinating testing and distribution of collection supplies statewide. The in-office portion — commonly called a collection kit — includes a nasal swab and a vial of transport liquid, which stabilizes and preserves the sample in transit to the lab. These are the exact materials that have been used for years to test for other respiratory viruses, such as the flu. Collecting the sample also means the health care worker and patient both need personal protective gear (PPE) of some kind, typically a mask for the patient and full-body protection for the worker. The vial is then sent to a lab, which if it’s located offsite would require shipping materials and a courier service. As of April 24, the state reports 48 labs are actively testing — a combination of the government labs, hospital system labs and independent private labs.  At the lab, they need machines to run the physical test and chemicals to aid in the analysis. An array of different chemicals are used at different labs to conduct the test, collectively referred to as ""reagents."" The majority of tests done in Wisconsin now return results within 24 to 48 hours. A relatively small number of health care systems have rapid testing that can accomplish all this in-house and get a result before the end of an office visit. In some extreme cases, tests sent to a backlogged outside lab could take up to 10 days. That brings us to the key word in the Fitzgerald/Vos claim — capacity. The day Vos and Fitzgerald made this claim, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported a statewide testing capacity of 7,608. The actual number of tests conducted was 1,433, about about 19% of the testing capacity.  The state’s capacity tally is referring to how many tests labs are theoretically able to process, if everything else in the supply chain was in place to collect and deliver them. Vos and Fitzgerald, meanwhile, are framing their claim around the idea that the capacity level cited by the state represents what can actually be conducted on a given day.  But the process involves collection and testing, and sometimes transport. And, as seen in the process above, the list of components to a test is long — swab, transport liquid, protective gear, lab machinery and reagent, at a minimum. ""It’s like baking cookies, that you need to have flour, eggs, butter and chocolate chips to make a batch of cookies, and if you don’t have any one of those, you can’t make cookies,"" Sterkel said. ""If one of those supply lines goes down, you go down altogether."" In short, the labs can handle a higher volume of tests than the rest of the system can actually conduct and send them right now.  ""That (20%) number is I think inaccurately representing what we’re capable of doing right now,"" Sterkel said. For starters, the state isn’t exactly overflowing with testing supplies. Asked which elements of the supply chain are preventing Wisconsin from doing more tests, Sterkel said, ""Just about everything."" And the testing capacity number is skewed by the inclusion of Exact Sciences, a Madison-based lab that has just started doing coronavirus testing. The massive lab accounts for about half of the state testing capacity number, but they are at least several weeks from being able to actually obtain that many tests to process.  ""This is testing that they did not previously do. They do not have existing relationships and ways to get samples to their lab, and this is something that needs to develop over time as they build those relationships with hospital systems,"" Sterkel said. ""They double the capacity in a very short amount of time in the state, but using that capacity will take time."" Sterkel made sure to note that the outlook for testing in Wisconsin is positive and improving quickly from initial logjams. She is working to make sure patients and doctors both know testing is widely available. ""For a while we had to limit to only the most ill where it could make the biggest difference because that’s all we could test,"" Sterkel said. ""Now we’re able to test more, we need to get the message out that people should be testing more."" She said about half of the state’s testing capacity — up around 11,000 as of April 24 — could be used today, though the collection supplies available now wouldn’t necessarily sustain that volume indefinitely. ""The labs have been working very hard to build capacity very quickly,"" she said. In a joint statement, Vos and Fitzgerald criticized plans to hold up re-opening Wisconsin — in part — for increased testing, saying Wisconsin is ""currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity."" That is indeed the portion of testing currently in use, but the implication that the state could simply flip a switch and increase testing fivefold is wrong. The state is in better shape than it was, but it still doesn’t have the sample collection materials it would need to sustain that kind of increase. And half of the state’s capacity is from Exact Sciences, which is likely a few weeks from having the supply chain in place to actually utilize its listed capacity. We define Half True as a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.

Yes, San Francisco residents formed Anti-Mask League during 1918 flu
","The protests against stay-at-home orders in some state capitals have drawn comparisons to the 2010 tea party movement, but the idea of protesting such rules amid a pandemic is not just a 21st-century phenomenon. There are parallels to a protest a century ago. ""During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, several influential San Francisco residents including a few physicians formed the Anti-Mask League which objected to wearing masks to prevent the spread of influenza,"" stated an April 22 Facebook post. ""They held meetings of thousands of maskless people. San Francisco was ultimately one of the cities that suffered the most with a high death rate."" (The ""Spanish flu"" is a misnomer — it’s more accurate to refer to it as the flu pandemic of 1918.) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post includes a black-and-white photo of policemen wearing masks over their mouths and noses. We did a reverse Google search and found the image matches a photo of policemen in a different city — Seattle — wearing masks in 1918. But there are accurate statements in the text, which draws from a source at the University of Michigan. We found that there was such a thing as the Anti-Mask League in San Francisco in January 1919. The city did have one of the highest death rates from the flu, but the authors said they can’t prove whether the Anti-Mask League played a role. RELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing Hat tip to NPR reporter Tim Mak for digging up the history of the Anti-Mask League and sharing it in a Twitter thread. Mak pulled from an essay by J. Alexander Navarro at the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine, a book by Alfred W. Crosby, America’s Forgotten Pandemic and the San Francisco Chronicle archives.  As the number of flu cases rose in October 1918 in San Francisco, the city passed an ordinance requiring everyone to wear a mask in public except at mealtime. Mask wearing was promoted as a symbol of patriotism. Gov. William Stephens told Californians it was a ""patriotic duty for every American citizen"" to wear a mask. City officials and local newspapers reported widespread compliance with the mask order initially, Navarro found. But some resisted the rules, and police arrested 110 people on Oct. 27 for not wearing their masks or for failing to keep them properly adjusted. The majority were fined $5, though some went to jail.  In November, with cases declining, the city started to lift restrictions, although it still required masks. People flocked to public venues including theaters and sports arenas. At a boxing match, the city’s mayor and city health officer were photographed not wearing masks, for which they were fined. Later that month, the mayor annulled the ordinance. But new cases quickly emerged, and the mask ordinance was reinstated in January. Opponents formed the Anti-Mask League, multiple news articles in January 1919 show. Crosby wrote in his book that the league consisted of ""public-spirited citizens, physicians and fanatics."" At a meeting of the Anti-Mask League ""resolutions were passed denouncing the mask ordinance as contrary to the desires of the majority of the people,"" the San Francisco Examiner reported. Nearly 2,000 people attended. The league got their wish, and the mask rule was rescinded Feb. 1. Navarro and colleagues studied how 43 cities fared during the 1918 pandemic and published their results in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They found that many cities experienced second waves after ending social distancing.  San Francisco had one of the higher excess-death rates: 673 per 100,000 people. ""It is impossible to say for certainty that the advent of the Anti-Mask League played a role in that outcome,"" Navarro told PolitiFact ""Undoubtedly, having over 2,000 people gather would have helped continue to spread influenza."" The main factors in San Francisco’s outcome, however, were failure to implement interventions such as social distancing quickly and failure to keep them in place long enough. Navarro said he didn’t find something similar to the Anti-Mask League in other cities. Only a few other cities implemented mandatory face mask orders, while others recommended that the public use masks.  A Facebook post said during the 1918 flu pandemic, San Francisco residents formed an ""Anti-Mask League."" San Francisco ""was ultimately one of the cities that suffered the most with a high death rate."" Residents angry about the reinstatement of a mask order did form the Anti-Mask League in January 1919. It appeared to be short-lived, as the mask rule was quickly rescinded. Researchers found that San Francisco did have one of the higher death rates in the country, but it is impossible to say whether that was directly related to the mask protests. A photo of masked police officers that accompanies the post is real, but it shows officers in Seattle.

Donald Trump didn’t ban welfare for immigrants illegally in the US
","President Donald Trump has been consistent and forceful in his argument that immigration represents a burden on the American taxpayer and the economy. His administration has sought to crack down on illegal immigration and curtail legal immigration, most recently by ordering a 60-day halt on issuance of green cards to people outside the United States. But a Facebook post crediting him with saving billions by denying welfare to ""illegal immigrants"" is inaccurate. ""President Trump has banned welfare for illegal immigrants which will save $57.4 billion a year,"" said the April 9 Facebook post. ""Do you support Trump on this?? I damn sure do!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are several wrong premises with the post: Immigrants living in the country illegally and those who arrive on non-immigrant visas (such as students and tourists) are generally not eligible for federal public benefits, even though some pay income taxes and contribute to Social Security. This was the case before Trump became president.  The Trump administration issued a rule in August 2019 that broadened the government’s ability to deny visas and permanent-resident status to immigrants who get public benefits or those who may need assistance after their arrival. The rule targets people who are seeking legal admission and those who are here and applying for permanent residency. The Facebook post doesn’t specify where the $57.4 billion figure comes from, but the post mirrors a headline on a Breitbart story. That story, however, was about legal immigration. Here's a more detailed explanation of the inaccuracies. Generally, immigrants living illegally in the United States are ineligible for federal public benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (commonly called food stamps), regular Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. These restrictions are not the result of Trump’s presidency. They may be eligible for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, Emergency Medicaid to cover emergency medical needs, and other emergency assistance, such as short-term non-cash, in-kind emergency disaster relief (which includes things like crisis counseling, shelter, food and water.) For decades, even immigrants who came to the United States legally have been restricted from public assistance for a period. A 1996 law barred immigrants from federal ""means tested"" public benefits for five years. (There are some exemptions; this story has more details.) Additionally, public-charge rules say that immigrants can be turned away if they are likely to depend on public-assistance programs; this type of restriction has been in place for more than 100 years. The Trump administration in August 2019 broadened the interpretation of these rules to make them stricter. But that did not ban welfare for immigrants here illegally. Immigration experts told PolitiFact that under the new rule, immigration officials will be able to deny immigrants visas if they are deemed ""more likely than not"" to use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are in the United States legally on temporary visas and have relied on such benefits in the past could also have more difficulty getting a green card.  The Facebook post claimed that the purported ban would save Americans $57.4 billion a year. An August 2018 Breitbart headline said, ""Trump’s welfare ban for immigrants would be $57.4B tax cut for Americans."" The story centered on Trump’s plan for a public-charge rule and immigrants who would ""resettle permanently"" in the United States. That Breitbart story linked to a 2016 post on its website headlined, ""National Academies: Immigrants cost state and local taxpayers $57.4 billion per year."" A study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine estimated that the annual fiscal cost of first-generation immigrants and their dependents, averaged across 2011-2013, was $57.4 billion. The figure referred to state and local expenses, not federal costs or benefits, and the main cost was education, said Francine D. Blau, a Cornell University economics professor who chaired the panel of researchers studying the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration. ""We find that much of this cost is related to the cost of educating both immigrant children and U.S. citizen children of immigrants (we attribute the entire cost of education to the parents of school age children),"" Blau said via email. ""The cost is smaller if we recognize the public-good aspect of education, that is, the broader social benefits in having a more educated populace."" The $57.4 billion also included costs of general public services such as police, fire, parks and recreation. It also did not apply only to immigrants in the country illegally. The study relied on data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, which did not allow researchers to differentiate between immigrants here legally and illegally, Blau said. A Facebook post said, ""President Trump has banned welfare for illegal immigrants which will save $57.4 billion a year."" Trump has not done that. Immigrants here illegally were already ineligible for most federal assistance programs. Trump’s administration issued a public-charge rule that would deny legal admission to people who are likely to depend on public benefits and which would make getting lawful permanent residency more difficult for people who are already in the country and used public assistance. The source of the $57.4 billion figure is unclear. A study estimated a $57.4 billion annual cost to state and local governments for first generation immigrants and their dependents. Schooling costs accounted for the bulk of that cost. The post is inaccurate.

Texas lags behind other states in coronavirus testing per capita
","As state leaders in Texas look to ease restrictions implemented to slow the spread of coronavirus in the state, some people have raised concerns about the number of tests the state has administered. U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, raised the issue during a webcast with the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute and the Migration Policy Institute on Wednesday. ""Texas, I believe, either is near the bottom or at the very bottom when it comes to testing per capita, so the numbers are probably far greater than what is being reported,"" she said. ""I believe we don’t have an adequate idea of just how many cases and how many deaths are being reported."" At the time of Escobar’s remark, Texas had administered 216,783 tests for the coronavirus, with 21,069 positive results, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The state was reporting 542 coronavirus fatalities with an estimated 7,341 recoveries. Escobar’s spokeswoman Elizabeth Lopez-Sandoval pointed to the COVID Tracking Project as the source of Escobar’s claim comparing Texas testing to other states. The COVID Tracking Project was launched by The Atlantic and tracks and publishes data from each state about testing, deaths and hospitalizations related to the coronavirus.  Looking at the numbers With a population of more than 27.8 million in 2018 and 216,783 tests administered, Texas had administered about 777 coronavirus tests per 100,000 people as of Wednesday, ranking 48th among states in testing per capita. Here’s a look at the five states that had administered the fewest coronavirus tests per capita, as of Wednesday: The total number of tests administered in Texas is significantly higher than other states at the lower end of the list, but testing per capita remains low. Here’s how other states with large populations compare to Texas in the number of tests administered per capita, as of Wednesday: And here’s how Texas compares to its neighbors in testing per capita, from lowest to highest, as of Wednesday: Efforts to increase testing Public health experts say a dramatic increase in testing is needed to ensure it’s safe to reopen sectors of the economy, as limited testing data means there are significant unknowns when it comes to the scope of the virus spread. The data that does exist is incomplete, as some private laboratories have not reported the number of negative tests they have administered. And there are clear discrepancies in some county-level data. For example, one small West Texas county reported 12 positive cases of the virus but only reported administering one test as of April 13, according to the American-Statesman.  During a news conference on April 17, Gov. Greg Abbott said he spoke with the White House and was told Texas would receive ""a dramatic increase"" in testing — ""not just testing those who may show symptoms, but also being able to test entire communities so that we have better information."" California and Arizona have both expanded which individuals meet the criteria required for testing, allowing individuals with no symptoms to be screened. Abbott told reporters that this increase in testing capacity is expected by ""late April or early May."" He declined to offer specifics, but said new testing will be coming from the private sector. Texas Department of State Health Services Commissioner John Hellerstedt said the private sector will play a role, but public health authorities also are working to grow their capacity. Our Ruling Escobar said that Texas ""is near the bottom or at the very bottom of COVID-19 testing per capita."" Data supports Escobar’s statement and shows that Texas has lagged behind other states in terms of coronavirus testing per capita.

UM System President rates Mostly True on claim about the economic impact of health institute
","The NextGen Precision Medical Institute, expected to open in October 2021, will serve as a research center for University of Missouri students and experts in a variety of scientific fields.  In a February email update, UM System President Mun Choi boasted of the institute’s economic impact: ""The facility construction alone will bring 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue to Missouri.""  That’s pretty sizable, so we wanted to check it out. Turns out, these numbers are in line with economic projections. Economic forecasts of any kind, however, are inherently flawed.  The future will always differ somewhat from the past, and a small change in factors such as gross domestic product, inflation and interest rates can make predictions incredibly complex.  In his email, Choi linked a UM System news release that cited economic projections for the next 25 years. This estimate was taken from a report by the University of Missouri Economic and Policy Analysis Research Center. But the projections in the release were about the economic impact of the NextGen Initiative as a whole, not the building.   Additionally, the numbers from Choi’s claim were not included in the 34-page economic report we obtained in an email from MU News Bureau Director Christian Basi.  So, where did these numbers come from?  After more emails and a phone interview with MU economics professor Joe Haslag, who co-wrote the university report, we discovered the numbers came from the university’s appropriations request to the state for the NextGen Health Institute.  The request, shared by Basi, stated construction of the NextGen Health Institute would have a $468 million impact on the overall state economy and generate 3,287 jobs.  That’s pretty close to Choi’s email that boasted of 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue. Basi said the gap in the numbers from the state request and Choi’s email could be a result of the operating costs not being included in the calculations.  They were generated using a report Basi shared from the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, a research foundation also known as NAIOP. The group produces an annual report to estimate the economic contributions of commercial real estate to the U.S. economy.  PDF link here The report compiles economic multipliers for each state. Multipliers, supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, are numbers used to calculate the economic impact of each dollar spent.  In other words, multipliers can tell you if you spend X on a commercial real estate project, this is the estimated number of jobs created and total economic impact. So, for a construction project that costs an estimated $221 million and a Missouri employment multiplier of 14.8721, the total number of jobs created is 3,287. With the same construction cost and a Missouri output multiplier of 2.1169, the total economic impact is $467,834,900. It’s worth noting that predictions aren’t a guaranteed reality. Lots of factors can change over the course of 25 years. So, when Choi said these jobs and economic impact will occur, he was overplaying his claim. PDF link here Choi claimed the construction of the NextGen Health Institute alone ""will bring in 3,400 jobs and $472 million in revenue to Missouri.""  After some digging, we found these numbers were the result of a third-party foundation’s report and used in the university’s capital appropriations request to the state. The request stated the institute would create an estimated 3,287 jobs and have a total economic impact of about $468 million.  Because all figures regarding the economic impact of the NextGen Health Institute are estimates for the next 25 years and Choi’s numbers were very close, we rate this claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096836780>],/factchecks/2020/apr/24/mun-choi/um-system-president-rates-mostly-true-claim-about-/

In most states -- 31 according to the NCSL -- elections boards simply compare the voter’s signature on an absentee ballot with a signature they already have on file for the voter. If there’s a discrepancy, election officials investigate. North Carolina is one of eight states that requires a witness to sign a voter’s absentee ballot, and one of only three states that requires the ballot to be signed by two witnesses if a notary isn’t available. The other states are Alabama and Rhode Island. The information on the NCSL website was confirmed as accurate by conference spokeswoman Wendy Underhill. That doesn’t necessarily mean that North Carolina is the hardest state to return an absentee ballot. Alabama, in addition to requiring signatures from two witnesses or a notary, requires voters to submit a copy of a voter ID with his ballot. In Mississippi, Missouri and Oklahoma, you can’t have just any witness. The ballots are required to be signed by a notary. Rules for who qualifies for an absentee ballot vary by state, too.  State Senators Marcus and Chaudhuri said ""North Carolina is in the small minority of states that requires an absentee ballot to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public."" According to a nonpartisan organization that tracks state laws, NC is one of only three states (6 percent of the US) that requires absentee ballots to be signed by two witnesses or a notary public.

Donald Trump exaggerates number of untapped coronavirus testing labs
","At a coronavirus press conference, President Donald Trump said he has a newly assembled list of labs across the country that have the equipment needed to conduct tests for the novel coronavirus.  ""We provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states — many, many labs,"" Trump told reporters April 20. ""We’re providing you with the list. We’ll show it to you now if you need it. We’ll give you the details. But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able."" Is there a vast, untapped reservoir of labs at the states’ disposal? Not in the way Trump described it. Many labs exist, but it’s not yet clear they have the capacity and equipment needed to do the job. We asked the White House for the data to back up Trump’s assertion about hundreds of labs, but the press office declined to comment and did not provide the list Trump referenced. A spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said it couldn’t provide a tally of these untapped labs. The spokesperson there did point to the Food and Drug Administration, which lists 109 labs nationwide that are already offering COVID-19 testing. The FDA also has a separate list of labs that are processing tests under emergency authorization. That adds 18 for a total of 127.  But Trump was describing labs that could conduct tests, not ones that already were. White House press staff provided an image of a map that included any lab that had equipment for identifying the genetic sequence of a virus. The image quality was too low for counting each dot. But Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, and chair of the National Governors Association, said that not only were many on the list already known to officials in his state, they had reached out to them before.  
Credit: White House   ""We’ve been trying for over a month to get access to use labs, like at National Institutes of Health, with no success,"" Hogan said in an April 21 interview with MSNBC.   Even if the labs exist and are willing, it could be challenging to harness the capacity of new facilities identified by the White House in the anti-coronavirus fight. That’s because all these labs are outfitted for the work they do in non-COVID scenarios, whether in defense, agriculture, basic research, or some other area. Each lab has testing equipment designed to meet those particular needs. Testing experts say it’s unrealistic to expect that each of these labs is able to analyze any specimen it receives. ""Just because the machine exists, you can't will it to work,"" said Scott Becker,  Association of Public Health Laboratories chief executive officer. ""You can’t just show up with a sample, plug it in and expect it to work."" Louise Serio, spokeswoman for the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a trade group that includes the largest commercial labs, echoed the point that much depends on the kind of equipment — or ""platform"" — the lab has. Test kits vary. They can contain different materials for a different range of steps in the process, and some are more complete than others. They are not interchangeable. ""For a lab to run a manufacturer’s test kit on a platform, the materials have to match up — the test kit and the platform must be from the same manufacturer,"" Serio said. Part of the challenge of using any lab is that testing is a three-step process.  It starts by collecting the specimen with a swab, preserving it in a stable medium for transport, and doing all the data entry that clearly ties that particular specimen to the patient it came from. At the lab, the RNA from the specimen is extracted and amplified so that it can be identified in a testing machine.  Then the results are reviewed and shared with health care providers and public health departments. The first two steps are vulnerable to supply shortages — especially of the nasal swabs used to collect patient samples and the chemicals referred to as ""reagents"" that are needed to study them. States have been competing against each other and Washington for the same limited supply of essential goods, a situation that has become one of the primary constraints on testing in the U.S. At the April 20 press conference, Vice President Mike Pence said a team at Walter Reed Medical Center was calling the labs on the list to see what they would need in order to help meet testing needs. That outreach suggests that the government is still learning which labs are able to work with the states. Trump said he had a list with hundreds and hundreds of labs ""ready"" and ""able"" to provide coronavirus testing. The White House declined to provide the list, and the Health and Human Services Department did not provide a tally. The closest we found was a FDA list of about 130 labs nationwide.  The people who work with testing said that simply possessing the laboratory equipment to process tests is insufficient to pull off the assignment. The vice president described how the government was still in the process of learning which labs could do what. The labs exist, but the ready and able piece is a work in progress. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4BBB80>],/factchecks/2020/apr/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-number-untapped-coronavir/

Anti-vaxxers spread conspiracy about Bill Gates and India’s polio vaccination
","A popular conspiracy theory on Facebook digs into Bill Gates’ past to try to discredit his current efforts to speed up the development of a coronavirus vaccine. An April 13 post claims the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ""tested a polio vax in India between 2000 & 2017 and paralysed 496,000 chlidren."" ""Fact!"" the post reads. But it’s not. The post, which has been shared more than 16,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) PolitiFact reached out to the original poster, but we haven’t heard back. The Gates Foundation told us in an email that the post is false.  Still, we wanted to take a closer look. The source of the claim appears to be an April 7 Instagram post from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and one of the biggest sources of anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook. The post was subsequently covered by the BL, a pro-Trump website that has been known to publish misinformation. We found no credible news reports about  496,000 paralyzed children in India due to a polio vaccine. The Gates Foundation has long funded groups in India and elsewhere that seek to expand access to polio immunization. In March 2014, the World Health Organization declared that its Southeast Asia region was polio-free, in part because of the kinds of mass vaccination campaigns supported by the Gates Foundation. However, the virus remains a threat in South Asian countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to the WHO, it is possible to contract polio from vaccines — but it’s extremely rare. The agency estimates that 1 in 2.7 million oral doses results in vaccine-associated paralytic polio. Since the eradication of polio in India, there have been some scares of tainted vaccines. But data from the WHO show that, between 2000 and 2017, there were 17 cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus. The Facebook post comes amid a rash of other conspiracy theories about Gates and his connection to the coronavirus pandemic. We’ve fact-checked several false or misleading claims about the billionaire philanthropist, spanning from his purported financial interest in a COVID-19 vaccine to a bogus conspiracy about tracking Americans in lockdown.

A barcode won’t tell you if a product was made in China
","As American businesses struggle to stay afloat amid shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, calls to buy American-made products have been growing on social media. Also rearing its head online is anti-Asian and anti-Chinese sentiment, directed at the country where the novel coronavirus was first discovered.  One viral image from Facebook reads: ""Pick up a product. Look at the barcode. If the first 3 numbers are 690 or 691 or 692, the product was made in China. Put it down and buy from any other country."" The post misrepresents what the numbers that accompany a barcode indicate; they do not tell consumers where a product was made.  These claims appear to date back to a 2008 email chain, and they’ve been repeatedly dismissed as incorrect. The idea that barcodes indicate a product’s country of origin has been debunked through the years by outlets such as Snopes, Reuters, Lead Stories and Nationwide Barcode. Barcodes are found on nearly all consumer products worldwide. The black and white barcode on a product package is an electronically scannable image that is accompanied by product number, usually printed just below it. This number, called a Global Trade Item Number, identifies what a product is and the owner of the brand that makes it. Although several variations of product numbers are used around the world, a 12- or 13-digit product number is common. The Facebook post claims that the first two to three digits of a product number indicate a product’s country of origin. But this is not the case, according to GS1, the global nonprofit foundation that works with manufacturers to assign the unique product numbers used with barcodes. These first few digits, called a prefix, are significant: GS1 licenses prefixes to manufacturers so they can create unique product numbers and barcodes that identify their particular company as the owner. These company prefixes are based on a set of country codes. It’s true that 690 to 699 prefixes are assigned to GS1 China, but that doesn’t mean products with those prefixes are made there. GS1’s website notes that ""since GS1 member companies can manufacture products anywhere in the world, GS1 prefixes do not identify the country of origin for a given product."" Most products have written labels that indicate where they were made. For example, a box of anti-viral Kleenex tissues says, ""Made in the USA from domestic and imported material."" Nationwide Barcode, another outfit that sells EAN and UPC barcodes, confirms that the product number prefix does not indicate what country a product was made in. ""Whether you purchase a barcode prefix from the GS1 or purchase a barcode from a company like Nationwide Barcode, the barcode will indicate the country where the prefix originated, regardless of where that company has their products manufactured,"" says a Nationwide Barcode article. A viral image reads, ""Pick up a product. Look at the barcode. If the first 3 numbers are 690 or 691 or 692, the product was made in China."" The prefix of the number that accompanies a barcode does not indicate what country the product was manufactured in. While GS1 assigns prefixes to companies based on a set of country codes, those companies can manufacture their products anywhere in the world.

Marco Rubio says CNN debate had no question on debt and little about the economy
","The high polling numbers for the GOP presidential field’s ""outsider"" candidates are in part the result of the media refusing to discuss substantive issues, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Rubio said on the Sept. 20, 2015, episode of This Week that political newcomers like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson were seeing success because people were tired of establishment candidates. But the CNN debate earlier in the week in Simi Valley, Calif., also showed that coverage isn’t focused on the country’s problems, he said. ""I don’t think it’s limited to the politicians, it’s also the media,"" Rubio said. ""We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy. It was a constant he-said-she-said, what do you say because so-and-so called you this name or that name."" What did the candidates really discuss during the debate? We reviewed the transcript and wouldn’t say there was ""no discussion"" about the debt, but Rubio has a point there was little said about the economy. The economy We’ll actually start with how much the candidates said about the economy, because it came up first, much in the way Rubio described. (We reached out to his campaign for more on this but didn’t hear back.) After lengthy discussions about Trump’s worthiness as a candidate, Russia’s involvement in Syria, Congress attempting to defund Planned Parenthood, immigration and other issues, moderator Jake Tapper switched gears. ""We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs,"" he acknowledged, but used the pivot to asked Fiorina to respond to Trump’s criticism of her record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. Fiorina then recounted her history with the company, before mentioning voter concerns over the nation’s $18 trillion debt as an attack on Trump. ""There are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money,"" Fiorina said to Trump. ""That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times, a record four times."" Tapper later asked questions about the minimum wage and tax policy, which one could argue are related to the economy. But he asked no direct questions about job creation or debt. Still, candidates did mention the economy as they addressed other questions. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that when he left Congress, ""we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming."" He implied his time as a congressman from 1982 to 2001 will help him find consensus as president to ""create a stronger economy for everybody."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pointed out Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton’s call for a higher minimum wage is ""her answer to grow the economy."" Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee mentioned that finding cures to cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s will save the country trillions, and would ""change the economy and the country."" Rubio, meanwhile, discussed the economy when answering a question about climate change. He said disregarding alarms raised by ""the left-wing government"" was necessary because ""every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America."" ""We are not going to destroy our economy,"" he said. ""We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely."" New Jersey Gov. Christie also made mention of agreeing with Rubio that ""we shouldn't be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate."" Back in April, PolitiFact checked a statement by Rubio that ""with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy."" We rated it False. The national debt So candidates did discuss the economy, though with little in the way of concrete plans. There also were a few mentions of the national debt, in addition to Fiorina’s attack on Trump. Christie cited debt service as a major portion of what the federal budget is stuck dealing with. ""Seventy one percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service,"" he said. Bush said his 4 percent economic growth plan will ""deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt,"" but didn’t discuss specifics about controlling projected costs. Rubio brought up the national debt while trading barbs with Trump; Rubio mentioned the debt as a symptom of Washington dysfunction.   ""You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it,"" Rubio said. ""We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy."" He’s right there was very little mention of the economy, but the national debt was brought up by some of the 11 candidates, usually while addressing an opponent. We should note that even then, no one gave any specifics about what to do beyond some broad talking points.

Rove says 2012 nomination fight saw many poll leaders over the months
","A major poll conducted soon after the second Republican presidential debate showed a huge bump for former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. A survey by CNN found Fiorina shot from 3 percent in early September to 15 percent now, putting her in a statistical tie for second with physician Ben Carson. Real estate billionaire Donald Trump still leads with 24 percent, but he’s down 8 points from the last CNN poll. The pundits had lots to say about a fluid field. Karl Rove warned against taking any lead in the polls too seriously at this point. ""Let's just remember, we are at the beginning of this process,"" Rove said on Fox News Sunday on Sept. 20, 2015. ""As of now, in 2012, Rick Perry was ahead at 29.9 percent, and we had seven more leads before it finally settled on Mitt Romney on Feb. 28 of 2012. "" Rove said the Republicans might not settle on a nominee until March or even April. We thought it would be interesting to look back at the 2012 Republican contest and see if the ""yellow jersey"" moved around as much as Rove said. The GOP strategist was largely correct. The 2012 election polls Rove’s office told us his source was an interactive chart on RealClearPolitics.com. The bright lines show the rise and fall of several of the candidates. Perry reached 29.9 percent on Sept. 17, 2011, and had fallen slightly to 28.2 percent on Sept. 20, 2011. So that’s very close to what Rove cited.  Source: RealClearPolitics.com We looked for each candidate’s highest poll average in each period when the lead changed hands. If we take the poll numbers at face value, the lead shifted nine times before Romney took it, held it and went on to win the nomination. For the purists, since most polls have a margin of error of at least 3 percent, we could discount those times when the lead was statistically doubtful. If we did that, we would still end up with six lead changes in the period Rove described. We should note that the lead sometimes went back to a previous lead holder. Overall, five candidates shared the lead: Romney, Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Candidate Date Overall % Lead Perry Sept. 20 28.2 8.6 Romney Oct. 10 21.9 5.5 Cain Nov. 3 26 2.2 Romney Nov. 12 22.5 0.5 Gingrich Dec. 13 35 12.7 Romney Jan. 18 33.1 14.8 Gingrich Jan. 27 29.3 2.3 Romney Feb. 8 34.5 11.7 Santorum Feb. 18 34.3 6.6 Romney Feb. 29 33 1.7 Source: RealClearPolitics.com Other polls Individual polls from different polling groups generally show a fair bit of movement, but not as much as the aggregated numbers that Rove used. For example, the Pew Research Center poll showed four lead changes. The Fox News poll also came up with four. These surveys were not done as frequently as all the polls that fed into RealClearPolitics.com's average, and so they might miss relatively brief periods when the lead bounced back and forth among Romney, Gingrich, Cain and Santorum. Flighty voters in the early months The 2012 Republican nomination saw a robust number of competitors. The race this year is even more crowded. Martin Cohen, a political scientist at James Madison University, said this all feeds into ""the media's fetish with the new and exciting."" Cohen places very little importance at polls at this point. ""Voters are influenced by media coverage and the post-debate spin,""he told us. ""But it doesn't mean that is the way they will ultimately vote or even whether they will vote at all."" Cohen said if you want to spot the real leaders, keep track of who snags the best and most influential endorsements. Our ruling Rove said the leader in the race for the Republican nomination changed seven times between September 2011 and the end of February 2012. Using the polling average numbers, that is a fair summary, and some might argue that the lead moved around even more. We found that five individual candidates -- Perry, Romney, Cain, Gingrich and Santorum -- handed the lead back and forth during that time period. Looking at individual polls, the lead might shift less often, but the window on the race those polls offer is not as detailed as the method Rove used. There might be minor quibbles about the exact tally, but Rove was in the ballpark.

Ken Block sees smoke, but how big is the fire?
","Ken Block is the former candidate for governor who strongly believes Rhode Islanders are paying far too much for an army of firefighters. In March, Block and his organization, Watchdog RI, released a research project that detailed the cost of firefighting in the state and compared costs here to other parts of the country. Block is proud of that work, and during an appearance on WPRI’s ""Newsmakers"" on Aug. 23 he said: ""When we studied firefighting costs in Rhode Island relative to other places, we determined that the cost of fire in Rhode Island is anywhere from 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive than anywhere else we could find."" In fact, Block told us his statement to ""Newsmakers"" had actually understated the difference, based on his latest review of the numbers. But it was also clear that the type of source information needed for a full vetting of Watchdog RI’s determination would not be forthcoming. More on that later. First, we needed to understand more about those percentages that Block used when he said Rhode Island was 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive. He said he had used them to convey the range of differences between the more expensive firefighting costs in Rhode Island and less expensive costs in other areas of the country that the Watchdog report analyzes for comparison purposes. Watchdog RI did not compare Rhode Island with every other community in the country. Far from it. The report compares Rhode Island’s firefighting costs with costs in some huge cities that Block acknowledges do not make good comparisons with Rhode Island. It also compares Rhode Island costs with costs in some areas that Block says match up well, especially when juxtaposed, not with Rhode Island as a whole, but with the eastern portion of the state. The Watchdog RI report calls this region Metropolitan Rhode Island because its population and land area is suitable for comparison with other urban areas in other states. The report also provides a per-capita fire cost for for Metro RI and also for Rhode Island as a state. Both figures, the $350 per capita for Metro RI and $315 for the state as whole, were for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2014. Both figures were based on the cost of 66 different fire departments and fire districts, as reported in responses to Watchdog RI’s information requests or in financial documents, according to Block. Both the $350-per-capita figure and the $315 exceed per-capita spending amounts in each of the 10 communities that Watchdog RI’s report compares to Rhode Island. Per-capita spending in Miami was the closest. Metro RI came in at 35 percent more expensive, according to Block. At the other end of the spectrum, Metro RI came in at 180 percent more expensive than Orange County, Florida. When comparing Rhode Island as a state, Block also found Rhode Island’s costs were 41 percent more than New York City and 116 percent more expensive than Los Angeles. We went online and checked out the financial reports that Block cited as his source for firefighting costs in other places and Block appeared to be in the ballpark. But Block did not provide the same type of source material that he gave for the 10 communities outside of Rhode Island to back up his claim about the costs of firefighting in Rhode Island. Watchdog RI’s report posted on its website has no appendix or footnotes. Block told us he was unwilling to spend the time needed to go through the budgetary information that his team had gathered, nor could he give us citations for that information. That would take more than 40 hours, he said, adding that it was time he did not have on the heels of a reporting effort that had consumed 500 hours. So we were on our own. And although we were unwilling to check in with all 66 Rhode Island fire districts, we did look at the adopted fire department budgets of the state’s five largest cities: Providence, Warwick, Cranston, Pawtucket and East Providence. The total amount of budgeted spending for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2014, came to $121.9 million. And the total population for the five cities added up to 460,984 people. This created a per-capita fire cost of $264 for Rhode Island’s five largest cities. That’s significantly less than Block’s per-capita spending amount for Metro RI of $350, but it still exceeds per-capita spending amounts in other areas that Watchdog RI selected for comparison. Before you put too much stock in these comparisons, consider this: Block says he suspected the Rhode Island numbers did not  include pension costs, which are a major line item. Therefore, we removed pension costs for the five Rhode Island cities we looked at. But for the comparison communities, we discovered that spending that he cited for Orange County and Miami did include pension costs; $12.6 million in Orange County and $23.7 million in Miami, but the Los Angeles number did not. It’s a muddle. Put simply, we’re not sure Block is comparing apples to apples. And Block, as an aside, told us he wasn’t sure the spending calculation for Providence included health-care expenses.   Our ruling On ""Newsmakers,"" Block said:  ""When we studied firefighting costs in Rhode Island relative to other places, we determined that the cost of fire in Rhode Island is anywhere from 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive than anywhere else we could find."" However, the determination itself isn’t that reliable without an appendix and without consistent data, especially in regards to pension costs. Perhaps, Block and his team should just finish their reporting job. For those reasons, the judges rate his claim Half True.   (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)",[<zip object at 0x0000028097839B80>],/factchecks/2015/sep/20/kenneth-block/ken-block-sees-smoke-how-big-fire/

Rep. Dale Kooyenga says the UW System is larger than any business in Wisconsin
","As students return to campuses across the state, the impact of the GOP-led $250 million two-year budget cut to the University of Wisconsin System -- combined with the extension of a tuition freeze -- is drawing new attention. On some campuses, the cuts proposed by Gov. Scott Walker and enacted by the Legislature as part of the 2015-’17 budget might reduce the number of campus jobs available for students. Meanwhile, there have been layoffs and early retirement offers. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield), a member of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, defended the cuts during an Aug. 31, 2015 appearance on Charlie Sykes’ talk show on WTMJ (AM 620). ""I think they can find ways to save money,"" Kooyenga said, adding that the Republicans who control state government chose the UW cuts instead of raising taxes. He expressed confidence that the system could handle the reductions because the cuts are small in relation to the UW System’s overall size. (The system’s overall annual budget is $6.1 billion). Kooyenga added: ""The university system is larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin."" That caught our attention, in part because there are a number of large Wisconsin-based businesses, including well-known names like Kohl’s, Menard and Johnson Controls. And, of course, there’s Walmart, which has several major distribution centers and 105 stores in the state, including 81 supercenters. There are a number of ways to measure the size of a business. Kooyenga’s aide Rachel Geary said her boss was using the most logical one -- number of employees. So how does the UW System stack up? According to its website, the system employed : 40,975 as of the end of fiscal year 2014. (A decade earlier the figure was 36,989.) How does that compare with the private sector? Kooyenga’s office offered several lists. For instance, one compiled by Newsmax, a conservative media outlet, said the top private employer was Eau Claire-based home improvement retail chain Menard Inc. (""over 10,000""). Also on the list was Epic Systems in Verona (""nearly 7,000"") and Thedacare in Appleton (""over 6,000). Kooyenga’s office also forwarded an email from Walmart -- the nation’s  largest employer -- that said the company has 30,095 employees in Wisconsin. Other big employers include Aurora HealthCare, with about 25,000 in southeastern Wisconsin. Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s has about 10,000 employees in corporate offices and stores around Wisconsin, a company spokeswoman said. And then there’s the largest public company based in Wisconsin, Johnson Controls with about 3,400 employees in the Milwaukee area. All fall short of UW when it comes to employees. Another measuring stick There are other ways to measure the size of a business, including annual revenue. The UW System has annual revenue of about $4.8 billion, on a budget of about $6.1 billion. But the university system is not designed as a profit-generating enterprise. As such, there are plenty of public and private companies based in Wisconsin with higher annual revenue. For instance, Johnson Controls is at $42.5 billion, Milwaukee-based Manpower is $20 billion, Kohl’s $19 billion, according to their annual financial reports. S.C. Johnson, the state’s largest privately based company, has annual revenue of $9.6 billion, according to an estimate by Forbes Another key difference, of course, is that the UW System operates within Wisconsin. Geary, the Kooyenga aide, said it was misleading to compare the system with corporations that generate revenue around the world. ""For example, Johnson Controls has a plant in China, then sells in China (and) that revenue is showing up at Johnson Controls,"" she said in an email. ""But the vast majority of the revenue (especially with the US heavy tax burdened on overseas profit) never makes it to Wisconsin and the related employees are primarily outside Wisconsin. Compare that to UW where 99% of the revenue is received and spent in state."" Our rating Kooyenga said that the UW System is ""larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin."" He’s right when you consider employment within Wisconsin, which is the most obvious way to make such a comparison. By other measurements, such as annual revenue, there are many Wisconsin-based companies that are larger than UW. But that creates more of an apples-and-oranges comparison. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972F4440>],/factchecks/2015/sep/18/dale-kooyenga/rep-dale-kooyenga-says-uw-system-larger-any-busine/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Legal Issues', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul says legality of birthright citizenship not fully adjudicated due to facts of 1898 case
","With illegal immigration zooming to the top of the Republican presidential primary agenda, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is taking aim at the concept of ""birthright citizenship"" -- the notion that someone born on United States soil automatically qualifies for U.S. citizenship. During the second GOP debate held at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., one of the CNN moderators, Jake Tapper, asked Paul, ""Where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?"" Paul referenced the 1898 Supreme Court case United States vs. Wong Kim Ark. ""The case that was decided around 1900 was -- people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens,"" Paul said. ""There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens. So it hasn't really been completely adjudicated."" We wondered whether Paul is right that ""there's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens."" The Wong Kim Ark case Wong Kim Ark, a laborer, was born in 1873 in San Francisco. His parents were of Chinese descent but lived legally in the United States. Around age 17, he left for a temporary visit to China, and returned to the United States without incident. Then, around age 21, he left again for a visit to China, but at the end of that trip, he was denied re-entry to the United States because the collector of customs argued that he was not a U.S. citizen. (This was no small distinction -- it was the era of anti-immigrant strictures known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts.) The Supreme Court framed the case this way in its majority decision: The question presented by the record is whether a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" The majority ruled that Wong -- and others born on United States soil, with a few clear exceptions -- did indeed qualify for citizenship under the 14th Amendment, which reads in part, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."" The majority wrote: The Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes. The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States. So what does this mean for Paul’s claim? He is right that the facts of Wong Kim Ark didn’t concern illegal immigrants who had a child while on U.S. soil. Rather, Wong’s parents were in the United States legally when he was born. ""Sen. Paul is correct,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University law professor. ""Wong Kim Ark was a child of parents who resided legally in the United States. The Supreme Court has not ruled explicitly on a citizenship case involving children born in the United States to undocumented parents."" How much do the facts of the Wong Kim Ark case matter for the future of birthright citizenship? In the debate, Paul essentially argued that because the 1898 Supreme Court case didn’t directly address birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, that issue remains to be fully adjudicated. That argument is much more controversial. One scholar who supports Paul’s view is John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University. Without getting too far into the weeds, Eastman and others who share his view see the 14th Amendment phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States as pivotal. In a recent article, Eastman decried ""widespread ignorance about the meaning of the word ‘jurisdiction.’ "" Eastman wrote that undocumented immigrants, like foreign tourists, ""are subject to our laws by their presence within our borders, but they are not subject to the more complete jurisdiction envisioned by the 14th Amendment as a precondition for automatic citizenship."" For this reason, Eastman argues, the ruling in Wong Kim Ark ""does not mandate citizenship for children born to those who are unlawfully present in the United States, and it does not even mandate citizenship for those who are visiting the United States temporarily but lawfully."" However, a majority of legal scholars said Paul’s focus on the facts of this particular 1898 case leaves out context. They argue that the majority’s ruling offered a ringing endorsement of birthright citizenship -- a stance that runs contrary to the idea that the justices intended to hand down a carefully restrained and limited decision. ""In Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court relied on common law, going back to cases decided in England before the American Revolution, to hold that any person born on U.S. soil and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is a U.S. citizen,"" Yale-Loehr said. ""I am confident that if a case arose involving a child born in the United States to undocumented parents, the Supreme Court would rule the same way."" Scholars who share this view add that the Supreme Court has had ample opportunity to overturn its precedent in the succeeding decades but has never done so. Finally, these scholars say, more than a century of longstanding practical precedent should also count for something. This is not simply a standoff between left-leaning and right-leaning scholars. John Yoo, a conservative University of California-Berkeley law professor, has taken a high-profile stance against the position Paul articulated. ""The Court read the 14th Amendment to recognize the existing American practice of granting citizenship based on birthplace,"" Yoo wrote. ""It saw no support for a new exclusion of the children of aliens, (writing) ‘The Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens.’ "" Eleanor May, a spokeswoman for Paul, stood by the senator’s claim. ""There is a difference between 'adjudicated' and 'longstanding legal consensus,' "" she said. ""Has the case been completely adjudicated? No. "" Our ruling Paul said ""there's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens."" Paul is right that the landmark Supreme Court case on this issue didn’t address the specific example of a child born to undocumented immigrants. But he ignores the sweeping language in support of birthright citizenship in the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the fact that the ruling continues to stand more than a century later, and the longstanding practice of granting citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809757EA40>],/factchecks/2015/sep/18/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-legality-birthright-citizenship-not/

Obama is Muslim, audience member says to Donald Trump -- in 2015
","We thought (hoped, maybe) the idea that President Barack Obama is Muslim from Kenya was dead and buried. But even in 2015, it lives on. This myth has been debunked over and over and over again. We’ve been fact-checking claims about this since 2007, the year PolitiFact went live. Yet it resurfaced Sept. 17, 2015 in Rochester, N.H., at a town hall event for Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump. An unidentified audience member asked the first question: What would President Trump would do about Muslims in the United States? Here’s the exchange. Audience member: ""We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. You know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American."" Trump: ""We need this question. This is the first question."" Audience member: ""Anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?"" Trump: ""We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. You know, a lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening. We're going to be looking at that and plenty of other things."" Trump was immediately criticized for not countering the man’s comments -- both the assertion that Muslims are a ""problem"" and that Obama is one. A recent CNN poll found that 29 percent of Americans and 43 percent of Republicans think Obama is Muslim. Let’s revisit why we know this is not true. (He’s actually Protestant.) Muslim? In 2010, we rated the statement ""President Obama is a Muslim"" Pants on Fire. Our fact-checking has shown that Obama is a Christian. According to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. (He was not raised in any particular faith as a child.) Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. In office, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. PolitiFact has debunked claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. Why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? One explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another possible explanation is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion like to associate him with something they perceive to be negative. Born in Kenya? The audience member also said Obama isn’t an American. In case you’ve forgotten, back in 2011 and 2012, Trump argued that Obama wasn’t really eligible to be president because he was born in Kenya, not the United States. This is also not true -- Obama was born in Honolulu. PolitiFact went to great lengths to document Obama’s Hawaii birth certificate. See our guide to Obama’s birth certificate. As part of his ""birther"" crusade, Trump said in 2011, Obama's ""grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth."" The claim is based on an Oct. 16, 2008, telephone call between Bishop Ron McRae of the Anabaptist Churches of North America and Sarah Obama of Kenya, Barack Obama's elderly step-grandmother. In the call, we hear a very rough Swahili-to-English translation in which an elderly woman agreed to a leading question that Obama was born in Kenya and that she was present. But the grandmother and translator immediately, clearly and repeatedly corrected the answer to say that Obama was born in the United States, and she was not present. We rated Trump’s claim False. Just this year, an image circulating on Facebook accused Obama of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration in choosing to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America’s tallest mountain. The image said, ""‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’"" In reality, Denali means ""high"" or ""tall"" in a native Alaskan language and has been used by native Alaskans as a name for the mountain for generations. Pants on Fire! Our ruling An audience member at a Trump campaign event said, ""You know our current president is (Muslim). You know he's not even an American."" PolitiFact and others have repeatedly debunked both of these claims -- that Obama is Muslim and that he wasn’t born in America. Against all odds, they live on. Obama is Christian and was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.

"['Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Obama called potential attack on Syria a 'pinprick,' Rubio says
","Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida defended a 2013 vote not to authorize President Barack Obama to use military force in Syria by saying the strategy wasn’t worth risking American lives. During a presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 16, 2015, radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt asked Donald Trump if he thought three senators — Rubio, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky — who opposed intervention against Syrian President Bashar Assad were now responsible for the current Syrian refugee crisis. Rubio defended his stance after Trump said he thought they were partly to blame. ""We have zero responsibility, because let’s remember what the president said,"" Rubio said. ""He said the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks."" Rubio went on to say he wanted a strategy that would put ""men and women in a position where they can win."" Obama’s Syria policy has been a target for Republicans during the campaign, but did Obama refer to potential strikes against Assad as ""a pinprick"" attack? Pinning down strategy  We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s campaign when we contacted them, but the crux of his reference is Obama’s response to Assad’s chemical weapons attack against civilians in 2013. While initially planning a military response against the Syrian government, Obama suddenly switched gears on Aug. 31. He announced he would first ask Congress to authorize intervention, likely starting with surgical missile strikes from Navy destroyers — an approach that faced questionable results, according to a July 2013 report from the Institute for the Study of War. Involving Congress was widely seen as a political gamble to bring lawmakers into the decision to move against Syria. Prior to that, Obama had struggled with whether to act unilaterally, without support from the American public, Congress, the United Nations or U.S. allies. Obama did use the term ""pinprick"" several times, but he used the word to say that's what he was not doing. Take, for example, an interview blitz on Sept. 9. Obama told Savannah Guthrie on the Today show that day that ""the U.S. does not do pinpricks. Our military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria."" Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution’s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us the term ""pinprick"" certainly is not a technical description of any kind of military strike. But in his experience, when the word is used, ""it is always pejorative."" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who favored military action in Syria, questioned Obama’s commitment to using force. McCain said on Face the Nation on Sept. 1 that he had wondered whether surgical strikes are ""just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America."" By Sept. 4, Rubio and Paul voted against a Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution allowing Obama to use limited force against Assad’s regime. (Cruz, who was not on the committee, made it clear he would have opposed the resolution.) It passed by a 10-7 vote and was sent to the Senate. Meanwhile, during a hearing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strategy in Syria on Sept. 4, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel tried to dispel notions Obama wasn’t planning an effective response. ""The president has said ... this would not be a pinprick. Those were his words. This would be a significant strike that would in fact degrade his capability,"" Hagel said. Now, Obama’s case wasn’t necessarily helped when then-Secretary of State John Kerry gave the opposite message on Sept. 9, saying during a meeting in Britain that the United States planned an ""unbelievably small, limited kind of effort."" But the strikes, pinpricks or not, never happened. Facing shaky support in the Senate, Obama asked majority leader Harry Reid to pull the measure.   On Sept. 10, Obama said in an address to the nation from the White House that he would postpone a military solution, but was committed to his stance that future intervention was a possibility. ""As some members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria,"" Obama said. ""Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks."" A year later, Rubio voted in favor of arming Syrian rebels, which Paul and Cruz opposed. Our ruling Rubio claimed Obama said an attack on Syria ""was going to be a pinprick."" In reality, Obama said the exact opposite of that, stating several times that a U.S. military response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons on its citizens would involve a significant show of force. While the president’s full strategy was somewhat unclear, at the debate Rubio echoed Obama’s own past statements that the U.S. military was not built for small-scale engagements that could be characterized as ""pinpricks.""

"['Foreign Policy', 'Nuclear', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says Iran deal ""trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves""
","With a dash of imagined dialogue, Ted Cruz of Texas made his case for the United States not to support the agreement backed by most Democrats, including President Barack Obama, that would allow Iran to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons and bring an end to longstanding economic sanctions. The Republican senator and presidential candidate told the Greater Houston Partnership on Sept. 1, 2015, that the Iran deal doesn’t lead to independent inspectors marching in. ""This deal,"" Cruz said, ""doesn’t send in American inspectors; this deal doesn’t send international inspectors. This deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. Let me repeat that: This deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themself."" Cruz said as much again at the Sept. 16, 2015, GOP presidential debate in California. ""And most astonishingly,"" Cruz said, ""this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever."" In Houston, Cruz likened the self-inspection element to a scene from ""Scarface,"" the 1980 movie starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant intent on taking over a drug cartel. ""This is the equivalent,"" Cruz said, ""of law enforcement picking up the phone and calling Tony Montana and saying, ‘Hey Tony, you got any drugs?’ ""‘I don’t got no drugs.’ ""‘Thank you, Tony.’ ""That,"" Cruz said, ""is essentially the Iranian nuclear inspection regime."" Setting aside Cruz’s cinematic vignette, is he right the Iran deal, which the Senate fell short of rejecting in a Sept. 10, 2015, vote, trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves? Cruz’s office told us he concluded as much based on reporting by the Associated Press on a confidential ""side agreement"" about how an international agency will check conditions at a longtime Iranian military-industrial site. Spokesman Phil Novack also said by email that Cruz ""has participated in multiple intelligence briefings -- both classified and unclassified -- about this Iranian deal. Without revealing the details of those briefings, they are entirely consistent with the public reports that the so-called inspections regime simply entrusts Iran with inspecting itself."" We’ll get to more of Cruz’s backup. Longstanding safeguards First it’s worth noting international inspections of Iranian facilities date back decades. By phone, Jeffrey Lewis, publisher of armscontrolwonk.com, which presents blogs on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, told us that like many nations, Iran has previously committed to ""safeguards"" agreements reached with the  International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations entity entrusted with monitoring nuclear non-proliferation commitments. The agreements confirm the IAEA’s power to check on the possible development of nuclear weapons. A 1974 agreement, for instance, gives the agency authority to monitor ""all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of Iran, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere, for the exclusive purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices."" Separate from that, Lewis said, the UN agency maintains confidential agreements with the many nations it monitors, including, he said, details on where cameras might be placed inside specific facilities. Typically, the IAEA says, its negotiated safeguards exist to ""to deter the spread of nuclear weapons by early detection of misuse of nuclear material or technology, thereby providing credible assurances that states are honoring their legal obligations. The IAEA plays a crucial independent verification role,"" it says, ""aimed at assuring the international community that nuclear material, facilities and other items subject to safeguards are used only for peaceful purposes. A 24-page agency safeguards booklet, dated June 2015, notes the agency won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. The booklet calls the safeguards a ""set of technical measures that allow the IAEA to independently verify a state’s legal commitment not to divert nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices."" Some 182 countries have safeguards agreements, the booklet says. ""Nuclear material subject to safeguards includes special fissionable material from which nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices could readily be made (e.g. plutonium-239; uranium-233; uranium enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233) and source material (e.g. natural uranium, depleted uranium or thorium), which cannot be directly used for nuclear weapons,"" the booklet says. But there’s room for suspicion. We noticed a passage suggesting the agency earlier caught Iran not complying with its oversight--and that was addressed: In 2002, information came to light regarding previously undeclared nuclear material and activities that the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) should have declared but had not declared to the IAEA. At time of writing, while the IAEA continues to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material at the nuclear facilities and LOFs declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement, the IAEA is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities. In November 2013, the IAEA and Iran agreed on a Framework for Cooperation, within which verification activities are being implemented by the IAEA to resolve all present and past issues. The 2015 agreement The July 14, 2015, agreement, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was negotiated with Iran by world powers including the United States and Russia. And far as we can tell, it’s silent about Iran getting to inspect its own facilities. Per the agreement, the IAEA will have Iran’s permission for 15 years to ""implement continuous monitoring, including through containment and surveillance measures, as necessary, to verify that stored centrifuges and infrastructure remain in storage, and are only used to replace failed or damaged centrifuges."" A section in the nearly 160-page deal on modern technologies and the IAEA’s long-term presence states Iran will permit the agency to use equipment that relays changes in nuclear enrichment to IAEA inspectors plus other technologies. Also, the agreement says, Iran will facilitate automated collections of measurements from nuclear sites. That section goes on: Iran will make the necessary arrangements to allow for a long-term IAEA presence, including issuing long-term visas, as well as providing proper working space at nuclear sites and, with best efforts, at locations near nuclear sites in Iran for the designated IAEA inspectors for working and keeping necessary equipment. Iran will increase the number of designated IAEA inspectors to the range of 130-150 within 9 months from the date of the implementation of the JCPOA, and will generally allow the designation of inspectors from nations that have diplomatic relations with Iran, consistent with its laws and regulations. Cruz cites a news story In an email to Novack, Cruz's spokesman, we noted the inspection mentions in the agreement. Novack replied by pointing out other language in the agreement that he said shows Iran will be providing information to the IAEA to create a baseline for future action. ""This does not mean the information Iran initially reports is complete. In these circumstances, we are trusting Iran to give us necessary information,"" Novack said. Novack singled out references in the agreement to Iran providing information enabling the international agency to verify production of ""uranium ore concentrate"" and to track centrifuge rotor tubes and bellows as well as ""heavy water stocks"" associated with nuclear power. The sections also provide for the IAEA to verify and continuously monitor such items. The spokesman earlier said that Cruz reached his conclusion about the deal trusting Iran to inspect itself  from an August 2015 AP news story indicating the IAEA agreed to let Iran inspect Parchin, a military-industrial site in the country that critics once accused Iran of using to develop nuclear weapons. The AP’s Vienna-datelined Aug. 20, 2015, news story said its reporter had obtained ""one of the side arrangements between the IAEA and Iran in regards to inspecting Parchin"" in Iran. The story presented what the AP described as the transcript of the original draft agreement between the IAEA and Iran ""covering inspections at the Parchin military site, where Iran has been accused of pursuing nuclear weapons development a decade ago."" The story also noted the Parchin agreement was ""separate from the much broader Iran nuclear deal signed by Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers in July"" 2015. Below is most of the transcript of the draft document which the AP says that two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed as not differing from the final agreement between the IAEA and Iran: Separate arrangement II agreed by the Islamic State of Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency on 11 July 2015, regarding the Road-map, Paragraph 5 1. Iran will provide to the Agency photos of the locations, including those identified in paragraph 3 below, which would be mutually agreed between Iran and the Agency, taking into account military concerns. 2. Iran will provide to the Agency videos of the locations, including those identified in paragraph 3 below, which would be mutually agreed between Iran and the Agency, taking into account military concerns. 3. Iran will provide to the Agency 7 environmental samples taken from points inside one building already identified by the Agency and agreed by Iran, and 2 points outside of the Parchin complex which would be agreed between Iran and the Agency. 4. The Agency will ensure the technical authenticity of the activities referred to in paragraphs 1-3 above. Activities will be carried out using Iran's authenticated equipment, consistent with technical specifications provided by the Agency, and the Agency's containers and seals. A day earlier, an AP news story said the Parchin agreement allowed Iran to use its own inspectors on the site rather than leaving that to the IAEA, which ""normally carries out such work."" That story said the Parchin agreement was worked out between the IAEA and Iran, with the U.S. and the other world powers involved in the larger Iran deal not being party to it, though the nations were briefed, the story said, and they ""endorsed it as part of the larger package."" The Parchin agreement, the AP story said, ""diverges from normal procedures by allowing Tehran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence of activities it has consistently denied — trying to develop nuclear weapons. Olli Heinonen, who was in charge of the Iran probe as deputy IAEA director general from 2005 to 2010, said he could think of no similar concession with any other country."" IAEA says ‘safeguards standards’ not compromised We emailed the IAEA about Cruz’s claim and didn’t hear back. But after the AP story broke, the agency’s director general, Yukiya Amano, issued a statement saying he couldn’t release separate agreements with countries without violating confidentiality. Suggestions the agency had given responsibility for nuclear inspections to Iran, Amano added, ""misrepresent the way in which we will undertake this important verification work."" Amano also said the side arrangements ""are technically sound and consistent with our long-established practices. They do not compromise our safeguards standards in any way."" Other analyses In August 2015, Heinonen, a Harvard University researcher who spent more than 25 years with the IAEA, wrote an oped article about the described Parchin side deal stating that if ""the reporting is accurate, these"" inspection ""procedures appear to be risky, departing significantly from well-established and proven safeguards practices. At a broader level, if verification standards have been diluted for Parchin (or elsewhere) and limits imposed, the ramification is significant as it will affect the IAEA’s ability to draw definitive conclusions with the requisite level of assurances and without undue hampering of the verification process."" Heinonen called for the described document to be made public by the IAEA and Iran, with U.S. support, accompanied by explanations responding to concerns about the Parchin process. To our inquiry, Heinonen pointed by email another confidential side agreement as noted by the IAEA in its ""road-map"" to clarify outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program. That July 14, 2015, document says the IAEA and Iran agreed on a ""separate arrangement"" premised on Iran this year answering agency questions per ""possible ambiguities"" leading up to the general agreement taking effect. Heinonen told us observers need to be able to see relevant side agreements before concluding Iran is being allowed to inspect itself. ""To this end, we are missing facts...By having such facts on the table, we can assess the IAEA approach on this issue,"" Heinonen wrote. To our inquiries, other arms control experts mostly told us the side agreement described by the AP doesn’t show Iran is going to be left to inspect itself. Lewis, referring to the reported Parchin agreement, said: ""This is a one-time managed access to a single facility by the IAEA. It is not the procedure for any other inspection. It is specially designed to answer questions relating to work carried out at this site between 1996-2002."" Similarly, Justin Logan, director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute, told us by email it’s worth keeping in mind it takes ample ""fissile material"" to make a nuclear weapon and ""large infrastructure."" At Iran’s known facilities where uranium enrichment is taking or has taken place, Logan said, IAEA inspectors will be present and have daily access. By phone, Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which has encouraged Congress to support the agreement, called Cruz’s claim an ""absolutely incorrect"" mischaracterization. Kimball said that even at the Parchin site, he believes the IAEA will provide information ""about where they want to sample at the site, which areas they want to soil or surface samples to see if there is individual radioactive material in these areas."" Then, Kimball said, ""the Iranian specialists in the presence of the IAEA inspectors will actually do the scooping, the swiping."" After that, Kimball said, whatever is collected will be ""put into packages the IAEA will take possession of (and) take to their labs for testing. By email, Kimball also pointed us to an Aug. 21, 2015, opinion article in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, headlined: ""No, Iran is not allowed to inspect itself."" In the piece, Mark Hibbs and Thomas Shea, experts on IAEA safeguards, spell out their expectation that IAEA officials would keep a close watch on Iranian staff gathering samples at Parchin and ensure the samples reached U.N. labs without being tainted. Iran, the two wrote, ""will not be allowed to inspect itself."" Another association official, Kelsey Davenport, followed up with an email noting that NBC News, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said in an Aug. 19, 2015, news story that Iran would be allowed to inspect Parchin itself only regarding signs of past military activity and still, U.N. inspectors ""would be on site to supervise the Iranians at every step of the way,"" NBC said. Davenport also pointed out an Aug. 20, 2015, post on the Arms Control Association’s website by Tariq Rauf, director of the Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In the post, Rauf asserted that even if Iranians were permitted to collect samples at Parchin, IAEA officials would be present to ensure no monkey business. Rauf went on: ""It would be unusual but by no means technically compromising to have Iranian technicians collect swipe samples at sites and locations at Parchin in the physical presence and direct line of sight of IAEA inspectors, including filming, and using swipe kits and collection bags provided by the IAEA. The agency inspectors then would seal the bags containing the swipe samples; they could leave behind one sealed bag at the IAEA office in Iran as a ‘control’ to be used if there is a dispute later about the results. The other three or four bags of swipe samples would be taken by the IAEA"" to UN laboratories for testing. We also reached Fred Fleitz, author of a July 2015 National Review article stating Iranians would be permitted to collect samples for the IAEA at Parchin. Fleitz, a senior official with the conservative Center for Security Policy, which focuses on national security in the belief that national power must be preserved and properly used, said by phone that Cruz‘s Houston claim implied ""the Iranians are going to do all the inspections. That's inaccurate. Iranians will be doing some inspections,"" he said, including at Parchin. Fleitz later said by email that Cruz proved ""exactly right"" in a Sept. 15, 2015 National Review commentary by saying ""in certain circumstances, Iran will inspect itself."" In his Houston stump speech, he speculated, Cruz left out such caveats. Our ruling Cruz said the Iran deal ""trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves."" A confidential side deal might allow Iranian staff to take photos and video and collect samples at the Parchin site yet the IAEA has generally insisted its protective protocols aren't being compromised. The Parchin uncertainty aside, Cruz didn’t offer nor did we find evidence the overall agreement trusts Iranians to inspect themselves. In contrast, his statement left the impression Iran would be conducting all inspections under the agreement by itself. That’s not so. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Did the Ft. Hood shooter get to keep his beard on religious grounds? No
","In the days before the second Republican presidential debate, candidate Mike Huckabee flew to the side of Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who went to jail rather than issue same-sex marriage licenses. Davis said it violated her religious beliefs to put her name to the forms that would allow such marriages. During the debate, Huckabee said Davis represented an example of judicial tyranny. ""We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard,"" Huckabee said. ""We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo — I’ve been to Gitmo, and I’ve seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans. ""You’re telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo?"" In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Huckabee’s claim about the Fort Hood killer’s beard and if he was allowed to keep it for religious reasons. The legal fight over Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan’s beard went back and forth. Ultimately, his jailers forcibly shaved him, but for a time, he was allowed to keep it. Trying the Fort Hood killer In November 2009, Army psychiatrist Hasan, an American of Palestinian descent, opened fire in a room at Fort Hood where soldiers were getting medical check-ups before deploying to Afghanistan. Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 30. As per Army regulations, until that point Hasan was clean-shaven. He began growing his beard while he awaited trial. According to the New York Times, he told his lawyers that he expected to die and thought it would violate his Muslim faith to die without one. The military prosecutors objected, saying the beard would make it harder for witnesses to identify Hasan. The trial judge, Col. Gregory Gross, objected on the grounds that the military code requires that everyone, with very few exceptions, be clean-shaven. The judge said that having a beard would disrupt the court proceedings. He held Hasan in contempt six times. The battle over Hasan’s beard was a snag that blocked his trial from moving forward. In September 2012, the judge ordered that Hasan be forcibly shaved. That’s no small matter. It takes a team of soldiers to restrain the prisoner and shave him while someone videotapes the entire process to guard against the undue use of force. Hasan appealed on the basis that the judge’s order violated his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In December, a military appeals panel ruled that it was up to commanding officers, not a judge, to enforce the dress code. The panel also removed Judge Gross, saying that he could no longer appear unbiased. The panel specifically did not address whether religious freedom laws gave Hasan the right to a beard. ""We need not and do not decide if and how RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) might apply to Appellant's beard,"" the judges wrote. ""Should the next military judge find it necessary to address Appellant's beard, such issues should be addressed and litigated anew."" The second trial judge allowed a bearded Hasan to attend the court hearings. In August 2013, Hasan was convicted on 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death. Hasan went to the detention barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he joined the handful of other soldiers on death row. In September 2013, a year after the legal fight began, an Army spokesman said that Hasan had been forcibly shaved. Our ruling Huckabee said that legal rulings allowed Hasan the Fort Hood shooter to keep his beard on religious grounds. While an appeals court did overrule the initial trial judge who had ordered that Hasan be forcibly shaved, that ruling did not affirm that Hasan had the right based on his religion. Instead, it said that it wasn’t the judge’s job to enforce the military dress code, which requires personnel to be clean shaven. When Hasan was convicted and sent to Fort Leavenworth, he was forcibly shaved. Hasan did keep his beard for a while, but ultimately, no accommodation was made for religious reasons.

Ben Carson says pediatricians realize need to cut down number and proximity of vaccines
","CNN’s Jake Tapper noted that a backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak in California. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has linked childhood vaccines to autism despite the medical community debunking that myth. During the second GOP debate, Tapper asked Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon who now lives in West Palm Beach, if Trump should stop making such a claim. Carson said Trump should look at the evidence, noting that there is ""extremely well-documented proof that there’s no autism associated with vaccinations."" Carson then turned the subject to the scheduling of vaccines: ""But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time. And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that’s appropriate."" Are pediatricians cutting down on the number and proximity of vaccines? As for Trump’s claim about autism, as PolitiFact has noted before, decades of epidemiological research have demonstrated autism rates do not increase when vaccines are introduced to a population. We contacted Carson’s campaign to ask for his evidence and did not get a reply. Vaccines Doctors follow a childhood vaccination schedule prepared by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Children may receive as many as 24 immunizations by their second birthday and may receive up to five injections during a single doctor’s visit, according to a 2013 paper by The Institute of Medicines of the National Academies. That vaccine schedule is also supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control. More than 90 percent of children entering kindergarten have been immunized with recommended vaccines in accordance with this schedule. But some parents have sought to delay vaccines or reduce the number given per visit, while others have rejected them entirely, despite recommendations by the scientific community. That’s not a good idea, according to the report. ""Delaying or declining vaccination has led to outbreaks of such vaccine-preventable diseases as measles and whooping cough that may jeopardize public health, particularly for people who are under-immunized or who were never immunized,"" wrote researchers. The researchers also concluded that there is ""no evidence that the schedule is unsafe."" The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a press release in 2013 stating that it agreed with the paper’s conclusion. After the Republican debate, it issued a new statement in support of vaccines: ""Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise,"" wrote Karen Remley, executive director of the academy. Despite the scientific consensus, pediatricians are facing pressure from parents to delay vaccines. A survey of 534 pediatricians done for the American Academy of Pediatricians in 2012 showed that 93 percent reported that within a typical month some parents asked to spread out the vaccinations. The vast majority thought these parents were putting their children at risk for disease but thought they would build trust with the families if they agreed to the request. While there is anecdotal evidence that some pediatricians have acquiesced to parents’ requests to delay vaccinations, that decision is not rooted in public health or science. ""There is no evidence that pediatricians 'recognize' that we give too many vaccines in too short a time,"" said Mark Schleiss, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Minnesota. ""Far from it. ... There is no evidence at all that spacing vaccines out or changing the schedule would improve health or help children."" Eugene R. Hershorin, chief of the division of general pediatrics at the University of Miami, pointed to what happened a decade ago when England and Japan delayed the DTaP vaccine, a combination vaccine used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. ""There was a tremendous increase in the incidence of pertussis in both countries, leading them to re-institute the schedule immediately,"" he said. Our ruling Carson said pediatricians have cut down on the number and proximity of vaccines because they recognize there have been ""too many in too short a period of time."" Leading medical organizations have concluded that the scheduling of vaccines -- including multiple ones at once -- is safe. While there is evidence that some parents ask pediatricians to delay vaccines, that’s a decision based on parents’ wishes and isn’t based on scientific evidence. There is no evidence that pediatricians are cutting down the number and proximity of vaccines based on any conclusion by them that there have been too many in too short a period of time. Carson has provided no evidence to support his claim.

Barry DuVal says U.S. is only major oil producer that bans crude exports
","Barry DuVal, president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, says it’s time for the U.S. to scrap its 40-year-old ban on exporting domestic oil. ""We’re the only major oil-producing nation in the world with a self-imposed ban on exporting our crude oil to other nations,"" DuVal said in an Aug. 25 radio interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" a Hampton Roads-based broadcast. We wondered whether DuVal was correct. Chamber spokesman Paul Logan backed the statement by pointing us to an Aug. 11 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that made a similar statement. Logan provided no other materials, so we did some digging on our own. The export ban The U.S. put the ban in place in 1975, two years after an embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries halted crude oil deliveries to the United States. Adam Sieminski, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, told Congress last December that the embargo seriously curtailed U.S. oil imports and highlighted U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The export ban covers the vast majority of crude oil produced in the U.S. -- but it’s not an absolute prohibition. For example, it doesn’t bar crude exports to Canada as long as the oil is used in that country. There are other exemptions as well. Some heavy crude produced in California, for example, is not subject to the ban, according to the U.S. Bureau of Security and Industry. The U.S. exported 401,000 barrels of crude oil a day, most of it to Canada, in July 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. That month, EIA figures show the U.S. produced almost 8.8 million barrels of crude daily. We should also note that although the ban affects raw crude oil, it does not prohibit export of ""refined"" petroleum products, such as gasoline. There have been several unsuccessful congressional attempts to lift the ban in recent years in the wake of rising U.S. oil production.  Amid the shale fracking boom, production increased from 5.4 million barrels a day in 2009 to 8.7 million barrels a day last year, according to EIA statistics. Efforts to lift the ban are ongoing. On Sept. 10, a House Energy and Power subcommittee approved a bill that would end the prohibition. Is the U.S. ban unique? EIA officials told us they weren’t aware of any other country with an export ban similar to the U.S. ban. But they stressed they couldn’t provide a definitive answer on whether the U.S. is the only nation among major oil producers that has such a limitation. So we turned to a couple of energy market analysts for further insight. Kenneth B. Medlock, senior director at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, told us in an email that DuVal’s statement is correct. ""The US is the only major producing country that does not allow exports of raw crude oil,"" he wrote in an email. Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Brookings Institution, also told us the U.S. is alone among major oil-producing countries in having the export ban. American Petroleum Institute, which supports scrapping the export ban, released a report this month saying ""the U.S. and China are the only major oil producers in the world that don’t export a significant amount of crude."" Ebinger, who also backs lifting the U.S. ban, says China’s tiny export of oil is not caused by a national ban. Instead, the low export is driven by high internal demand for oil within the nation, he said. Our ruling DuVal said the U.S. is the only major oil-producing nation in the world that bans export of its crude oil. Two experts we contacted agreed with DuVal’s statement, and officials at the EIA said they’re not aware of any other country with similar export restrictions. But the ban is not absolute -- a small portion of U.S. crude is exported to Canada. So we rate his DuVal’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BC54C0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/17/barry-duval/barry-duval-says-us-only-major-oil-producer-bans-c/

At CNN debate, Carly Fiorina urges others to watch Planned Parenthood videos
","Following the release of several videos claiming to prove Planned Parenthood illegally profits off of aborted fetal tissue, many anti-abortion politicians have called for cutting off federal funding to the women’s health organization. At the second Republican debate, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina laid out defunding Planned Parenthood as a priority. ""I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes,"" she said on the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Sept. 16. ""Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' "" The videos, which amount to at least a dozen hours, are produced by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress. They primarily show people posing as tissue brokers and talking with Planned Parenthood employees about procuring fetal tissue for medical research. Fiorina’s claim makes it sound like there is actual footage of Planned Parenthood examining an aborted fetus whose heart is still beating, while someone says ""we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain."" There isn't.  Fiorina is likely talking about this 10-minute Aug. 19 video. (Warning: The video contains extremely gruesome footage.) The video shows an interview with a woman talking about a scene similar to the one Fiorina describes; the video’s creators have matched her interview with grisly stock footage of a fetus outside the womb. In the video, the Center for Medical Progress interviews a woman identified as Holly O’Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress. StemExpress is a biomedical company that previously worked with Planned Parenthood to collect tissue for medical research, but the company ended its relationship with Planned Parenthood amid the ongoing controversy. O’Donnell talks about a time when she saw a fully-formed aborted fetus, with its heart still beating, in a pathology lab at a California Planned Parenthood clinic while she was on a job. ""I’m sitting here looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think,"" O’Donnell said. According to O’Donnell, her supervisor then told her they would procure the brain because the fetus was well-preserved. The Center for Medical Progress video does not show actually show footage of O’Donnell’s experience, and there’s nothing else in the video to corroborate O’Donnell’s story. Additionally, the supervisor in O’Donnell’s story does not say anything about keeping the fetus alive specifically for the purpose of harvesting the brain. To dramatize O’Donnell’s interview, the video cuts to a fetus outside the womb, placed on what appears to be some sort of examination surface, and the fetus’ legs are moving. The Center for Medical Progress says the source of the footage is the Grantham Collection, an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure. We don’t know the circumstances behind this video: where it came from, under what conditions it was obtained, or even if this fetus was actually aborted (as opposed to a premature birth or miscarriage). Our ruling Fiorina said one of the Planned Parenthood videos shows ""a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain."" One of the Center for Medical Progress’ videos attacking Planned Parenthood shows an interview with a woman identified as a former tissue procurement technician, who tells about an experience in a Planned Parenthood pathology lab where she sees a fetus outside the womb with its heart still beating. According to the woman, her supervisor said they would procure the fetus’ brain. The video’s creators added footage of an aborted fetus on what appears to be an examination table, and its legs are moving. But Fiorina makes it sound as if the footage shows what Planned Parenthood is alleged to have done. In fact, the stock footage was added to the video to dramatize its content. We rate her statement Mostly False.

Scott Walker says high court has said federal laws against extortion usually don't apply to unions
","With his standing in presidential preference polls down, Gov. Scott Walker went to Las Vegas on Sept. 14, 2015 to unveil a sweeping labor reform plan. The Wisconsin Republican proposed eliminating the National Labor Relations Board, creating a national right-to-work law and preventing federal workers from collectively bargaining. His plan also calls for changing federal law, saying it does not protect employees from ""threats, violence and extortion from a union."" ""As it stands,"" Walker claims in the plan, ""the Supreme Court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions. I will ensure that employee rights are protected."" So -- in the context of workers being extorted by a union -- has the nation’s highest court ruled that federal prohibitions against extortion usually don’t apply? It’s a relatively technical claim, given that extortion or other acts of violence against a person can be prosecuted under state law, whether they involve a union or not. Supreme Court case To back Walker’s claim, his campaign cited a controversial U.S. Supreme Court opinion in the 1973 case of United States v. Enmons et al. Here are the facts of the case, according to the opinion: Employees of the Gulf States Utilities Co. in Louisiana were on strike. Three officials of labor unions, including Travis Paul Enmons, were charged with committing acts of violence in an effort to get the company to agree to a contract with higher wages and other benefits. The charges included allegations of firing high-powered rifles at three company transformers and blowing up a transformer substation owned by the company. So, in this case, union leaders were accused of committing extortion against an employer, not against workers. That’s important, given that Walker’s claim involves protecting employees from extortion by unions. The criminal charges against the union officials were thrown out. A federal district court ruled that if the pay raises ""sought by violent acts are wages to be paid for unneeded or unwanted services, or for no services at all,"" then the violence would constitute extortion under the Hobbs Act, a federal law that prohibits extortion that obstructs commerce. In other words, acts of extortion to gain, for example, personal favors wouldn’t be protected by the federal law. But the court determined that because the use of force was to obtain legitimate union objectives -- a better contract -- it did not violate the Hobbs Act, even though it could be prosecuted as a crime in state court. In a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision to dismiss the charges. So, Walker is citing a Supreme Court case that says extortion by a union, if done in order to obtain a legitimate labor objective, does not violate a particular federal law. But that case had to do with an employer being extorted by a union, and Walker’s claim is about changing federal law to protect workers from what he terms as union extortion. Moreover, Walker’s claim leaves the impression that employees have no federal protections if they are extorted by their union. Analysis Walker’s campaign also cited to us a more recent case, a 2014 criminal trial in Buffalo in which the Enmons ruling played a role. But that case also involved union extortion against an employer, as seven former labor leaders were charged with using death threats, assaults and vandalism to force construction companies into hiring union workers. Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the Center for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., told us the end result of the Supreme Court ruling in the Enmons case ""is that if a union or union member performs acts of violence and vandalism to achieve legitimate collective-bargaining objectives, such as higher wages, then it is not a violation of the Hobbs Act."" He said he believes the ruling would apply to acts of union extortion against workers, but that he could not find appellate opinions that have ruled that way. Law professor Marion Crain of the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis took a different view, telling us the Enmons case ""has nothing to do with union abuse of power vis a vis workers. The case simply doesn’t stand for that proposition."" Crain also pointed out that the federal Landrum-Griffin Act, adopted in 1959, has provisions to protect employees from unfair practices by unions. Several experts experts, including Burrus and Cornell University law professor Angela Cornell also noted the protections. Federal law ""prohibits unions from coercing or restraining employees in the exercise of their right to engage in, or refrain from, union and concerted activity. This would include violence or extortion,"" said University of Richmond law professor Ann Hodges. In other words, despite the high court’s ruling in the case Walker cites, there are other federal protections for workers. Our rating Walker said he will pursue change in federal law to protect employees from ""extortion from a union"" because ""the Supreme Court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions."" The high court did rule that union extortion in pursuit of legitimate labor ends, such as a better contract, does not violate a particular federal law that prohibits extortion that obstructs commerce. But that case did not involve union extortion against workers. Moreover, state as well as other federal laws protect workers against abuses by a union. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

Donald Trump says Marco Rubio has 'worst voting record there is today'
","In one of many heated exchanges during the second Republican primary debate, Donald Trump mocked Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s poor attendance record in the Senate after Rubio schooled Trump on his lack foreign policy knowledge. ""The one thing that the federal government must do -- the one thing that only the federal government can do -- is keep us safe,"" Rubio said on Sept. 16. ""And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office."" ""You have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today,"" Trump countered, referring to Rubio’s missed votes. ""No. 1, I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I am a businessman doing business transactions."" Rubio admitted that he didn’t have the best attendance record and suggested that’s because he’s focusing on something more important: the White House. We wondered if Rubio really has missed the most Senate votes in the GOP field. Neither the Rubio nor Trump campaigns got back to us. But we took a look at the roll calls and found that the ""most truant"" award goes to Rubio if we’re looking at this year only. If we examine career records, Republican rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas takes the crown.   Votes missed this year From the start of the year to Sept. 9, Rubio had missed 77 of 263 roll call votes, USA Today reported, though he was present for the two additional votes that have taken place since that tally. Based USA Today’s and our own calculations, here’s how Rubio stacks up against the other senator-candidates right now: Senator Votes missed (Jan. 1 to Sept. 16) Absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 77 29.1 percent Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 62 23.4 percent Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) 60 22.6 percent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 9 3.4 percent Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 4 1.5 percent Republican rival Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are close to Rubio’s truancy rate. In contrast, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who’s running for the Senate and the presidency, has the best attendance record. (The senators who are running for president tend to have the lowest vote participation rates.) The majority of the votes Rubio’s skipped came after April 13, when he announced his candidacy, the Tampa Bay Times noted. ""It's not unusual for presidential candidates to miss Senate votes,"" Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Sen. Rubio remains fully engaged in the issues important to Florida and helping Floridians, and as he travels the country to talk about his agenda to help the middle class, there will be no doubt where he stands on any important issues before the Senate."" Overall attendance If we look at career truancy, Cruz has a worse attendance record than Rubio, but it’s pretty close. Here’s how the presidential field compares, according to data from GovTrack. Senator Votes missed (career) Absentee rate Cruz 104 out of 922 11.3 percent Rubio 154 out of 1,408 10.9 percent Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) 249 out of 2,616 9.5 percent Graham 221 out of 4,081 5.4 percent Paul 43 out of 1,408 3.1 percent Sanders 83 out of 2,761 3.0 percent Jim Webb (D-Va., 2007-2012) 37 out of 1,839 2.0 percent Rick Santorum (R-Penn., 1995-2006 ) 79 out of 4,156 1.9 percent So Cruz has skipped out on more votes over his career than any other senator or former senator in the 2016 race. But beyond the field, neither Cruz or Rubio are the worst ever offenders -- in fact, they didn’t even crack the top 100, according to a May 2015 Washington Post analysis. President Barack Obama missed 24.2 percent of votes in his brief senate career. And that doesn’t even compare to the most truant senator of all time: Maryon Allen, D-Ala., who racked up a 43.5 percent absentee rate during her five-month stint in the Senate in 1978. Our ruling Trump said that Rubio has ""the worst voting record there is today."" He’s accurate if we look at the number of votes missed this year out of the five current senators running for president. Rubio has missed about a third of all votes. If we look at career truancy records, Rubio is a close second to Ted Cruz among the current field.

Donald Trump says Mexico doesn't have birthright citizenship
","Donald Trump confused several facts about birthright citizenship — a 150-year-old practice he has pledged to end — in the second GOP presidential debate. CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Trump to explain why this is part of his platform to foe Carly Fiorina, who has said Trump is pandering on the issue.

I don’t think so."") Trump’s claim about Mexico not offering birthright citizenship didn’t sound right, so we wanted to look it over. Our hunch proved correct. Mexico does offer birthright citizenship, even if it’s not an exact copy of the American model. Birthright citizenship in the United States was first established by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, primarily to grant legal status to emancipated slaves. The amendment stipulates that ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""  The Mexican Constitution says the Mexican ""nationality"" is obtained by birth if the person is born ""within the Republic’s territory whatever their parents’ nationality might be,"" among other circumstances. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted a technical difference between the Mexican and American constitutions. In Mexico, someone does not become a ""citizen"" — regardless of whether the person is born to Mexican parents or just in Mexico — until he or she turns 18. At that age, he or she can vote, hold public office or join the military. In addition to being Mexican and 18, he or she must also have ""an honest way of life."" A Mexican-born child is still considered Mexican even without voting rights, FactCheck.org found, similar to American children who also do not have access to voting until they turn 18. Article 37 adds that Mexican nationality by birth ""shall never be revoked."" Birthright citizenship also exists in Canada, Brazil and nearly every other country in Central and South America, according to a list of nations with birthright citizenship maintained by Numbers USA, which supports reduced immigration levels. Countries that offer birthright citizenship are located almost exclusively in the Western Hemisphere. No country in Europe or East Asia, for example, has a similar citizenship policy. Our ruling Trump defended his pursuit of ending birthright citizenship by saying not even Mexico has it, adding the United States is alone on this right. But that’s not true, no matter how many times Trump repeats this line. Anyone born on Mexican soil is considered Mexican by nationality, regardless of whether their parents are Mexican. No one in Mexico, even if a person’s parents are Mexican, is considered a ""citizen"" by the country’s Constitution until he or she turns 18. The United States and Mexico are joined by more than 30 countries around the world, predominantly in the Americas, that offer birthright citizenship. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097804080>],/factchecks/2015/sep/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexico-doesnt-have-birthright-ci/

Carly Fiorina says pot is stronger today than in the past
","The Republican presidential candidates sparred over many issues in the CNN debate, including the potency of pot. On drug policy, there was talk about expanded rehabilitation and prison reform to reduce the number of nonviolent prisoners. When it came to marijuana, one candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the hardest line, saying he would enforce a federal ban nationwide. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul favored allowing states like Colorado do as they please. So did former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who explained his position by acknowledging his own use. ""So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My mom's not happy that I just did."" Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina shared the view that states should decide for themselves, but she offered an important caution. ""The marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago,"" Fiorina said. We thought it would be good to explore whether pot has become more potent since the 1970s. This is something we’ve looked at before. The main psychoactive agent in marijuana is THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC. THC levels differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years. But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time. The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period. Back in the late 1970s , the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research with the monitoring project, told us in an interview for a prior fact-check. Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007. But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said. For the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s uncertainty about what rising THC levels mean. Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level. In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs. Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact. Our ruling Fiorina said the marijuana kids smoke today is not what it was 40 years ago. Studies back that up. THC potency is up, with a growing fraction of seized marijuana having a concentration of 9 percent or more. There is some evidence that users smoke less when the pot is more potent, but that doesn’t detract from Fiorina’s main point. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097553BC0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/17/carly-fiorina/fiorina-says-pot-stronger-today-past/

Huckabee: U.S. is giving Iran the equivalent of $5 trillion
","Iran is getting a sizeable award for the nuclear deal with the United States -- to the tune of $100 billion, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said at the second Republican debate. The Iran deal was a big topic at the Sept. 16 CNN debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Several of the candidates blasted the deal between the United States, Iran and several world powers -- including the former governor of Arkansas.. ""We've just now given over $100 billion (to Iran),"" Huckabee said. ""The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion."" We’ve looked into similar claims before, so we decided to take a look at Huckabee’s version. The $100 billion It’s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal, because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted if Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. Iran will have access to a good deal of these funds within several months of the deal being enacted, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University. Huckabee made it sound as if the United States is giving some kind of subsidy or compensation. But the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn’t been able to access it. In similar claims by other candidates and officials, the $100 billion figure has referred to the dollar amounts of Iran’s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank. It also includes the billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions, in a prior interview with PolitiFact. Estimates of the value of Iran’s foreign assets start as low as $25 billion, and they run as high as $150 billion. Most experts we’ve interviewed on this question peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount. Iran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, Iranian officials won’t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. The lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, also in a prior interview. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal. How does this translate into $5 trillion in America? The $5 trillion Based on a prior fact-check, we can deduce that Huckabee is comparing the Iranian and U.S. economies based on gross domestic product, the standard measurement of an economy’s size. According to the World Bank, Iran’s economy is $415 billion. So the $100 billion in sanctions relief amounts to about 25 percent of the economy. The United States’ economy is about $17 trillion. Twenty-five percent of that is $4.25 trillion -- a little low but not too far off from Huckabee’s $5 trillion. It’s not a perfect measurement, said Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, who said she would be more interested in comparing the two in terms of GDP per capita. Though, ""I do think it gives an interesting comparison of the scale,"" Sinclair said of Huckabee’s claim. Our ruling Huckabee said, ""We've just now given over $100 billion (to Iran). The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion."" Huckabee’s $100 billion figure is one of the most commonly cited estimates of how much the Iranian economy will reap from sanctions relief under the Iran deal, though no one is fully certain of the amount. But he gives a misleading impression of the transaction by implying the United States is giving the money to Iran when it would just unfreeze the assets. We rate Huckabee’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097186F40>],/factchecks/2015/sep/17/mike-huckabee/huckabee-us-giving-iran-equivalent-5-trillion/
