Wisconsin Working Families party claims taxpayers spent $100,000 on SUV for Chris Abele
","A group working to block a new term for Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is arguing  Abele is more concerned about himself than public safety and families. A direct mail piece sent out in the days before the Feb. 16, 2016 primary election by the Wisconsin Working Families Party included this statement: ""Abele broke his own promise to crack down on perks for government workers, spending $100,000 of taxpayer money on a new luxury SUV. He also awarded a no-bid contract to a celebrity firm to provide personal security to himself."" The claim was illustrated with a picture of a shiny black SUV. So, did county taxpayers spend $100,000 on a sweet ride for the County Executive? First a bit of background. The group making the claim is led by a longtime political foe of Abele -- Marina Dimitrijevic, a Milwaukee County supervisor who is the state director for the Wisconsin Working Families Party. Dimitrijevic, a former chair of the County Board, took the job with the political group after the state Legislature moved to slash the pay for county supervisors and made the job part time. Abele pushed for the move to a part time board. Milwaukee County voters overwhelmingly approved the changes in a 2014 referendum, and they take effect this spring.   Meanwhile, there has been a spat between the board and Abele over his security dating to 2013. First elected in 2011, Abele went two years without a security detail. Then, after receiving unspecified threats, Abele asked the county to spend $400,000 for a private firm or local law enforcement agencies to provide him with security. Supervisors allocated $100,000 and required that Abele use the Sheriff’s Department for security. But that never took place, and the money went unspent. The board allocated $100,000 for Abele security in the 2015 budget. In the summer of 2015, Abele decided to hire Gavin de Becker & Associates, a company that, among other things, provides security for celebrities, including actress Jennifer Lawrence. The county spent $95,000 of the $100,000 for the company’s services. Abele personally paid the remainder -- $300,000. In the fall of 2015, the County Board refused to allocate additional money for the firm, and Abele is now footing the entire bill. So what did county taxpayers get for the $95,000 that they paid Gavin de Becker? Dimitrijevic and Abele’s office provided the same set of documents regarding the security contract, but offered different interpretations. One thing was clear: The county didn’t purchase a $100,000 SUV. Wisconsin Working Families perspective The contract between the county and Gavin de Becker has numerous sections blacked out as confidential -- ""heavy redaction"" was the way Dimitrijevic put it. In a statement, the group said ""it will be difficult for you to demonstrate that $100,000 in public funds was NOT used on the luxury SUV."" Here’s their reasoning: ""Based on the retail price of the GMC Yukon ($50,000) and the fact that Abele used it to travel to and from events during and after business hours for a minimum of a period of six months, it is not unreasonable to state that taxpayers had to foot a $100,000 bill for the cost of the SUV. One could reasonably assert that the cost of the SUV use, insurance, gas, mileage etc. would account for a minimum of $100,000 or about 25% of the total cost, before he could unilaterally renew this public contract"". The group also included an email from Corporation Counsel Paul Bargren to Dimitrijevic, who had sought details of the contract with Gavin de Becker. He noted that portions of the contract were redacted, and added: ""The $100,000 payment in public funds was a flat fee, all inclusive. There was no breakdown."" We also note that the claim in the mailing included a footnote to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel column by Dan Bice published Oct. 11, 2015. The column discusses the security contract and notes that the SUV is part of the package of services provided by Gavin de Becker. ""The GMC Yukon XL does not belong to Abele or the county,"" Bice wrote. Abele’s take The payments to Gavin de Becker covered more than just the vehicle, Abele spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said in an email. ""This contract is for security services, which includes the use of a vehicle. That vehicle is leased locally by the security firm,"" she said. We asked if the vehicle pictured in the campaign flier was the one used to transport Abele. It has a different grille than the vehicle identified as Abele’s in a picture that accompanied the Bice column. And the word ""Yukon"" appears on the floor in front of the SUV, an indication that it’s a handout photo from an automaker. ""That is not the car that the security firm leases, not even the same kind of car,"" Baldauff said. Our rating Wisconsin Working Families said Abele spent ""$100,000 of taxpayer money on a new luxury SUV."" In a footnote, the group cited a Journal Sentinel column that stated the vehicle was part of a package of security services, presumably just like the uniforms, radios and other items used by the two guards assigned to the Abele detail. The county’s lawyer told the group the same thing -- the county paid a flat fee. In any case, the vehicle was not bought by county taxpayers.

Donald Trump cites dubious legend about Gen. Pershing, pig's blood and Muslims
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph ""Black Jack"" Pershing. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War. Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department. After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies. ""They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,"" Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. ""And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem."" After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a ""legend."" We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump’s takeaway is wrong-headed. We’ll take a look at those two concerns separately below. Did it happen? The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades. For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin ""to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers,"" Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently. Snopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005. But the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines. ""Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal,"" according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal. However, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.) Other historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least. ""This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,"" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. ""I am amazed it is still making the rounds."" Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that ""I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character."" Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to ""pacifying"" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors. ""He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply."" Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions. ""The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,"" Janda said. ""This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism."" Facts aside, Trump’s larger point is wrong To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified ""terrorists"" is actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable. ""Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,"" said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region ""remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present."" Silbey of Cornell agreed. ""Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,"" he said. ""The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism."" If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative. ""The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,"" Janda said. ""It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies."" Our ruling Of the eight historians we checked with, all were at least skeptical that what Trump said actually happened, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. The only evidence of something approximating what Trump said stems from one letter documenting a different scenario written by a veteran more than a half century after the fact. Perhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. In all, Trump’s claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, Feb. 29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents ""were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins."" In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics."" While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, they do not support the claim Trump made. There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig’s blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today. When we ran this additional information by three of the historians we checked with for our original story -- Silbey, Linn and Janda -- they told us they agreed with our conclusion. Our rating remains Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2016/feb/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-cites-dubious-legend-about-gen-pershi/

Ted Cruz attacks Donald Trump for wanting to leave public land in feds' hands
","Of all the controversies associated with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, his position on federally owned land tends to attract less attention. But the issue of public land ownership is important to Nevadans, where federal government agencies manage and control around 85 percent of state land. And it’s partially why Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is slamming Trump on the issue in a campaign ad airing just days before the Nevada Republican presidential caucus on Feb. 23. ""Eighty-five percent of Nevada is owned and regulated by the federal government,"" says Cruz in the ad. ""And Donald Trump wants to keep big government in charge. That’s ridiculous."" The ad has aired dozens of times in Reno through the lead up to Nevada's caucus, according to Political TV Ad Archive. We thought Cruz’s claim merited fact-checking, because public lands management is a critical issue with Nevada voters. An on-screen graphic refers to a January interview with Field & Stream magazine, where Trump said he would be hesitant to give federal land over to state and local governments. ""I don’t like the idea, because I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do,"" he told an interviewer. ""I mean, are they going to sell if they get into a little bit of trouble?"" Trump’s campaign offered a slightly more detailed explanation of his proposed policy in an answer to a candidate questionnaire, but said the bigger issue was land management and not transfer of ownership. ""The issue is not that so much of the state is public land; it is how that land is managed,"" the campaign wrote, promising to cut ""needless bureaucratic red tape."" The Trump campaign didn’t return emails seeking comment. Cruz, on the other hand, takes a more libertarian stance on public land issues and said the amount of land owned by the federal government is ""unacceptable."" ""I believe we should transfer as much federal land as possible back to the states and ideally back to the people,"" he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in December. Cruz fought with the Bureau of Land Management over the agency's efforts to ""claim 90,000 acres of disputed land near Texas’s Red River,"" and for a time supported Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s standoff with the federal government over his unpaid grazing fees. And many of the Texas senator’s Nevada supporters pushed for a failed bill in the state Legislature that ""would lay claim to almost all federally managed public lands and water rights in the state."" It’s worth noting that Nevada’s state constitution expressly gives up the state’s rights to all ""unappropriated public lands"" to the federal government, which is why it’s worth quibbling with candidates like Cruz and Rubio promise to ""return"" control to its citizens  — who have never held a claim to the federally owned land in the past 151 years of Nevada statehood. Our ruling Cruz says that Trump wants to keep ""big government"" in charge of Nevada’s public lands. Trump has answered questions on public land management twice. He has not advocated for transferring ownership, but he has focused on cutting bureaucratic red tape. Cruz exaggerates Trump's position slightly by saying Trump favors ""big"" government.

No, arthritic goat milk cannot cure HIV
","An Australian doctor says he cured Charlie Sheen and the island nation of Comoros of HIV with a curious treatment — specifically, arthritic goat’s milk. Samir Chachoua first made headlines in January, when he became the subject of a Dr. Oz intervention. Sheen told Oz that he stopped taking conventional HIV medication for about a month after Chachoua’s treatment made HIV ""undetectable"" in his blood. Oz pointed out that Chachoua was not licensed to practice medicine in the United States and his method of convincing Sheen — by injecting himself with Sheen’s blood — was not only unorthodox, but highly inappropriate. Sheen agreed to take his medicine again. It gets weirder. A few weeks later, Chachoua expressed his disappointment in Sheen and touted his treatment on Jan. 29’s Real Time with Bill Maher. ""I found a place in Mexico with all these IV drug users, prostitutes, all the high profile things that are necessary for AIDS but I didn’t find AIDS,"" he said. ""What I found was, their people were drinking milk from goats, which had arthritis. These goats have a virus called CAEV, and this virus destroys HIV and protects people who drink it for life."" This treatment, says Chachoua, not only cured Sheen but helped eradicate HIV in Comoros, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, in 2006. Let’s state off the bat that Chachoua has been, as Maher noted, ""called a quack a million times."" His claims that he eradicated HIV in Comoros in 2006 and cured Sheen are profoundly untrue. ""We have no cure for AIDS and it’s certainly not going to be anything related to goat’s milk,"" said Jeffrey Laurence, the senior scientific consultant for programs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. The facts on CAEV As its name suggests, the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus or CAEV  — which is part of the same genus of viruses as HIV — causes arthritis and encephalitis in goats. Some research shows that infected goats may develop antibodies that will ""cross react"" with HIV. What does this mean? If you remember the lock-and-key model from your biology textbook, you’ll know that your body produces antibodies that are specific to an antigen. Some CAEV antibodies, in addition to flagging CAEV, can also identify HIV. Simply put, they recognize HIV as an antigen. That’s it.   There is no evidence these antibodies ""destroy"" or protect against HIV, said Brian Murphy, a professor of pathology at the University of California Davis’ School of Veterinary Medicine, who’s studied CAEV. Scientists have actually known about this cross-reactivity for decades, but in the grand scheme of AIDS research, it’s meaningless, according to Laurence of amfAR. ""It wouldn’t make my list of 100 things to consider in the search for a cure,"" he said. ""There are so many more interesting things to look into without having to look into cross-reactions with goats."" Nonetheless, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did support research into CAEV’s vaccine potential in the 2000s before determining that it wasn’t viable. Currently, there’s a team of scientists at Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, working on a CAEV-based HIV vaccine. Yahia Chebloune, one of the immunologists on the team, explained the concept to us. The team’s vaccine prototype combines CAEV with HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). Unlike HIV, CAEV doesn’t destroy T helper cells — the white blood cells essential to the immune system — nor does it replicate as aggressively and indefinitely or create an AIDS-like disease in goats. So when the vaccine was tested on mice, macaques and llamas, their T helper cells weren’t destroyed and the animals could produce antibodies, suggesting that the vaccine was effective in stopping the HIV strains from replicating.   Got goat milk None of this suggests that Chachoua has successfully cured Sheen or the 780,000 inhabitants of Comoros against HIV. Simply ""drinking milk from goats with arthritis"" cannot protect anyone from the virus. CAEV is not transmittable to humans, so Charlie Sheen couldn’t have developed CAEV antibodies — even if they did ""destroy"" HIV (again, they don't). ""This is the craziest story I’ve ever heard,"" said Chebloune. ""The claims of Dr. Sam Chachoua are not scientifically serious."" Is it possible that Chachoua inoculated Sheen with a homemade CAEV-based vaccine like Chebloune’s? Our multiple requests for comment went unanswered so we’ll never know for sure. But the one CAEV vaccine prototype we found triggered an immune response in animals and has yet to be tested on humans. What’s more, as Lawrence of amfAR noted, vaccinating someone against a disease is not the same thing as curing it. Then there’s the most damning evidence against Chachou: Sheen is still HIV-positive, while there were 7,900 HIV cases in Comoros in 2012. ""I’m not cured, no,"" Sheen said on Feb. 11’s Dr. Oz. Salvator Niyonzima, who directs the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in Comoros, told Oz that he and his colleagues ""have never heard of Dr. Samir Chachoua."" Our ruling Chachoua said he cured Charlie Sheen and Comoros of HIV with ""milk from goats which had arthritis."" Chachoua is taking a nugget of science and twisting into an absurd claim. There is no proof that CAEV — a relative of HIV that’s studied for its vaccine potential — neutralizes HIV. Sheen and people on the island of Comoros both have HIV.

Marco Rubio says Americans pay more in taxes than food, clothing and housing
","A Web ad from Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has gotten a lot of attention for a case of geographic mistaken identity: The narrator says ""It’s morning again in America"" -- while showing a video clip from Vancouver, Canada. The Rubio campaign told BuzzFeed it was unintentional. But there’s also a serious public policy claim in that ad. ""Today, more men and women are out of work than ever before in our nation’s history,"" the narrator says. ""People paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined."" Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. We’ve looked how many people are out of work in other fact-checks. In January 2016, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008. Here, we wanted to look at the claim that people are paying more in taxes than for food, housing and clothing. Taxes versus food, housing and clothing The Rubio campaign sent us an April 2015 blog post by the Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank. A bar graph showed that America will pay a total of $4.8 trillion in taxes and about $4.4 trillion in food, clothing and housing combined. Kyle Pomerleau, who wrote the blog for the Tax Foundation in April 2015, said it was based on a projection of what Americans would spend for the year based on information from the Congressional Budget Office. So let’s look at the actual numbers using the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since the BEA doesn’t have full tax data yet for 2015, we used tax and spending data for 2014. We used the same method the foundation did and found that total receipts for the federal, state and local government taxes were about $4.8 trillion. On the spending side in 2014, Americans laid out $886 billion for food and beverages purchased for use at home, $751 billion on food services and accommodations, $369 billion on clothing and footwear and $2.1 trillion on housing and utilities. If we add that up, we get about $4.1 trillion. So by this method, Americans are spending more in taxes -- about $4.8 trillion --  than on food, clothing and housing combined of about $4.1 trillion. But this is just one method to compare taxes and spending.   The foundation’s method is an aggregate of what all Americans pay combined -- the amount that any individual or family spends on taxes compared with food, clothing and shelter can vary widely. That means that Rubio’s statement is likely true for some Americans but not others. ""Looking at the chart, this is an aggregated figure, and what is true of the whole is not true of all the parts,"" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute of Economic Competitiveness. ""Clearly there are lower income individuals who do not pay all the taxes that higher income people do. For those folks, they are spending more on food, housing and clothing."" Indeed, as a general rule, poor Americans pay relatively little in taxes compared to what they spend on food, clothing and housing. This matters for judging Rubio’s statement because, for many of them, his statement is inaccurate. It’s more often true for richer Americans. Another way to look at taxes and spending is by what individuals spend on average. Americans spend an average of 39 percent of their money on food, housing, apparel and services in 2011, according to the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Taxes -- federal, state and local combined -- claim roughly 30 percent of income, said Roberton Williams, a tax expert at the Tax Policy Center. So by this measure, ""taxes claim a smaller share of income than do food, housing, and clothing,"" Williams said. Our ruling Rubio said that ""people (are) paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined."" Rubio’s statement only measures up if we look at aggregate spending on those basics by all Americans. But whether individuals spend more on taxes than food, housing and clothing varies widely depending upon their income. Wealthier Americans do spend more on taxes than food, housing and clothing combined, while those with low incomes do not.

Mass shooting claims by Newsom, Pan rated 'Mostly False'
"," Editor's Note: We’ve received questions about our Mostly False rating on this fact check, with some saying we relied on a definition of mass shooting that’s too limited. As we stated in the fact check, there is no legal definition for this act of violence. We agree there’s room for interpretation about how many deaths or injuries should constitute a mass shooting. And we’ve added the perspective of gun control advocates to this fact check to convey that sentiment. We maintain, however, that the statements we fact checked used the most overly broad definition of this type of crime, a definition that goes beyond what the average person would consider a mass shooting.   What is a mass shooting? There’s no legal definition. But a key congressional report defines it as a shooting that kills four or more people. Think Columbine. Virginia Tech. San Bernardino. From 1999 through 2013, there were about 21 mass shootings each year in the United States, according to a congressional analysis of FBI data. Roughly four took place annually in public settings, like at schools, restaurants or workplaces. Another 17, on average, took place in private homes or other locations. More recent FBI data was not available. But recent claims by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan say hundreds of mass shootings took place —  in 2015 alone. ""So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days,"" Newsom said in a Dec. 5, 2015 email promoting a gun control initiative he’s introduced. Newsom references the San Bernardino mass shooting in his email. That attack killed 14 people, injured 22 others and took place on Dec. 2, 2015. Pan added in a press release on Jan. 19, 2016 that ""there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015."" We wondered: Did mass shootings in America somehow skyrocket from about 20 annually to more than 300 overnight? Or were Newsom and Pan using a definition of this kind of crime that reflects a different view of reality? Newsom is running for California governor in 2018. He has introduced a gun control initiative for the November ballot that would require most Californians to pass background checks to purchase ammunition. Pan, who represents the Sacramento region, recently proposed legislation that would require the state to track gun deaths. Both are Democrats. Newsom’s claim Let’s dive into the lieutenant governor’s statement first. He made the claim that there had been more mass shootings than days in 2015 on Dec. 5, or day 339 that year. Representatives for Newsom and the Courage Campaign said the politician, in making his claim, relied on news reports that cited gun violence tracking websites, including what was until recently known as ‘Mass Shooting Tracker.’ That website, now known as ‘Gun Violence Archive,’ used crowd-sourced information and a much broader definition of mass shooting than the congressional report. It counted mass shootings as any incident, anywhere, in which at least four people were shot, but not necessarily killed. By early December 2015, Mass Shooting Tracker reported there had been 353 mass shootings in America so far that year. Criminologists told us the website’s broad definition lumps in more shooting categories, such as gang-related crimes or robberies, than typically associated with mass shootings. Several said this is purposely done to inflate the statistics. David Kopel is a professor at Denver University’s Sturm College of Law. He has written several books from a gun rights perspective. ""The problem with the way Gavin Newsom is using this pseudo data is it’s out of context and is done in a way which is calculated to cause confusion,"" Kopel said. ""When people hear the term mass shootings, I think what they think of are things like the San Bernardino attacks or the Newtown crime. … By that definition, the number is far, far smaller.""   Gun control advocates say there’s no good reason to require that four people die before calling a crime a mass shooting. Using that threshold, they point out, would mean a February shooting in Kansas in which three people were killed and 14 were injured would not be considered a mass shooting. ""It is arbitrary to distinguish between a death and an injury,"" said Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We shouldn’t have to be waiting outside a hospital room to see if the victim is going cling to life to call it a mass shooting."" Freilich said the definition for a mass shooting should be an incident in which a dangerous person is able to shoot four or more other people, regardless of whether anyone is killed.  State Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, left, talks with fellow lawmakers at the Capitol. Associated Press file photo. Pan’s claim State Sen. Richard Pan's claim was ""there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015."" When contacted by PolitiFact California, a spokeswoman for Pan said the press release from the senator’s office mistakenly omitted the full definition used by the shooting tracker website. She then issued a new press release with Pan quoted as saying a mass shooting is defined as four or more people ""shot or killed."" Pan relied on news reports that cited the shooting tracker website to back up his claim, the senator’s spokeswoman said. Again, the experts told us, that website tracked far more than what would be considered mass shootings. ""Once you drill down through the data, you find that there are very different particular reasons for those shootings, or for those injuries,"" said Ryan Getty, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. Getty said the data might be derived from a family shot ""trying to defend their home against home invaders."" But, instead, ""people just assume that it’s events like what happened in San Bernardino."" As PolitiFact Florida reported, ""Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions."" ""Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs,"" Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, told PolitiFact Florida, which evaluated a similar mass shooting statement. William Krouse of the Congressional Research Service authored the report ""Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013."" That’s the report that shows about 21 mass shootings took place per year, using the stricter definition of at least four people killed. Krouse said federal data for the past two years is not widely available. But, he added, USA Today’s tracking of this type of crime is the best available. It shows 18 mass shootings took place in 2014 and 25 last year. Our ruling Following the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and injured 22, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan claimed that hundreds of mass shootings took place in 2015. They used an extremely broad definition of mass shooting — one that includes incidents in which people are shot but no one is necessarily killed. A key congressional report defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed. Criminologists say this definition is more in line with events like the shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech or in San Bernardino. As we said at the beginning, there is no legal definition for a mass shooting. The California politicians chose a broad definition by using a crowd-sourced website that better fits their gun control goals. We rate their claims Mostly False.

Bill Clinton wrongly says San Bernardino attackers never went to the Middle East
","America requires an especially robust defense, given how porous the world’s borders are today, former President Bill Clinton said at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. ""Keep in mind, the people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East,"" Clinton said in Greenville, S.C., Feb. 16. ""They were converted over the social media."" This is incorrect, as Buzzfeed first pointed out. The husband and wife pair who carried out the Dec. 2 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14, spent significant time in the Middle East. A spokesman for Clinton told us that he misspoke. Here are the facts about where the couple traveled: The wife, Tashfeen Malik, was born in Pakistan but moved to Saudi Arabia at a young age. She returned to Pakistan in 2007 to study pharmacology. The husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was born and raised in the United States, but he traveled to the Middle East on multiple occasions in recent years. Farook met Malik online. He traveled to Mecca, Saudi Arabia in 2013 to meet Malik in person and to complete the annual Muslim pilgrimage known as the hajj, according to the Los Angeles Times. Farook returned to Saudi Arabia in 2014 to bring his new wife to his Southern California home. (The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol photo to the left shows the couple in Chicago in 2014.) Malik got into the United States on a K-1 visa, which allows someone to enter the country in order to marry a United States citizen. There is evidence the couple was radicalized and might have been inspired by foreign terrorists. However, FBI Director James Comey said in December that there isn’t yet evidence that Farook and Malik were working with larger terrorist organizations, though they did send private messages over email and social media that referred to jihad and martyrdom. While the couple communicated privately with others about their commitment to radicalism, there is not yet evidence that they posted publicly on the topic. ""So far, we’ve seen no indication that either of these two killers came across our screen, tripped any trip wires, anything that either brought them to our attention or should have brought them to our attention,"" Comey said. The FBI is trying to get more information on what led to the attack by accessing an iPhone belonging to the couple, but so far they have been unable to penetrate it. A judge ordered Apple to devise a way for the government to unlock the phone, but the company has refused, citing privacy concerns on its customers’ behalf. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East."" This is incorrect. The wife lived her entire life in the Middle East until 2014, and the husband traveled to Saudi Arabia on at least two recent occasions to meet with her.

Planned Parenthood president says half of Ohio's abortion centers shut down under Gov. John Kasich
","Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, told a crowd of women in Los Angeles how she really feels about the idea of Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, winning the presidential election: ""It would be a complete and utter disaster."" She continued, ""Gov. Kasich has come off as a moderate, only by comparison to Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, but it’s really important to know in Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down. He signed 17 separate bills to restrict reproductive access in the state."" We looked more closely to find out how many of Ohio’s abortion providers had closed, and whether it could be attributed to Kasich’s leadership. Ohio’s chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America has been keeping tabs on clinic closings and openings. They say that since 2011, Kasich’s first year in office, eight of the 16 surgical abortion clinics have closed or stopped performing abortions. A new provider in Akron opened in the summer of 2015, bringing the total number of functioning surgical abortion clinics in the state to nine. PolitiFact Ohio confirmed NARAL’s tally of closings in Ohio, in chronological order: February 2011, the Mahoning Valley Women’s Center, Youngstown June 2012, Capital Care Network, Columbus April 2013, Capital Care Network, Akron October 2013, Center for Choice, Toledo October 2013, Cleveland Center for Women’s Health June 2014, Cleveland Surgi-Center   August 2014, Complete Healthcare for Women, Columbus August 2014, Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati They key legislation that caused at least four of the clinics to close was passed in Ohio’s 2013 budget (HB 59). Kasich signed into law regulations that equate to a Catch-22 for abortion providers. HB 59 requires all ambulatory surgical facilities to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital to admit patients in case of emergency. At the same time, the law prohibits public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion providers.  H.B. 59, 130th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ohio 2013) In 2013, the New York Times wrote about Ohio’s changing climate for women’s reproductive rights. ""Ohio has become a laboratory for what anti-abortion leaders call the incremental strategy — passing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of Supreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them."" Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, put it more succinctly last year, when the Columbus Dispatch quoted him as saying, ""The goal is to end abortion."" The transfer agreement legislation shut down Toledo’s Center for Choice; the center was unable to get a transfer agreement from a private hospital after legislation outlawed their agreement with the public University of Toledo Medical Center. Today, their phone number forwards calls to a clinic in Michigan, the next-closest location for women seeking surgical abortions in the area. Likewise, the Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati was denied an exception to their transfer agreement from the Ohio Health Department and went to court to fight the decision in Hamilton County. The center lost in court and closed in August 2014. A representative at Cleveland’s Surgi-Center told PolitiFact that when their location’s lease was up in July 2014, they had to move, which meant applying for a new ambulatory surgical center license through the Ohio Department of Health. ""Knowing all the problems other clinics were having,"" the Surgi-Center stopped performing abortions. They still provide reproductive health services like STD screening and birth control. The Cleveland Center for Women’s Health closed in 2013 and relocated to Detroit, Mich., where there are fewer regulations for clinics that do abortions. The other four shuttered abortion providers closed for reasons that are not as directly tied to state regulations. The Mahoning Valley center in Youngstown closed as a business decision, according to NARAL. The Capital Care Network location in Akron closed after state inspectors identified safety violations that temporarily halted services, and the provider opted to close rather than correct the issues. In Columbus, Capital Care merged with Founders’ Women’s Health, another abortion provider. Finally, according to NARAL, the doctors with Complete Healthcare for Women, who still provide complete women’s health care services other than surgical abortions, never gave an explanation for why they stopped performing the procedures after 2014. Our ruling Richards said that ""more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down."" PolitiFact confirmed that since 2011, seven abortion providers have closed and an eighth stopped performing surgical abortions. That’s half of the previous 16 providers in the state -- not more than half. Also, four of the eight providers closed for reasons associated with provisions in HB 59, which Kasich signed. But that law hasn’t been directly tied to the other four abortion providers’ decisions to shut down.

Traditional schools get much more capital funding than charter schools, state Rep. Adkins says
","A Florida House bill that would make school districts share capital funding with charter schools has sparked a debate over how much money the privately run institutions should get. A bill sponsored by Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami, would in part require that charter schools have access to local school board levies that are normally reserved for traditional public schools’ capital improvements.  Charter schools are financed with taxpayer money but managed by private companies. Initially touted as an option for students attending low-performing public schools, charters have grown in popularity. Critics have complained that too many taxpayer dollars have subsequently been shifted to the private companies that run charters, while traditional schools suffer from a lack of resources. In a House Appropriations Committee hearing for Fresen's HB 873, Republicans supported equal access to capital improvement funds by charter schools. ""I think it is time that we recognize that there is great disparity, tremendous disparity, in the funding on a per-student basis between our traditional public schools and our charter public schools,"" said Rep. Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, at the Feb. 9 hearing. The bill has drawn some extra scrutiny because Fresen works for an architecture firm that builds charter schools and his sister and brother-in-law are executives for the state's largest charter-school operator. The bill passed Appropriations 19-5 and on Feb. 17 passed the Education Committee, 13-4, both times along party lines. These votes move the bill to the House floor. The Legislature has argued about charter-school funding for years, and the subject is confusing, to say the least. We wanted to run the numbers to see if Adkins, a candidate for Nassau County Schools superintendent, is correct to say there’s a ""tremendous disparity"" between charter and traditional schools. It turns out that while the figures aren’t so easy to decipher, it seems Adkins has a point. School funding 101 Florida has 4,270 public schools with around 2.7 million children enrolled and more coming every month. Those figures include some 650 charter schools across the state, with about 250,000 students. Charter-school enrollment has grown at least fivefold in the last decade. That means statewide, there are more than six traditional schools for every charter school. But since charter schools often have much smaller enrollments than their counterparts, traditional schools have almost 11 students for every one in a charter. Calculating school funding is confusing alchemy that mixes money from the state and local governments, including several kinds of tax revenues, grants and awards. Many of these sources are earmarked for specific things, like vocational-technical career centers and money to even out class sizes. For this fact-check, we’ll focus on capital outlay costs, which are dollars set aside largely for construction and maintenance. Adkins confirmed to PolitiFact Florida she was referring specifically to those capital dollars, not operating funds. State money for operations is allocated annually by the Legislature on a per-pupil basis — around $7,100 per student — and given to school districts, which divide the money among charter and traditional public schools. (This is the cash Gov. Rick Scott likes to mention when he talks about school funding.) Capital funding is a different story. Districts have been under pressure to build schools as Florida’s population grows, and a good chunk of the capital funding the state sets aside for schools is to pay down debts on projects they’ve already completed. Many charter schools, however, lease the property they occupy instead of erect new buildings, so much of their capital funding goes to paying rent. That’s a controversial practice on its own, since districts are often left without assets if a charter school closes.   There are several sources for these capital dollars, but we’re going to look at the two most relevant sources: state Public Education Capital Outlay money and local school board levies. Split access As charter schools grew more popular, the Legislature gave them more of the state capital money, known as PECO, than it gave traditional schools — which received nothing from that fund in some years. The totals have been in flux recently, but charter schools get vastly more PECO money than traditional schools on a per-student basis. Last year lawmakers gave $50 million to those 650 charter schools and $50 million to the other 3,600 traditional schools. That gives charter schools a bit more than $200 per student in PECO funding, while traditional schools get roughly $20 per student. The Legislature is currently debating how much to allocate for 2016-17. (As lawmakers head into budget negotiations, the House has proposed $90 million in capital funding for charter schools. The Senate has offered charters zero capital dollars. Both chambers would keep traditional schools’ capital outlay at $50 million.) But school boards have the power to add to their capital budgets in the form of levies. These levies can be up to 1.5 mills (that’s $1.50 per $1,000 in taxable property values) on an annual property tax bill. Money from those local levies, however, is largely off limits to charters. State statute allows districts to share this money with charter schools, but only five districts do. Fresen’s bill would require school districts to share a portion of this money with charters. Districts argue these local levies are needed to keep up with ever-growing communities. A common argument is that the districts have needed this money as the state has cut other sources of funding. It’s important to remember that not every district levies these taxes at the same rate or brings in the same amount. But there’s no denying it’s a huge pot of money to which charter schools don’t have ready access. According to the Florida Department of Revenue, these levies created an annual pool of about $2.3 billion statewide in 2015. Traditional schools also receive an additional $850 million or so in dedicated capital funding along with their PECO money, a House comparison says. Charter schools Traditional schools PECO funding $50 million $50 million School board levies N/A* $2.3 billion Other state and local revenues N/A $850 million Total capital outlay funding $50 million $3.2 billion Full-time students 250,000 2.4 million Capital funding per student $200 $1,300 Sources: Florida Department of Education, Florida Department of Revenue, Florida House Appropriations Committee, Office of the Speaker of the House * Five counties share some levy funds with charters These figures are rounded estimates, of course, and we need to remember that traditional schools and charter schools face different challenges. It also doesn’t include money from bonds that school districts can ask voters to approve. But using these estimates, we found that traditional schools have a more than 6 to 1 ratio of capital dollars than do charters. We’d consider that a pretty big disparity, regardless of the reasons behind the policies. Our ruling Adkins said, ""There is great disparity, tremendous disparity, in the (capital) funding on a per-student basis between our traditional public schools and our charter public schools."" While charter schools do get a larger per-student share of one kind of state capital funding, traditional schools can bring in much more by taking advantage of school board levies and other sources that charters can’t access.   There are many fine details that can get lost in discussions about the subject. But we found that currently, traditional schools potentially can get six times the capital funding per pupil than charter schools can. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/22/janet-adkins/traditional-schools-get-much-more-capital-funding-/

Governor Maggie Hassan says drug overdoses are second leading cause of death in New Hampshire
","During her recent State of the State address, Gov. Maggie Hassan dropped a startling statistic about New Hampshire’s opioid problem. ""Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire,"" said the two-term Democrat. ""Today, more Granite Staters are killed by overdoses than by diabetes, breast cancer or motor vehicle accidents."" Much has been reported about the rapid rise of drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire. More than 400 people died from a drug overdose in 2015, up from 326 overdose deaths in 2014, and 192 in 2013. The issue has taken a role in the 2016 presidential contest. During a recent ABC News Republican debate, moderator David Muir cited Hassan’s claim. But are overdoses now the second leading cause of death in the state, beating out diabetes, breast cancer and motor vehicle accidents? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers. Hassan’s camp cited a chart created by New Futures, a statewide advocacy organization that focuses on substance abuse. The bar chart, titled ""In Perspective -- New Hampshire Deaths,"" stacks up drug deaths against other mortality statistics from 2014. Drug overdose deaths rank second in the chart, behind Alzheimer's disease, which led to 351 deaths in 2014. Those two causes of deaths are followed by diabetes (310), flu and pneumonia (226), kidney disease (175), breast cancer (170), motor vehicle deaths (138) and a host of other cancers.   The slide, however, doesn’t include every cause of death, and leaves out several conditions that led to far more deaths than drug overdoses and alzheimer's disease in 2014. Heart disease caused 2,464 New Hampshire deaths in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same year, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease and stroke killed 680 and 474 Granite Staters respectively, the CDC reported. The point of the slide, however, is not to rank causes of death, but rather to contrast similar mortality causes and put drug deaths into perspective, according to New Futures spokesman Joe Gallagher. ""The slide does not attempt to rank drug overdoses as the second leading common cause of death in New Hampshire, nor does the slide account for all causes of death in the state,"" he said in an email. So, where exactly do drug overdoses stand among causes of death? It depends on how one classifies mortality rates. While the New Futures slide breaks out different forms of cancer, for example, the CDC lumps all cancer data together and names the disease the leading cause of death in New Hampshire. All forms of the cancer killed nearly 2,700 people in the state 2014. Heart disease followed cancer as the second leading cause of death in New Hampshire, according to the CDC data. ""Accidents"" -- which includes things like car crashes and drug overdoses -- ranked third, and left 716 people dead in 2014. Even if one breaks out different forms of cancer and heart disease, the leading causes of death in those categories still outnumbered drug overdose deaths in 2014, according to the New Hampshire Division of Vital Records Administration. Lung cancer was the underlying cause of 730 New Hampshire deaths in 2014. Atherosclerotic heart disease led to 687 deaths in the state that same year, according to division statistician Nicholl Marshall. Hassan went on to cite specific conditions that drug overdoses have surpassed, including diabetes, breast cancer or motor vehicle accidents. New Futures pointed us to data from the American Cancer Society, which shows breast cancer killed an estimated 170 Granite Staters in 2014, far fewer than the 326 killed by drug overdoses. Diabetes killed 300 people in New Hampshire during 2014, according to the CDC, again fewer than the state’s drug deaths that year. And, finally, motor vehicle accidents accounted for 102 deaths in 2014, according to the New Hampshire office of the chief medical examiner. Our ruling New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said, ""Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire."" Drug deaths are a growing cause of death in the state, and have certainly outpaced car accidents, diabetes and breast cancer, the three examples Hassan cited. But overdoses are not the second leading cause of death, still falling behind heart disease, stroke, and a host of other ailments.

Trump campaign manager: 'We don't have any donors'
","Why was Donald Trump heavily booed during the Feb. 13 Republican presidential debate in South Carolina? Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s national campaign manager, addressed that question during a Feb. 15 radio interview on ""The John Fredericks Show"" based in Portsmouth. He said the Republican National Committee offers debate tickets to the big donors for each presidential candidate and, as such, Trump supporters are shut out. ""As you know, Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we don’t have any donors,"" Lewandowski said. Seconds later, Lewandowski added: ""We have only one donor to the campaign, so we can submit only one name. His name is Donald Trump, and he already has a spot on that stage, and he’s always at the center of that stage because he’s the front runner."" Let’s start by noting the RNC disputes Lewandowski’s claim that debate tickets are reserved for the highest donors, saying each of the five campaigns participating in the South Carolina event - including Trump’s - were given 107 passes to distribute as they pleased. The subject of this fact-check is not debate tickets but Lewandowski’s repeated claim that the billionaire Trump is the ""only"" contributor to his campaign. Trump often says he’s ""self-financing"" his campaign, a statement our colleagues at PolitiFact National recently rated Half-True. Lewandowski’s assertion that there are no outside donors to the campaign, however, takes Trump’s claim to a new level and deserves a separate look. We asked Trump’s campaign for an explanation of Lewandowski’s comments but did not get a response. Contributions Trump’s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015, according to the latest Federal Election Commission records. Trump put in $12.8 million of that himself. The remaining $6.6 million came from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election. Trump has invested far more of his personal money into his campaign than any other presidential contender. The only other candidates endowing their own campaigns are: •Republican Jeb Bush, $388,720, or 1.2 percent of $31.9 million he raised; •Democrat Hillary Clinton, $368,147, or 0.3 percent of the $115.6 million she raised; and •Republican Ben Carson, $25,000, or 0.05 percent of the $54 million he raised. Trump, by contrast, has put in 66 percent of the money his campaign has raised. But the remaining 34 percent, contrary to Lewandowski’s claim, has come from donors. FEC rules require candidates to disclose the names of donors who have contributed an aggregate $200 or more to their campaigns. Through the end of 2015, Trump listed about 3,200 such patrons who donated a collective $1.6 million. A far greater number of people made small donations to the campaign, but we can’t tell you how many because these names and contributions are not itemized. What we do know is that Trump, at year’s end, raised almost $5 million from people who sent in less than $200 apiece. Although a significant portion of his campaign fund comes from individuals, Trump doesn’t appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool. It has no record of any events to benefit Trump. In contrast, Political Party Time has recorded more than 280 fundraisers for Clinton and more than 150 for Bush since the start of 2015. There is, however, a ""donate"" button on Trump’s website. Lastly, any conversation about Trump’s ""self-financed"" campaign also should include two caveats: •Of the personal money he’s put into his campaign, Trump lists $200,000 as a contribution and $12.6 million as loans. That means he may expect to recoup those funds. •Trump ramped up his self-financing in the final quarter of 2015, when he made $10.8 million of his loans to his campaign. Our ruling ""Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we don’t have any donors,"" Lewandowski, Trump’s campaign manager, told a Virginia radio audience. Seconds later, he virtually repeated the claim. Trump is certainly his own greatest benefactor, having endowed his campaign with $12.8 million of the $19.4 million it raised through the end of last year - or 66 percent of its funds. Trump lists almost all of his investments in his campaign as a loan, not a donation, so he may be expecting to get some of his money back. In any case, Lewandowski is flat-out wrong by insisting the campaign has no donors other than Trump. He ignores thousands of supporters who contributed $6.6 million through the end of last year, or 34 percent of the campaign’s resources. So we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2016/feb/22/corey-lewandowski/trumps-campaign-manager-we-dont-have-any-donors/

Comedian Bill Maher says ISIS' army is outnumbered by surrounding Arab states 250 to 1
","Comedian and social commentator Bill Maher, in a Feb. 10 essay for The Hollywood Reporter, wanted to know why the terrorist group ISIS is doing so well in the Middle East when so many nearby countries with big militaries want it gone. ""Why don't they fight their own battles? Why are Muslim armies so useless against ISIS? ISIS isn't 10 feet tall. There are 20,000 or 30,000 of them. The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people. So why do we have to be the ones leading the fight? Or be in the fight at all?"" We were wondering if Maher's numbers were correct and Islamic State fighters are potentially outgunned by as much as 250 to 1 in the region. ISIS size In the past, we've found reliable estimates of the strength of ISIS, also known as ISIL, are hard to come by. United States intelligence data from May to August of 2014 put the number at 20,000 to 31,500 fighters. Media reports at the time, based on unnamed sources, put the number at anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000. Maher’s spokesman, Adam Schiff, said the comedian was going by that widely available U.S. estimate. The latest U.S. estimate is 19,000 to 25,000 released by the White House on Feb. 4. The Obama administration contends that the fight against ISIS has brought the number down. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the numbers show ISIS is finding it increasingly harder to find replacements for the thousands of fighters who have been killed. So Maher is still in the ballpark. Surrounding militaries But what about the militaries surrounding ISIS? We turned to the World Bank's website and its tally of armed forces personnel in various countries. The most recent counts listed are for the year 2013. The website says its source is ""The Military Balance,"" published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. If you consider the countries bordering Iraq and Syria — Iran (with 563,000 armed forces personnel), Jordan (115,500), Kuwait (22,600), Lebanon (80,000), Saudi Arabia (251,500) and Turkey (612,800) — you get a total of 1.6 million. Add in Iraq (177,600) and Syria (178,000) themselves and that brings the total to 2 million. That's less than half of Maher’s figure. When we heard back from Maher's spokesman, he said the comedian was also including the armies of Bahrain, Egypt, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. He's obviously using a broader definition of ""surrounding"" countries. Oman is about 560 miles from its closest border with Iraq. Putting that aside, if you add those five additional states into the mix, you're still 2 million soldiers shy of the 5 million cited by Maher. Schiff said Maher was relying on numbers from Wikipedia, specifically the ""List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel"" page. It lists the 2014 edition of ""The Military Balance"" as the source. Maher took the totals for those 13 countries and came up with 4.95 million. We wondered how both Wikipedia and the World Bank could cite the same data source and still be so far apart. The difference comes down to reservists. The World Bank total includes both military and paramilitary personnel on active duty serving full time. The totals on the Wikipedia page add in reserve forces who are not active military but are available for mobilization if necessary. If they're included as part of a country's army, the total for those 13 countries Maher wants to include rises to 4.95 million, as Maher said. If you don't include the reservists, the number of troops in the countries cited by the comedian only rises to 3.6 million. It all boils down to two questions. First, whether five countries cited by Maher, none of which share a border with Iraq and Syria, should be considered ""surrounding"" countries. Second, whether reservists should be considered part of a country's army. On that point, we will note that about half of the U.S. troops in Iraq in 2005 were reservists. All of the countries Maher is counting except Syria and Iran (which are waging their own efforts against ISIS) are part of a 66-country coalition that has pledged to eliminate the threat posed by the terrorist group. However, some may be doing little more than letting the United States use their country as a staging point for airstrikes. Surrounding countries have not played a major role in the campaign. Michael Desch, co-director of the international security program at the University of Notre Dame, said the Arab states either have inept armies or are preoccupied with domestic threats (or both). In addition, counter-insurgency operations typically require 10 to 20 as many troops to succeed. ""Given all that, it is no mystery ISIS has proven to be a tough nut to crack despite its relatively small numbers,"" he said. Our ruling Maher said, ""There are 20,000 or 30,000 (ISIS fighters). The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people."" Maher based his ISIS estimate on a widely reported estimate, though the White House has downgraded the official estimate a bit. It’s Maher’s tally of surrounding armies that needs more explanation. He's including reservists — not just active military and paramilitary — in his definition of ""army.""

Goodlatte says SCOTUS confirmations in presidential races are rare; haven't happened since 1940
","Count U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, among the many conservatives saying the replacement of the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court should be left to the next president. ""It’s highly unusual to have a Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year. The last one was 1940,"" Goodlatte said in a Feb. 15 interview on the Fox Business Network. Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has criticized President Barack Obama over the years for embracing liberal policies and sometimes stepping around Congress to enact them. He told Fox it’s ""highly unlikely"" that Obama, who will leave office next January, would appoint a new justice who has anything close to Scalia’s conservative views. Obama is promising to nominate a new justice, and some Senate Republicans are threatening to block the nomination because they want the new president to fill the open seat. Although Goodlatte won’t have a vote in the controversy, we decided to fact-check his full statement that a presidential election-year confirmation of a Supreme Court justice is 1) rare and, 2) hasn’t occurred since 1940. During the 80-year time frame that Goodlatte cites, it’s pretty clear that election-year confirmations indeed have been a rarity. There’s a couple reasons for that. Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National that justices rarely have died in office in recent decades, and they don’t usually resign during an election year in order to avoid escalating debate over filling their seats. But there has been election-year activity on Supreme Court seats. Let’s start with 1940. That Jan. 4, President Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, nominated Frank Murphy to the court. The overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later. Murphy filled the seat of Justice Pierce Butler, who died in November 1939. In October 1956, Justice Sherman Minton stepped down. With the Senate adjourned, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, used a recess appointment to elevate William Brennan to the seat. Brennan was formally nominated by Eisenhower and confirmed by the Democratic-led Senate early the next year. The next election-year opening occurred in 1968, when Chief Justice Earl Warren announced he wanted to retire. President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat who was not seeking re-election, nominated sitting Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Warren as chief justice. Johnson nominated Homer Thornberry to replace Fortas. But neither of those men, who were nominated in June, got a confirmation vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Republicans and Southern Democrats filibustered Fortas, whom they considered a liberal jurist. In October, Johnson withdrew both Fortas’ and Thornberry’s nominations. Warren remained on the bench until the spring of 1969 when Warren Burger - nominated by President Richard Nixon, a Republican - became chief justice. So although there was action on Supreme Court seats in 1956 and 1968, it’s accurate to say the Senate did not confirm a justice during either election year. But 1988 was a different story. That Feb. 3, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 97-0 to confirm Anthony Kennedy for a seat on the high court. That was during the last full year of Republican Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Kennedy was Reagan’s third choice to fill a vacancy left by retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. In July 1987, Reagan nominated Robert Bork, but the Senate rejected him in a vote that October. Reagan then announced he would nominate Douglas Ginsburg but backtracked after Ginsburg acknowledged he had smoked marijuana as a college student and early in his teaching career. Finally, on Nov. 30, 1987, Reagan nominated Kennedy. The Senate Judiciary Committee held three days of hearings on Kennedy’s nomination in December 1987 before recommending his confirmation and sending his selection to the full Senate. We asked Goodlatte’s office to back up the congressman’s claim that no Supreme Court justice has been confirmed during an election year since 1940 and got a reply from Michael Woeste, deputy press secretary at the House Judiciary Committee. He stressed that although Kennedy was confirmed in an election year, the original nomination for the seat he filled was made well before then. ""The Reagan example is distinguishable because Kennedy was simply a replacement for Douglas Ginsburg, who dropped out, and Ginsburg was the replacement for Bork, who dropped out earlier,"" Woeste wrote in an email. ""So Reagan’s initial appointment for that slot on the Supreme Court occurred before the election year, and the replacements were for the same position."" Our ruling Goodlatte said: ""It’s highly unusual to have a Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year. The last one was 1940."" Clearly, such confirmations are rare in modern times; it’s happened only once during the past 18 presidential elections. That doesn’t mean that the Senate has a long tradition of refusing to consider high court nominations when the White House is up for grabs. What it shows mostly is that Supreme Court justices avoid retiring during presidential election years. There’s an obvious flaw, however, in Goodlatte’s contention that 1940 was the last time a justice was confirmed during a presidential election year. Kennedy was unanimously confirmed in February 1988. So on the whole, we rate Goodlatte’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/22/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-scotus-appointment-presidential-yea/

Brady misleads on graduated tax comparison
","The race for the nation’s next president isn’t the only big choice facing Illinois voters in 2020. They also will approve or reject a plan spearheaded by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker to replace Illinois’ flat income tax with a series of graduated rates intended to make the wealthy pay more. The plan has become a rallying cry for state Democrats, who say it provides an equitable way to raise much-needed revenue. Republicans have come out swinging against it, predicting it will mean future tax hikes for the middle class. We’ve fact-checked a number of assertions on the issue from both sides, including one from state Senate Republican Leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who inaccurately claimed last summer that Illinois’ last tax hike sent middle-class families fleeing the state. At a recent event for McClean County Republicans, Brady lobbed another attack at Pritzker’s proposal, arguing the governor had ""manipulated"" the issue by touting his plan as a tax hike limited to the state’s wealthiest residents. ""Eventually the politicians, after they’ve driven out some of the million-dollar incomes, have to go back down to lower incomes,"" Brady said, according to a report from WGLT, a local NPR station. Brady went on to cite Oregon as an example of what Illinois’ future could hold if voters OK the graduated tax measure, which would allow the state to implement higher tax rates on households earning more than $250,000 a year. ""In 2012 its (Oregon’s) highest bracket included anyone more than $250,000,"" he said. ""Oregon expanded the upper tax bracket to a levy, the highest being 9.9%, on anyone making more than $125,000."" Brady’s implication is that the same thing could happen for Illinois residents. But is Brady’s Oregon example accurate? Did Oregon lawmakers lower the threshold for the state’s top bracket after 2012 to tax more earners at its highest rate, as Brady suggested? We decided to find out. In 2010, Oregon voters approved a measure that temporarily raised taxes on the state’s biggest earners. From 2009 through 2011, individuals there making more than $125,000 and couples making more than $250,000 paid a state income tax rate of 10.8% on every dollar exceeding those amounts. Single filers making more than $250,000 and couples earning greater than $500,000 paid 11%. In 2012, the top rate fell to 9.9% for all individual income greater than $125,000 and all joint income above $250,000. Those brackets remain in place today. Although Brady’s dates are slightly off, the bigger issue with his claim centers on his underlying argument. Oregon’s history does not fit Brady’s narrative of politicians driving out wealthy residents with high top rates and then turning to those who earn less to make up the difference. First, Oregon lawmakers did not reopen the tax code to expand the top bracket to include less wealthy earners after the tax had gone into effect. Instead, voters approved the change as part of the same package that included those higher, temporary rates from 2009 through 2011. What’s more, single filers making more than $125,000 but less than $250,000 and joint filers making more than $250,000 but less than $500,000 paid less — not more — when the permanent top bracket with its lower income threshold took effect than they did as part of the temporary structure’s second-highest bracket. So we asked Brady’s office to explain how Oregon’s history backed up the senator’s argument. A spokesman responded that Brady’s claim is accurate because ""the bracket for the top tax rate was broadened"" from what it was when the law initially took effect. He did not address the fact that Oregon’s law also eliminated the higher rate associated with that top bracket and reduced the rate that those who had been in its second-highest bracket now pay. Oregon also makes a poor example for Brady’s broader case that raising taxes on the rich drives them out of state. Between 2010 and 2017, the latest IRS data show, the number of taxpayers reporting income of $1 million or more grew faster in Oregon than in any other state. That isn’t to suggest Oregon’s graduated tax helped it make those gains. But it does call into question Brady’s assertion that a more progressive rate structure is a recipe for economic disaster. Citing Oregon as an example of what Illinois’ future could hold if voters approve Pritzker’s graduated tax plan, Brady said Oregon’s highest income tax bracket included anyone making more than $250,000 in 2012 before the state expanded that top bracket to include ""anyone making more than $125,000."" In 2010, Oregon voters approved a measure that temporarily raised the rate for income exceeding $125,000 to 10.8% and earnings over $250,000 to 11%. The same law included a scheduled rate reduction for all income over $125,000 beginning in 2012. Since then, the state has taxed income in its top bracket at 9.9%. Brady suggested that Oregon taxpayers earning between $125,000 and $250,000 saw an increase after 2012 because of the bracket change in the state’s graduated income tax measure. While the law did lower the threshold for Oregon’s top tax bracket, all taxpayers in it paid less in taxes than they had for the previous three years because the tax rate was also lowered. Given that his remarks create an inaccurate impression that taxes went up in Oregon after 2012, we rate his claim Mostly False.

How many Americans actually donate to political candidates?
","MUSCATINE, Iowa — Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants more Americans donating to political campaigns. The business entrepreneur pitched a ""democracy dollars"" idea that would give every voter $100 to spend on any candidate they wish — but the voter has to use the money or lose it.  Doing this, Yang told voters at a town hall in Muscatine on Jan. 23, would boost the influence of Americans of average means compared with corporations. The percentage of Americans who give to campaigns is quite small, he said. ""Right now 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns and candidates,"" Yang said.  PolitiFact reporters were covering the event in the student center at Muscatine Community College when Yang made this remark, and we wondered if it was true.  The figure is not based off of actual donations, but rather a survey asking people if they’ve donated. We found estimates vary.   Yang’s claim about American political donors rests on one poll that is several months old but offers a snapshot of how many people said they were making such donations.  A CNBC/SurveyMonkey online poll in June found that 8% of Americans said they have donated to a 2020 presidential candidate. An additional 19% responded, ""no but I plan to."" The poll is based on what people said — it isn’t based on records of who actually donated. RELATED: Fact-checking Andrew Yang in Muscatine, Iowa The Pew Research Center analyzed data from a major election survey called the American National Election Studies. That data showed about 12% of Americans said they gave to candidates in 2016, 9% gave to parties and 5% gave to other groups.  The survey does not specify the type of candidate (federal, state or local). It included contributions of any size. The data is based on self-reported survey responses. There’s an important distinction between donations above and below $200. Under Federal Election Commission rules, campaigns must register the personal data of donors who give $200 or more. (That includes name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.) However, if a donor gives an amount less than $200, the campaign is not required to disclose the donor's name.  The Center for Responsive Politics found that a tiny share of Americans make federal donations of more than $200. In 2016 about a half-percent — 0.52% — of the U.S. population donated $200 or more to political candidates, parties or political action committees. Overall, about two-thirds of the value of donations come from donations of $200 and above, and one-third come from donations that are smaller.  RELATED: Thinking small: Why Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates seek low-dollar campaign contributions Yang said, ""Right now 5% of Americans donate to candidates.""  He’s likely in the ballpark, but the number can only be determined by polling, and different polls have found different numbers.  Yang was citing an online poll in June that found 8% of Americans said they had given to a 2020 presidential candidate. That was more than a year before the election. Pew found based on data from the American National Election Studies questionnaires after the last presidential election that 12% said they donated, but that wasn’t limited to federal candidates. Because the best estimates are small, though not quite as small as what Yang said, we rate the statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/jan/24/andrew-yang/what-percent-americans-donate-political-candidates/

No, Californians aren’t being asked to repeal Prop. 13’s residential property tax limits
","Supporters of a California ballot measure that would remove some of Proposition 13’s tax protections say claims shared thousands of times on Facebook and other social media platforms have distorted their initiative.  The campaign for the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of 2020, also known as the ""split-roll"" measure, is still gathering signatures to qualify for the November ballot. It is backed by a group of union and social justice organizations.  If approved by voters, the measure would hike taxes on factories, stores and other commercial and industrial real estate by requiring they pay property tax based on current market value rather than the value of the property when it was purchased. ​ It would raise an estimated $7.5 billion to $12 billion annually, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. The money would be distributed to schools and local governments.  The proposed ballot measure, however, would not touch tax protections for homeowners.  Yet many claims on social media suggest the initiative would repeal all parts of Prop. 13, stoking concerns that residential property taxes could spike. Here’s one example posted on Facebook Dec. 31, 2019:    A similar Facebook post by Bakersfield Tuff, a media company focused on racing and rodeo, was shared more than 2,200 times. Others have appeared on the platforms Next Door and We Chat, according to the campaign for the initiative.   Do these claims distort the truth? We set out on a fact check to find out. Background on Prop. 13 In 1978, voters approved Prop. 13, which slashed property taxes and limited how much they could go up. It also tied tax rates to a property’s purchase price, rather than to the fluctuations of California’s real estate market, ensuring homeowners greater financial stability. The law remains popular among homeowners and business groups, who argue it allows neighborhoods to stay intact and older residents on fixed-incomes to remain in their homes rather than being forced out by high tax bills.  Groups such as Californians to Stop Higher Property Taxes have warned that removing Prop. 13’s commercial tax protections will lead companies to pass along any increased tax burden to consumers.  Critics of Prop. 13, on the other hand, say the law has cut too deeply into the foundation of tax revenue for local governments.  Social Media Claims ‘Completely False’ The campaign spearheading the November ballot measure contacted PolitiFact about the social media claims. ""They are completely false,"" said Alex Stack, spokesperson for the initiative. ""It would completely protect and exempt all residential property, that means homeowners, renters and seniors."" That’s backed up by the initiative’s official title and summary prepared by the Attorney General’s office. That document says the measure exempts ""residential properties; agricultural properties; and owners of commercial and industrial properties with combined value of $3 million or less.""   California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) Becerra's Role The social media posts claimed Becerra ""was putting together plans"" to ""eliminate"" Prop. 13. There’s no evidence to substantiate that.  Becerra and others attorneys general, however, have been criticized for drafting misleading ballot measure titles and summaries. For example, Becerra was accused of giving an earlier version of this measure a friendly write-up. But attorneys general do not initiate ballot measures. A spokesperson for Becerra declined to directly address the social media posts.  Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at Sacramento State University, said the claim about Becerra planning to repeal Prop. 13 is clearly wrong and described the rest of the information as ""cleverly fuzzy."" ""It’s very intelligently written,"" he said of the posts, suggesting they may have originated with a political operative. ""Only one or two spots are wrong. A lot is political opinion."" There’s no doubting the ballot measure’s significance, Hussey added. It would be ""a dramatic revision"" to Prop. 13. ""If passed, it would be by far the biggest change we’ve seen"" since voters approved the law, he said.  Keith Smith is a political science professor at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, where he studies elections and voting behavior.  He agreed the claim about Becerra was technically wrong. But given that the initiative represents a big change to Prop. 13, some voters may see it as ""a gateway"" to repealing the measure altogether.  Asked if social media posts were accurate, he replied: ""It depends on your perspective. Is [Prop. 13] going away? No, it’s not going away. Is [the ballot measure] proposing to do away with some aspect of Prop. 13 that currently exists? Yes."" The claims published on Facebook and other sites, Smith explained, could be more convincing to voters than any details in the ballot measure.  Earlier this month, ABC 10 Sacramento examined similar claims and found there’s no effort to eliminate Prop. 13. Adding to the confusion about the proposed November ballot measure, there’s a voter initiative on California’s March primary ballot called Proposition 13, the School and College Facilities Bond. But it has nothing to do with the landmark measure of the same name passed four decades ago. A spokesman for the California Secretary of State’s Office said that the numbers assigned to propositions are reused through the years, sometimes leading to duplicates.  Our Ruling  Social media posts claimed a November ballot measure would repeal California’s Prop. 13, and that Attorney General Becerra ""is putting together plans"" to eliminate the historic law.  The proposed measure would undo Prop. 13’s tax protections for commercial and industrial properties with a value over $3 million.  It would be a major change to the law.   But homeowners, small businesses and agricultural properties would not lose their Prop. 13 tax safeguards. That’s spelled out in the measure’s official state title and summary document. While Becerra’s office writes the legal titles and summaries for voter initiatives, the attorney general does not put forward ballot measures. There’s no evidence Becerra is trying to eliminate Prop. 13.  In the end, the social media posts capture the real concern about potential changes to Prop. 13, but they also greatly misrepresent the specific changes the November ballot measure would make to it.  We rate their claims about repealing Prop. 13 as False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

No, Trump isn’t signing an executive order on term limits ‘this week’
","President Donald Trump promised to push for term limits for members of Congress. But online posts claiming that this week he’s signing an executive order toward that end are false.

Leave it to President Trump to finally do something about it. ""This week, Trump is expected to roll out an executive order which will put in place term limits for all members of Congress, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate.

But descriptions for the YouTube video do not say that the claims are made-up. The video is tagged under the category ""News & Politics"" and, so far, has around 18,000 views and more than 1,000 likes. Commenters appear to think that the claims are true.

No, anglerfish do not typically grow to be seven feet long
","Anglerfish may have a reputation for being among the creepier-looking ocean-dwellers, but it’s not because they grow to be seven feet long, as a viral image on Facebook claims.  The Jan. 12 post shows a young girl reaching toward what appears to be a very large anglerfish mounted on display at a museum. The text above the image reads, ""So,... I’ve spent my entire life thinking the Deep Sea Angler Fish was about the size of a Nerf football. How horrifying is it that a typical specimen is SEVEN FEET LONG?""

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, anglerfish, known for the fishing pole-like protrusion that dangles over the females’ heads, do not grow to be seven feet long. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, anglerfish can’t grow any longer than 3.3 feet, but a typical anglerfish is even smaller -- less than a foot. What’s more, the picture referenced in the Facebook post alleging that anglerfish are typically 7 feet is taken from the Australian Museum’s 2012 exhibit titled  ""Deep Oceans."" The anglerfish in the photo is actually a large-scale sculpture model of the fish made of  plaster. When the exhibit opened in June 2012, The Sydney Morning Herald reported on how the exhibit’s team had created an ""oversized anglerfish"" and listed the many steps in making it: ""Pieces such as the oversized anglerfish, with huge fangs and antenna-like flashing rod to attract prey, begin with cutting and welding a metal frame, then sculpting material over it and, finally, hand painting it,"" the story says. While a massive anglerfish model might be a great teaching tool, the claim that these deep sea creatures grow to seven feet has no scientific grounding: Pants on Fire! ",/factchecks/2020/jan/24/viral-image/no-anglerfish-do-not-typically-grow-be-seven-feet-/

Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate muddles claim on education vs. corrections spending
","Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky is presenting herself as an advocate for social justice reform in her campaign for the state Supreme Court. To that end, she outlined a series of goals during a Nov. 19, 2019, talk with the University of Wisconsin Pre-Law Society, as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. She also lamented the state’s incarceration rate and what she views as too much spending on the Department of Corrections.  ""The Department of Corrections budget in Wisconsin is more than the Department of Education budget,"" she said. Karofsky is facing conservative Justice Dan Kelly and Marquette University Law School professor Ed Fallone in the Feb. 18, 2020 primary. The top two advance to the April 7 general election. Wisconsin does spend more tax dollars on corrections than it does for state universities or for technical colleges. However, the state does not have a Department of Education. So how does Karofsky’s claim rate? Digging into the numbers The state of Wisconsin funds education through three avenues: the Department of Public Instruction, which is generally responsible for public K-12 education; the University of Wisconsin system and the Wisconsin technical college system. None of these are a Department of Education as described by Karofsky.  When asked for backup, Karofsky campaign aide Alanna Conley acknowledged the judge misspoke. ""Obviously, at the end of a long day, where she was overseeing a trial and then had multiple campaign appearances, Judge Karofsky meant to say ‘Higher Education,’"" Conley said. ""She knows there’s not a ‘Dept. of Education’ in Wisconsin, nor a ‘Dept. of Higher Education,’ she was just referring to the state contribution to the UW System budget.  ""This issue has been widely discussed in the public."" Indeed it has. In 2018, we checked a similar claim from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kelda Helen Roys, who said, in Gov. Scott Walker’s first budget, Wisconsin for the first time spent more on corrections than the UW system.  A review of more than 20 years of state budgets found that to be accurate, but noted corrections started to catch up to the UW system before Walker took office. And that the overall UW budget, when federal grants and other revenue are factored in, is much larger than corrections. We rated the claim Mostly True. This trend is continuing under Gov. Tony Evers.  The state allocated $2.44 billion in general revenue for the Department of Corrections in the 2019-2021 budget compared to $2.24 billion for the UW system. However, the overall UW budget — $12.6 billion — remains significantly larger than corrections. Education funding in Wisconsin Let’s return to Karofsky’s original claim: ""The Department of Corrections budget in Wisconsin is more than the Department of Education budget."" States including Michigan, South Carolina, Oklahoma and Idaho maintain Departments of Education that share duties similar to Wisconsin’s Department of Public Instruction, including overseeing assessments and special education. By that measure, though, she is well off the mark. The state’s 2019-2021 budget includes $13.3 billion in general revenue dollars for the department. The bulk of the department’s $15.3 billion budget goes toward general school aid and what are termed categorical aids, such as for transportation. That compares to $2.44 billion in general revenue for corrections. Wisconsin does spend more on corrections than technical colleges. The state budgeted nearly $1.1 billion in state tax dollars to the latter for 2019-2021. Our ruling Karofsky claimed ""the Department of Corrections budget in Wisconsin is more than the Department of Education budget."" According to an aide, she intended to say the state spends more on corrections than the UW system, which is generally true. But she muddied her point by calling it the Department of Education, an agency that doesn't exist in Wisconsin by that name. And the agency closest to a Department of Education — the Department of Public Instruction — actually comes out far ahead of the Department of Corrections in general revenue funding. Our definition for Mostly False is ""the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/jan/24/jill-karofsky/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-muddles-claim-ed/

Has Austin removed legal consequences for where ‘homeless lie, sleep...defecate?’
","In early January, a man stabbed one person to death and injured others at an Austin shopping center. His attack ended at a burrito shop, where he jumped from the roof and later died from his injuries. Police later identified the attacker as a man experiencing homelessness, prompting Gov. Greg Abbott to highlight the incident as part of his ongoing assault on homeless policies in Austin. ""What Austin has done over the past half year is to perpetuate a sense of lawlessness in the city by the homeless,"" Abbott told reporters at the Capitol.""They have removed, seemingly, any legal consequences to the actions where the homeless lie, sleep, where they defecate."" Austin has changed the parameters of its ordinances regulating public camping related to homeless people multiple times since first suspending a ban on camping in public in June. But even when the regulations were at their most lax, they included provisions preventing camping in certain areas and legal consequences for violating the policy. Abbott did not return requests for comment seeking more information about his claim. Removal of camping ban in Austin Abbott has been publicly sparring with Austin leaders over the city's homeless policies since June, when the City Council voted to make public camping (except in parks) legal, as long as a person did not endanger ""the health or safety of another person or of themselves; or make usage of such area unreasonably inconvenient or hazardous."" The original policy made it legal for people to sit, sleep or panhandle on public sidewalks as long as they didn't engage in behavior or actions deemed aggressive. There were questions about the scope of the policy from the beginning. The Travis County Republican Party said the changes gave homeless people more rights than property owners and allowed for ""homeless camps on private property, business frontage, and even public sidewalks.""We rated that claim False. People were in violation of the ordinance if they continued camping in an unauthorized area after being notified by law enforcement that they were violating the policy and given ""a reasonable opportunity by a law enforcement officer to correct the violating conduct."" The policy also prohibited people from obstructing areas with ""high pedestrian traffic and a high incidence of petty crime related to public disorder."" The policy did not outline a specific penalty for violating these rules, which means an offense would be a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500. The ordinance change did not affect city policy related to defecating. Urinating or defecating in public view or ""in or on a public street, alley, sidewalk, yard, park, building, structure, plaza, or utility right-of-way or other public place"" is a Class C misdemeanor. Changes to Austin's policy In October, the City Council changed its camping ordinance again, adding more specific language defining camping and dictating where camping is permissible. The ordinance states that, unless there is an imminent health or safety threat, law enforcement officers must advise people violating the ordinance of places where they can sleep legally or about available shelter or housing in the area. They also are expected to contact a ""city designee who has the authority to offer to transport the person or provide the person with services."" A person commits an offense under this policy if they do not change their behavior after being notified by law enforcement that they are violating city code. An offense is still a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500. In early November, state and city officials started enforcing the new ordinance and took steps to clear out camps set up under highway overpasses and in areas near the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless. At least three people were arrested during the initial push to enforce the ordinance. One man was charged with camping in an area not designated for camping and two others were charged with resisting law enforcement activities in enforcing the policy. Again, urinating or defecating in public are still prohibited actions in Austin. Our ruling Abbott said that Austin officials ""have removed, seemingly, any legal consequences to the actions where the homeless lie, sleep, where they defecate."" Austin has taken steps to allow for public camping in more areas than were previously permissible, but there are still limitations to where people who are homeless are allowed to sleep and lie in public — and legal consequences in place for violating the policy. The city has not changed its policies surrounding public urination or defecation — both actions are prohibited.

Ex-Georgia candidate makes Pants on Fire claim about son of US Rep. Lucy McBath, Jordan Davis
","U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., became a gun control advocate after her teenage son was murdered. On Jan. 20, the day 22,000 people rallied for gun rights in Richmond, Va., a Republican from her home state attacked her policies in a Facebook post. The post, repeated on Twitter, was made by Paul Maner, who ran in 2016 for the Republican nomination for a Georgia state Senate seat.  The post includes a video related to the Richmond rally and says:  ""THIS is what the lunatics like Lucy McBath for Congress Rep. Lucy McBath are all about. ""#TakeBack6th ""If her son hadn't been involved with a drug deal gone bad, her son might still be alive today. Her solution, to disarm everyone who is a law abiding citizen."" The claim about her son is wrong.  McBath called it ""pathetic"" and used Maner’s Twitter post to try to raise donations for her campaign. Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, called the attack vile and hateful, and urged her Twitter followers to support McBath. We messaged Maner on Facebook, asking for information to back his claim, but did not get a response. The Atlanta Journal Constitution describes him as a Georgia Republican activist. The facts of McBath’s son’s death at the hands of Michael Dunn are clear and have been reported many times by local and national news media. It became known as the ""loud music"" case. Drugs were not involved. From a CBS News story on Dunn’s sentencing in October 2014: Dunn encountered four black teens — including McBath’s son, Jordan Davis, 17  — on the evening of Nov. 23, 2012, when Dunn and his girlfriend pulled up next to their SUV in the parking lot of a convenience store in Jacksonville, Fla.  Dunn asked the teens to turn down the music in their car. Davis took issue with his request. The two exchanged heated words as Davis sat in the back seat of the SUV. Dunn argued that he thought he saw the barrel of a gun inside the car and was in fear for his life when he shot up the SUV. The prosecution said that the threat Dunn, a white man, perceived from the group of black teens was ""only in his imagination."" The teens were unarmed. Dunn fired 10 shots in three short bursts, striking Davis three times.  At the sentencing, Dunn then 47, made a short statement addressed to Davis' family: ""I truly regret what happened... if I could roll back time and do things differently I would. Still, I'm mortified I took a life."" We looked through multiple news stories about the case. None tied the shooting to a potential drug deal. Dunn was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Maner said Davis, the son of a member of Congress, was killed in ""a drug deal gone bad."" Davis was among four black teens in a car who got in a dispute with a middle-aged white man who wanted them to turn down their music. The man shot and killed Davis, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life without parole.

No, Aaron Hernandez’ family isn’t entitled to the rest of his NFL contract money
","After Netflix released its docuseries, ""Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"" claims about the former NFL player’s contract and infamous murder case have resurfaced on social media. One viral Facebook post features a split photo of Hernandez, former tight end for the New England Patriots, blowing a kiss to his daughter in a courtroom. Text above the image says:   ""Aaron Hernandez committed suicide because under the state of Massachussetts law, if you die during a appeal of conviction, the original conviction becomes null & void. This means he technically never violated the New England Patriots contract, thus his daughter is now entitled to the remainder of the guaranteed $15 million the Patriots owe him."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the post contains some accurate information, it’s ultimately wrong and outdated. It’s true that a legal principle in Massachusetts initially erased Hernandez’ conviction because he died before having a chance to complete his appeal. However, that rule was later thrown out by the state’s Supreme Judicial Court and his conviction was reinstated. Regardless of the court’s decision, the presumption that Hernandez’ family would have been entitled to money owed from his football contract has also been disputed. Hernandez was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2010. He played for the team until the 2013 offseason, when he was arrested and charged in the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional player who had been found shot to death on June 17, 2013. The Patriots released Hernandez immediately after the arrest.  In 2015, Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison. While on trial for Lloyd’s murder, he was also indicted for a 2012 double-homicide. In 2017, he was acquitted of most of the charges in that case, days before he was found dead in his prison cell. A judge threw out Hernandez’ conviction that year, citing ""abatement ab initio,"" a common law legal doctrine dating back to English law that states a defendant’s convictions be vacated if the defendant dies during appeal. At the time, some law experts said with a ""creative lawyer"" Hernandez’ family ""could file litigation against the Patriots and the NFL for voiding Hernandez’ contract after his indictment.""  But a contemporaneous report by the Boston Globe disputed the success of such a suit. The newspaper said that while the situation was unprecedented (Hernandez was the first player in NFL history to be convicted of first-degree murder during his playing days and the first to die under such circumstances) he was ""almost certainly"" in breach of his contract: ""When Hernandez was arrested for Lloyd’s murder in June 2013, the Patriots released him and refused to pay the remaining guaranteed money — a $3.25 million deferred signing bonus payment, and base salaries of $1.323 million and $1.137 million. They also declined to pay a $82,000 workout bonus that he had earned in June 2013... Hernandez lost his grievance, and his contract would likely prevent him from collecting any of the money now, despite the lack of a conviction on his record."" But it’s a moot point now. The prosecution appealed to have the conviction reinstated, and on March 13, 2019, it was.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reinstated Hernandez’s murder conviction in a unanimous decision to do away with the legal principle. The court called the rule ""outdated and no longer consonant with the circumstances of contemporary life,"" and ordered Hernandez’ conviction to be restored and that the practice be abolished for future cases.

No, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus
","A viral Facebook post suggests that a new coronavirus outbreak is related to an expired patent and that, while journalists are ""fearmongering"" over a quarantine, there is actually a vaccine available for it. The Jan. 22 post begins: ""So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today.. We have a sudden outbreak. There's magically already a vaccine available.. And NOW fear mongering spread by the media about quarantine."" Included with the post are screenshots of: Part of a patents.google.com page that seems to indicate a U.S. patent application has expired, but there is no reference to the coronavirus or to what the application is for at all. A CNN.com headline — which seems to contradict the Facebook post — that says: ""Vaccine for new Chinese coronavirus in the works."" A South China Morning Post headline that says: ""China grants emergency quarantine powers to stop spread of Wuhan virus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what we know. There is an outbreak of what is known as the Wuhan coronavirus.  There are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans. One of them, categorized as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become known as the Wuhan coronavirus because of the city of about 11 million people in central China where it was discovered. Another is known as SARS-CoV and is the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Two weeks before this Facebook claim was posted, the New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had blamed a new coronavirus for sickening 59 people in Wuhan. The cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds.  By the day the Facebook post was published, the outbreak had killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 400 — including a Washington State man who had recently been to the Wuhan region — and had spread to several other countries, according to the Times. Despite what the Facebook post suggests regarding a recently expired patent and a new vaccine, there is no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus available. The partial image of a patents page that is included with the post refers to a patent associated with the coronavirus that causes SARS, a different illness. It makes no sense that there could have been a patent for a vaccine for a coronavirus that was only just discovered. In fact, the CNN story cited in the post quotes a top U.S. federal health official as saying the National Institutes of Health is merely ""in the process of taking the first steps"" towards developing a vaccine, and that it would be more than a year until a vaccine might be available. ""There are no vaccines available for any coronaviruses let alone the (Wuhan) one,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security, in a PolitiFact interview. As for the post’s reference to a quarantine, the Washington Post reported that Chinese health ­authorities were seeking to impose a ""­quasi-quarantine"" in the area of the outbreak, advising people in Wuhan not to leave. But the authorities could also forcibly quarantine people known to have or suspected to have the coronavirus, according to the report. Hours after the Facebook post, the Chinese government announced plans to quarantine Wuhan, indicating the city will cancel planes and trains leaving the city and suspend buses, subways and ferries. Before we close, two points for putting this outbreak in perspective: 1. This coronavirus has been compared to the SARS outbreak of 2003, which caused 774 deaths in more than two dozen countries (none in the United States).  But the rate of fatalities currently appears to be much lower; and it is still unclear the degree to which human-to-human transmission is possible with this virus, according to an article by Adalja. 2. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the Wuhan coronavirus is ""a serious public health concern,"" but the immediate health risk to the general American public ""is considered low at this time."" A Facebook post states: ""So.. patent on this ‘new’ Corona virus expired on the 22nd, today.. We have a sudden outbreak. There's magically already a vaccine available.. And NOW fear mongering spread by the media about quarantine."" There was an outbreak in recent weeks of what is known as the Wuhan coronavirus.  News media reported that Chinese authorities have taken steps to quarantine Wuhan, the city in China where the outbreak was discovered. More importantly, there was no expired patent related to the Wuhan coronavirus, and there is currently no vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, either.

Major environmental groups opposed the new USMCA trade deal
","In the last debate before the Feb. 3 Iowa presidential precinct caucuses, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA) did not go far enough to protect the environment or the rights of workers.  Moderator: ""But, Sen. Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal [the USMCA]. Are you unwilling to compromise?"" Sanders: ""The AFL-CIO does. ""The Machinists Union does not (support the USMCA trade deal). And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it."" We found Sanders mostly correct in stating major organizations oppose the USMC, although stating that every major organization opposes it was a stretch. Plus, his claims about union support for the deal need some context. Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign pointed to a letter from a group of 10 high-profile environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, Greenpeace, and others, urging Congress to vote against the USMCA.  The 10 groups signing the letter have a combined 12 million members.  ""We do not get many opportunities to renegotiate trade deals. At this pivotal moment, we cannot afford to lock ourselves into a multi-decade deal that ignores climate change and helps corporate polluters,"" the letter stated. However, some large environmental groups did not take a stance on the USMCA. In an email to The Daily Iowan, representatives from the Environmental Working Group, a nonpartisan conservation nonprofit, said the group has no official stance on the USMCA. Likewise, the Union of Concerned Scientists said the USMCA is not an issue the organization is working on or following.  The USMCA is the new agreement governing trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, updating the nearly 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. The leaders of the three countries involved in the agreement agreed to the USMCA in November 2018.  The USMCA passed the House of Representatives 385-41 on Dec. 19, 2019, and the Senate 89-10 on Jan. 17, 2020, with bipartisan support. Sanders was one of 10 senators to vote no on the agreement. Channing Dutton, a Des Moines-based attorney and member of Citizens Climate Lobby, said most environmental groups would oppose the agreement because the USMCA does not include provisions for climate change in its current form. ""It’s a safe bet that every responsible climate change organization would oppose any trade agreement that ignored the effects of climate change or allow easy modification of the agreement because of climate change impacts,"" Dutton said.  Dutton, who has endorsed businessman Tom Steyer’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, added that the agreement cannot be modified to adapt to worsening climate conditions, echoing the concerns environmental groups expressed that the deal cannot be altered to provide provisions for climate change after it becomes law.  ""This is why he [Sanders] said he would not sign the deal without climate change considerations,"" Dutton said. ""They use the agreement to stop people, communities, states, and even nations from doing things such as adopting the carbon tax that Citizens Climate Lobby supports."" Sanders also brought up during the Des Moines debate the USMCA’s support among unions. Moderator Brianne Pfannenstiel, the chief politics reporter at the Des Moines Register, said the AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 55 national and international labor unions, supports the deal.  The AFL-CIO announced in December 2019 its support for the deal, which it previously opposed, after negotiating with lawmakers to include more provisions for the deal it deemed to be labor-friendly.  ""The USMCA is far from perfect. It alone is not a solution for outsourcing, inequality or climate change,"" the AFL-CIO said in a prepared statement. ""Successfully tackling these issues requires a full-court press of economic policies that empower workers, including the repeal of tax cuts which reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas."" During the debate, Sanders noted that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace (IAM) workers, which has a membership of 600,000, opposes the USMCA.  Although the machinist and aerospace union is part of the AFL-CIO, it issued a statement criticizing the USMCA, though it did not cite concerns over climate change.  ""U.S. workers have been waiting over 25 years for a responsible trade deal that puts their interests ahead of corporations who are fleeing our shores,"" the machinists and aerospace union wrote in the statement. ""They are still waiting. The IAM will oppose NAFTA 2.0.""  Responding to PolitiFact, the Sanders campaign cited the IAM statement, as well as statements from the National Family Farm Coalition, which has around 450,000 members, and the United Food and Commercial Workers, with 1.3 million members, as evidence of labor unions upset with the USMCA.  While some unions are in opposition, other large unions have issued statements of support for the newest version of the USMCA. The Teamsters, a union consisting of truck drivers, mechanical workers and other trades with a membership of 1.4 million, supports the deal.  Additionally, the United Steel Workers, with a membership of 860,000, supported the deal, while the United Auto Workers, membership 990,000, did not explicitly support the deal, but said the deal will need to be strictly enforced to prevent the further loss of U.S. auto industry jobs to Mexico.  ""We will do all we can to vigilantly monitor the agreement to try to make sure multinational corporations live up to their end of the bargain, but we should have no illusion that our efforts alone will get the job done,"" United Auto Workers president Rory Gamble wrote in a prepared statement.  Sanders said about supporting USMCA, ""The AFL-CIO does. The Machinists Union does not. Every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it."" Sanders is correct in saying the Machinists Union does not support the USMCA trade deal, although some major unions support it.  Not every single environmental group in the country opposed USMCA — some had no position. But most of the major groups were opposed, including 10 organizations with 12 million combined members who urged Congress not to support the USMCA. We were unable to find any major environmental group that endorsed the deal.  We rate Sanders’ statement Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/jan/22/bernie-sanders/major-environmental-groups-opposed-new-usmca-trade/
