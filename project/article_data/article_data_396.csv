Family Foundation says U.S. among seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks
","The Family Foundation, a socially conservative Virginia group, recently applauded the U.S. House’s passage of a bill that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. ""The United States is one of only seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization..."" the organization said in a May 14 Facebook post. We wondered whether the global characterization was correct. The U.S. standard for abortion rights was handed down by the Supreme Court in its Roe v. Wade decision of 1973. The court ruled that a woman is entitled to have an elective abortion -- terminate a pregnancy for any reason -- until the point when a fetus can viably survive outside a uterus. Justices cited medical research showing that viability point can begin as early as 24 weeks into the gestation period, which begins on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period. So women in the United States can get an abortion for any reason until at least 24 weeks of gestation. After 24 weeks, states may set up their own abortion rules and most, including Virginia, generally restrict the procedure at some point to mothers whose health is endangered by pregnancy. The Family Foundation pointed us to a report on global abortion laws published in February 2014 by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization dedicated to ending abortion. It concluded that only seven of 198 nations and territories allow elective abortions after 20 weeks: Canada, China, Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, United States and Vietnam. We came up with the same seven countries after sifting through 2014 data published by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a worldwide pro-abortion group. Some might argue there’s an eighth nation, Australia, but this should come with a qualification.  Although Australia has no federal abortion law, it allows each of its states and territories to set its own guidelines. Some of those regions have tight restrictions but one -- Victoria, on the populous southeastern coast --allows an  elective abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy. Although the Lozier Institute and the Center for Reproductive Rights are at cross purposes, they agree on other broad characterizations of global abortion laws. The institute says 59 nations allow abortion without restriction at some point in pregnancy and 139 require some reason for the procedure, such as saving the life or health of the mother.  The center says 61 countries allow early abortions without restriction, 109 require a reason for it and 29 ban the procedure. The two organizations disagree mightily, however, on how the data should be interpreted. The Lozier Institute, in its report, said the figures show the U.S. is outside ""the international mainstream"" on abortion and has ""ultra-permissive abortion policies."" But Katherine Mayall, global advocacy adviser for the center, told us the data is an ""imperfect way to think about abortion laws. What’s important is access to clinics. In Europe, you don’t see the efforts to limit access to clinics you see in the United States."" We should note that House bill banning most abortions after the 20th week is expected to be blocked by Senate Democrats and, even if it does pass in the chamber, faces a promised veto from President Barack Obama. And one final note: In 2013, PolitiFact National gave a Half True rating to a statement by Carly Fiorina, now a GOP presidential candidate, that the U.S. was among ""four nations that legalize abortion after five months."" PolitiFact Texas gave the same rating that year to an almost identical claim made by Anita Perry, the wife of then Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Both statements were downgraded because many countries allow abortions after 20 weeks for special circumstances, such as if the mother’s life is endangered. The Family Foundation’s statement is different from Fiorina’s and Perry’s because the organization specified it was referring to elective abortions after 20 weeks. Our ruling The Family Foundation says, ""The United States is one of only seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization."" Separate research by pro- and anti-abortion rights groups back up claim. We won’t quibble over whether Australia should be added to the group of seven. We find the statement True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280978FFFC0>],/factchecks/2015/may/26/family-foundation/family-foundation-says-us-among-seven-nations-allo/
"['Georgia', 'Tourism', 'Transportation', 'Jay Roberts']","
Will out-of-staters or Georgians pay most of the new hotel fee?
","A new nightly $5 fee on hotel stays in Georgia won’t be collected for another six weeks, but the question remains just who will be paying it. Conservative estimates show the fee will pay close to 20 percent of the roughly $900 million that the transportation bill, House Bill 170, is expected to raise annually to tackle a backlog of transportation needs. Former state rep. Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, who spearheaded the bill, said about 85 percent of the hotel guests who pay the fee will be from outside Georgia. ""This shifts some of the burden to visitors who will have to share the costs to modernize the transportation network in Georgia,"" said Roberts, now a planning director for the state Department of Transportation, during floor debate on the final bill. The state’s hospitality industry, though, was blindsided by the last-minute addition of the fee and has claimed it will hurt business and Georgians. The Georgia Convention and Visitors Bureau points to a survey of hoteliers that shows about a third of leisure guests are in-state tourists. Those people will already be paying an average of 6 cents more a gallon for gas when the law takes effect July 1. So who is right? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. First, remember we already checked a claim that the fee will hurt Georgia’s convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state. We ruled Mostly True with a caveat: There is nothing that says the new fee must be passed along to hotel guests. In fact, looking at data from Savannah-area hotels, those businesses would be better off absorbing the cost – about $18.7 million a year, based on published occupancy rates – than passing it along and potentially chasing away 7.5 percent of room nights. That would cost hotels about $22.5 million. But if hotels pass them along to guests, where are those folks from? Roberts said he cited his figure based on memory of lawmakers’ debates on funding for the new Falcons stadium. ""I remember … that we were told that approximately 85 percent of the people that stay in the metro Atlanta motels/hotels are from out of state,"" Roberts said. In fact, Roberts underestimated slightly.  According to a website run by stadium advocates, 86 percent of overnight guests in the state’s largest hotel market are from outside Georgia. So where does the Georgia CVB get its figures? From the 2013 Georgia Longwood study that looked at both statewide figures as well as Atlanta, which has 94,000 of the state’s 177,000 hotel rooms. That report concluded 31 percent of leisure guests – that is, not including business travelers, conventioneers or people traveling with social groups like a church or school trip – were in-state travelers. For the Atlanta region, in-state travelers accounted for only 20 percent of the total. ""Almost half of the state’s hotel rooms are in the Atlanta metro, so you need to look at the figures in other regions to get a more clear picture of how many Georgians are affected by this fee,"" said Julie Ford Musselman, head of the Georgia CVB. That picture is a bit fuzzy, given that there is no single way that regions reported where their guests were from and what kind of guests they were. Hotels in the Lake Lanier area, for instance, reported based on the number of leisure and group bookings, with Georgians making up 73 percent and 56 percent, respectively. ""We have not done an aggregate study for every category, but looking at what we have, we can say that most definitely the $5 fee impacts Georgians more heavily than anyone realized when they passed this transportation bill,"" Musselman said. ""The ability to book business and keep our existing customer base, in every market, is our concern."" Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University who had helped PolitiFact Georgia with the business costs in our previous fact check, agrees. More specifically, he said, the question of how the fee affects every region of the state is a salient economic point. And, while the hospitality industry cannot provide verifiable answers, neither could state lawmakers before passing the bill that included the fee. Even Atlanta, while less susceptible to the fee, could potentially see increased competition from out-of-state tourist or business spots. No one can say for sure, Seaman said, because there was no study. ""There has not been enough careful analysis done on this,"" Seaman said. ""There are clearly going to be differential regional effects. The numbers are plausible, but we don’t know what they will mean."" Our ruling The state lawmaker who helped Georgia pass a nearly $900 million bill to tackle the state’s backlog of road and bridge work said a hotel fee in the bill would help shift the burden to out-of-state visitors. Jay Roberts was correct with his numbers, at least in the largest hotel market in the state. But hoteliers have a point that the fee could hit more Georgians in the state’s smaller cities and regions, even if the numbers vary by the type of visitors staying. Roberts implied the 85 percent out-of-state figure was statewide, even if his citation was clearly only for metro Atlanta. He was accurate, but the statistic needs more information to be fully understood. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976B9BC0>],/factchecks/2015/may/25/jay-roberts/will-out-staters-or-georgians-pay-most-new-hotel-f/

Accidents cut in half after Marquette Interchange work, roadbuilders say
","If you’re a regular listener to Milwaukee Brewers radio broadcasts, one oft-repeated ad may ring a bell. The radio spot by a group representing roadbuilding firms features a stat that’s a world apart from RBI or ERA or WHIP. The ad’s opening pitch says: ""Improving Wisconsin’s roads and highways is critical to reducing accidents and keeping our families safe."" Then the payoff pitch: ""In fact, Milwaukee’s Marquette Interchange is a shining example of those successes. Accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent."" All-star numbers, if true. The $800 million rebuilding of the Marquette, in the heart of downtown Milwaukee, was a huge traffic story from 2004 until the work was completed in 2008. Since then, Milwaukee has moved on to other mega-highway renovation projects, including the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange and the re-decking of the Hoan Bridge. Statewide, a glut of highway projects has led to concern that Gov. Scott Walker’s budget seeks too much borrowing for roadbuilding. The Legislature is reviewing options. In the Marquette, the old cloverleaf was having trouble handling increasing traffic.  Motorists had to crisscross lanes to reach exits. Key components were falling apart and accidents were topping 600 a year. The reconstruction didn’t solve all the design puzzles in the busy interchange. Changes were needed in 2010 to slow traffic on the long curve tying I-94 eastbound to I-43 northbound after the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office and others raised concerns about accident rates. In 2012, DOT had to make adjustments after backups and long delays plagued westbound I-794 in the Marquette. But what about the overall claim? Did the reconstruction add up to the big safety improvements claimed by the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association? What the numbers show Pat Goss and Kevin Traas from the group pointed us to the state Department of Transportation, which collects data on reported accidents from local law enforcement agencies. The association cited a DOT chart comparing the average number of crashes annually in the three years before the rebuild (2001-2003) to the first three years after (2009-2011). It showed annual crashes down 48.2 percent, and injury or fatal crashes down 60  percent. By the numbers, that’s 365 fewer reported accidents every year, and 143 fewer per year involving injuries. So those figures generally back up the group’s claim, albeit by rounding up from 48 percent to 50 percent. Newer figures The numbers are out of date though, so we obtained five years of accident data from before and after the construction period. Those figures run through 2013. There’s a caveat: The boundaries used for the interchange were somewhat different in DOT’s five-year comparison than in the three-year comparison. But they help confirm the trends. They also show a big drop in total accidents, though not quite as sharp: 45 percent for total accidents, and 55 percent for injury accidents. The cumulative accident count from 1999-2003: 3,416. The same count from 2009-2013: 1,890. For injury accidents in the five-year comparison, there were 561 fewer in the five years after the rebuilding. Michael Pyritz, DOT spokesman for the southeast region, attributed the improvement in accident rates to several factors. The new interchange made exiting safer and improved sight lines while incorporating modern safety and efficiency designs, he said. ""We expect to see the same trend when the Zoo Interchange is done,"" Pyritz said. As a double check on the DOT data, we got crash figures from the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, which responds to most accidents in the Marquette Interchange. That data showed somewhat smaller, but still significant, declines in accidents. For example, comparing the three years before the project (2001-2003) vs. the latest three years (2012-2014), accidents are down 45 percent and injury accidents 49 percent, according to the Sheriff’s Department. The two agencies defined the interchange somewhat differently. By another measure -- the three years before rebuilding vs. the first three years after (2009-2011) -- the Sheriff’s Office found 27 percent and 32 percent drops in total accidents and injury crashes, respectively. That same comparison using the DOT data yielded the 48 percent and 60 percent drops. There’s a large discrepancy in which the Sheriff’s Office shows far fewer injury accidents before the project than are reported in the DOT figures. Sheriff’s officials said a changeover in data collection methods, and late reporting of injuries by crash victims, likely explains some of the discrepancy. Still, even with that, both agencies show a clear drop in accidents. One final note: more traffic could also explain the higher numbers of accidents before the reconstruction. But DOT data we reviewed on its website suggests that traffic volumes were not significantly higher, if higher at all, back then. In the broad view, after 30 years of steady increases, miles traveled on state highways leveled off in 2000 and have not budged much. On I-94, which feeds the Marquette, a DOT study reported a 5 percent increase eastbound from the Brewers ballpark from 1989 to 2009. All that might suggest that volume in the Marquette after the rebuild is roughly the same or higher than it was before construction. Our rating The Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association radio ad contended that ""accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent"" since the redesign of the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee. There are different ways to slice this, but the ad cites official state data that is backed up within a few percentage points by more recent figures, and is generally confirmed by local data. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097266700>],/factchecks/2015/may/25/wisconsin-transportation-builders-association/accidents-cut-half-after-marquette-interchange-wor/

Fireworks lobbyist says sparkler legalization cut Conn. fireworks injury rate by 57 percent in 2000
","One proposal before the General Assembly would restore the state's ban on all fireworks, a prohibition that was in place until the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri lifted it in June 2010. The ban was eased to allow sparklers, spinners and smokers to be purchased in stores. Fireworks that explode or fly through the air remained illegal, although you wouldn't know it during the weeks surrounding that Fourth of July, when the number of neighborhood fireworks displays seems to have, well, skyrocketed since sparklers became legal. During a hearing on the bill, S-431, a comment by Eric Turner sparked our attention. He's director of governmental affairs for American Promotional Events, which sells fireworks under the name TNT Fireworks. Turner argued against the Rhode Island bill, saying the experience in Connecticut, which began allowing sparklers and other ""consumer"" devices, shows the public is actually safer when such products are legal. ""When the public is permitted to use sparkling devices as allowed in Rhode Island, they're less apt to go after illegal products,"" Turner told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""Injuries actually go down because more people use a regulated product."" ""I'll give you an example,"" he said. ""In 2000, Connecticut, your neighbor, passed a very similar law -- handheld and ground-based sparklers. The Connecticut Department of Public Safety showed a 57-percent decrease in fireworks-related injuries in 2000 compared to the 14 years prior."" We made repeated attempts to contact Turner to find the source of his information. He never returned our phone messages or emails. So we tried to get the data ourselves. Turner cited the state's department of public safety. So we went there. After one month, the only data it could provide was well outside the period Turner mentioned in his testimony. And the numbers it did have -- one or two injuries per year reported to the department's Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit -- were ridiculously small. It turns out that there are a lot more, as we discovered when we contacted Connecticut's Department of Public Health and received its data on emergency room visits and hospital discharges classified as stemming from an accident caused by fireworks. Instead of just one injury per year in 2010 to 2014 as logged by the public safety department, the hospital data show an average of 35 people admitted to emergency rooms each year during that period. Their emergency room numbers, available going back to only 1996, show an average of 40.5 fireworks injuries per year through 1999.  The number in 2000: 40. Basically there was no change in 2000 versus the average of the previous four years. That's a far cry from a 57-percent drop the year that sparklers were legalized, as Turner insisted, referring to a longer period for which we can’t find -- and he hasn’t provided -- any reliable data. The average since 2000: 43 emergency room injuries per year, which is actually a slight increase from the year when Connecticut legalized sparklers. We tried to add in the much smaller numbers for people whose injuries were serious enough to require hospitalization, using inpatient discharge data going back to 1991, the oldest available. But the state would not give us firm numbers for the years when inpatient discharges were 5 or fewer. But even when we assumed numbers most favorable to Turner, the reduction in 2000 wasn't even close. And if you look at subsequent years, the number of injuries have, on average, increased. Our ruling Fireworks lobbyist Eric Turner, contending that fireworks injuries decreased when sparklers are legalized, said that when Connecticut legalized sparklers and similar pyrotechnics in 2000, there was ""a 57-percent decrease . . . . compared to the 14 years prior."" While Turner stood up and shot off his mouth on Smith Hill, he wouldn’t respond to our repeated requests for information. And when we contacted the agency he cited in his testimony, we found the current database misses virtually all fireworks injuries. Finally, the most reliable source of information -- hospital records collected by the state health department -- shows no significant change in emergency room visits before and after sparklers and similar devices became legal. This incendiary claim is so wrong it rates a Pants on Fire.

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
Did Russ Feingold announce his U.S. Senate comeback from California, instead of Wisconsin?
","Republicans have had months to plan for Democrat Russ Feingold’s announcement that he would seek a rematch against U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who defeated him in 2010. The big word came May 14, 2015, when Feingold released a 90-second video saying he was in the race. Knowing that Feingold is teaching a course at Stanford University in California, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pounced. Not long after Feingold tweeted his announcement, the NRSC issued this retort: ""In what may be the oddest move of the campaign season thus far, Stanford Professor and failed 2010 candidate Russ Feingold announced his Wisconsin Senate run today from … California."" The line of criticism was repeated throughout the day, including by conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes and on his Right Wisconsin website. More recently, it was picked up by Gov. Scott Walker, when he said Feingold ""announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate while he was still in California."" And the NRSC has continued to press the idea on its website, with a map that circles California (""where Feingold announced"") and Wisconsin (""where he’s running."") So did Russ Feingold’s attempt at a Wisconsin comeback really begin in the Golden State? Prof. Feingold Since his 2010 defeat after 18 years in Washington, Feingold has taught classes at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., Marquette University in Milwaukee and twice at Stanford. He also held a temporary assignment for 18 months as the U.S. State Department envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa. He left that post earlier this year. His current Stanford class is called ""Implications of Post-1994 Conflicts in Great Lakes Region of Africa: an American Perspective."" The course, offered to graduate and law school students, runs from March 30 to June 3, meeting from 4:15 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. on Wednesdays. We asked NRSC communications director Andrea Bozek for evidence to support the group’s claim that Feingold announced his new campaign from California. Her response: ""If he was at class Wednesday night, how did he get back by 9:15 in the morning"" on Thursday for an announcement? Asked if the group had proof that Feingold was in California at the time of the announcement, she responded: ""I think the onus is on Sen. Feingold to prove that he was in the state when this video went out."" The announcement Before we take a closer look at Feingold’s day, we should note that his campaign announcement video was made in the living room of the house he has owned for years in Middleton, Wis. That home -- and its garage door on which Feingold once painted campaign promises -- has factored prominently in his previous campaigns. During the 2010 campaign, WISN-AM radio talk show host Mark Belling claimed that Feingold faked an ad to make it appear that he was standing outside the house. We rated the claim Pants on Fire and Belling later backtracked. So what about Feingold’s whereabouts on May 14? A look at his Twitter and Facebook accounts provides solid evidence that he was in Wisconsin that day. An entry posted at 11:10 a.m. on Twitter includes a picture of Feingold sitting on a patio, talking on the phone. The message reads: ""At home in Middleton. Excited to travel Wisconsin, meet with folks, and kick off our campaign. -RDF"" The day goes on from there with pictures of visits to the Mocha Moment Coffee House in Janesville, and a stop for a beer at the Memorial Union Rathskeller at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Meanwhile, other tweets suggest Feingold has been back and forth while teaching the Stanford class. A March 21, 2015 tweet read: ""At home today prepping for my class at Stanford. Took a break in beautiful Pheasant Branch Creek in Middleton."" Bozek said Republicans would continue to emphasize Feingold’s out of state job and have assigned a ""tracker"" to follow Feingold when he is in California. On May 21, 2015, they posted and tweeted videos of Feingold walking to his class. ""If you want to represent Wisconsin families you need to dedicate your time to listening to their concerns, rather than meeting with donors in California, "" Bozek said. So how did Feingold teach his Stanford class and yet make it back to Wisconsin for the big day? His campaign said the answer was pretty simple: a red eye flight. Feingold took United Airlines flight 995 from San Francisco to Chicago. The flight left at about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday and arrived in Chicago at about 5:44 a.m. Thursday morning, said Russ for Wisconsin campaign manager Tom Russell. Feingold was picked up at the airport and back in the Badger State when his latest quest began, his campaign said. Our rating The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that Russ Feingold announced his campaign for Senate while in California. But tweets and other evidence shows he was in Wisconsin at the time.

Was Ronald Reagan's record on black unemployment better than Barack Obama's?
","Recently, a reader forwarded us a social media meme that accused President Barack Obama of having a worse record on African-American employment than former President Ronald Reagan -- a charge which, if true, would be an embarrassment to the nation’s first black president. The meme says: ""During Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent."" This text has been placed over a photograph of an African-American man wearing a T-shirt that reads, ""I need a job."" Is the meme correct? We took a closer look. We’ll start by noting that on its face, the comparison is odd. It compares Reagan’s full eight-year term to five years under Obama (not even the full six-plus years that Obama has been in office so far). Doing so is problematic because it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. In addition, the meme glosses over the question of how much impact a president has on unemployment among any racial or ethnic group. Their policies are generally considered to have some impact, but joblessness is also affected by factors beyond a president’s control, such as technological change and international economic competition. That said, the meme also has problems with the data. We’ll start by looking at the parameters the meme used, even though they are of questionable value. During Reagan’s full term -- January 1981 to January 1989 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent. That’s a decline of 2.8 percentage points, or 19 percent. That’s close to what the meme said. But during Obama’s first five years -- January 2009 to January 2014 -- black unemployment didn’t rise at all, which is what the meme said. Rather, it fell from 12.7 percent to 12.1 -- a decline of 0.6 percentage points, or about 5 percent. The meme’s claim of a 42 percent increase is way off. Now let’s look at the first five years of each presidency -- a more reasonable comparison to make. During Reagan’s first five years -- January 1981 to January 1986 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 14.5 percent. That’s a decline of 0.1 percentage point, or less than a 1 percent decrease. This is a lot less impressive than the meme’s favored eight-year decline of 20 percent. It’s also less impressive than the 5 percent decline during Obama’s first five years. If we instead look at Obama’s entire term to date -- January 2009 to April 2015 -- black unemployment fell from 12.7 percent to 9.6 percent. That’s down 3.1 percentage points, or a decrease of 24 percent. That’s a more impressive decline than under Reagan’s entire term. There are also other ways to compare the two presidents’ records on black unemployment. • The black unemployment rate peaked at 21.2 percent under Reagan in January 1983, but the peak under Obama was significantly lower -- 16.8 percent in March 2010. • The low point for black unemployment under Reagan was 11 percent, reached twice in 1988. The low point under Obama is 9.6 percent, which is the current rate. That’s lower than the lowest point under Reagan. • Under Reagan, black unemployment exceeded its worst level under Obama -- 16.8 percent -- for 26 consecutive months, or more than two years straight. Our ruling The meme says that ""during Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent."" This claim is problematic on several levels. It presents a time frame cherry-picked to boost Reagan’s record. It flat-out misrepresents the statistics during Obama’s first five years, when black unemployment actually fell. And it ignores several other measures that show that black unemployment was better in absolute terms under Obama than Reagan. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1C4C0>],/factchecks/2015/may/22/facebook-posts/was-ronald-reagans-record-black-unemployment-bette/
"['Veterans', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Was only one person fired at the VA for withholding services as Jeb Bush says?
","Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says that the Obama White House has seen ""scandals of epic proportions"" at the Veterans Administration under its watch. ""It is scandalous that we treat our military coming home from service in the veterans’ department and veterans’ administration in a way where people should be fired,"" Bush said at a GOP Lincoln Day dinner in Iowa May 16. ""One person has been fired. There should be scores of people fired for withholding services for people who truly need it."" Has only one person been fired related to the VA scandal? We decided to check. Health care scandal at VA In 2014, news reports revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, while whistleblowers claimed that VA employees manipulated wait-time data. That ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki amid growing calls for him to be fired. A Bush spokeswoman said that when Bush said only one person was fired he was referring to Shinseki’s forced resignation. (But the day after his speech Bush wrote that eight had been fired.) ""You can't just make a change at the top,"" Bush spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger said. Shinseki wasn’t the only one who lost his job, though. Pinpointing the exact number is difficult, though, for a number of reasons. Numbers vary depending on if we count only permanent employees who were fired or include people who were in their one-year probationary period. We can also count people who retired or quit rather getting fired. The numbers also vary depending upon the reasons for terminations and whether they were directly related to the VA scandal. Finally, the VA produces a new report each week of disciplinary actions, so the numbers can change frequently. PolitiFact obtained a list of disciplinary actions from the VA supplied to the House and Senate committees on Veterans Affairs between June 3, 2014, and May 14, 2015. That information, shows employees disciplined for patient scheduling, record manipulation, appointment delays, and/or patient deaths. (Bush mentioned firings in the context of ""withholding services"" -- that term itself isn’t mentioned on the document though it could certainly overlap with the ones mentioned here.) The data shows 21 regular employees were removed, six probationary employees were removed and 10 resigned or retired when they faced being fired, for a total of 37 removals. Another 12 removals remained pending. We confirmed the numbers with a spokesman for the VA. But those 21 include three medical center directors who were ultimately fired for reasons unrelated to the waiting times scandal, such as accepting improper gifts and failure to oversee employees, including one who took a patient to a crack house. So if we don’t count those three, the number would be 18. (A judge threw out most of the reasons the medical center director in Phoenix was fired including about waiting times but upheld her firing for accepting improper gifts.) The numbers are larger than those reported in a widely quoted April 22 article in the New York Times, which stated that VA data showed at best three people were fired for manipulating wait times through April 8. That number included the medical director fired for accepting gifts, one who retired while facing being fired and a pending case. We asked VA for updated figures on the number of people it has fired for manipulating wait times, the problem that precipitated the scandal. VA did not provide those figures. Both sides have exaggerated claims about VA firings. In February, Shinseki’s replacement, Robert McDonald, said on Meet the Press that 900 people ""have been fired since I became secretary (of Veterans Affairs). We’ve got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times."" McDonald inflated that figure in part by counting proposed firings. Data in February showed that 14 people were either removed, received probationary termination or resigned in lieu of removal. Another nine individuals had removals against them pending. PolitiFact rated that claim False. Our ruling Bush said ""one person has been fired"" related to withholding services at the Veterans Administration. Bush was referring to Shinseki, who technically resigned but that was amid growing calls for him to be fired. Data through May 14 showed that 18 permanent employees have been fired for patient scheduling, record manipulation, appointment delays, and/or patient deaths. Bush has a point that few have been fired, but he exaggerated when he said it was only one. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Sean Hannity: As senator, Hillary Clinton 'paid female staffers a lot less than men'
","Is Hillary Clinton a hypocrite when it comes to equal pay? That’s the question raised by some conservative commentators after a Washington Free Beacon story said Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. As Fox News host Sean Hannity put it: ""As senator, she actually paid female staffers a lot less than the men."" Hannity’s guests, Democratic contributor Tamara Holder and former Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, debated the story. Holder said the Free Beacon story was based on manipulated data. McInnes said the bigger picture was that women earn less in America because ""they choose to"" attend kids’ piano recitals and not work late. We’ll set McInnes’ statement aside and focus on the attack against Clinton, the 2016 Democratic frontrunner. The Free Beacon story The Washington Free Beacon article headlined ""Hillary Clinton’s War on Women"" looked at data from Senate expenditure reports submitted to the secretary of the Senate from 2002-08. (The reports are not available online for Clinton’s time in office, but we found the information published at Legistorm.) The website focused on full-time staffers who worked a complete fiscal year, which runs Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Clinton was sworn in as New York’s junior senator in January 2001, so the Free Beacon analysis does not include her first nine months in office. The Free Beacon analysis also excludes Senate employees who took leaves of absence, which is common for employees who leave for short periods to work on campaigns, or left after even 11 months of work within the fiscal year. Regardless, the Free Beacon concluded the median salary for a woman on Clinton’s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office, or about $40,800 compared to $56,500 for men. ""The salaries speak for themselves,"" the story says. ""The data shows that women in her office were paid 72 cents for every dollar paid to men."" Clinton campaign responds  A Buzzfeed News headline on the same topic presents a completely different take: ""Internal Data: Hillary Clinton Paid Women And Men Equally."" What’s going on here? The Clinton campaign provided salary data for full-time staffers that worked in the Senate office as well as what they earned if they worked for a congressional committee or political groups Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, and Hillary Clinton for President. The information showed names, positions and salaries for Senate staffers, Senate committees and applicable political activity from 2002-08. The data show a median salary of $40,000 for both men and women receiving official Senate pay over those seven years (excluding Clinton’s pay, since she does not pay herself). The median salary remains equal if you factor in non-Senate work, too. The campaign argues this is a better picture of a staffer’s annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to join in Clinton’s presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton’s Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year, too. ""The Free Beacon based their analysis on an incomplete, and therefore, inaccurate set of numbers,"" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said. ""The fact is, Hillary Clinton paid full-time men and women equally."" If you isolate the data from year to year, the median earnings between men and women were not so even. In 2002, female Senate staffers (excluding Clinton) earned a median of $33,000, while men earned $42,500. The median pay gap closed in 2005 to $41,000 for women and $43,000 for men, and then women exceeded the men’s pay in 2006 and 2007. For what it’s worth, there were more women working for Clinton overall than men in every year. Not doing the same work The fact is neither set of data provides a truly definitive answer to the following question: Did Hillary Clinton pay men and women equally? Neither set of data compares wages for men and women who do the same work, which is the key issue in claims about the wage gap. PunditFact ran into a similar issue when Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard executive running for the Republican presidential nomination, accused President Barack Obama of not paying men and women equally. She said Obama was ""not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House."" Fiorina’s claim rated Mostly False because she was using a misleading measure. In reality, politicians and pundits of all stripes have abused data about the gender pay gap. Democrats often fall into trouble by suggesting women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men for doing the same work. In reality, women and men often choose to do different work, and those choices impact pay as much or more than gender. In this case, the Free Beacon and Hannity are overlooking data gaps and the individual circumstances of life working in the U.S. Senate. There are more significant differences between the methodologies of the Clinton campaign and the Free Beacon. Unlike the Free Beacon, the campaign includes staffers who worked full-time but not for the entire year. Our friends at FactCheck.org, which also looked at this topic, points out that an assistant chief of staff, Dan Schwerin, earned a $35,000 salary, but he was not included in the Free Beacon’s analysis because he took a two-week unpaid leave of absence to work on a House campaign. Norman Ornstein, a scholar of congressional pay at the American Enterprise Institute, said it’s common for Senate staffers to temporarily leave payrolls to volunteer or work for campaigns and political committees. So he favors the Clinton campaign’s approach. Making apples-to-apples comparisons is difficult, he said, ""but it is clear that the Free Beacon approach did not take into account the reality that people move in and out of payrolls on a fairly regular basis."" Another wrinkle for the Free Beacon analysis: Legistorm, the nonprofit that records salaries in Congress, cautions users from extrapolating exact salary information from the twice-yearly reports from offices that it shares, pointing out in its FAQ that true earnings fluctuate depending on bonuses and leaves of absence to work on the political side. Our ruling Hannity said Hillary Clinton paid ""paid female staffers a lot less than the men"" than when she was a senator. One set of data supports that claim, but it is far from perfect. There are several ways of looking at Senate earnings — one created by the Clinton campaign, for instance, undercuts Hannity’s claim. In reality, all the datasets have caveats. While it’s fair to note that Democrats can overreach on gender pay claims by using imperfect data, it doesn’t mean critics can use the same imperfect data to make counterclaims. Hannity’s claim includes an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F5F00>],/factchecks/2015/may/21/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-senator-hillary-clinton-paid-female-s/

Benghazi Committee Chair: State Dept. hasn't complied with 6-month-old document request
","The State Department is ""stonewalling"" the House Committee on Benghazi’s investigation, says its committee chair, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. On Fox News May 15, Gowdy said the State Department is taking far too long in producing documents related to the 2012 terrorist attack on an American diplomatic compound. Gowdy pointed to a November 2014 request for emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top advisers that has yet to be fulfilled. ""It's a conscious decision not to cooperate with a legitimate congressional inquiry,"" he said, adding. ""I don't want the drama. I want the documents. They have had half a year and I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper."" Because the Benghazi investigation -- as well as Clinton’s private email use while secretary of state -- are likely to stay in the news as Clinton’s presidential campaign moves forward, we decided to look into Gowdy’s statement. There’s no denying that the Benghazi committee doesn’t have all the documents it wants and not by the committee’s desired timeline. But it’s inaccurate to say they haven’t received ""a single, solitary scrap of paper"" related to their November request. The committee’s own interim progress report -- published May 8, 2015 -- proves this. 850 scraps of paper In November, the committee asked for communications and documents about Benghazi for 11 top State Department officials that included Clinton and her senior staff, according to the report. The committee also asked Clinton’s attorney for her private emails related to Benghazi and Libya. Two months later, the committee held a hearing to draw attention to what Gowdy says is a prohibitively slow executive branch response to document requests. After the hearing, on Feb. 13, 2015, the State Department produced about 300 emails to and from Clinton, totaling about 850 pages. Of course, this didn’t completely satisfy the November request, because it didn’t include the emails of Clinton’s top aides and senior staff. The committee ordered a subpoena in March for the rest of these emails. The subpoena has a broader scope than the November request -- for example, requesting all emails pertaining to Libya, not just the attack on the Benghazi compound. Committee spokesman Jamal Ware told PolitiFact that Gowdy’s statement referred to the March subpoena for Clinton’s aides’ emails, which the committee still hasn’t received. However, Gowdy’s statement includes the qualifier ""They’ve had half a year,"" which would indicate he is talking about the November 2014 request, not the March 2015 subpoena. Additionally, the Clinton emails were the committee’s top priority from the November request, according to a State Department document detailing the documents provided. It’s worth noting that more than two-thirds of the Clinton emails are communications with her senior staff, and some senior staff emails pertinent to the November request were included in earlier document releases to the committee. In defense of Gowdy’s statement, Ware added that the Clinton emails don’t necessarily count as State Department documents because Clinton used a private email address while secretary, maintained in her own private server, so the emails were never under State Department control. ""The only records the committee has received were self-selected by the former secretary and turned over by her,"" Ware said. ""The State Department did not have control or custody over those emails."" The department did, though, have at least some modicum of control over these emails. Because of the Benghazi investigation, the department requested and received 50,000 pages of Clinton’s emails weeks before the November request. They read through every email to select the ones that pertained to the November request, resulting in the turnover of 300 emails in February. The State Department contends that they are unable to fully complete records requests within the committee’s desired timeframe in large part due to ""resource and technological restraints."" For example, going through Clinton’s 50,000 pages of emails took about 2,400 man hours, according to the Washington Post. The State Department had to digitize every single page by hand because Clinton handed over paper copies of her emails, rather than electronic ones, vastly slowing down the process. Additionally, the State Department said it does not have key phrases to search through emails pertaining to the subpoena, so they have to read through every single email over a two-year period for 10 members of Clinton’s senior staff. In response to the State Department’s assertion that how fast they can comply is limited by their resources, the committee’s interim report said, ""While the committee respects the State Department’s institutional interests, it is also important to note that a substantial degree of this effort may result from its own internal review processes rather than any requirements imposed by the committee."" State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach said his office has worked closely with the committee since its inception, noting that over the course of the investigation, the State Department has provided more than 40,000 pages of documents in total. ""We have been continuously engaged and responsive to the committee’s requests and stated priorities, and we have had several meetings and discussions with them during recent months regarding the specifics of our plans to respond to both their Nov. 18, 2014, letter and their broader March subpoena,"" Gerlach said. Our ruling Gowdy said the State Department has ""had half a year"" to respond to a Benghazi document request, yet ""I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper."" The House Benghazi Committee’s own report notes that in response to a November 2014 request for emails from Clinton and her top aides, the State Department has produced 850 pages of Clinton’s emails. The State Department hasn’t yet produced Clinton’s staffers’ emails in response to this request. The department argues that Clinton’s emails were top priority, that many of the staffers’ emails have been provided in previous document requests, and that their response time is limited by department resources. Gowdy has a point that he’s still waiting on quite a few documents, but it goes too far to say he hasn’t received a ""single, solitary scrap of paper."" We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975A76C0>],/factchecks/2015/may/21/trey-gowdy/benghazi-committee-chair-state-dept-hasnt-complied/

Ted Cruz: Americans spend $500 billion complying with tax laws, about same as entire military budget
","A reader questioned Sen. Ted Cruz’s comparison of military spending to how much it costs Americans to get their taxes done. According to a blog post on txwinelover.com, Cruz toured Becker Vineyards in July 2014 before holding a roundtable with wine industry representatives during which he agreed the tax system should be simplified. ""Every year,"" Cruz elaborated, ""we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance. I agree with you we should move to a simple flat tax where everyone can fill out their taxes on a postcard and that we should shut down the IRS."" Cruz, a Texas lawyer elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, has since declared his candidacy for president. But he’d already called for a flat-rate income tax and abolishing the IRS. And was he right that about the same $500 billion a year getting spent on complying with tax laws and funding the military? Both figures need explaining. Military spending Per military spending, Cruz campaign spokesman  Rick Tyler said by email that Cruz drew on a chart posted by The Washington Post in 2012 indicating that adjusted for inflation, defense spending has exceeded $500 billion a year since 2007 or so: SOURCE: Blog post, ""Defense spending in the U.S., in four charts,"" Wonkblog, The Washington Post, Aug. 28, 2012, chart citing Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (noted in an email from Rick Tyler, chief national spokesperson, Ted Cruz presidential campaign, May 5, 2015) The Post relied on the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments where by email, analyst Todd Harrison told us the military’s 2014 base budget, meaning the cost of maintaining a standing military in peacetime, totaled $496 billion. So far so good, except, Harrison advised, that figure did not reflect all military spending. Generally, he said, the base budget ""does not include the cost of using the military to fight a conflict, nor does it include legacy costs, such as unfunded pensions and veterans benefits, or military activities conducted outside of (the Department of Defense) such as the maintenance and upgrade of nuclear weapons. All of those things are extra,"" he said. If you count those other expenses, Harrison said, the U.S. spent $866 billion on the military in 2014. By email, Tyler stressed the military’s base budget doesn’t include overseas contingencies. But it’s ""your rigged game, you make up any facts you want,"" Tyler said by email. Next, we turned to what it costs Americans to fulfill federal tax requirements. Tax compliance costs To get our arms around ""compliance costs,"" we reached out to certified public accountant Connie Weaver, a Texas A&M University professor, who guided us to June 2011 testimony on compliance costs by tax expert Michael Brostek of the investigative arm of Congress, the General Accountability Office. Broadly, Brostek said that complying with IRS regulations ""costs taxpayers time and money,"" at least $107 billion in 2005, the GAO estimated, with other studies estimating costs 1.5 times as large. Beyond compliance costs, Bostek noted even larger estimated ""economic efficiency costs, which are reductions in economic well-being caused by changes in behavior due to taxes."" Previous fact checks Even before Cruz commented at the roundtable, the FactChecker at The Washington Post awarded two Pinocchios to House Speaker John Boehner’s claim that it was costing Americans $500 billion a year to comply with federal tax demands. Cost estimates varied, the Post wrote, with the ""safest bet"" at the time being $163 billion as estimated by the IRS’s Taxpayer Advocate Service, entrusted with helping taxpayers resolve problems and recommending changes. Adjusting for inflation, that cost would have been nearly $172 billion a year around the time Cruz spoke in 2014. More recently, the FactChecker weighed in again after noticing Cruz made his $500 billion military-tax compliance spending comparison at a May 2015 South Carolina stop. Like Boehner, Cruz drew a couple Pinocchios. Weaver told us that because Cruz didn’t say what he meant by compliance costs — where he’d draw the boundaries — an observer could explore three possibilities: a taxpayer’s basic liability as in how much he or she sends the government in taxes; the costs associated with pulling together information and submitting it to the government; or efficiency costs as in ""lost outputs, time taken from other productive activities or from missing out on other consumption activities."" For an individual, she said, it’s easy to calculate compliance costs by gauging how long it takes to fill out the required forms and multiplying that by an hourly dollar figure for how the individual values their time. ""When you try to aggregate that nationally,"" she said, ""it’s very difficult."" She said she wouldn’t be comfortable specifying a national compliance-costs figure. But all in all, Weaver said, it looks like Cruz’s figure was high. Cruz aide: Senator relied on two studies Tyler told us Cruz got his tax-compliance costs from an April 2011 analysis by supply-side economist Arthur B. Laffer and others indicating $431.1 billion in combined annual costs incurred by taxpayers to pay federal taxes and a May 2013 study by researchers at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University stating the annual ""hidden costs"" of U.S. tax compliance ranged from $215 billion to $987 billion. Laffer study The Laffer-led study said researchers created a ""comprehensive estimate of the total administrative costs, time costs, and direct tax compliance costs created by the complex U.S. federal income tax code."" The $431.1 billion in estimated annual spending, the report said, reflects money spent ""to comply with and administer the U.S. income tax system.* Its estimate, relying on 2010 figures, broke out to approximately $31.5 billion in direct outlays (paying a professional tax preparer or purchasing tax software), total IRS administrative costs of $12.4 billion; and nearly $378 billion for the  ""time value costs taxpayers must bear to pay their taxes,"" filling out and submitting forms. In 2011, the Post’s FactChecker called the Laffer study ""dubious,"" noting it took a figure from the Internal Revenue Service’s Tax Advocate — that individuals and businesses spent 6.1 billion hours complying with tax filing requirements — and got to its cost estimate by multiplying ""it against an absurd hourly income of $68.42 on the theory that the wealthy pay most of the income taxes."" Mercatus Center study The Mercatus Center’s study, led by Jason J. Fichtner, a senior research fellow, similarly noted the high wage costs applied in the Laffer study, stating that in the study, the ""average income used to monetize taxpayers’ time is significantly greater than the average income used in other estimates."" For its part, the center suggested a range of hidden costs connected to paying taxes including ""time and money spent submitting tax forms, foregone economic growth, lobbying expenditures, and gaps in revenue collection"" though the authors said they couldn’t pin a figure for lobbying by interests trying to reduce taxes paid. As far as compliance costs, what Cruz singled out, the center study estimated $67 billion to $378 billion a year in accounting costs associated with filing taxes, a range based on IRS information suggesting 60 percent of individual taxpayers and 71 percent of unincorporated business taxpayers pay someone--an accountant, lawyer or tax professional--to prepare their taxes, with 32 percent of individual taxpayers relying on software. Significantly, Fichtner told us, his paper, based on a review of relevant studies, was intended to cover far more than simple compliance costs. ""I chose to give a range based on the different methodologies that I found in the research literature. It’s not that one method is better than another–or right versus wrong,"" Fichtner said. ""All the measures have different assumptions for the time value of an hour of lost work/productivity as well as time spent."" Here’s a chart from the study summarizing a range of cost studies dating back to 2003:                                  Other analyses Next, we asked the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation about Cruz’s figure. Spokesman Richard Borean said by email it had no analysis to confirm or refute the $500 billion figure. But he noted the Mercatus Center study and suggested we consider annual reports on tax compliance costs put out by the National Taxpayers Union, a non-partisan research and educational organization that says it’s devoted to showing Americans how taxes, government spending and regulations affect them. The union’s April 2014 report, which would have been the the latest one available before Cruz spoke, noted the IRS’s National Taxpayer Advocate had most recently estimated the annual paperwork burden generated by the federal personal and corporate tax system at 6.1 billion hours — the equivalent of about 3.05 million employees working 40-hour weeks year-round with two weeks off each. The group said: ""The value of the labor behind the 6.1 billion hours amounts to a jaw-dropping $192.6 billion, when calculated with the most recently reported average employer cost for non-federal civilian workers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $31.57 per hour. Add in the $31.7 billion spent on tax software and other out-of-pocket costs for individuals and the total is $224.3 billion a year."" (The union’s latest look at compliance costs, released in April 2015, said compliance with the federal income tax cost the economy $233.8 billion in productivity in 2014.) Our ruling Cruz said: ""Every year we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance."" This claim proved squishy at both ends. It looks like depending on how you value time, you can get to almost any total for what it costs Americans to prepare and file tax returns. However, most estimates run short of Cruz’s figure. Meantime, military spending exceeded $800 billion when he spoke though the senator’s spokesman indicated he meant to not count spending on conflicts abroad and other items not in the military’s nearly $500 billion base budget.

"['Education', 'Women', 'Florida', ""EMILY's List""]","
Jeb Bush held $1 million 'hostage' for abstinence-only education, Emily's List says
","A Democratic political action committee ripped Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, saying his positions as Florida’s governor preview what he’d be like as commander in chief -- particularly when it comes to women’s issues. Stephanie Schriock, president of the group Emily’s List, said in an essay on Medium that Bush spent his two terms curbing women’s reproductive and health rights. (Emily’s List helps Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights.) Schriock ticked off several actions that ran counter to the group’s stance, including Bush’s support of abstinence-only sex education. ""And let’s not forget that Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all,"" she wrote. We wondered what Schriock meant about Bush holding grant money hostage, so we took a closer look at the books. Not talking about it We found only a few media mentions of a situation resembling a hostage crisis, and they were the same ones Emily’s List sent to us as proof. The primary source was a March 2001 story in the Tampa Bay Times that focused on a budget request from Bush for lawmakers to consider during the legislative session. The story detailed how Bush wanted $1 million of the state Department of Health’s $5.7 million family planning allocation to create education grants for chastity counseling. This would have mirrored some federally funded programs in the state that told teens to wait until marriage to have sex, without discussing birth control methods. Those programs, many of which were privately run by religious groups, operated under names like Best Friends, Sex Can Wait and Everyone's Not Doing It. The request would have marked the first time the state would have funded an abstinence-based counseling program. The idea was criticized by sex education advocates and legislators who said teaching abstinence didn’t work. They also said diverting $1 million would keep many poor women from getting HIV tests, pap smears, birth control counseling and other services at clinics and county health departments. But except for a couple of mentions in other articles about the proposal, the March 2001 Times article was the only place we found that the request was fully examined. Even Emily’s List couldn’t tell us what happened to Bush’s proposal. They did tell us their aim was to point out Bush had made clear he preferred abstinence-only counseling, and was willing to put conditions on funding to achieve that goal. That doesn’t strike us as Bush literally preventing that money from being used for regular family planning services, however. Though the Times story says the request was supported by then-health secretary Bob Brooks, it was still just a request. Florida governors routinely submit a proposed budget each year before the session, but the Legislature has the final say on how money is spent. It appears in 2001 lawmakers didn’t follow Bush’s wishes. The state Department of Health shared appropriations for family planning services going back to 2000 and found nothing specifying funds had to go to abstinence education exclusively. ""It does not appear that there was any proviso language that directed $1 million to be spent on chastity programs from the family planning category,"" spokeswoman Mara Burger told us. The 2001 appropriation for family planning was almost $5.8 million, a figure that has since fallen to $4.2 million today. Florida continues to specify abstinence should be taught as a part of sex ed classes, although school districts are given plenty of leeway. The state is still one of the biggest recipients of federal money for chastity programs. Even anti-Obamacare Republicans in the Legislature agreed in 2012 to take millions set aside for abstinence education in the Affordable Care Act, even while rejecting other aid tied to the law. Our ruling Emily’s List said, ""Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all."" There are a handful of news stories that say Bush in 2001 asked the Legislature to set aside $1 million for chastity programs out of the state’s almost $5.8 million for family planning. That's a bit different from threatening existing programs with a gag order. More importantly, there's no evidence Bush's proposal went into effect. The health department said no requirements for abstinence programs were passed by lawmakers.

"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Are there more U.S. Senators than Wisconsin residents who would benefit from GOP estate tax plan?
","To demonstrate how few people would be affected by repealing what Republicans deem the ""death tax,"" Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin compared the payers of the tax to the most selective group in the nation — the United States Senate. Baldwin tweeted this from her account (@SenatorBaldwin) on May 5, 2015: ""There are more members of the US Senate than the number of WI families who would benefit from GOP estate tax break."" That same night, Baldwin took the Senate floor to talk about the Republican budget, which had just been approved. She voted against the budget, and voiced her disdain for the elimination of the estate tax. ""The Republican budget continues the same, failed, top down economics where Washington rigs the rules in favor of special interests, in favor of millionaires and billionaires,"" she said. Republicans support the elimination of the estate tax saying the tax discourages saving and investment that could help others in the economy. Democrats see the tax as a way to level the playing field between rich and poor and maintain tax revenue. Some form of an estate tax has been on the books since 1916. The tax is imposed on the transfer of a deceased person’s estate. Only estates valued at or above the exemption amount — $5.43 million for 2015 — are required to pay. Republicans repealed the estate tax for 2010, but Congress reinstated the estate tax starting in 2011. The new Republican budget would abolish the estate tax entirely. In January, we rated Baldwin’s statement that middle-class Americans ""pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires"" as Half True. Turns out, some do and some don’t, depending upon the source of a person’s income. We wondered if Baldwin was right this time. Would fewer than 100 state families really gain from the tax break? Digging into the numbers The Tax Policy Center estimates that the estate tax kicks in for two out of every 1,000 deaths. In 2013, the latest year for which data is available, 49,917 people died in Wisconsin. By that math, some 100 Wisconsin families would have paid the estate estate tax that year. But, just 63 estates paid the tax in that year. Looking back, the last year for which more than 100 estates paid the tax in Wisconsin was 2009, when the exemption amount was much lower — $3.5 million. That year, 290 estates paid. Each year since then, the exemption amount increased and the numbers of families paying the tax in Wisconsin decreased. When we asked Baldwin’s office for backup, staffers directed us to a report by the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. That report made state-by-state estimations for the number of estate tax payers in 2016. Sure enough, the center estimated that in 2016 just 70 families in Wisconsin would face the estate tax, well below the 100 family mark Baldwin established in the tweet. The report made projections for 2016 because it would be the first full year that the estate tax would be repealed, if the measure is also passed by House Republicans and signed by President Barack Obama. The report created the estimate based on numbers from the IRS and Congress’ own Joint Committee on Taxation. For 2016, the Joint Committee on Taxation projects that 5,400 estates nationally will pay the tax. To create a state-by-state estimate, the report used IRS tax data from 2013. The center assumed the proportion of families from Wisconsin paying the estate tax in 2016 would be the same as in 2013. According to 2013 IRS data, 63 Wisconsin estates paid the tax out of 4,687 total. Applying the same ratio to the 2016 estimate, about 72 families would pay the estate tax from Wisconsin. The report rounded each estimate to the nearest 10 because so few estates pay the tax each year. That put the state estimate at 70. The math adds up, but what about the report’s methodology? Matthew Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, called the estimation ""pretty rock solid"" and said the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities used a sensible starting point. ""To be able to do anything differently, you would have to know exactly how many people were going to die in 2016,"" Gardner said. Bob Williams, a fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said the ""back of the envelope"" calculation made sense. Williams did cite a concern about the use of a single year the projection for 2016. What if 2013, he asked, was an outlier? After all, the number varies from year to year. To account for that point, we calculated a new ratio for Wisconsin estate tax payers using the average for a period covering four years, 2010 to 2013. The new figure was lower than the one just for 2013. By that measure, 50 state families would pay the estate tax in 2016. But Baldwin was a bit imprecise in how she made the claim. She did not provide a time frame for the figure and, if imposed, the elimination of the tax would be ongoing. That is, each year more estates would benefit from it. In just the six years of Baldwin’s term, some 400 families would benefit. Our rating Baldwin claimed that ""There are more members of the US Senate than the number of WI families who would benefit from GOP estate tax break."" The experts we consulted said the estimate cited by Baldwin was a reasonable one. But Baldwin’s claim did not provide a time frame for when the families would be affected, and many more than the 70 she cited would benefit over time. We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DD0DC0>],/factchecks/2015/may/20/tammy-baldwin/are-there-more-us-senators-wisconsin-residents-who/

Hillary Clinton says hedge fund managers 'pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers'
","During a visit to Mason City, Iowa, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton resurrected an old Democratic theme -- that the rich pay less in taxes than working people do. ""Hedge fund managers themselves make more and pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers,"" she said during the May 18, 2015, visit. This is a topic we’ve delved into several times previously, but the way Clinton worded this claim makes it particularly off-base. Usually, the claims we’ve seen specifically refer to whether a nurse or truck driver pays a higher tax rate than a millionaire -- in other words, a higher percentage of their income in taxes, rather than a higher dollar amount. But Clinton didn’t make that distinction in her remarks, at around 12:45 in this video. (Later that day, Clinton appeared at another event in Iowa and used the term ""tax rates."") Let’s take a closer look. The available data isn’t perfect for making this sort of comparison, but we’ll use the most appropriate data we can find and note the caveats. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median 52-week earnings for industrial truck and tractor operators was $30,888 a year. For registered nurses, it was $56,680 a year, and for nurse practitioners it was $87,516 a year. Let’s take the most extreme example. Say a nurse makes $100,000, which is actually well above the median for the most well-compensated category of nurse. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, taxpayers earning between $75,000 and $100,000 pay an average tax rate of 15.7 percent, which includes not just income taxes but also payroll and other federal taxes. So that nurse earning $100,000 is going to pay, on average, $15,700 in federal taxes for the year. Nurse practitioners earning the median income level, or registered nurses, would pay less. So would truck drivers, who earn less to begin with. Now let’s look at the hedge fund manager. The IRS calculated that in 2012, the 400 highest-income households in the country averaged $336 million in income, and the cutoff to make that list of 400 was about $140 million in income. We can be pretty sure there’s overlap between the IRS list of 400 and hedge fund managers, since the most recent top 10 list of highest-earning fund managers runs from annual earnings of $425 million all the way up to $1.3 billion. These 400 households paid an average of $56 million in taxes each. In other words, these fund managers were paying multi-million-dollar tax bills to the IRS, compared to an above-average example of a nurse paying $15,700. So using taxes paid, Clinton is incorrect. What if Clinton meant tax rates? Roberton Williams of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center told us he suspects that the point Clinton intended to make was that the primary source of income earned by hedge fund managers, known as ""carried interest,"" is taxed as capital gains and not as earnings, and as a result, they face a rate of 20 percent plus surtaxes of 3.8 percent and 1.2 percent. In addition, there is no payroll tax payable on this income. By contrast, the income of ordinary workers is subject to both income and payroll taxes. This can narrow or erase the tax-rate gap between the two groups, at least in some cases. Is it theoretically possible that a particular nurse pays a larger share of his or her income in taxes than a particular hedge-fund manager? Yes -- each category has some variation in tax rates paid. But if you look at the typical case, Clinton’s claim paints a distorted picture of the nation’s tax structure -- and that’s if you grant that she meant to say ""tax rates"" rather than ""taxes."" Looking at income taxes alone, the average tax rate -- income taxes paid divided by adjusted gross income -- for the IRS top 400 is 16.7 percent. By comparison, the median trucker is paying approximately 6 percent of income in taxes (and there’s a decent likelihood that they are paying no income taxes at all, after consideration is made for exemptions and credits). So the median trucker is paying a much smaller percentage of income in taxes than a hedge fund manager. We should note that the definitions of income and taxes used by the Tax Policy Center and the IRS top-400 study are not exactly the same. The Tax Policy Center used a broader definition of both income and taxes than the IRS study did, which casts some doubt on the merits of comparing tax rates. When comparing total tax paid, however, the difference is so vast that methodological variations are not going to make much of a dent. Also, Williams noted that focusing on the top 400 earners effectively zeroes in on the best-compensated hedge-fund managers. We don’t have comprehensive data on the full spectrum of compensation for hedge-fund managers. However, even if one lowers the estimated income threshold for hedge fund managers to $1 million a year, the Tax Policy Center, using its methodology, suggests that people in that income bracket pay 34.6 percent of their expanded income in taxes, which is quite a bit higher than nurses and truck drivers do. (The lower tax rate in the top-400 list likely stems from the particular mix of income streams among the very wealthiest, which tend to get more favorable tax treatment.) Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that, as she has in other appearances, Clinton was ""making the point that a nurse making $66,000 per year is in the 25 percent tax bracket while many hedge fund managers are paying less than a 24 percent rate on millions of dollars they earn."" However, we'll note that a person's tax bracket refers to the rate paid on the last dollar they earn, not what they pay overall in taxes compared to their full earnings. The latter is what Clinton's phrasing suggests. Our ruling Clinton said that hedge fund managers ""pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers."" She is certainly wrong for dollar amounts, which is what her statement was about. If she meant to say tax rates, that's more complicated, and the data doesn't clearly back up the point. Here, we're looking at just taxes paid, so we rate her claim False. UPDATE, May 20, 2015, 2:30 p.m.: This article has been updated to reflect a comment from Clinton's campaign staff. The rating has not been changed.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097464140>],/factchecks/2015/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-hedge-fund-managers-pay-less-/
"['National', 'Civil Rights', 'Crime', 'LGBTQ', 'Religion', 'Focus on the Family Action']","
The First Amendment is still in effect
","
A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be ""the most left-wing president in our nation's history."" The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further ""the homosexual agenda"" to being soft on the war against terrorists.
 
Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson.
 
One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: ""He (Obama) has pledged to homosexual leaders that he will sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ... (forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual). He also supports hate-crimes expansion ... (potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality).""
 
First off, Obama has, in fact, strongly supported the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and hate crime expansion. It's the bits that Minnery puts in parentheses that are misleading.
 
We'll take these one at a time.
 
The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 would make it unlawful for employers to discriminate against an individual on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. The law would provide employment protections to gay, lesbian and bisexual employees similar to those in the Civil Rights Act.
 
The bill passed the House and has come to the Senate. Obama not only supports that measure, but would support expanding it to include gender identity as well, according to his campaign Web site.
 
Focus on the Family has long been opposed to the legislation.
 
Minnery told PolitiFact it could lead to this scenario: ""Someone applies for a job and they are turned down, and later they identify themselves as a homosexual and claim that is why they weren't hired. How is an employer supposed to defend themselves against that charge? Proving a negative is nearly impossible.""
 
Particularly vulnerable are businesses that have religious people working for them, he said. Suppose, he said, that the person doing the hiring has a Bible on his or her desk and the applicant is put off by that, and claims later that the person had an agenda against homosexuals. If the new law is passed, he said, that applicant would be able to file a claim against the company.
 
""That's a possibility here,"" Minnery said.
 
Hardly, said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation.
 
""They have to have known or thought the person was gay for there to be a discrimination claim,"" Leonard said.
 
Brian Moulton, associate counsel for Human Rights Campaign, a strong proponent of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, said Minnery's hypothetical scenario is a red herring.
 
""The burden of proof under ENDA is on the employee who has made a claim of discrimination,"" Moulton said.
 
Twenty states already have these kinds of discrimination laws, he said, and there has been no run of unsubstantiated lawsuits.
 
""If this were a real concern, we would have long ago seen this present itself,"" Moulton said. ""The importance of the bill is that people who are losing their jobs because of their sexual orientation have no recourse. That's the real problem.""
 
Minnery's expressed concern about the expansion of hate-crime laws as ""potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality"" is similarly off base. An amendment co-sponsored by Obama sought to expand federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity.
 
According to Minnery, that could lead to this scenario: Someone hears a sermon about the Bible teachings on homosexuality and then goes out and commits a crime against an innocent person; they claim they got the impetus from the church pulpit; and then the church gets charged with a hate crime.
 
""It would have a chilling effect on teaching that part of the Bible that deals with homosexuality,"" Minnery said.
 
Leonard, the law professor, said: ""That's ridiculous.""
 
The First Amendment would protect the church against any kind of action like that, Leonard said.
 
""No sane prosecuting attorney in the United States would go after a church due to a preacher making a sermon based on the Biblical teachings about homosexuality,"" Leonard said.
 
Moulton, of Human Rights Campaign, noted that 32 states have hate crime laws that cover sexual orientation and, he said, ""you aren't seeing members of the clergy being prosecuted under that state law for preaching about homosexuality.""
 
The hate crime legislation specifically notes that it will not impact anyone's First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and religion. Is there such an instance where a church or pastor could be at risk under the law?
 
""If you say, 'Gay people are evil and should be killed and here's a gun,' then yes,"" Moulton said. ""But someone simply expressing what their religious tradition says about homosexuality from the pulpit, no.""
 
Although the Senate passed the expanded hate crimes legislation backed by Obama in September 2007, negotiators in the House and Senate did not include it as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and it stalled.
 
It's fair enough to take issue with Obama on his support of the two measures — certainly they were highly controversial and hotly debated. But Minnery's characterizations of what the bills would mean are misleading. We rule his statement False.

A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen.

The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further ""the homosexual agenda"" to being soft on the war against terrorists.
 
Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson.
 
One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, is that, ""As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!""
 
It's true. But before you go fitting Obama with Hugh Hefner-esque silk pajamas, some explanation is in order.
 
The bill that came before the Illinois state Senate on March 29, 2001, sought to prohibit adult businesses from being located within 1,000 feet of public or private elementary or secondary schools, public parks, places of worship, preschools, day care facilities, mobile home parks or any areas zoned residential.
 
Obama argued that kind of regulation is better handled by local officials through zoning. He noted that the City of Chicago opposed the bill as a pre-emption of its home rule.
 
Addressing the assembly, Obama stated: ""This is one of those areas where nobody likes, necessarily, to have — well, I don't say nobody, but most of us would prefer not to have an adult bookstore or movie theater or something next to our residence. But that's exactly why we have local zoning ordinances. And that's why, presumably, we have council members or heads of townships or all the various branches of local government who are much closer to the ground than we are in making these determinations. And it seems to me that if there's ever been a function that has historically been relegated to local control and it is appropriately there, it's these kinds of zoning matters. I would urge a No vote.""
 
But Obama didn't actually vote ""no."" He and four others voted ""present."" In the Illinois state Senate, lawmakers sometimes vote ""present"" instead of ""no"" to block bills without officially opposing them. (Earlier in the campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton questioned whether Obama used present votes 129 times over eight years as an Illinois state senator to duck tough votes. PolitiFact examined Obama's present votes

here.

)
 
The political considerations here are obvious. Had he voted no, the attack would now be that ""Obama opposed..."" instead of the weaker ""Obama refused to support..."" The small distinction didn't appear to have saved Obama much grief.
 
The vote came down 33 in favor; 15 against, with 5 voting ""present."" Because the bill needed 36 votes in favor — a three-fifths majority — it narrowly failed.
 
Any implication that Obama's vote means that he supports sex businesses opening near schools or places of worship would be false. But in Minnery's article, which has been widely circulated through chain e-mail, he states that Obama ""refused to support"" a bill that would have prohibited sex shops near schools and places of worship. That's True.

Yes, he did
","Making a hard-charging statement and then denying you ever said it is a tricky proposition in the best of circumstances. It's particularly difficult when the initial statement and the denial are caught on tape and posted to the Internet.
 
Which brings us to the case of former President Bill Clinton on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania.
 
On April 21, 2008, Clinton gave a provocative interview to National Public Radio affiliate WHYY in which he said the Obama campaign ""played the race card on me."" He later denied saying that. Given the seriousness of the original charge — the ex-president claiming his wife's rival for the Democratic nomination tried to exploit racial issues to damage him — we decided to examine Clinton's denial of that charge.
 
Did he say it or didn't he? He did. Here's how it happened:
 
WHYY interviewer Susan Phillips asked him about the South Carolina primary, when he compared Barack Obama's January win there to Jesse Jackson's win in 1988. Phillips said at least one black leader had been offended by that comparison, saying it marginalized Obama, and switched support from Hillary Clinton to Obama.
 
Phillips asked, ""Do you think that (comment) was a mistake, and would you do that again?""
 
Clinton gave a lengthy response,

which you can hear via YouTube here

. For our fact-checking purposes, the relevant passages are below:
 
""No. I think that they played the race card on me. ... I said, if you go back to what I said. ... First of all, there was a conversation that I engaged in that included two African-American members of Congress, who were standing right there, who were having the conversation with me. And I said that Jesse Jackson had won a good campaign with overwhelming African-American support and white supporters. And this was started off because people didn't wanna — they wanted to act like, for reasons I didn't understand, that Senator Obama didn't have this African-American support, or they thought his white support was better because Jesse Jackson had blue-collar working people, and most of Senator Obama's support were upscale, cultural liberals. So it was like beneath them to be compared to Jesse Jackson.
 
""I respect Jesse Jackson. He's a friend of mine, even though he endorsed Senator Obama. One of his sons and his wife endorsed Hillary. Their whole family's divided. But his campaign in 1988 was a seminal campaign in American history. It was the first campaign ever to openly involve gays. Hillary's chief delegate counter, Harold Ickes, worked his heart out for Jesse Jackson. I frankly thought the way the Obama campaign reacted was disrespectful to Jesse Jackson. And I called him and asked him if he found anything offensive, and he just laughed and he said, 'Of course I don't. We all know what's going on.' ...
 
""And this was used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the Obama campaign to try to breed resentment elsewhere. And, you know, do I regret saying it? No. Do I regret that it was used that way? I certainly do. But you really gotta go some to try to portray me as a racist.""
 
So, here's where Clinton gets in trouble. The next day, NBC News' Mike Memoli asked Clinton about some of the things he had said in that radio interview.
 
NBC: ""Sir, what did you mean yesterday when you said that the Obama campaign was playing the race card on you?""
 
Clinton: ""When did I say that, and to whom did I say that?""
 
NBC: ""On WHYY radio yesterday.""
 
Clinton: ""No, no, no. That's not what I said. You always follow me around and play these little games, and I'm not going to play your games today. This is a day about election day. Go back and see what the question was, and what my answer was. You have mischaracterized it to get another cheap story to divert the American people from the real urgent issues before us, and I choose not to play your game today. Have a nice day.""
 
NBC: ""Respectfully sir, though, you did say ...""
 
Clinton: ""Have a nice day. I said what I said, you can go and look at the interview. And if you'll be real honest, you'll also report what the question was and what the answer was.""

.
 
It's hard to know what more to say on this one. Clinton was asked to explain an intriguing accusation he made against the Obama campaign and responded by saying he didn't say it. But he did. Even when we review the full context of the original radio interview, as Clinton suggests, the facts here don't budge. We say ... Pants on Fire!

Hard numbers are just guess-timates
","
Sen. Hillary Clinton has a new health care ad in Pennsylvania in which she accuses Sen. Barack Obama of attacking her, and then takes a few jabs at him.
 
Obama's plan ""will cost taxpayers $1,700 more to cover each new person,"" Clinton's ad states. ""Obama's health care plan leaves 15-million people with no coverage.""
 
We've previously checked her statement that Obama's plan

leaves 15-million people without coverage and found it to be Half True

.
 
For evidence that Obama's plan will cost $1,700 more, the Clinton campaign pointed to a blog post by Paul Krugman of the

New York Times.

Krugman believes Clinton's plan, with its universal mandate that requires every person to have health insurance, is superior to Obama's plan, which does not.
 
Krugman's numbers come from a study by Jonathan Gruber, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gruber's latest working paper is about covering the uninsured in the United States.
 
Gruber studied broad models for providing health insurance, comparing a plan that includes a mandate with one that does not. Krugman and Clinton's ad both correctly note that the per-person cost difference between the two models is about $1,700 per year.
 
But as Krugman notes, the models, while ""broadly similar"" to Clinton's and Obama's health plans, are not the same. For one thing, Obama's plan has a mandate for children, so it is not the same as a plan with no mandates at all.
 
Also, experts we've interviewed previously about the Clinton and Obama health plans have emphasized the difficulty of putting hard numbers to the campaign proposals. The proposals are broad outlines and contain little in the way of hard numbers for subsidies or eligibility for subsidized insurance. This makes it hard to say exactly how much the plans will cost. (

We looked at this point previously when Obama said his plan would save more

.)
 
So Clinton's ad is pushing the envelope quite a bit to say that her plan would save $1,700 per person. Yes, there is evidence that a mandate lowers costs for everyone, but whether $1,700 would be the difference between her and Obama's plan is a different matter. We find her statement to be Barely True.

Her mandate doesn't mention garnishment
","
In the final days before the Pennsylvania primary, the two Democratic candidates went after each other on health care.
 
""Hillary Clinton's attacking, but what's she not telling you about her health care plan?"" the narrator in a Barack Obama campaign ad asks. ""It forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can't afford it, and you pay a penalty if you don't.""
 
Text on the screen shows a news story with the highlighted words, ""willing to have workers' wages garnisheed if they refuse to buy health insurance.""
 
Read Clinton's health care plan, and you won't find ""garnisheed wages"" in any of the fine print.
 
But her plan does have an individual mandate — every person in the country will be required to have health insurance one way or another. (Obama's plan has a mandate for children only.) Clinton hasn't specified how she will enforce the mandate.
 
Obama's ad cites an Associated Press article, titled ""Clinton acknowledges willingness to tap wages of those who refuse to buy health insurance."" That story is a report of an interview Clinton gave to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News'

This Week.

 
Stephanopoulos asked Clinton how she intended to enforce the mandate: ""Will you have fines for people who don't buy health care, don't go by the mandate? Will you garnish their wages?""
 
Clinton responded by saying that her plan will lower costs and that it's an important principle that everyone be included in the system. After more pressing from Stephanopoulos, Clinton answered his question on garnished wages:
 
""George, we will have an enforcement mechanism, whether it's that or it's some other mechanism through the tax system or automatic enrollments, but you're missing I believe the key point. ... The reason why I think there are a number of mechanisms — going after people's wages, automatic enrollment, when you are at the place of employment, you will be automatically enrolled — whatever the mechanism is, is not as important as, number one, the fundamental commitment to universal health care, the appreciation that with health care tax credits and with a premium cap it will be affordable for everyone.""
 
The Obama ad uses Clinton's promise of universal coverage to imply dire consequences for those who don't comply with the mandate. In practice, Clinton's plan, just like Obama's, emphasizes leaving in place employer-paid coverage that people already have, while expanding eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Both of their plans subsidize premiums for some employers and create pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. Both plans include initiatives to increase technology and use more preventative care.
 
Is it possible that Clinton's plan could garnish wages? Yes. Her plan has a mandate, and she said it was one of several ways that a mandate could be enforced. But she was clearly speaking of it as one scenario among several, not advocating it as a definite enforcement mechanism. For this reason, we find Obama's claim to be Half True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Barack Obama']","
A distinction without a difference
","In an attempt to draw distinctions where there are, in fact, very few, the Obama campaign sent around a mailer in Pennsylvania last week attacking Sen. Hillary Clinton on foreign trade.
 
Over a picture of people standing in an unemployment line is this headline: ""Here's the Truth: Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA and permanent China trade. Pennsylvania lost thousands of jobs.""
 
PolitiFact has addressed the NAFTA issue before, concluding that in the past, Clinton has, indeed,

energetically promoted NAFTA, while noting that more work needed to be done.

 
In June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects ""but unfortunately it had a lot of downside."" And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected.
 
The other claim in Obama's political ad about Clinton's support for permanent China trade relates to a bill that passed Congress in 2000 to enter the United States into a Permanent Normalized Trade agreement with China.
 
Clinton was campaigning for the U.S. Senate when the bill passed (just seven Democrats opposed), and Clinton was asked at a CNN-sponsored forum in April 2000 what she thought about it, in light of China's history on human rights.
 
Said Clinton: ""I share the concerns that many of my supporters in organized labor have expressed to me, because I do think we have to make sure that we improve labor rights, we improve environmental standards in our bilateral and our multilateral trade agreements.
 
""But on balance, I've looked at this, I've studied it, I think it is in the interests of America and American workers that we provide the option for China to go into the WTO (World Trade Organization). Right now, we are trading with China. We have a huge trade deficit with China. The agreement that has been negotiated between our two countries would open their markets to us in a way that they are not yet open, and in fact, for many large manufactured products, like automobiles, we would have the first chance to really get in and compete in that marketplace.""
 
Obama says he would have opposed the legislation.
 
In a forum sponsored by the Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) on April 15, 2008, Obama said the Permanent Normalized Trade agreement with China ""didn't do enough to ensure fairness and compliance.""
 
""Now, you can have a debate about whether my position is right or wrong,"" Obama said. ""But here's what you can't do. You can't spend the better part of two decades campaigning for NAFTA and PNTR for China, and then come here to Pennsylvania, and tell the steelworkers you've been with them all along.""
 
But when Clinton and Obama addressed the AAM, separately, on April 15, 2008, their stated positions on foreign trade were ""virtually identical,"" said AAM director Scott Paul.
 
Both pledged to step up enforcement of current trade laws. Both promised to crack down on China's practice of manipulating its currency to give its products an unfair advantage. Both said they opposed the Chinese government subsidizing industry to the detriment of U.S. competitors.
 
""China must stop manipulating its currency because it's not fair to American manufacturers, it's not fair to you, and we are going to change it when I am president,"" Obama said.
 
Said Clinton: ""I'm calling for changing our laws to send China a message. If you subsidize your exports and hurt our manufacturers, you'll pay a price.""
 
Which led Paul to conclude: ""There is not a lot of policy difference moving forward.""
 
The debate comes amid a campaign initiated by AAM called ""China Cheats. Pennsylvania Loses.""
Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonpartisan business-labor alliance, commissioned a study by the Economic Policy Institute that concluded that trade deficits with China have cost the United States 1.8-million jobs since 2001 (78,200 in Pennsylvania). Another study by EPI concluded Pennsylvania lost another 44,173 jobs between 1993 and 2004 due to NAFTA.
 
But while the Obama campaign mailer tries to make it seem as though the two Democratic candidates are far apart on trade issues, in substance they are not. It is true that Clinton has in the past verbally supported NAFTA and permanent trade with China. Yet it is also true that she has spoken forcefully about the need to reform NAFTA and to much more stringently enforce trade agreements with China. So we rate the claims in the mailer to be Half True.

Obama contradicts previously stated pin philosophy
","During the Democratic debate in Philadelphia, a question from a voter rekindled an unlikely campaign issue: why Sen. Barack Obama doesn't wear a flag lapel pin. Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos rolled video of a voter from Latrobe, Pa.: ""Senator Obama, I have a question, and I want to know if you believe in the American flag. I am not questioning your patriotism, but all our servicemen, policemen and EMS wear the flag. I want to know why you don't."" Obama gave a lengthy answer first defended his patriotrism -- ""I revere the American flag, and I would not be running for president if I did not revere this country"" -- before repeating remarks that it's more important to act patriotically than to wear a pin. ""What I've tried to do is to show my patriotism by how I treat veterans when I'm working in the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee; by making sure that I'm speaking forcefully about how we need to bring this war in Iraq to a close, because I think it is not serving our national security well and it's not serving our military families and our troops well; talking about how we need to restore a sense of economic fairness to this country because that's what this country has always been about, is providing upward mobility and ladders to opportunity for all Americans."" Then he added, ""I wore one yesterday when a veteran handed it to me, who himself was disabled and works on behalf of disabled veterans. I have never said that I don't wear flag pins or refuse to wear flag pins."" This is not the first time Obama has been questioned about lapel pins. The issue first came up in October 2007 when a reporter with KCRG-TV, an ABC affiliate in Iowa, asked him, ""You don't have the American flag pin on. Is that a fashion statement?"" Obama said: ""You know, the truth is that right after 9/11, I had a pin. Shortly after 9/11, particularly because as we're talking about the Iraq War, that became a substitute for I think true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security, I decided I won't wear that pin on my chest. Instead, I'm going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great, and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism."" The comment raised enough eyebrows that Obama brought it up the next day at a campaign appearance to explain it. ""I said, you know what, I probably haven't worn a flag pin in a very long time. After a while I noticed people wearing a lapel pin and not acting very patriotic. ""My attitude is that I'm less concerned about what you're wearing on your lapel than what's in your heart. You show your patriotism by how you treat your fellow Americans, especially those who serve. You show your patriotism by being true to our values and ideals. That's what we have to lead with is our values and our ideals."" So it is true that Obama said he won't wear the flag pin, and his statement at the debate was not accurate. Obama wasn't the only candidate, however, not wearing a flag pin. News reports from October 2007 indicate that neither Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, nor John McCain were wearing flag pins on a daily basis either. The only candidate mentioned in news reports as regularly wearing a flag pin was Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani. (For more on the flag pin controversy and reaction to the debate, see our story here.) Nevertheless, Obama did give a statement saying he didn't wear flag pins, so we find his statement, ""I have never said that I don't wear flag pins or refuse to wear flag pins,"" to be False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097210900>],/factchecks/2008/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-contradicts-previously-stated-pin-philosophy/
"['National', 'Economy', 'John McCain']","
One major tax cut, then lots of raises
","Throughout the primary season, the Republican contenders — Sen. John McCain among them — jockeyed for position as the heir to the legacy of Ronald Reagan. A key part of that legacy is the conservative mantra — treated practically as sacred truth — that Reagan was a die-hard tax cutter.
 
While campaigning in Westport, Conn., on April 9, 2008, McCain made it clear that he's a true believer in Reagan's tax-cutting record. Asked by a voter how he planned to balance the federal budget, McCain said he would emulate Reagan and pursue a supply-side approach, the belief that cutting taxes can actually grow tax revenue by stimulating the economy.
 
""I don't believe in a static economy,"" McCain said. ""I believe that when there's stimulus for growth, when there's opportunity, when people keep more of their money — and the government is the least efficient way to spend your money — that economies improve.""
 
And McCain said he'd pursue a policy just as Reagan had. After Reagan took office, ""we didn't raise taxes and we didn't cut entitlements,"" he said. ""What we did was we cut taxes.""
 
Whether the comment about Reagan's tax-cutting proclivities, as well as his success at safeguarding entitlements, is true or not depends on how much of the Reagan record you want to consider.
 
In the period immediately after Reagan took office, McCain's statement is on the money. Reagan in 1981 proposed — and Congress passed — a massive tax cut, the centerpiece of which was a 25 percent reduction in marginal tax rates.
 
The result was that taxes paid as a share of gross domestic product immediately began to decline from the post-World War II peak of 20.2 percent that they hit that year.
 
Reagan didn't cut entitlements either — a promise he'd made during his 1980 campaign. But that's not to say he didn't consider it. In 1982, Reagan went along with a plan by GOP Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico to slow the growth of spending on Social Security and cut $40-billion from the program. Reagan also called for a 10 percent reduction in total spending for Medicaid in his budget proposal that year.
 
In the end, both ideas came to naught, in the face of Democratic opposition in Congress.
 
McCain's recollection that Reagan safeguarded entitlement programs becomes more true later in Reagan's presidency, while his memory of Reagan as a tax cutter becomes more flawed.
 
In 1983, Reagan signed legislation aimed at preserving Social Security's solvency by raising payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits of upper-income Americans.
 
The plan certainly preserved Social Security but also demonstrated that Reagan was willing to impose tax increases, even if he didn't propose them and rarely accepted them with enthusiasm.
 
As former Reagan adviser Bruce Bartlett wrote in a 2003 article for

National Review,

Reagan signed two major tax increases in 1982 that took back much of the break he'd provided in his 1981 tax bill. After the Social Security tax increase of 1983, Reagan approved further tax increases — in one form or another — in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.
 
None of them was particularly draconian and taxes as a share of GDP continued to decline until 1984, when they bottomed out at 18.4 percent but then rose back to 19.2 percent by 1989, when Reagan left office. The overall percentage then was still lower than during Reagan's first year in the White House.
 
Still, the fact that Reagan signed legislation raising taxes at all during his presidency certainly runs counter to the current GOP orthodoxy and would seem to contradict, if not disprove, McCain's statement, which we find to be Barely True.

Slippery math, loaded words
","In the battle to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are each claiming they'd be tougher on ""Big Oil"" than their opponent.
 
The oil companies are a convenient bogeyman because gasoline is averaging $3.42 per gallon in the state, and the high fuel cost is driving up prices on food and many other products.
 
In a new TV ad, Clinton says Obama has made an empty boast by saying he doesn't take money from oil companies.
 
""No candidate does,"" the announcer says, adding that it's against federal law. ""But Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies."" The screen then lists names and amounts from some of Obama's oil-affiliated contributors.
 
The announcer continues: ""Every gallon of gas takes over three bucks from your pocket, but Obama voted for the Bush-Cheney energy bill that put $6-billion in the pocket of big oil. Hillary voted against it.""
 
We checked the contribution claim

with this item,

so here we'll address Clinton's claim that Obama voted for the bill.
 
She is referring to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a major priority for the Bush administration. She is correct that Obama voted for it, one of of 25 Democrats who did. (Clinton voted against it.)
 
Obama said he voted for it ""reluctantly."" He said he wanted it to do more to reduce reliance on foreign oil, but he liked the bill's incentives for ethanol and clean coal.
 
""This bill, while far from a solution, is a first step toward decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil,"" he said. ""It requires that 7.5-billion gallons of ethanol be mixed with gasoline by 2012. That's 7.5-billion gallons of fuel that will be grown in the corn fields of Illinois, and not imported from the deserts of the Middle East.""
 
The bill's title said its purpose was ""to ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and reliable energy."" As you might expect, there are differing interpretations about whether the bill provided so much for the energy industry that it was a ""giveaway.""
 
While Clinton is correct that the legislation included plenty of tax breaks for oil companies, the companies also had to pay a $3-billion extension of taxes on crude oil to help offset costs associated with oil spills. As we've noted

with this prior item on a Clinton attack against Obama,

a large share of of the $14.6-billion in tax incentives in the law actually went to ""renewable"" sources of energy, to accelerate the development of wind, clean-coal and nuclear power, and hybrid vehicles. (There is debate over whether coal and nuclear power should be considered renewable.)
 
And then there's the matter of Clinton's math. She claims in the ad that the bill ""put $6-billion in the pocket of big oil."" That number is not accurate.
 
The Clinton campaign said it comes from Public Citizen, one of many environmental and consumer organizations to oppose the bill. A Public Citizen report titled ""The Best Energy Bill Corporations Could Buy: Summary of Industry Giveaways in the 2005 Energy Bill,"" had a headline that said the oil and gas subsidies totaled $6-billion.
 
But when PolitiFact compared the group's numbers with the official estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional panel that calculates the cost of tax legislation, they didn't match. The Public Citizen report was considerably higher.
 
We spoke with Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen's energy program, who explained why: The group had produced a higher number by including all of the tax breaks for oil companies that would reduce revenue to the federal government, but did not include other tax changes that would actually cost the companies additional money and bring new revenue to the government.
 
For example, Public Citizen estimated a provision for oil refineries was an $842-million ""giveaway"" over the first six years, but it neglected to include the $436-million in new taxes that the companies would pay over the next four years.
 
So when we included the additional taxes the oil and gas companies would pay, the actual number is about $5.3-billion over 10 years.
 
Slocum acknowledged that the $6-billion cost was ""a little misleading."" But he said the conclusion remained the same, that ""it was just egregious to have that level of a giveaway.""
 
And so we find that Clinton is right that Obama voted for the bill, but she's using incorrect numbers about the bill that exaggerate the benefit for oil companies, and her description of the bill fails to reflect its incentives for alternative energy. Overall, we'd say that makes her statement Half True.

Murder rate is down this year
","During the Democratic debate in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton was asked about gun control. As part of her answer, she talked about reducing gun violence in cities, and mentioned Philadelphia's struggle with that.
 
""You know, more than one person, on average, a day is murdered in Philadelphia,"" Clinton said. ""And Mayor (Michael) Nutter is very committed, as the mayor of this great city, to try to do what he can to stem the violence.""
 
A murder a day means more than 365 murders per year. Last year, Philadelphia did hit that unhappy milestone with 392 murders. That was down slightly from 2006, when there were 406 murders.
 
This year, though, murders have declined since the beginning of the year. The home page of the Philadelphia Police Department tracks the year's murders, and the day after the Philadelphia debate, the number stood at 87, down from 114 on the same date a year ago. At that rate, the murder rate is about 20 percent less than a murder a day.
 
So previous year's statistics do bear out Clinton's point, but the statistics for 2008 do not. For this reason, we find her statement to be Half True.

Clinton accepts lobbyist money
","If you were wondering how Washington works, an ad from the Barack Obama campaign ostensibly offers a primer – ""A Guide to Understanding Washington Lobbyists"" — while it attacks Hillary Clinton.
 
The Web-only ad outlines the following steps with on-screen text:
 
Step 1: ""Lobbyists donate to politicians.""
 
Step 2: ""Politicians defend lobbyists.""
 
Step 3: ""Americans pay the price.""
 
As part of the first step, the ad states:
 
""Senator Hillary Clinton has taken over $800,000 from lobbyists, more money than any other candidate — Republican or Democrat:
 
* Over $130,000 from energy lobbyists
 
* Over $130,000 from drug company lobbyists
 
* Over $125,000 from health care and insurance lobbyists.""
 
We asked the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which categorizes and analyzes political contributions, whether this text was accurate.
 
The $800,000 number is correct. A recent analysis by the center showed Clinton has accepted $865,290 from lobbyists, based on data released on March 20, 2008.
 
The threshold of contributions by industry the ad lists for Clinton is probably too low, said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the center.
 
The center's analysis found the following amounts that lobbyists gave to Clinton:
 
* Energy: $442,800
 
* Pharmaceuticals/health products: $450,450
 
* Hospitals, health services/HMOs and insurance companies: $552,050
 
* Health professionals: $114,755.
 
Based on these numbers, we find Obama's statement that Clinton has taken more than $800,000 from lobbyists to be True.

Yes, oil company employees have donated to Obama
","As part of a dust-up over which candidate is more likely to stand up to Big Oil, Hillary Clinton knocks Barack Obama for taking money from people who work for oil companies.
 
The ad starts by showing Obama saying, ""I don't take money from oil companies."" The Clinton ad's narrator chides Obama for boasting about this when corporations are prohibited by law from donating to political candidates. ""But Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies,"" the narrator ads.
 
Obama would have been correct if he had said he didn't take money from oil company lobbyists or political action committees. (He did make this point in

a later ad, which we found to be Mostly True; see it here

.)
 
The ad also is correct that Obama accepted $222,309 from executives and employees of oil companies, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's worth noting those donations could be from anyone from the CEO to the janitor. People who donate to political candidates are required to list their occupation and employer. It's important to note that this rule is has far from perfect compliance; sometimes people don't fill it in at all.
 
Clinton doesn't mention the fact that she accepted even more money from executives and employees of oil companies — $309,363, according to the center. And she accepted about $442,800 from energy lobbyists, according to the center, though not all of that is from oil and gas alone.
 
Nevertheless, the ad is correct that Obama did accept money from employees of oil companies, and we rate its statement True.
 
",[<zip object at 0x0000028097132DC0>],/factchecks/2008/apr/17/hillary-clinton/yes-oil-company-employees-have-donated-to-obama/

Obama rejects lobbyist money
","Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton aired television ads about the oil and gas industry just before the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania.
 
Obama's ad asserts, ""Obama's the only candidate who doesn't take a dime from oil company PACs or lobbyists. And that's change we can believe in.""
 
Obama has stated he has a policy of not accepting campaign contributions from political action committees or lobbyists. There's

a bit of fine print on this, however, as we've reported previously

. Obama does not take money from registered federal lobbyists, but he does take money from state lobbyists, retired lobbyists and spouses of lobbyists.
 
The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has a broad definition of lobbyist money that includes contributions from spouses of lobbyists. By its reckoning, Obama has received $115,163 in money from lobbyists based on data released on March 20, 2008.
 
We can't say how much of that comes from contributors connected with oil and gas lobbyists versus other kinds of lobbyists. Many lobbyists represent more than one industry.
 
It's worth noting, however, that Obama's total lags his significantly behind Clinton, who got $865,290, from lobbyists, and John McCain, who got $590,952.
 
Is it possible that Barack Obama took ""a dime"" from someone connected to oil and gas lobbyists? Yes. But it looks as if Obama took good-faith measures not to accept money from current lobbyists for any industry, including oil and gas. For these reasons, we find his statement Mostly True.

Dems don't propose tax increases on lower incomes
","A chain e-mail going around the Internet announces, ""Voters Beware! ... We are in for big time trouble if either H. Rodham Clinton or B. Hussein Obama were to be elected as President of the United States."" (

Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety

.)
 
The e-mail asserts that Sens. Clinton and Obama

want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels

. We'll look at the income taxes claim here.
 
The e-mail says Clinton and Obama will roll back the Bush tax cuts for people making $30,000 a year and up, while Sen. John McCain won't. These cuts are set to expire during the next president's first term.
 
But the e-mail wrongly describes the Obama and Clinton plans. Obama and Clinton have both said they don't want to let the tax cuts expire for people earning under a certain amount.
 
When we first looked at this e-mail, Clinton had said she would not raise tax rates on people making more than $250,000 a year, and Obama had made similar statements. They further clarified their stances on tax cuts at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008. Both candidates said said then they would not raise tax rates for people making less than $250,000 a year. Both indicated they would consider raising the capital gains tax. (

See the statement on capital gains here.

)
 
So the e-mail is wrong about what Clinton and Obama have actually proposed. It's correct that McCain supports making the Bush tax cuts permanent for all income levels.
 
Also, the e-mail calculates the current taxes for different income brackets, purporting to show what taxpayers would pay under McCain's ""no changes"" plan. But the numbers appear to be slightly off. We calculated the tax rates using the 2007 tax tables listed by the IRS. The taxes are as follows:
 
Single making 30K - tax $4,113; not $4,500
 
Single making 50K - tax $8,930; not $12,500
 
Single making 75K - tax $15,180; not $18,750
 
Married making 60K- tax $8,221; not $9,000
 
Married making 75K - tax $11,604; not $18,750
 
Married making 125K - tax $24,098; not $31,250
 
We find this chain e-mail gets facts both large and small wrong. It doesn't list the higher tax brackets that actually would go up if Clinton or Obama implemented their plans, and it accuses them of wanting to raise rates on lower incomes that they've said should stay the same. So we rate the chain e-mail's claim False.

This statement has been updated to reflect comments the Democratic candidates made about the capital gains tax at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008.

Capital gains taxes often don't apply to homeowners
","A chain e-mail accuses Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of wanting sharp tax increases, while praising Sen. John McCain for holding the line. (

Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety

.)
 
The e-mail asserts that Clinton and Obama

want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels

. We'll look at the capital gains taxes claim here.
 
So what is a capital gains tax? The Internal Revenue Service explains: ""Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset."" When you sell an asset for a profit, that profit margin is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the income level of the tax filer and the length of the investment, with separate tax rates for short-term vs. long-term capital gains.
 
Here's what the e-mail says about capital gains taxes:
 
""CAPITAL GAINS TAX
 
MCCAIN
 
15% (no change)
 
OBAMA
 
28%
 
CLINTON
 
24%""
 
""How does this affect you?"" the e-mail asks. ""If you sell your home and make a profit, you will pay 28% of your gain on taxes. If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes. This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income.""
 
The item lists 15 percent as the current rate, and that is a correct number for long-term capital gains for higher income brackets. Obama has said he would raise the capital gains tax rate to somewhere between 20 percent and 28 percent, depending on how much he needs to pay for his health care plan. (The long-term rate was generally 20 percent prior to the Bush tax cuts.)
 
After we received this e-mail, Clinton addressed the capital gains tax in some detail at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008.
 
""I wouldn't raise it above the 20 percent if I raised it at all,"" Clinton said, adding, ""I'm going to have to look and see what the revenue situation is.""
 
We talked with a spokesman for a business-backed tax policy group and he said he expects either Democrat would raise the capital gains rate.
 
""Unless they just go back on all their campaign promises to raise taxes on high-income people, these are the taxes that they're talking about,"" said William Ahern of the Tax Foundation, which advocates for a transparent, progrowth tax code.
 
But there's another problem with the e-mail's statements, specifically the implication that all home sales are subject to the capital gains tax. Many home sales are exempt from the capital gains tax. As long as they meet rules requiring that they've lived in their home, homeowers don't have to pay the capital gains tax if the profits on their home are less than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a married couple. The rule applies to workers and retirees alike, said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C.
 
To summarize, the e-mail is right that Obama wants to raise the capital gains rate, though it pegs the high end of a range he's suggested. Clinton, meanwhile, would consider raising it to 20 percent, not the 24 percent stated in the e-mail. It's also important to note that because the tax code allows for significant capital gains on a homestead before capital gains taxes are levied, most homeowners are exempt. In the end, the e-mail's statements on the capital gains tax are more wrong than right; we rate it Barely True.

Obama served on board with Ayers
","A little-known relationship in Sen. Barack Obama's past — one that had been buzzing in mostly conservative circles for months — took a very public turn Wednesday night during a Democratic debate in Philadelphia.
 
It relates to Obama's relationship with William C. Ayers, a onetime member of the Weather Underground, a leftist fringe of the 1960s antiwar movement. Known as the Weathermen, the group was responsible for bombings of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971 and of the Pentagon in 1972.
 
During the debate, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about his relationship with Ayers, as part of a discussion about Obama's patriotism.
 
""An early organizing meeting for your state Senate campaign was held at his house and your campaign has said you are 'friendly,' "" Stephanopoulos said.
 
Stephanopoulos quoted a

New York Times

story, published Sept. 11, 2001, in which Ayers was quoted as saying: ""I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough.""
 
Asked Stephanopoulos: ""Can you explain that relationship for the voters and explain to Democrats why it won't be a problem?""
 
Obama downplayed the relationship.
 
""This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from,"" Obama said. ""He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.
 
""And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn't make much sense, George.""
 
Sen. Hillary Clinton then piled on.
 
""I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr. Ayers for a period of time, the Woods Foundation, which was a paid directorship position. And, if I'm not mistaken, that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11 and after his reported comments, which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and, I would hope, to every American, because they were published on 9/11, and he said that he was just sorry they hadn't done more.""
 
We need to point out that it was merely a coincidence the remarks were published in the

New York Times

on Sept. 11 and they had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks that day. They were referring to activities by the Weather Underground in the 1970s.
 
Deborah Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, a philanthropic organization in Chicago, said Obama was a director from 1994 through 2001. That overlaps Ayers' time as a director by three years. It also means Obama served with Ayers for the final months of 2001, after Ayers made his comments to the

New York Times.

 
Ayers, now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago (not English as Obama stated), is still on the seven-member Woods Fund board.
 
In 2001, Ayers wrote a book, ''Fugitive Days'' — he called it a memoir — in which he wrote that he participated in the bombings of New York City police headquarters, the Capitol building and the Pentagon. But in a review of the book, the

New York Times

noted that Ayers coyly noted that some of the book was fiction.
 
Last week, Ayers defended the September 2001 comments on

his blog

stating: ""I'm sometimes asked if I regret anything I did to oppose the war in Vietnam and I say: No, I don't regret anything I did to stop the slaughter of millions of human beings by my own government.""
 
Obama has minimized his relationship with Ayers. Campaign finance reports show Ayers donated $200 to Obama's re-election campaign in 2001.
 
In the spirit of fairness, we should note that just before leaving office, President Bill Clinton pardoned Susan L. Rosenberg who, according to a

New York Times

story in 2001, was ""a onetime member of the Weather Underground terrorist group who was charged in the notorious 1981 Brink's robbery in Rockland County that left a guard and two police officers dead.""
 
But as for Clinton's comments about Obama's relationship with Ayers, we rate them True.

Not enough to matter
","If only it were that easy.
 
With gas prices above $3 per gallon and voters complaining that energy prices are squeezing them from every direction, Sen. John McCain, the de facto Republican nominee for president, is offering a salve based on Economics 101, the rule of supply and demand:
 
If elected, he'll stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce demand and ease prices.
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, is the nation's government-owned stockpile of crude oil. It is stored in a series of salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana and currently holds about 700-million barrels of oil, enough to replace the nation's oil imports for about 60 days.
 
President Bush supports expanding the reserve to 1-billion barrels in the next decade.
 
""Right now I think we should stop adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" McCain said at a small business roundtable in Brooklyn, N.Y., on April 10. ""The SPR is intended to offset the impact of physical disruption of oil supplies.
 
""But with oil at over $100 a barrel and an adequate supply in the SPR, it is time to suspend purchases. This will lessen worldwide demand for oil, and if the classic laws of supply and demand hold, we should see a welcome decrease in the price of oil.""
 
Well, kind of. The problem is, the SPR doesn't buy enough oil to make a significant dent in oil supplies or prices, experts say.
 
The Energy Information Administration, the independent, analytical arm of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates that the SPR adds, at most, $1 to $2 to the cost of a $100 barrel of oil, or as much as 4 cents to 5 cents per gallon of refined gasoline. Independent experts tend to agree.
 
While any cut in prices may be better than nothing, it's hard to argue those pennies would equal the ""welcome decrease"" McCain describes with gas prices up around $3.30 per gallon.
 
""Our analysis points out that there is a relatively minor impact, maybe a dollar or two at most per barrel, out of $100-plus per barrel,"" said Doug McIntyre, a senior oil market analyst at the Energy Information Administration in Washington.
 
""I'm sure everyone would love to find something they could change and immediately make prices drop $20 a barrel, regardless of the (political) party. Our analysis is, this isn't the magic bullet that some would like it to be.""
 
Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to protect the economy in case of another disruption to oil imports. It has steadily expanded over the years, and was growing by as much as 300,000 barrels per day during the Reagan administration.
 
The government currently adds to the reserve by about 70,000 barrels of crude oil per day, less than one-half of 1 percent of the 20.6-million barrels the United States uses daily. So while it does increase demand, it does so by a relatively small amount.
 
Dr. A.F. Alhajji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, said filling the SPR does add to costs, in part because the government creates inefficiencies in the way it fills it.
 
""If you do the calculations, it has an impact,"" Alhajji said.
 
But, he added, McCain's idea ""would have a small impact. ... In an environment of increasing oil prices, people are not going to feel it, people are not going to see it.""
 
Not everyone agrees. A 2003 report by the Democratic staff of a subcommittee of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, led by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., found that filling the SPR could have ""significant market impact"" because the balance between global supply and global demand is generally only several hundred thousand barrels of oil.
 
In that context, sending 100,000 barrels a day to the SPR could affect demand, the report argued.
 
But U.S. refineries have more oil at their disposal than they are processing right now, so making more available would not necessarily put more gasoline into the market and cut costs. Plus, McIntyre said the government's purchase schedule is well known, ""so the market should be able to account for it fairly easily.""
 
The oil market also is complex. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including current demand, expected demand, available stockpiles and, of course, global and domestic politics. That makes it difficult to determine exactly how gas prices would truly be affected if the government stopped adding to the reserve, but experts doubt it would be significant. A Congressional Research Service report from 2005 also was skeptical.
 
""The effect of any change in fill policy on gasoline prices would depend on a number of factors — refiners' access to SPR crude, available refining capacity to manufacture gasoline meeting regional Clean Air requirements, other local conditions, and weekly reports of gasoline and other product stocks,"" the report said.
 
""While prices might fall some on the heels of an announcement that SPR fill would be deferred, the adjustment might be only short-term. Gasoline and home heating oil prices might be more sensitive to reported stock levels than to reports of modest additional crude supply.""
 
Also, only about 40 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline comes from the price of crude oil, so a drop (or rise) in oil prices and doesn't necessarily mean a corresponding drop (or rise) in gas prices.
The reserve has been tapped in the form of sales, exchanges or loans several times over the years, including after Hurricane Katrina disrupted oil production and imports on the Gulf Coast in 2005 and after Hurricane Ivan struck the Gulf Coast in 2004.
 
In 1996, sales from the reserve were used to raise money. In April 1996, President Clinton released 12-million barrels to blunt a rise in crude oil prices.
 
Filling the reserve also was suspended after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and again in 1994 to save money.
 
We find that while McCain is correct in principle, he grossly overstates the potential impact of his idea. Drivers would see little change in the price at the pump if the government stopped buying oil for the Strategic Reserve. We rate his statement Barely True.
