Fake news site posts that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is dead for second time in a month
","A fake news story that said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was killed in a coordinated, nationwide strike by U.S. forces under cover of darkness comes from a shopworn website known for churning out fabricated stories. ""Report: Kim Jong Un killed in (President Donald) Trump’s overnight black op attack on North Korea,"" read the headline on a July 28, 2017, ArmyUSANews.com post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. The story said that 17 SEAL teams struck multiple targets, and that ""in three hours time, the entire military infrastructure of that country has been eliminated,"" according to a reporter. Kim was reportedly killed, although state media played a ""death to America"" speech recorded years ago, the article said. Kim Jong Un’s death has not been reported widely because this coordinated attack did not happen. The story is fake. (The photo showing a North Korean city on fire is actually a British hospital burning.) It originated on July 23 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a self-described liberal troll who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers. A footnote on the bottom of the website said that ""everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction."" The warning is repeated in the About Us section, where a disclaimer reads, ""We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist."" This isn’t the first time TheLastLineOfDefense.org has posted a story that said Kim was dead. The site posted a story on July 6 that said an American sniper had killed the North Korean leader — we ruled that claim Pants On Fire! It’s not immediately apparent why the site would post essentially the same story just a couple of weeks apart. We attempted to contact TheLastLineOfDefense.org to see if a fictional assassination of Kim Jong Un would be a regular occurrence on the site, but didn’t get a response.

Nearly half of counties have no providers or one for health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges?
","Two Republican talking points in attacking Obamacare are particularly prominent. One is that the health care law has failed, as House Speaker Paul Ryan declared in a January 2017 claim that, in one form or another, continues to be repeated. We rated it Mostly False. The Affordable Care Act did not meet all its promises, including a big one -- that you could keep your insurance plan if you liked it. But health care costs have risen more slowly since the law took effect and the law has met its major goal of getting more people insured, an estimated 20 million. Another Obamacare attack, often stated in the same breath, is that in much of the country health insurance providers are drying up. One of Ryan’s fellow Wisconsin Republicans, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, made that claim July 20, 2017, in a television interview on EWTN, a Catholic network. ""We let Democrats off the hook,"" Duffy said. ""They gave us a failing health care package. You have almost half the counties in America that have one provider or no provider for insurance. This law is crumbling."" Markets with fewer insurers have been linked to fewer affordable choices for health insurance and higher prices. As we’ll see, Duffy might be right -- but he’s a bit ahead of it’s time. Trump’s similar claim To be clear, Duffy is referring to the relatively few Americans who buy their own health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, not the vast majority who are covered by an employer or a government program such as Medicare. In March 2017, when President Donald Trump claimed that one-third of the nation’s counties ""only have one insurer left"" on the exchanges, PolitiFact National’s rating was True. There was only one insurance provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties, based on figures from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected authority on health care. But that was four months before Duffy’s claim. And Duffy’s claim goes further than those made by many Republicans.   Duffy’s evidence To back Duffy’s statement, his office cited a June 2017 analysis by the New York Times. It estimated that 1,433 counties -- or about 45 percent of all counties -- are expected to have one insurer or no insurers in the Obamacare marketplaces, unless another carrier steps in. The marketplaces are where 12 million people buy their own coverage. The Times said it used Kaiser data showing which companies currently offer plans in each county, and combined that with announcements from insurance companies saying which counties they plan to exit or enter in 2018. So, the 45 percent is an estimate for 2018, not a current count. Currently, according to the article and Kaiser data, 1,036 counties have one provider. That’s 33 percent of all counties. There aren’t any counties right now that have no insurers on the exchanges. Other views The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit research group, also confirmed that 33 percent of counties in 2017 have only one health insurer on the exchanges. And, like the Times, it estimates that in 2018, 45 percent of counties will have one insurer or none. Two health care experts, however, told us it’s too soon to say whether the 45 percent figure will be accurate. Cynthia Cox, the associate director of Kaiser’s program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance, said most states haven’t disclosed enough information publicly to make such an estimate. And Urban Institute health policy fellow John Holahan said that while 45 percent might be a fair estimate currently, the percentage likely will turn out to be lower because more insurers will probably enter the exchanges for 2018. (By the way, Wisconsin tends to fare well on these measures. In 2017, according to Kaiser, the number of insurers on the exchanges ranged from 1 -- in Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming -- to 15 in Wisconsin. The average was four.) One note before we close: Counties with one provider or no provider are concentrated in rural areas. So, even though one-third of counties currently have only one insurer, only about one in every five people who buy that insurance is affected. Our rating Duffy said: ""You have almost half the counties in America that have one provider or no provider for insurance"" on the Obamacare exchanges. Currently, 33 percent of counties have only one company selling health insurance policies to individuals on the Obamacare exchanges. There are no counties that have no providers. The element of truth in Duffy’s claim is that the New York Times estimates that in 2018, 45 percent of counties will have one provider or no providers. But that’s a projection and the article notes that the current figure is 33 percent. We rate Duffy’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/aug/04/sean-duffy/nearly-half-counties-have-no-providers-or-one-heal/

Are there over $4 trillion of untaxed corporate earnings offshore, as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump said U.S. companies have anywhere from $4 trillion to $5 trillion in offshore accounts — a substantial increase from just last year. Trump blamed the large sum of money on what he (inaccurately) considers the highest tax rate in the world in a July 25 Wall Street Journal interview obtained by Politico. ""We’re the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size,"" Trump said. ""But we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. We have — nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion … I guess it’s $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, it’s a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore."" We’ve already rated Trump’s previous claims that we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world False. This time we took a look at the amount of U.S. money sitting in offshore accounts. How much untaxed foreign revenue is out there, and could the figure have doubled since Trump cited the $2.5 trillion figure during the 2016 campaign? The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. We’ll start off by saying there is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas, as there is no law requiring they be reported. Researchers can instead look at the indefinitely reinvested earnings on financial statements of publicly traded companies. Indefinitely invested earnings aren’t making their way back to the United States anytime soon, which lets them off the hook for taxes and thus fatten after-tax profits. They might go to overseas factories, prospective acquisitions or other investments. Other companies may instead take on a deferred liability, which entails a future tax bill -- but while currently untaxed, most go undisclosed, so they aren’t counted in the researchers’ figures. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation can provide a fuller picture, because the committee has access to total untaxed foreign earnings. However, that information is only turned over to members of Congress. The last time the committee made its findings public was in an August 2016 memo to two congressmen. In 2012, the committee said, $2.3 trillion of foreign earnings went untaxed. Using predictive models, they estimated the number at $2.6 trillion for 2015. The committee cited Audit Analytics, a third-party research service, to corroborate these findings. Audit Analytics found $2.4 trillion in indefinitely reinvested earnings. There was a $200 billion difference between the JCT’s estimate of untaxed foreign earnings and Audit Analytics’ calculation of indefinitely reinvested ones, which is what experts estimate the current discrepancy to be. Audit Analytics ran its latest numbers for us. The company found $2.8 trillion of indefinitely reinvested earnings are sitting overseas, as of July 2017 — far short of what Trump described. ""It is possible that analysts are still working on entering information from small companies, but it would not change the number from the rounded-off figure of 2.8 trillion,"" Audit Analytics research director Don Whalen said. We also turned to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which found that Fortune 500 companies — a slightly smaller pool — report $2.6 trillion offshore. ITEP included total untaxed earnings, not just indefinitely reinvested ones, in their studies of Apple and Pfizer, as these companies provide a disclosure allowing for a fuller estimate of their untaxed offshore income and generate a significant amount of earnings through this mechanism. ""There is no reason to believe that this figure is substantially higher than what companies report and certainly not double the reported amount as President Donald Trump has contended without citing any source,"" said Taxation and Economic Policy senior policy analyst Richard Phillips. So what else could cause the discrepancy? Edward Kleinbard, the Robert C. Packard Trustee Chair in Law at the USC's Gould School of Law, said that firms double down their offshore tax planning when they expect a tax holiday, which is when they get to bring back offshore earnings while paying little to no taxes on them. ""It’s plausible that people have accelerated their gamesmanship in the anticipation that in tax reform there will be another tax holiday,"" Kleinbard said. ""But it’s not plausible to think the number could be as high as the 2 trillion-dollar difference between the data and what the president said."" Another possibility is for Trump to have counted tax inversions, which is when a small foreign company in a lower taxed country acquires a larger U.S. company and thus reduces their taxes. But that would entail a change in the definition of untaxed revenue. And even if we were to make that calculation, Kleinbard said the number wouldn’t expand by so much in such a short time span. Trump described untaxed corporate earnings in overseas accounts as growing monumentally, from around $2.5 trillion to ""anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore."" The highest reported number of offshore earnings is $2.8 trillion. That could be off by a couple hundred billion dollars due to undisclosed untaxed earnings. But experts agreed the discrepancy could not add up to Trump’s $4 trillion or $5 trillion estimate. Business optimism and altered definitions of untaxed revenue couldn’t bridge that gap either.

"['Immigration', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Crime', ""The 2018 California Governor's Race"", 'California', 'Antonio  Villaraigosa']","
MOSTLY TRUE: Undocumented immigrants less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens
","Candidate for California governor Antonio Villaraigosa jumped into the nation’s heated debate on immigration reform during a recent interview on MSNBC. The Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor rejected the idea that deporting undocumented immigrants was a sound strategy for reducing crime. His statement followed President Trump’s speech about combatting MS-13 gang members. The gang started in poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It’s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000. Trump campaigned on the promise to deport millions of undocumented residents, often describing them as threats to public safety. Here’s what Villaraigosa said on July 31, 2017 on MSNBC. ""I think we all agree that people that commit violent crimes ought to be deported. But going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy, when you look at the fact that the National Academy of Sciences in, I think it was November of 2015, the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born. That’s just a fact."" Watch the interview here.  We decided to examine this last point as part of our Tracking The Truth series, which fact-checks claims in the 2018 California governor's race. We interpreted Villaraigosa’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born. But we wondered whether this was really a settled matter. We set out on a fact check. Our research We started by checking out the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study Villaraigosa cited. It found: ""Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates."" The study added that ""This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men."" It continued: ""Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy."" The academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government. Findings in a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support Villaraigosa's statement: ""Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented."" The Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States.  To examine Villaraigosa's claim, we also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants ""are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic."" PolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed. PolitiFact’s findings PolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population. Looking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California. The American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are ""significantly lower"" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma. Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said. Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. ""They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,"" he told PolitiFact. ""This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."" Crime trends PolitiFact also noted that as the immigrant population has increased, crime has gone down, citing Ewing’s report. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, the violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data. Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens. ""The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research,"" Bersani said. According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations). ""This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population,"" Bersani said. Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available. More research needed? The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime ""remains confused"" due to lack of data and contrary information. Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said. As PolitiFact reported in 2015, there isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated. PolitiFact California spoke about this critique with Ewing of the American Immigration Council, whose research supports Villaraigosa’s claim. He said he’s confident in the work that’s been done and said critics have used anecdotes, rather than full-blown research, to try to make their points. Ewing added that the studies backing up Villaraigosa’s statement are ""from such a wide range of researchers using so many different methodologies and sources of data -- not everyone can be wrong."" Our ruling Villaraigosa said ""undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born."" He cited a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences that backs up this claim. In a fact check last year, PolitiFact rated a similar claim Mostly True. It cited additional studies by scholars and partisan groups that show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born. It also found that researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime. It said this was a needed clarification.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Greg Abbott says more Texans have jobs than ever before
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott drew cheers from supporters in San Antonio as he vowed to keep the Texas economy rocking and laid a claim to history. The Republican governor, kicking off his re-election campaign, said in July 2017: ""And since I took office, in just the last two and a half years, in Texas, we’ve added more than 450,000 new jobs. More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state."" That jobs-gained number sounded a little low. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures we drew from a bureau economist, Cheryl Abbot, when Abbott took office in January 2015, the state was home to nearly 11.8 million non-farm jobs. As of June 2017, that count was up by about 507,500, exceeding 12.3 million. We decided to check whether more Texas residents have jobs than ever before. Abbott’s campaign didn’t answer requests for the basis of the claim. Meantime, economists concurred that according to bureau figures drawing on U.S. Census Bureau surveys, more than 12.8 million Texas residents had jobs from April 2017 through June 2017--with the April 2017 count of 12,872,506 employed people setting a record, though the tally subsequently slid marginally, reaching 12,848,980 in June 2017. A bureau-provided chart shows the dip in employment after that count had mostly steadily increased since January 2015: SOURCE: Chart showing Texas Local Area Unemployment Statistics, BLS (received by email from Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, BLS, July 21, 2017) The economists we queried noted that because Texas continues to grow in population, it makes sense, barring economic disaster, that you’d see more people having jobs year after year. ""Status quo in Texas,"" Mark J. Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint, told us by email, ""it’s always had steady job growth."" Perry passed along a chart showing the nearly uniform annual upticks in employed Texas since 1939: SOURCE: Chart based on data posted by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (provided by email from Mark J. Perry, Ph.D., scholar at The American Enterprise Institute, professor of Finance and Business Economics, School of Management, University of Michigan-Flint, July 28, 2017) So, Abbott was mostly right about the record count of Texans with jobs at the time he spoke. Jobless rate, employment-population ratio Other indicators provide context, however. For instance, the month before Abbott kicked off his re-election effort, the state’s unemployment rate of 4.6 percent--as in the share of able workers unsuccessfully seeking employment--was not a record low. We counted 59 months since 1976 when the Texas jobless rate was lower, per an Abbot-provided chart. Also, a ratio that compares the number of people with jobs to the population as a whole was higher for Texas and other states in the 1990s, a facet explored by PolitiFact in Washington in July 2016. That story also noted that nationally since the end of the Great Recession, the U.S. employment-to-population ratio had climbed, slowly but fairly steadily. When we asked, Abbot shared bureau figures rooted in Census Bureau survey findings to represent changes in the Texas employment-population ratio. Similarly, economist Tara Sinclair, an associate professor at George Washington University, drew on bureau figures showing that the state’s employment-population ratio exceeded 65 percent from 1995 through 2000 but fell to 61.5 percent in 2014 and to to 60.9 percent and 60.7 percent, respectively, in 2015 and 2016. In the latter year, the bureau says, that ratio reflected 12,671,801 Texans with jobs out of 20,861,611 residents. By email, Sinclair wrote that similar ""to the national pattern for the employment-population ratio, Texas is still low relative to its historical peak (although doing a bit better than the national ratio).""  SOURCE: Chart drawing on BLS annual data for Texas (received by email from Tara Sinclair, associate professor of Economics and International Affairs, Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, George Washington University, July 21, 2017) Our ruling Abbott said: ""More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state."" By raw numbers, the more than 12.87 million employed Texans in April 2017 set a record though that count had dipped to 12.85 million by the time Abbott spoke. Also, the state’s June 2017 jobless rate, 4.6 percent, exceeded the rate in more than 50 months since 1976 while Texas in 2016 (like the nation) had an employment-population ratio trailing what it used to be.

A July 28, 2017, post on NewsBreaksHere.com said a 53-year-old Manhattan chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife had jumped out of a high-rise window together, leaving a note that read, ""We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care."" The post noted that the suicide came ""just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare,"" but that three members of the GOP had voted no, defeating the measure and keeping the Affordable Care Act in place. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. There was a double suicide in midtown Manhattan on July 28, according to the New York Post. Glenn Scarpelli and Patricia Colant jumped from the ninth floor of the building where they worked, leaving behind a 19-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter. The husband and wife also did leave a note, which read, ""We had a wonderful life."" But the couple was deeply in debt. The New York Post reported a lien showed they had owed more than $23,000 in federal taxes, and as of April 2015 they had more than $232,000 in debt. Scarpelli had faced legal action in 2013 for not paying back a $60,000 student loan. The ""financial spiral"" in which they were trapped was too much for the couple, who elected to jump to their deaths, the Post reported. There was no mention of medical costs, or health insurance premiums, or anything else related to the Affordable Care Act. So where did all these posts mentioning health care costs come from? Initial versions of the New York Post’s story apparently cited a law enforcement source that said there was a second note at the scene. That note reportedly read, ""We both have medical issues, we just can't afford the health care."" Later versions of the story corrected that assertion, saying a New York Police Department spokesman refuted that detail, and that there was no mention of health care costs in the couple’s sole suicide note. Several posts on different websites cited a version of the story from the U.K.’s Daily Mail, which appears to have included the same details and also was updated. Neither story indicates what was changed in the text during the subsequent updates. Using an uncorrected and incomplete version of the story led those posts to highlight the erroneous assertion that medical expenses, whether through high insurance premiums or procedural costs, drove the couple to suicide.

Multiple blog posts said that the couple committed suicide because of unaffordable medical costs.

GOP Sen. David Perdue blames Obamacare for leaving behind 300,000 Georgians
","Chalk up Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., as someone who was unhappy about the Senate’s failure to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. After the Senate fell one vote short of overturning key elements of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, Perdue offered a statement, reprinted here in part: ""Throughout this entire process, we have witnessed everything that’s wrong with Washington. The Senate had a real opportunity to dismantle the most damaging parts of Obamacare. As Republicans have railed against the failures of Obamacare for the last seven years, Democrats have failed to acknowledge any shortcomings of Obamacare and refused to try to fix a broken system. ""Now, due to an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self-interests ahead of national interest, Obamacare remains the law of the land. This means that the poorest among us will continue to be fined because they can’t afford Obamacare. This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised. Additionally, this means the Medicaid expansion will continue as an open-ended government program that cannot be sustained."" We wondered whether Perdue was right that the failure to pass the repeal bill means that ""more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised."" Perdue’s office told PolitiFact that he correctly stated that even with Obamacare in place, 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line can’t get insurance. The data we found showed that to be the case. However, in decrying the demise of the GOP bills, Perdue glosses over the fact that independent experts say the Republican replacement bills would not have solved this problem; in fact, they would have made it worse. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 309,000 people in Georgia are in the ""coverage gap"" -- a no-man’s-land where their income puts them above current Medicaid eligibility for their state but below the lower limit for premium tax credits for plans purchased on the ACA’s online marketplaces. The House and Senate bills would have addressed this, but only in a limited way. ""Both the House and Senate bill would have offered these individuals tax credits,"" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the RAND Corp. But while these tax credits are ""arguably better than nothing,"" Eibner said, it’s not really a viable policy solution for insuring hundreds of thousands of additional Georgians. That’s because the policies available would have such large deductibles that they’d either offer little protection from health care costs or scare off customers from buying a plan in the first place. While the tax credits in the Senate bill would have required relatively small premiums for those in poverty, the independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that the deductible for a typical plan under the Senate bill would be $6,000, likely making it ""unaffordable for a person with income under the poverty level,"" Eibner said. And for the House bill, Eibner said, the CBO estimated that a low-income older person ""could face net premiums in the range of $13,600 to $16,100, even after accounting the tax credits available."" Such realities played into the CBO’s conclusion that the Senate bill nationally would leave 22 million fewer Americans insured by 2026 than if current law continued. The CBO’s estimate for the House bill was 23 million fewer Americans insured. As for Georgia specifically, the Senate bill would have increased the number of uninsured Georgians by 376,000 in 2022, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. For the House bill, the Urban Institute projected an additional 304,000 uninsured Georgians in 2022. Bottom line: Those Georgians might have ""access"" to policies, as Purdue put it, but that’s a far cry from actually getting insurance, much less adequate insurance. The reality, independent experts say, is that the coverage they’d have access to doesn’t offer out-of-pocket costs that are affordable enough to get many new people on the insurance rolls. In fact, any of the repeal-and-replace proposals would have decreased the number of people with insurance substantially compared to current law. There’s another problem: Georgia turned down an opportunity under the Affordable Care Act to expand Georgia’s eligibility for Medicaid. The state would have had to pick up about 10 percent of the bill, with the federal government paying about 90 percent. The most recent analysis by the Urban Institute found that Medicaid expansion in Georgia -- which is still on the table if the GOP-led state wanted to accept it -- would reduce the number of uninsured Georgians by between 460,000 and 556,000 people in 2021. In other words, the state could have covered even more low-income Georgians than Perdue’s 300,000 by expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. (And, as we noted above, it’s unlikely that the Republican bills would have covered those 300,000.) ""To blame the ACA for the state government of Georgia’s decision not to expand Medicaid eligibility is a tremendous distortion,"" said Urban Institute health policy specialist Linda Blumberg. Perdue said that because of the failure to pass a repeal bill, ""Obamacare remains the law of the land ... This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised."" Perdue has a point: Even with Obamacare in place, 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line can’t get insurance. However, in the context of decrying the failure of the Republican bills to advance in Congress, this observation is misleading. While the Senate and House bills would have offered tax credits to low-income Americans, independent analysts agree that these tax credits wouldn’t open the door to affordable insurance for low-income Americans. Perdue’s criticism of Obamacare is also problematic. In reality, the ACA’s Medicaid expansion could have covered even more than 300,000 low-income Georgians had it not been rejected by Perdue’s fellow Republicans in Georgia.

Ashley Smith, who posed with Greg Abbott, says transgender Americans make up 1-in-300 residents
","A San Antonio activist tried to make a point about the proposed Texas law affecting bathroom access in public schools and other buildings simply by posing with a presumed leading supporter of the legislation, Gov. Greg Abbott. The photo from Abbott’s July 14, 2017, re-election kickoff rally in the Alamo City shows Abbott grinning next to ""Trans-Woman"" Ashley Smith. Smith added this comment in a post below the photo placed the next day on her Facebook page: ""How will the Potty Police know I'm transgender if the Governor doesn't?"" That post went viral though Smith later got our attention when she described the prevalence of Americans who are transgender, telling Chris Quinn of the San Antonio Express-News: ""We're about 1-in-300 people, we're all over the place, we're your friends and your neighbors. Some of us are not immediately obvious as trans. And the idea that you are going to be able to enforce a bathroom bill, I mean the enforceability is just not there."" We asked Smith the basis of her 1-in-300 figure. She pointed by email to a report finding that nationally, about 1.4 million residents were ""trans,"" Smith said, ""which if my math is right, would make us 1 in every 231 people."" The June 2016 report, ""How Many Adults Identify as Transgender in the United States?."" was issued by the Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law think tank that says it advances sexual orientation law and public policy through independent research. The authors, making statistical adjustments to Centers for Disease Control 2014 phone survey results, estimated that 0.6 percent of U.S. adults ""identify as transgender."" The report went on: ""This figure is double the estimate that utilized data from roughly a decade ago and implies that an estimated 1.4 million adults in the U.S. identify as transgender."" In 2011, an institute researcher, Gary Gates, had estimated based partly on surveys taken in Massachusetts and California that 0.3 percent of U.S. adults identified as transgender. The U. S. Census Bureau hasn’t estimated the number of Americans identifying as transgender. But we turned to its population estimates to gauge the institute’s latest figures. As of July 2014, the bureau says, the U.S. was home to 318,563,456 residents including 244,986,302 adults. Applying the institute’s estimate that 0.6 percent of adults identify as transgender delivers a subtotal of 1,469,917 adults. Summing up, the institute estimated that 1.8-in-300 U.S. adults identify as transgender. Minors identifying as transgender? For an estimate of younger Americans identifying as transgender, Smith told us, she relied on a January 2017 institute report similarly starting from federal surveys. That report says researchers estimate that 0.7 percent of U.S. minors aged 13 to 17, tallied at about 150,000 people, are transgender--which breaks out to about 2.1-in-300 individuals in the age group. The 2017 report includes a chart estimating transgender residents by age groups:            SOURCE: Report, ""Age of Individuals Who Identify As Transgender in the United States,"" the Williams Institute, January 2017 (accessed July 26-27, 2017) At Smith’s urging, we also queried the policy counsel of the National Center for Transgender Equality, which says it’s the ""nation’s leading social justice advocacy organization winning life-saving change for transgender people."" By email, Ma’ayan Anafi replied that the center considers the 2016 institute estimate to be the most reliable available estimate of the U.S. transgender population. Anafi similarly noted the institute’s estimate for people aged 13-17, adding: ""Currently, there is no comprehensive national estimate for the number of transgender people under the age of 13."" A Williams Institute researcher Next, we heard back from Andrew Flores, a visiting scholar at the institute involved and familiar with its reports. Flores said that while the research estimates were not independently peer-reviewed prior to publication, both are under consideration by an academic peer-reviewed journal. ""We have not seen a methodological challenge or rebuttal,"" Flores wrote. Also, he said, ""we have seen other estimates proposed using the same or similar data."" In that vein, Flores provided a web link to the abstract of a study published in the February 2017 American Journal of Public Health containing an extrapolation based on 12 U.S. population surveys taken from 2007 to 2015. Its authors estimated that as of 2016, 390 U.S. adults per 100,000, or almost 1 million adults, identified as transgender. That breaks out to 1.17-in-300 adults. ""This estimate,"" they wrote, ""may be more indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50% of the respondents in our analysis."" State estimates by institute We saw that the 2016 institute report had state-by-state estimates of adults identifying as transgender, ranging from 0.3 percent in North Dakota to 0.8 percent in Hawaii--and 0.66 percent in Texas, or 125,350 residents, the report said. The report specified that its estimates were rooted in data from 19 states that opted in to asking participants in the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2014: ""Do you consider yourself to be transgender?"" If someone answered affirmatively, he or she was asked: ""Do you consider yourself to be male-to-female, female-to-male, or gender non-conforming?"" In total, the report says, 0.52 percent of respondents in the 19 states identified as transgender. According to the report, if a respondent asked for a definition of transgender, the person  seeking responses was to reply: ""Some people describe themselves as transgender when they experience a different gender identify from their sex at birth. For example, a person born into a male body, but who feels female or who lives as a woman would be transgender. Some transgender people change their physical appearance so that it matches their internal gender identity. Some transgender people take hormones and some have surgery. A transgender person may be of any sexual orientation -- straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual."" We asked Flores why the institute reached the 0.66 percentage for the nation when responses to the survey question in the 19 states--Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming--supported a lower 0.52 percent result. Flores replied: ""While our underlying dataset only contains 19 states, we wanted to make inferences about every state. We did this by running a model that included all respondents, even those who did not get asked about whether or not they identified as transgender. We then used the model results to impute or fill-in whether an individual would identify as transgender considering their state and demographic profile. Finally, we used these results and generalized them to population statistics provided by the Census Bureau. ""The reason why the (19-state) survey estimate is lower than the resultant national estimate,"" Flores wrote,  ""is mostly due to the demographic composition of the remaining states. As we noted, people of color and younger individuals are more likely to identify as transgender. If a state that was not one of those 19 contains more younger individuals or populations of color, then that would mean then national estimate would be larger as a result."" Texas state demographer Next, we asked Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, to review the institute’s 2016 report. Potter said  by email that his read suggests that from 0.36 percent to 0.95 percent of the population identifies as transgender, so 1-in-300, or 0.3 percent, ""is a little low,"" he said. Potter explained that institute researchers applied characteristics including race and ethnicity, age cohorts and educational attainment provided by individuals who responded affirmatively to the CDC survey question to produce its estimates of adults in each state who may identify as transgender, with all of the state estimates aggregated to a U.S. estimate.. Potter went on: ""It is likely that there is under-reporting among those who do identify as transgender in those 19 states which would suggest the estimate is on the low end."" Our ruling Smith said transgender residents make up ""about 1-in-300 people, we're all over the place, we're your friends and your neighbors."" There’s no direct national count of individuals identifying as transgender but recent analyses rooted in federal survey results support estimates of 1.8-in-300 adults and 2.1-in-300 minors.

Internet post misleads by saying witness will testify specifically against Hillary Clinton
","A story online that says a witness will speak out against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of a larger investigation into her actions is a muddled mix of real developments misleadingly retold. ""Breaking: A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton,"" read the headline on a July 30, 2017, post on CoffeeBreakForYou.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The post said that Clinton would be ""held accountable for the many wrongdoings she has been charged with,"" although it never specifies what those charges may be. It said President Donald Trump had tasked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Clinton’s ties to Russia. That’s where the ""key witness"" comes in. ""Glenn Simpson has been friends with the Clinton family for many years,"" the post read. ""Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels."" The CoffeeBreakForYou.com article said the Senate Judiciary Committee had subpoenaed Simpson. The post asked readers whether they thought Simpson ""will share crucial information about how Hillary attempted to frame Donald Trump."" The story appears to have originated as a July 30 post on Conservative101.com. The byline on the post was Christopher Reynolds. We attempted to reach Conservative101.com through the website’s contact form (the only method of contact available) but didn’t get a response. The story isn't fake in the sense that it makes up all its content, but it does spin things to the point of being misleading or incorrect. The most notable issues are whether Clinton is really being investigated, and for what reasons the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to talk to Simpson. Trump has publicly criticized Sessions for failing to investigate Clinton for deleting emails from her private server and for allegedly getting information from Ukraine during her presidential campaign. The Justice Department has not publicly acknowledged an investigation into Clinton, although the Senate Judiciary Committee has demanded the agency disclose if it’s investigating the Ukrainian allegations. The Justice Department has until Aug. 3 to respond. House Republicans have requested FBI documents into the campaign investigation and have asked for a special counsel for a Clinton probe. The Senate committee has been looking into the extent of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Simpson is a real person. He is a former journalist who is a founding partner of opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Simpson was initially being subpoenaed for a hearing, but not explicitly to expose Clinton. The committee wanted to compel him to discuss details of his company’s Trump dossier, which became public in January 2017. Simpson wanted to protect the Democratic-leaning client who hired Fusion GPS to create the Trump dossier, according to the Daily Beast. Simpson had originally intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, but struck a deal in which he would provide a transcribed interview. The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed and withdrew its subpoena. We couldn’t find any proof that Simpson was ""friends with the Clinton family,"" although the New York Post reported that Fusion GPS was ""actually an opposition-research group for Democrats, and the founders, who are more political activists than journalists, have a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda."" But trying to protect the identity of a Clinton ally who paid for opposition research against Trump is not the same as testifying against Clinton. In addition to the Trump opposition report, Fusion GPS also had reportedly worked to ease sanctions against Russia, through ties with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. She’s the same lawyer Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had met in a controversial and previously undisclosed 2016 meeting. Bloggers said, ""A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton."" The post used details from several real news events in a way that would lead readers to draw some unproven conclusions. The article said that a founding partner in an opposition research firm was being called to testify against Clinton. Simpson was being asked to discuss details about a dossier filled with unsavory (and largely unsubstantiated) details about Trump as part of an investigation into Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election.

False: Trump's claim about illegal immigration under past administrations
","President Donald Trump, in a speech about the brutality of MS-13 gang members and his administration’s resolve to deport criminal immigrants, claimed it wasn’t until he came along that border crossings went down. ""You know, the border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing. Down 78 percent,"" Trump said in New York on July 28. ""And, in fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a big favor -- believe me. They get very little traffic in there anymore, because they know they're not going to get through the border to the United States. So that whole group has been incredible, led by General (John) Kelly."" Trump congratulated Kelly for doing ""an incredible job"" as secretary of Homeland Security, and at a July 31 Cabinet meeting — the first for Kelly as Trump's new chief of staff — reiterated his pride for reductions in illegal immigration. ""As you know, the border was a tremendous problem, and they’re close to 80 percent stoppage.  And even the president of Mexico called me — they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they’re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment,"" Trump said. Based on past statements Trump has made, his remarks that ""the border is down 78 percent"" refer to apprehensions of immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. But calculations of different time periods do not show a 78 percent decline. The claim that under past administrations apprehensions did not go down is not accurate. Trump uses different timeframes to make a case that illegal immigration is down. He has looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there’s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016, to say it’s gone down 61 percent; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February. Where does the 78 percent come from? We asked the White House but did not get a response. From June 2016 to June 2017, apprehensions at the southwest border went down 53 percent. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data also show that from November to June (latest available figures), apprehensions by border patrol agents declined about 66 percent. From January to June, it declined 49 percent. From Trump’s first full month in office, February, to June, it went down 14 percent. And though they remain low,  the number of apprehensions actually picked up in May and in June. As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted, Trump’s claim of apprehensions nearing 80 percent is clearer when comparing cherry-picked figures: the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76.4 percent decline. Trump also claimed, ""Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing."" In fact, apprehensions have gone down under past administrations. Unauthorized immigration also fell dramatically during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. Analyses of monthly and annual apprehension statistics show declines for both Bush and Obama’s administrations. ""No matter how you look at it, Trump is far from the first U.S. president to preside over big drops in unauthorized immigration,"" Wilson said. Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions – about 1.2 million more than in 2016. The decline hasn’t been as steady, however, as there have been increases and decreases over the years. During the 1980s, there was an annual average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000. FactCheck.org also pointed out that apprehensions declined 75 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2016. Referring to border apprehensions, Trump said, ""The border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up."" Calculations of the latest figures available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection do not show a 78 percent decline in apprehensions. The closest number to that would be based on cherry-picked numbers of the highest number of apprehensions in November to the lowest number, in April. Though there have been fluctuations over the years in the number of apprehensions, they certainly have gone down under past administrations.

Abbott's tweet further pointed to a Uconservative.net web post from that day headlined: ""Cowboys Jerry Jones to Players: ‘Stand For the Anthem or You’re Off the Team.’"" Yet the site’s story, we noticed, doesn’t quote Jones making that statement to players other than to fold in a person’s unsourced July 27, 2017, tweet quoting Jones saying so. So, did Jones tell players to stand up or pack up? According to a September 2016 news blog post by the Dallas Morning News, Jones at the times expressed displeasure about Colin Kaepernick, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, not standing for the playing of the anthem. Kaepernick said he wasn't standing to protest social inequality; he ultimately kneeled for the anthem through the team’s 16 regular-season games after sitting through the anthem during some pre-season games. ESPN reported in March 2017 that Kaepernick, no longer a 49er, intended to stand for the anthem in the 2017 season. The 2016 Morning News story noted that every Cowboys player had stood for the anthem at the team’s season opener that week. It didn't quote Jones telling players anything. From the story: ""I got to give a big pat on the back to our entire team, our coaching staff, our entire organization,"" Jones said Tuesday morning on 105.3 The Fan's Shan and RJ show [KRLD-FM]. ""We strongly, strongly support the flag.

For anybody to use parts of that visibility to do otherwise is really disappointing."" After Abbott posted his August 2017 tweet, the Dallas newspaper both took note of the Uconservative web post and pointed out that its reporters previously found no basis to reports of Jones saying he’d fire any player who didn’t stand for the anthem. On Oct. 7, 2016, the paper reported that Jones ""never made those or other alleged comments and the episode as described never happened.""

Have the number of complaints against police dropped under Mayor Kriseman's police chief?
","Rick Baker won’t definitively say whether he would retain police chief Anthony Holloway if the former St. Petersburg mayor wins a third term at city hall. Mayor Rick Kriseman has been working to show voters he made the right choice in hiring Holloway in 2014, bragging about Holloway’s achievements and warning that it could disappear if Baker wins the election. Kriseman said Holloway has helped improve community-police relationships in the city. ""The number of complaints against police officers has decreased from an average when Mr. Baker was mayor from 78 to 14,"" Kriseman said at the July 25 debate hosted by the Tampa Bay Times and Bay News 9. We wanted to know if complaints dropped by that much, and why. Kriseman’s evidence comes from the police department’s Office of Professional Standards, which investigates complaints and criminal misconduct. The complaints are broken down into citizen-initiated and department-initiated complaints. The figures Kriseman cites are accurate for the number of citizen-initiated complaints. The average number of department-initiated complaints also fell from Baker to Kriseman, from 76 to 39.  Citizen-initiated complaints have — for the most part — been dropping since the beginning of 2001. They average number also decreased during the four-year term of Baker's successor, Mayor Bill Foster. From January 2010 to January 2014, the average number of citizen-initiated complaints was 41.  Asked to explain the drop, the police department credited increased communication between residents and police. ""People understand what we do and why we do it, and our sergeants and frontline supervisors have become more accustomed to explaining why things are done a certain way,"" said Maj. Tim Brockman, who has been the Office of Professional Standards commander for two years and with the department for over two decades. Concerns or inquiries are sometimes handled by police before a formal complaint is filed, he added. Holloway has made several moves to implement a community policing philosophy, a Kriseman campaign pledge. Holloway has encouraged officers to leave their cruisers and talk to residents, building relationships with the people the police are serving. In 2014, the department started a Park, Walk and Talks program that requires all uniformed officers to walk a patrol area at least an hour a week. Police spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez said the department has 384 uniformed officers and in the most recent three months of 2017 (April, May and June), there were 5,809 logged walks. From the 1990s until 2006, the department's approach was different: More than 40 officers were each committed to a particular neighborhood. However, former police chief Chuck Harmon, who held the job from 2001 to 2014, said he stopped that initiative amid complaints from the department. ""One of the things that I found is that community officers were engaging with just a handful of people, and those people were demanding most of their time,"" Harmon said. Harmon also said he became police chief at ""tough time"" when relationships between the police and community were strained. Before Harmon was hired, Baker had selected Mack Vines to serve as police chief. Vines was fired by Baker after he used the term ""orangutan"" to describe the actions of a black suspect's resistance. Finally, we'll note that law enforcement agencies don't record complaints the same way, making it difficult to compare St. Petersburg's practices to other jurisdictions. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office takes a very broad look at complaints. Any person who calls in, writes a letter or emails with a concern is counted in the data provided by the department. In 2016, 64 members were investigated by a commander within their department and 44 members were investigated by the administrative division.  St. Petersburg police included investigations by the department and the Office of Professional Standards — which does not include some of the call-ins that were determined to not be a complaint.  Kriseman said, ""The number of complaints against police officers has decreased on an average when Mr. Baker was mayor from 78 to 14."" Those numbers check out for citizen-initiated complaints. The city attributes the decline to increased communication with the community and the police, among other factors. It’s worth noting that citizen-initiated complaints for the most part have been declining for the past decade-plus, which might not be apparent in Kriseman's wording. Kriseman’s claim is accurate but needs additional information. For that reason, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/02/rick-kriseman/have-number-complaints-against-police-dropped-unde/

Charlie Rangel says last president to seek congressional permission for war was FDR
","
During an April 4, 2011, interview with the Fox Business network, Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., discussed the recent U.S. intervention in Libya with host Andrew Napolitano.

Napolitano introduced Rangel to viewers as ""an intellectually honest, progressive member of Congress who believes that we have not followed the law and the moral rules of engagement in Libya.""

During the interview, Napolitano asked Rangel, ""Have you received a request from the president for authorization to use the military? Have you received a request for the president to bring about regime change? Have you received a request from the president for a declaration of war in Libya?""

Rangel replied, ""No. It is true that he did send his Cabinet to brief us as to the reasoning that he made it, but you know, it's three things, the Constitution, the constitution, the constitution. And ever since Franklin Roosevelt, the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war, what I really don't understand … is that when you talk about -- you use the word put our young people in harm's way, what a sacrifice.""

Was Franklin Roosevelt really the ""last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war""?

The answer is -- sort of.

First, some background on presidential and congressional war powers.
   
The Constitution (Article I, Section 8) assigns the right to declare war to Congress. But the last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II, when Roosevelt was president.

Since then, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions.

Most controversially, in August 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Congress to back his effort to widen the U.S. role in Vietnam. He received it with enactment of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which passed both chambers of Congress, including the Senate with only two dissenting votes.

As the Vietnam War turned sour, lawmakers became increasingly frustrated at their seemingly secondary role in sending of U.S. troops abroad. So in 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution required that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise.

Since its enactment, the War Powers Resolution has triggered consultations and official communications about foreign interventions more than 100 times, according to the Congressional Research Service. (All of them occurred while Rangel was a Member of Congress.)

We’ve pored over the full list and have whittled it down to a half-dozen examples in which presidents have actively sought legislative support -- rather than just informing lawmakers of a military fait-accompli. In several cases, votes were held and authorizing resolutions were passed.

President Gerald Ford: On April 10, 1975, three weeks before the fall of Saigon, Ford asked Congress, in the words of the CRS,  ""to clarify its limitation on the use of forces in Vietnam to insure evacuation of U.S. citizens and to cover some Vietnamese nationals, but legislation to this effect was not completed."" Ford went ahead and used helicopters, Marines and fighter aircraft to evacuate U.S. citizens and others from South Vietnam.

President Ronald Reagan: Shortly before the expected signing of an agreement initiating a peacekeeping force to oversee the Israeli handover of the the Sinai to Egypt, Reagan asked for congressional authorization for the U.S. military to take part. Congress passed such a resolution, and Reagan signed it on Dec. 29, 1981.

Two years later, with U.S. Marines participating in a multinational force in Lebanon, Congress passed a resolution, signed by Reagan on Oct. 12, 1983, that authorized forces to remain for 18 months. Less than two weeks later, a pair of trucks packed with explosives rammed into a barracks compound in Beirut, killing 241 American service members and 58 others. The suicide attack prompted Reagan to withdraw U.S. forces.

President George H.W. Bush: After Iraq’s Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, Bush ordered troops to the region to protect Kuwait’s neighbors and prepare for a possible counterattack against Hussein. After pressure from lawmakers who wanted a voice in the military buildup, Bush, in a Jan. 8, 1991, letter, requested support from Congress to act -- militarily if necessary -- to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions related to the conflict. The resolution would not be an official declaration of war but rather an ""authorization for use of military force."" Both chambers passed the resolution on Jan. 12, 1991, and the U.S. and its allies began an offensive less than a week later.

President Bill Clinton: Amid a a civil war and humanitarian crisis in Somalia, Bush sent forces to the east African nation in late 1992 in advance of a U.N. deployment. Shortly after Bush left office, his successor, Clinton, set about securing congressional backing for the mission. The Senate passed a resolution on Feb. 4, 1993, and the House followed on May 25, 1993. But the two resolutions were different, and they were never passed by both chambers in reconciled form. After a difficult deployment, Clinton withdrew U.S. troops by March 1994.

President George W. Bush: Within a week after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Bush secured an Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution that provided support for, among other things, U.S. entry into Afghanistan, where al-Qaida terrorists had set up bases. The resolution said that ""the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons."" Attacks on Afghanistan commenced within weeks of enactment.

Bush’s second, and more controversial, Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution was passed in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which aimed to oust Hussein from power. Enacted Oct. 16, 2002, the resolution authorized the president to ""use the armed forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to (1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq."" The invasion began in March 2003.

All told, then, at least six of the 12 presidents since Franklin Roosevelt have come to Congress to seek support for military actions. So how does this square with Rangel’s comment?

A Rangel spokeswoman told PolitiFact that ""the congressman's argument is that presidents have the constitutional obligation to seek congressional authorization before engaging our country in a military conflict, not through resolutions afterward. The last official war declared by Congress was World War II. Subsequent conflicts were initiated by the executive branch.""

But we see the evidence as more mixed.

• Rangel is correct that no president has sought a formal declaration of war since Roosevelt. 
• Each president has been careful about the phrasing of his request to Congress. Even as presidents ask for Congress’ support -- something seen as politically useful, even necessary -- they always take pains to note that they are doing so voluntarily, without ceding any presidential prerogatives. So when Rangel says that ""Franklin Roosevelt (was) the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission"" to go to war, he has a point. No president since Roosevelt has come to seek ""permission"" from Congress for military action. However, presidents have repeatedly come to Congress to seek ""support"" for military action.

• What is the definition of ""war""? Of the seven post-War Powers Resolution examples listed above, one came at the end of a genuine war (the fall of Saigon) and three involved more limited peacekeeping or humanitarian missions (Sinai, Lebanon and Somalia). None of these would be solid examples of a president seeking congressional backing to engage in ""war"" by its strictest definition.

However, we think most people would consider the other three cases -- the Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq -- genuine wars. And in each of those cases, the president sought congressional support (reluctantly or otherwise) before initiating hostilities and ultimately received it (with varying degrees of unanimity).

So where does this leave us? Rangel is right that Roosevelt is the last president, strictly speaking, ""to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war."" But at least two presidents -- both George Bushes -- have waited to launch wars until they had an official vote from Congress backing them up. On balance, we rate Rangel’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/05/charles-rangel/charlie-rangel-says-last-president-seek-congressio/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Bob Graham']","
In column, Bob Graham scolds Legislature for university funding cuts
","
Former Democratic governor and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham is taking to the editorial pages of Florida's newspapers to warn against a slow march by the Republican-dominated Legislature against the state's core values.

In an opinion column that appeared in the St. Petersburg Times on April 3, 2011, Graham openly questioned whether the Legislature's decision over the past decade to reduce taxes has produced the high-quality jobs the tax cuts promised, and whether the Legislature is backing away from a commitment to preserve the Florida Everglades.

He also took on the Legislature when it comes to how the state funds its university system. In doing so, he provided a claim that piqued our interest. He wrote:

""Since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000,"" Graham wrote. ""These savage cuts to education expose a lack of vision for Florida's future.""

We've heard Graham talk about the Legislature and the state university system before. In 2007, he sued the Legislature, arguing that it did not have the authority to set tuition rates. That power, he said, is left up to the Board of Governors. A circuit court judge last year ruled against Graham, who said he will appeal.

In this case, Graham is talking about the money the Legislature sets aside in general revenues -- mostly from sales tax proceeds -- to fund the university system.

Graham's numbers actually came from the Board of Governors, the statewide governing body for the university system that was created by the passage of a constitutional amendment in 2002.

Kelly Layman, a spokeswoman for the Board of Governors and university system Chancellor Frank Brogan, provided PolitiFact Florida the same spreadsheet it provided Graham when he requested it. The spreadsheet details university funding from the 1990-91 budget -- Republican Bob Martinez's last budget as governor -- to the current 2010-11 budget.

The big takeaway?

The vast majority of dollar-for-dollar increases into the university system are overwhelming the result of increases to student tuition.

In 1990, general tax revenues funded 71 percent of per-student costs while tuition covered 18 percent.

In 2010, taxes funded 49 percent of per-student costs. Tuition covered 40 percent.

In bottom line numbers, taxes funded $5,131 a student in 1990 compared to $5,682 in the current budget. Using the U.S. Department of Labor's online inflation calculator, $5,131 in 1990 dollars is worth $8,688 today.

That's $3,006 less. Short of the ""about $4,000"" Graham claimed. 
We reached Graham to ask him about the difference. Graham told us he calculated the figure a slightly different way. He took the 1990 allocation -- $5,131 -- and popped it into a compound interest calculator like this one. He factored in 3 percent annual interest growth, and calculated out for 21 years -- 1990 to 2011. 
The result? $9,626.45. He then subtracted $5,682 (the current funding) to get an inflation-adjusted spending reduction of $3,944.45. 
""We should be investing in our students and our universities, and instead we're not,"" Graham said. 
It's worth noting that the amount of tax dollars funding the university system didn't fall off a cliff in 1990. In fact, after a decrease in 1991, spending increased. In 1998, tax dollars contributed $6,950 per student ($9,400 in today's dollars when adjusted for inflation). Dollars slowly melted away after that, or if the Legislature approved funding increases, they failed to keep up with the cost of inflation. As late as 2007, the Legislature directed $7,685 in tax dollars to the university system, which translates to about $8,200 when adjusted for inflation.

Graham said that ""since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000."" He used a compound interest calculator to come to that figure, but that assumes inflation from 1990-2011 averaged 3 percent per year. According to the Department of Labor, the economy did not grow quite at that rate -- hence the disparity between Graham's calculation and ours. 
That said, he's right that tax dollars are not funding the state university system the way it did two decades ago.

So we rate Graham's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/05/bob-graham/column-bob-graham-scolds-legislature-university-fu/
"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Jim Jordan']","
Rep. Jim Jordan presses to reform the volume of welfare programs
","
Rep. Jim Jordan chairs an influential group, the Republican Study Committee, at an opportune time. The group’s political beliefs generally intersect with those of the Tea Party, and they include a desire to stop wasteful government spending.

Among the targets: redundant social welfare programs. You might know these as food stamps and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, but Jordan, of Urbana, Ohio, says there are a whole lot more than that.

Jordan counts 77 federal means-tested social welfare programs, citing that number during an interview on the FOX Business Network and in backup materials to support one of his bills.

""There are seven -- this is according to Heritage Foundation, we get a list of these -- 77 different means tested social welfare programs -- 77 different ones,"" Jordan said during a March 22 appearance on Fox.

A week earlier he had introduced his Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would require a full accounting of each social welfare program. It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients. And it would require federal welfare spending to return to pre-recession levels, with allowance for inflation growth, once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent.

The sheer number that Jordan cited --  77 separate welfare programs -- sounded extraordinary, so PolitiFact Ohio took a look.

Jordan’s office had a list with all 77 programs.

Space limits our ability to include all here, and Jordan’s list is not online. You can find them in Jordan’s bill, or watch as they scoll across the screen on this Republican Study Committee video.

They include Medicaid, food stamps,  Section 8 housing assistance; weatherization help for home owners and Pell grants to help students afford college. Jordan’s list also includes low-income home energy assistance, school breakfast for children from low-income families, the Job Corps training program for at-risk teens and young adults, and Head Start for pre-kindergartners.

Most of the programs are geared toward people who fall below a certain income level. But Jordan’s list also included at least a dozen programs that don’t give federal money or services directly to the poor.

Some examples: the Appalachian Regional Commission; urban development block grants; Title 1 education grants that help schools in low-income areas; empowerment zones, which typically benefit businesses as well as communities, and Americorps, which sends college graduates into low-income neighborhoods for social service work.

Is this really welfare spending?

Jordan’s office says yes. His bill defines ""means-tested welfare spending"" as ""any federal program that is designed to specifically provide assistance or benefits exclusively to low-income Americans."" Each of the 77 programs he cites were designed with that in mind.

His bill also states that ""community and economic development programs targeted to low-income communities or populations shall be considered means-tested welfare programs"" for purposes of the legislation.

We asked Mimi Abromovitz, an authority on welfare reform at City University of New York’s Hunter College of Social Work. In an e-mail, she said, ""To me, ‘means test’ means you have to be below a specified income level and the level varies by program."" She also referred us to a description on LibraryIndex.com, a reference site on social topics. It said:

""Means-tested programs provide benefits to those whose income and financial resources meet certain requirements. More than 80 benefit programs provide cash and/or non-cash aid to individuals who meet certain low-income qualifications in the United States.""

In case you missed that: ""More than 80.""

Finally, Abromovitz noted a 2005 Government Accountability Office study that found that 50 percent to 70 percent of eligible people do not use these programs. But the question here is the number of programs, not their outreach -- and the GAO addressed that, too:

""Each year through more than 80 means-tested programs, the federal government provides benefits and services to individuals and families with low incomes — just 12 of which account for as much as $330 billion in annual federal expenditures.""

The GAO said 80. Jordan said 77.

You could say he was just being conservative, but on the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates as True.

Gingrich: States should consider alternatives to prisons to save money
","
In the wake of the Great Recession, some conservative political leaders are considering a new portion of the state budget to save money -- the prison system.

Gov. Nathan Deal has talked about his desire to find less costly alternatives to prison for drug addicts who commit nonviolent crimes.

""It is draining our state treasury and depleting our workforce,"" Deal said in his inaugural address.

It seems some of this new thinking comes from conservative mastermind Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman and one-time U.S. House speaker who says he is considering a run for president.

Gingrich co-wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post a few days before Deal’s speech that contained similar themes.

""The criminal justice system is broken, and conservatives must lead the way in fixing it,"" wrote Gingrich and Pat Nolan, a former California lawmaker who is now vice president of a Christian ministry that aids prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families.

""Some people attribute the nation’s recent drop in crime to more people being locked up. But the facts show otherwise,"" they added. ""While crime fell in nearly every state over the past seven years, some of those with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population.""

AJC PolitiFact Georgia stumbled upon the second sentence late last week and wondered whether it was true. Wouldn’t the reason why some states have less crime is because more criminals are in prison?

A Gingrich spokesman pointed to data from states such as Texas to make the former speaker’s case. In 2007, Texas lawmakers approved broad changes to the state’s correctional system -- then the nation’s largest -- that included more drug courts and treatment programs, The New York Times reported. Crime, Gingrich and Nolan wrote, dropped 10 percent between 2004 and 2009, and the Lone Star State is expected to save about $2 billion in prison costs over five years.

Gingrich and Nolan also compared New York and Florida to further prove their point.

""Over the past seven years, Florida's incarceration rate has increased 16 percent, while New York's decreased 16 percent,"" they wrote. ""Yet the crime rate in New York has fallen twice as much as Florida's. Put another way, although New York spent less on its prisons, it delivered better public safety.""

We looked around to see whether anyone has done research on this topic. The Washington-based Pew Center on the States puts together an annual report on the prison population of each state. Its most recent annual report, released in April 2010, found the number of state inmates in America declined for the first time in 38 years. Between 1972 and 2008, the number of state prisoners grew by an astounding 708 percent, Pew found.

The Pew Center has also done research, using data from the federal government, on the nation’s crime rate. It shared two charts: one with the change in crime rate between 1999 and 2009; the other contained the incarceration rate change during that same time period.

The Pew research showed four of the 10 states with the greatest drops in crime were also among the top 10 states in lowering their incarceration rates. Those four states were Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Utah. The six other states had increases in their incarceration rates. Texas, which Gingrich and Nolan held up as an example of their theory, had a 10 percent drop in crime and a 15 percent decline in its incarceration rate.

Georgia, by the way, had a 21 percent decrease in crime and a 1 percent decrease in its incarceration rate, according to Pew’s data. The Peach State did not rank in the top 10 in either category.

We also looked at data from the federal National Institute of Corrections, which compiled 2008 crime statistics from several state and federal agencies and the incarceration rates in 2009. Seven of the 10 states with the lowest crime rates also had among the 15 lowest incarceration rates. Those seven states were Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota and Vermont. Georgia had the eighth-highest crime rate and incarceration rate.

Florida and Texas ranked among the top 10 highest crime rates and incarceration rates.

So are some of these states making a concerted attempt to leave more space in their prisons?

Texas is trying to change its approach in order to save money on incarceration, Gingrich and The New York Times noted.

In Oregon, where officials say the crime rate is at its lowest rate in four decades, the state’s Criminal Justice Commission analyzed five-year intervals of the state’s incarceration rate, the Portland Oregonian reported. Oregon had a 36 percent decrease in crime between 1999 and 2009, the largest decrease in the nation, according to the Pew data.

The commission found major drops in both violent and property crime from 1995 through 2000, when Oregon's prison population grew more than 50 percent, the Oregonian reported. It also showed that when incarceration remained fairly flat from 2005 to 2008, violent crime and property crime continued to fall. Then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat, has used the lack of growth in the prison system to argue that Oregon should not ""overinvest in our prison system."" Others in the Oregonian article suggest the lower crime rate is a result of an aging population and efforts to reduce the production of a key ingredient of methamphetamine.

There is some debate about what factors are causing a decline in crime. Gingrich and Nolan argued that ""some"" states with major reductions in crime have also had large drops in their incarceration rate. The Pew figures provide support to Gingrich’s point. So does the National Institute of Corrections data. Therefore, we rate Gingrich’s statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/05/newt-gingrich/gingrich-states-should-consider-alternatives-priso/
"['Corporations', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Sen. Marco Rubio says the United States will soon have the industrialized world’s highest corporate taxes
","
Corporate taxes aren’t a topic to raise the heart-rate, unless you’re the one paying them. But this particular fact-check about corporate tax burdens needs a footnote because of changes brought by an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.

It starts with a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

In March, as Congress confronted a rapidly approaching federal debt limit, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argued for tax reform, among other changes to federal policy. In an op-ed article on March 30, 2011, he said, ""Our generation’s greatest challenge is an economy that isn’t growing, alongside a national debt that is.""

On his short-list of ways the United States inhibits business growth: high corporate taxes.

""Current federal policies make it harder for job creators to start and grow businesses,"" Rubio wrote. ""Taxes on individuals are complicated and set to rise in less than two years. Corporate taxes will soon be the highest in the industrialized world. Federal agencies torment job creators with an endless string of rules and regulations.""

It’s not the first time we’ve heard a claim about America's high corporate taxes, but we thought this one was worth a closer look: What’s about to change? And what did Rubio mean by ""corporate taxes""?

We asked Rubio’s office for evidence for his statement. Alex Burgos, his director of media affairs, provided a link to a Daily Caller story that declared ""America to have the highest corporate tax rate in April."" It reported that, according to the Tax Foundation, Japan’s corporate tax rate leads the industrialized world, with a combined state and federal rate of 39.5 percent. No. 2, by less than a percentage point? The United States, with a combined rate of 39.2 percent.

But Japan, it reported, planned to lower its rate in April, leaving America ""the corporate tax leader in the developed world.""

So far, so good, right?

The tax rates reported by the Daily Caller are easy to confirm. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development publishes the combined rates of its member countries, about 30 large, industrialized nations. The most recent indeed shows Japan on top at 39.54 percent vs. 39.21 percent for the United States.

Meanwhile, PolitiFact has previously cited a news item about Japan’s plan to cut its corporate tax rate by 5 percentage points, which, with parliamentary approval, was to take effect for the year starting April 1, 2011.

It looks like Rubio’s on solid ground here.

But are tax rates the whole story? After all, Rubio didn’t say ""corporate tax rates,"" as Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on Jan. 2, 2011. He said ""corporate taxes."" His spokesman said he uses the phrases interchangeably. But what would a typical reader think he meant?

We started by asking Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, since his study was the one cited by the Daily Caller article provided by Rubio’s team ""I think most readers understood that he meant rates, although if you really want to split hairs, I suppose he could have been more grammatically correct by specifically referring to corporate tax rates. In general discourse, most people understand that higher taxes mean higher rates,"" he said.

But there are at least three ways to compare corporate taxes, said Bob Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. One of them — the share of GDP claimed by tax or other measures of how much revenue is collected — depends too much on the size of the corporate tax base to allow valid cross-country comparisons, he said.

Another is to compare statutory rates, such as those reported by OECD. But statutory rates aren’t a good indicator of the amount of tax companies pay, according to the World Bank report, ""Paying Taxes 2011: The global picture."" (Consider, for example, a recent New York Times report that  General Electric managed to escape paying any U.S. tax at all in 2010.)

To compare what companies actually pay country by country, Williams recommends looking at the effective tax rate. ""It measures what I think most people consider when they think about the level of taxes.  … It’s not the rate that matters, it’s the amount of tax you pay that you care about.""

How would Rubio’s statement measure up when you consider what companies actually pay in corporate income tax?

Hodge said the situation is exactly the same, citing a recent paper by professors Kevin Markle and Douglas Shackelford of Dartmouth and the University of North Carolina that examined financial statements for more than 11,000 corporations from 82 countries from 1988 to 2009: ""They find that the U.S. has the second-highest effective tax rate among major industrialized countries. Like the statutory rate, only Japan has a higher effective rate.""

Indeed, the paper, ""Cross-Country Comparisons of Corporate Income Taxes,"" finds multinational corporations in Japan face the highest effective tax rates, followed by the United States, France and Germany. Further, the authors find that although effective tax rates have declined worldwide over the last two decades — ""most notably in Japan"" — the rank from high-tax countries to low-tax countries has changed little.

The effective tax rates are lower than the statutory rates: In the United States, the median effective tax rate is 25 percent for domestic companies and 30 percent for multinationals, far below the 39 percent statutory rate. But in Japan, domestic companies pay a median 41 percent and multinationals pay 37 percent, not far off its rounded 40 percent statutory rate.

So it’s an open question whether a 5-percentage-point cut by Japan would pull its effective tax rates below the United States’ — the U.S. effective rates are more than 5 percentage points lower. That would point to a less-than-true rating for Rubio’s statement.

There’s yet another measure to consider when it comes to corporate taxes, and that’s businesses’ tax burden beyond just income tax. Remember that World Bank study, ""Paying Taxes 2011: The global picture""? On pages 98-100, it lists something it calls the ""total tax rate"" for more than 180 counties. The rate includes all taxes that might be borne by a standard firm with 60 employees in a given year: profit taxes, labor taxes and others.

Why is the total tax rate interesting? The World Bank points out that corporate income tax is only part of the burden of taxes on business. Around the world, corporate income tax accounts for 38 percent of the total tax rate.

We figured if Rubio is concerned about the burden on job creators, he would be interested in companies’ total tax burden. And here, the U.S. rank improves compared with other industrialized countries. If we highlight just the 34 OECD nations among those studied by the World Bank, the United States sits at 16th: Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, Austria, Sweden, Hungary, Mexico, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Japan, Germany, Australia and Greece all have higher total tax rates than the U.S. rate of 46.8 percent. No. 12 Japan has a 48.6 percent total tax rate.

Now, there’s more to the Japan story. Yes, the country planned a rate cut that would vault the United States to the top of the statutory rate heap. But on March 11, 2011, the nation suffered a catastrophic earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis. And in the wake of the disaster, in turns out, government and business leaders have started to back off tax-cut plans as they debate how to pay for rebuilding.

The week after Rubio submitted his op-ed, headlines said a Japan tax increase was unavoidable, and that the nation was weighing scrapping the corporate tax cut all together. In fairness, we only consider a statement’s truthfulness based on information available at the time, so we won’t count the changes in Japanese policy against Rubio. But it’s interesting to note that around the same time Rubio’s op-ed published, a major factor behind his claim shifted.

Said Hodge: ""By many accounts, they may postpone the rate cut. We will have to see.""

Where does that leave us?

If most people think of tax ""rates"" when they hear a claim about ""corporate taxes,"" Rubio was right. The United States ranked second just to Japan, and Japan planned to cut its own rate as early as April 1. Even a look at ""effective tax rates"" -- what corporations actually pay -- partly supports Rubio’s claim. The United States again came in behind just Japan.

By a wider measure, the total tax rate calculated by the World Bank, Rubio’s not even close. And we think it’s a fair bet some readers would assume from Rubio’s statement that American corporations would soon face the world’s highest tax burden — rather than simply face the world’s highest corporate income tax rate. But since the total tax rate goes beyond income taxes to include other taxes, it doesn’t seem fair to weigh this measure as heavily against Rubio’s statement.

His statement, ""Corporate taxes will soon be the highest in the industrialized world,"" contains some truth, though even the experts disagree about how much. We acknowledge the claim is right by at least one measure, but rule it Mostly True because of the other ways to interpret it.",/factchecks/2011/apr/04/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-united-states-will-soon-have-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'This Week - ABC News', 'George Will']","
George Will says most recent recession killed more jobs than previous four recessions combined
","During the April 3, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, columnist George Will said during the show’s roundtable segment that ""we lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined.""

We knew the most recent recession was bad, but we hadn’t realized it was so bad in comparison to other recent recessions. So we decided to check whether Will was right.

We turned to two sources. One is the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group of economists that is the de facto arbiter of when recessions begin and end. The other is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates all manner of employment figures.

Below we list the last five recessions as declared by the NBER, along with the difference in U.S. non-farm employment levels between the official start of the recession and the official end:

Jan. 1980 to July 1980: 968,000 jobs lost
July 1981 to Nov. 1982: 2,824,000 jobs lost
July 1990 to March 1991: 1,249,000 jobs lost
March 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1,599,000 jobs lost
Total jobs lost in the four prior recessions: 6,640,000

""Great Recession"" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: 7,490,000 jobs lost

So the numbers show that Will is right -- about 850,000 more jobs were lost during the great recession than in the previous four recessions combined.

We wondered, though, whether the result would be different if we factored in the size of the labor force, which has grown over the past three decades. It’s impossible to make the same exact comparison Will did -- that is, comparing the sum of the past four recessions with the current one -- because you can’t simply add together percentages drawn from different time periods. But we thought we’d at least see whether the 2007-2009 recession registered more jobs lost on a percentage basis than any of the prior ones.

Here are the numbers for jobs lost as a percentage of the labor force:

Jan. 1980 to July 1980: 1.0 percent
July 1981 to Nov. 1982: 3.1 percent

Tim Pawlenty says every child is born with a $30,000 share of the U.S. debt
","
In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential Republican presidential contender in 2012 -- addresses a wide range of policy topics. One of those is the national debt.

""Every child born today,"" Pawlenty wrote, ""inherits a $30,000 share in a national debt that stands at more than $13 trillion.""

We wondered whether his math was accurate.

According to the U.S. Treasury, the total U.S. debt held by the public on Jan. 1, 2011, was almost $9.4 trillion. Meanwhile, the 2010 Census just determined the national population to be 308.7 million people.

Divide those two numbers and you get $30,419 per person -- right on target for what Pawlenty wrote.

But there’s a catch.

Remember, Pawlenty wrote that the national debt ""stands at more than $13 trillion."" The number he’s referring to is different from the $9.4 trillion we used in the previous calculation. The $13 trillion figure refers to something related, but different -- gross federal debt, which is the sum of publicly held debt and debt held by other parts of the federal government. The additional debt included in this number typically is held by trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Economists have told us in the past that they believe both measures to be equally valid.

On Jan. 1, 2011, gross federal debt stood at just over $14 trillion, which works out to $45,433 for every American.

So both of the figures Pawlenty used have a basis in reality, but they do not relate to each other the way he suggested. If Pawlenty wants to stick with the $30,000-per-person figure, he should have said that debt stands at more than $9 trillion. Alternately, if he prefers to stick with the ""more than $13 trillion"" debt figure, he should say that the amount of debt per person exceeds $45,000. Since both of his numbers are right -- just measuring different things -- we’ll give him some leeway and rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/04/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-every-child-born-30000-share-us-/

Water advocate says toilets could save nearly 50 million gallons daily
","
Despite decades of legal squabbles over the Southeast’s precious water resources, the problem still looms large over Georgia.

But take heart. And look down. Some of the solutions can be found in your toilet, the head of a water conservation group said recently.  

""In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program,"" Sally Bethea, founding director of Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, said in a recent article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Can better commodes really flush away that much of the area’s water problem?

Georgia has been battling for years with Florida and Alabama over how to divvy up the region’s water supply. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that if the states fail to reach a water-sharing agreement by mid-July 2012, metro Atlanta can take only the same amount of water it received in the mid-1970s -- when the population was less than a third of what it is today.

Georgia appealed the ruling in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the state has a good shot at victory.

Even if Georgia wins this battle, the available water supply might not meet the region’s long-term needs.

So Bethea has targeted the potty, the modern household’s thirstiest water hog. Nationally and locally, governments have created programs to replace old-fashioned commodes that can use more than 3.5 gallons per flush with low-flow toilets that use as little as 1.28 gallons.  

This is how Riverkeeper came up with its number:

Atlanta is part of the 15-county Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, which includes counties as far north as Hall and as far south as Coweta. She said the planning district estimates that 850,000 homes have old-fashioned plumbing.

The district already has programs in which residents receive rebates if they install low-flow toilets. But Bethea said she envisions a more dramatic change.

In the mid-1990s, New York City ran a successful program that changed out the city’s old toilets with low-flow ones.

Over three years, that effort switched about 1.3 million toilets and saved an estimated 70 million to 80 million gallons per day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the privately managed program, which was heavily promoted to apartment building owners and plumbers, property owners received up to $240 per toilet to have them replaced by a licensed professional.  

Experts we interviewed think that New York City-style programs can be more effective than a typical rebate program. They are especially helpful for properties with low- or fixed-income residents who often live in older housing with outdated plumbing.

Using EPA figures, Riverkeeper calculated that 8,120 gallons can be saved per person per year if a resident installs one new high-efficiency toilet, faucet and shower head in his home. If there are 2.5 people in the household, the savings totals 47.3 million gallons per day across the region, the group calculated.  

Bethea described her estimate as ""very conservative"" because many homes have more than one toilet or 2.5 residents. It doesn’t include savings when the upgraded plumbing fixes leaks, either.

We found that Riverkeeper numbers are optimistic.

The group’s figure for households with old-fashioned plumbing is out of date, according to data from the Water Planning District. Last year, it was about 615,000, or 27 percent less.  

And Bethea’s estimate for the amount of water saved per toilet is high. Her group assumed those toilets would date from the 1980s or earlier. The older the toilet, the more water it uses.

But Atlanta’s housing stock is relatively new. Under an existing rebate program that will last until 2025, the Water Planning District expects the region to save 14 million gallons per day if 57 percent of homeowners use the program.

District figures do not include savings from installing more efficient faucets and shower heads. But since those fixtures combined use thousands of gallons per year less than toilets, we think it’s reasonable to expect that they would not increase the amount of water saved to nearly 50 million gallons per day.  

In addition, the Atlanta region has characteristics that could weaken the impact of a New York City-style program. The Big Apple has far more apartments, which meant persuading a single apartment building owner to change made a dramatic difference. Plus property owners had a big incentive to switch toilets quickly because of changes in how the city billed for water.

To Bethea’s credit, she used careful language. She said the region ""could"" save 50 million gallons per day, not that it ""would.""  And while saving nearly 50 million gallons of water per day appears unlikely in light of water district numbers, it isn’t impossible.

The region could have a higher-than-expected participation rate or proportion of very old toilets. The amount of water saved because the new plumbing fixes leaks could boost the total, and changing toilets over three years rather than 14 (under the rebate) does save more water, total.

Therefore Bethea’s fundamental point rings true. A New York-style program ""could"" save 50 million gallons per day. The amount could easily be much lower, but even more conservative estimates place the savings in the range of tens of millions of gallons per day.

Texas Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock says ""some of the colleges, including A&M,"" have guaranteed tuition freeze
","
During debate over legislation that cuts about $1.5 billion in spending from the state’s current budget, state Rep. Sylvester Turner spoke in favor of an amendment that would have redirected $6.2 million from programs under the purview of Gov. Rick Perry to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which administers state-funded student financial aid programs. 
On the House floor March 31, Turner, a Houston Democrat, said that after expected reductions in funding for higher education, ""students in the state of Texas will need more financial aid than ever before because their tuition will go up. … Why are we more interested in protecting the governor’s agency than in providing financial aid to our students?"" 
Republican Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock of Killeen, an opponent of the amendment, responded by defending the programs handled by the governor’s office and indicating that tuition hikes are not a done deal: ""Some of the colleges, including A&M, have already guaranteed that they will not increase their tuition."" 
The amendment failed, but we still wondered whether Texas A&M University and other colleges have really decided to freeze their tuition, as Perry urged in his February State of the State address. 
On Feb. 9, the day after Perry’s speech, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that ""at least one public university system had already decided to freeze tuition."" Texas A&M’s board of regents ""last year voted to freeze tuition rates for the 2011-12 academic year at 11 universities,"" according to the news article. 
Texas A&M spokesman Jason Cook confirmed that the university system had frozen ""designated"" tuition — what public universities charge students on top of state-set tuition — but he said A&M’s flagship university in College Station is proposing to raise additional tuition for three of its colleges: architecture, engineering and veterinary medicine. 
Cook told us the proposed hike only applies to certain undergraduates — about 1,415 architecture students, 7,880 engineering students and 510 students in a veterinary medicine program. Total enrollment last fall on the College Station campus was 49,426, so about 20 percent of students would pay the higher charges. 
A&M President Bowen Loftin will take the proposal to the university’s board of regents in May, Cook said — a year from when the board decided not to raise university-wide tuition this fall. 
Tuition won’t go up at the other universities in the A&M system, Cook said, but fees may go up. According to the an overview of tuition by the coordinating board, mandatory fees, such as library and laboratory fees, are charged to all students upon enrollment. Texas A&M University at College Station is proposing ""a small increase in three mandatory fees,"" he said. 
When he spoke on the House floor, Aycock said that A&M was among ""some of the colleges"" that have promised to freeze tuition. When we checked back with the lawmaker, he told us that he was only talking about institutions within the A&M system. 
Still, we think Texans who heard him could be left with the impression that some other public colleges in Texas had guaranteed tuition freezes. 
We looked for such pledges — unsuccessfully. 
Searching news articles, we discovered that the governing boards at three public higher education institutions had voted within the past two weeks to increase tuition and fees this fall at some campuses, including the University of North Texas in Denton, Del Mar community college in Corpus Christi and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls. In each case, projected cuts to state funding were a factor in the board’s decision to implement the increases. 
Representatives of Texas Tech and the University of Houston also told us that fall tuition could be raised. 
What about the University of Texas system? 
The Austin American-Statesman reported in a March 3 story that the new chairman of the system’s board of regents, Gene Powell, has pledged to try to hold tuition at current levels or even lower. In Feb. 18 remarks to the board, Powell said: ""We are going to lower the cost (of a bachelor’s degree) if we can do it in any way."" 
UT regents typically set tuition every two years. In March 2010, they voted to increase tuition and fee rates at most of the system’s institutions for both this school year and next. 
During that meeting, regents did not increase the 2011-12 cost of attending the system’s medical, dental and nursing health campuses but signaled that they would revisit the question the following year. And last month, they raised the tuition at those institutions. 
In a press release announcing the March 2010 vote, UT regents left the door open to consider an additional increase for this fall ""should available funding change."" Because tuition recommendations originate at individual campuses, we checked with UT-Austin to see whether any increases for the fall are being considered. Robert Meckel, director of public affairs at the school, told us that ""there will be no proposal for a tuition increase"" for the next school year. 
We also asked Matt Flores, a spokesman for the UT System, whether any UT institutions had ""guaranteed"" that they wouldn’t raise tuition for the following school year, 2012-13. 
""No,"" he said. ""That’s too speculative right now."" 
So, where does that leave us? 
In his remarks on the House floor, Aycock said ""some colleges"" including Texas A&M have pledged not to increase tuition costs to students. That’s not quite what we found. 
It’s true that all but one of the A&M system’s campuses won’t be seeing tuition increases this fall. But 20 percent of students at the system’s flagship campus may have to pay higher tuition, and all A&M students could face mandatory fee increases. Outside the A&M family, we found no evidence of tuition freezes — instead we found impending tuition hikes.

Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder says Georgia’s voter ID law didn’t dissuade black voters from participating
","
Editor's note: The statement for this item was paraphrased after publishing for clarity. 
Republicans in the Ohio House said they were acting to ensure ballot integrity last month when they raced to approve legislation requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification at the polls.

Backers of the legislation, House Bill 159, produced no evidence of voter impersonation at the polls -- the problem that the measure claims to solve.

But they pointed specifically to Georgia in responding to criticism that the law would disproportionately affect ethnic and racial minorities, students, senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. All are groups with lower rates of having government-issued IDs, several national studies have found.

The bill's sponsor, Rep. Bob Mecklenborg of Cincinnati, pointed to totals in Georgia that showed an increase in voting among all racial groups following adoption of a voter ID law.

""The African-American vote in Georgia has increased dramatically -- five times the amount of the white vote,"" he said.

""Had there been a contrary result, we might have taken a different position on the bill,"" House Speaker William G. Batchelder said March 23 at a news conference. ""Had this dissuaded black voters from participating, we might have taken a totally different look at it. It hasn't, it doesn't, and apparently, if you do cause and effect in that state, it's been helpful.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a closer look at the speaker's claim.

The voting numbers from Georgia -- where photo ID for in-person voting was first required in September 2007 -- came from Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who testified in Columbus for the Ohio bill.

Kemp said the Latino vote in Georgia increased from 18,000 in 2004 to 43,000 in 2008, an increase of 140 percent; the African-American vote increased from 834,000 in 2004 to 1.2 million in 2008, an increase of 42 percent; and the white vote increased from 2.3 million in 2004 to 2.5 million in 2008, an increase of 8 percent.

Comparing the non-presidential years of 2006 and 2010, the Latino vote increased 66 percent, African-American participation increased 44 percent, and white voting rose almost 12 percent.

Was the photo ID requirement the cause of the increase, as Batchelder suggested?

Batchelder's office didn't get back to us. We put the question to William Minozzi, an assistant professor of political science at Ohio State University, who examined the effects of voter ID in a study published last fall.

""Correlation does not imply causation,"" he said. Georgia's increased voter participation is ""the result of a lot of different things. I think you could call this cherry-picking.""

""It's an obviously specious argument,"" said law professor Daniel Tokaji, associate director of Ohio State University's Election Law @ Moritz project, who testified against the photo-ID bill. ""A lot of things affect turnout. The last two election cycles are ones in which the Democratic base has been extraordinarily motivated.""

Both Minozzi and Tokaji cited the candidacy of Barack Obama, whose voter-registration drive in 2008 was called the largest in the history of presidential campaigns. The drive's biggest announced goal was in Georgia, where it aimed to register and turn out 500,000 unregistered African-American voters.

The actual increase from 2004 was 466,000, according to the secretary of state's office, which cited its own outreach program to get free ID cards to voters as a factor increasing turnout.

A review of research by the University of Wisconsin, responding to voter-ID legislation proposed in that state this year, noted that some researchers thought that such laws might increase turnout, possibly by increasing voter awareness -- ""but we found no research showing that effect.""

A study published in the Harvard Law & Policy Review concluded only that outreach programs may counter a decline in turnout it associated with voter ID laws.

Over all, UW found that ""studies of the effect of voter ID laws on voter turnout find no discernible relationship or a small negative impact,"" and that ""data limitations make these relationships notoriously difficult to estimate.""

""You can’t clearly identify the cause and effect,"" Minozzi said. ""There is not wide evidence for one side or the other.""

A recently completed study by University of Georgia political science professor Trey Hood found ""credible evidence"" that Georgia's voter ID law did lower turnout among people who lacked government photo IDs before the law took effect, by about one third of a percentage point in 2008 compared to 2004 levels.

However, the Hood study found no evidence to suggest there was a racial or ethnic component to the dropoff. In fact, the dropoff happened across all ethnic groups with white voters actually seeing the biggest share of that overall third of a percentage point drop in voting because of the law, he said.

""It doesn't affect minorities disproportionately -- they were impacted the same or slightly less than whites by the law,"" said Hood in a phone interview. ""From my observation and from my research, it's sort of a been a wash.""

Speaker Batchelder was correct when he said voting increased in Georgia after its photo ID law took effect. Suggesting that the restriction caused the increase is a logical fallacy that ignores important other factors and is unsupported by research.

George Allen says the health care bill defies the wishes of Americans
","
Editor's Note:  This item originally was published as if we fact-checked a direct quotation from Allen. Since the fact-check was focused on his claim about public opinion, we have changed our ruling statement to reflect that. 
Republican senate candidate George Allen celebrated the first anniversary of the health-care reform law by posting an irate blog item detailing his objections to the act.

""A year ago today President Obama ignored the objections of the American people and signed into law a $2.5 trillion monstrosity -- one year later, We the People are still being ignored,"" Allen wrote on March 23.

Allen said the law is a recipe for bigger government and higher debt.

We reviewed dozens of public opinion polls -- from time Obama signed the bill to present -- to see if Allen is correct in stating that the health-care reform law defies the wishes of ""We the People.""

Katie Wright, Allen’s campaign communications director, pointed us to several polls she said back up her boss’s claim. They included CNN/Opinion Research surveys and Rasmussen Reports polls showing solid majorities in opposition to the law in March 2010 and March 2011. She also included a Rasmussen Survey from March showing 58 percent of people at least ""somewhat favor"" repealing it.

Other polls during the past year have shown different results, sometimes with people favoring the measure or being evenly split in their support or opposition to it.

There’s certainly no shortage of national polls on health care reform. With little effort, we found 76 online.

Charles Franklin, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said he read all the surveys around the time the bill was passed. Although the numbers varied, he noticed a pattern.

""There was a very small majority opposed...just over 50 percent, and there was a substantial minority in the low to mid 40s in favor (of the law),"" said Franklin, who is also co-founder of Pollster.com. ""My caveat is it was a marginal advantage (for opponents).""

Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University, has a slightly different take. He says an averaging out of polls shows no majority opinion -- more than half the population -- existed on the health-care reform bill around the time it passed. But he did find that a larger number of people -- a plurality -- opposed rather than supported the measure.

We took 28 separate poll results listed on Pollster.com that were conducted during March 2010 and found that an average of 42.2 percent of respondents supported the law while 49.9 percent opposed it.

Where do things stand today?

An average of recent polls on the Real Clear Politics website shows 53 percent opposing the law while 38.9 percent supported it. But these are tricky numbers. Not all of the people against the health-care law agree with Allen that the law is a federal overreach.  Some progressives oppose the law because they think it does not go far enough.

CNN/Opinion Research Poll from March 11-13, 2011 found 59 percent opposed the law. But 13 percent said they were against it because it was ""not liberal enough."" When combined with the 37 percent who favored the law, that means 50 percent of respondents either liked it or wanted something stronger, while 43 percent opposed the act for being too liberal and another 7 percent had no opinion. A survey from CNN/Opinion Research from a year earlier found a similar result.

So an argument can be made that the opposition is not entirely due to conservative ire over what they see as as invasive government.

""Where does the public stand on it now, a year later (after passage)? I would say split right down the middle,"" Frank Newport, Gallup’s editor-in-chief said in a video report on the polling organization’s website.

A lingering question is where the country goes from here - keep the law, throw it out, repeal and replace?

Polls show support for certain provisions of the law, such as not denying coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions, but opposition for its mandate that people have health-care coverage. .

The average of recent polls on Real Clear Politics indicates a slight majority of respondents show at least some interest in repealing the law.

But a March 2011 survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, provides a more complex picture. It found that 30 percent wanted the law expanded while 21 percent wanted it to stand as is. Another 21 percent want it repealed without replacement  while 18 percent want it repealed and substituted with a Republican alternative.

If you’re curious, the Kaiser survey found a relatively even split on where public sentiment stands on the law. The poll shows 46 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view while 42 percent had a favorable thoughts on the measure.

Let’s review.

Allen said Obama signed the health-care reform law against the will of ""We the People,"" and the American public remains opposed to the law to this day.

At one point in his blog post he even went so far as to say ""It is clear to everyone but those in Washington that this is the wrong prescription to fix our health system.""

Such statements are far too sweeping; poll averages generally show a sizeable minority favor the law.

You’ll find more opponents than supporters of the measure. But some of the opposition comes from liberals who wanted a more expansive law.

Still Allen is correct to the extent that polls show the law generally stirs more opposition than support.

State union lobbyist says Rhode Island pension benefits are average or below
","
With Rhode Island facing a financial crisis, the expensive and underfunded state employee pension system is once again in the cross hairs. The conventional wisdom is that state workers who get a pension have a great deal, so it's not surprising that some legislators are looking to scale back benefits, while Governor Chafee wants workers to contribute more.

During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, James Cenerini, a lobbyist for Council 94 of the American Federation of State, Council & Municipal Employees, argued that the state pension system is not as lucrative as most people believe.

""When you take a look at, comparatively, our system, to other systems throughout the country, our benefits are not gold-plated,"" he said. ""They are not rich. They are actually average or below average.""

When we asked Cenerini how he made that comparison, he sent us to the latest report of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, which has been comparing public pension systems every two years since 1982. The latest report, released in December 2009, is based on data from 2008. The 2010 report isn't due out until early next year, said author Daniel Schmidt.

Neither Cenerini nor the Wisconsin report addressed health insurance benefits for retirees, so they are not considered in this analysis.

Even a cursory look at the 87 public employee retirement systems examined in the report (at least one per state) shows that the systems have their own quirks that make comparisons tricky. In addition, some of the information is outdated. The provisions of Rhode Island's pension system, for example, are now less lucrative for employees than they were in 2008. Thus, the data in the report should be regarded as a snapshot in time.

But that's the snapshot Cenerini said he used, so we decided to see how Rhode Island stacked up based on the information in that report.

We'll take the easy comparisons first.

NORMAL RETIREMENT: For Rhode Island state employees and teachers, it was age 60 with 10 years of service, or at any age with 28 years of service. Of the 86 other plans, 42 had a more liberal standard. For example, in Massachusetts, it was age 55 with 10 years of service or at any age with 20 years of service. Rhode Island was right in the middle of the pack.

EARLY RETIREMENT: Ten plans had no early retirement provision. Rhode Island allowed early retirement, with a reduced payout, at age 55 with 20 years of service. Sixty three other plans were more liberal, putting Rhode Island well below average.

EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION: Rhode Island state employees contributed -- and continue to contribute -- 8.75 percent of their salary to retirement. Only nine plans required a greater contribution and in every one of those plans, except one, retirees would presumably need to set aside extra money because they were not covered by Social Security. (Rhode Island teachers, some of whom are not eligible for Social Security, pay 9.5 percent.)

Among plans where workers were eligible for Social Security, only Arizona made employees pay a greater share -- 9 percent. In Kentucky, for example, teachers were paying 9.86 percent, but they were not covered by Social Security; state workers who were eligible paid just 5 percent. (The Chafee administration wants to increase the contribution rate for teachers and non-teachers alike to 11.75 percent.)

VESTING: In nearly every retirement plan, you must work for the state for a certain number of years before you are eligible to receive retirement benefits. For Rhode Island, that ""vesting"" period is 10 years. Seventy of the 86 other plans had a shorter vesting period.

TAXED BENEFITS: Rhode Island is one of only a dozen states where state retirement payments are fully taxed by the state. In 12 states they were exempt, in 2 states they were exempt for some workers, in 18 states some retirement income was exempt and 7 other states have no state income tax.

So far, based on 2008 data, Rhode Island's system seemed to rank at or below average.

Now, it gets a little more complicated.

ANNUAL INCREASES: At the time of the report, Rhode Island retirees were entitled to annual cost of living increases of 3 percent. This was the one area where Rhode Island's system clearly offered more money than most. And it was an expensive feature of the plan. Only nine other states were giving 3-percent annual increases, the highest guaranteed increases among the states. Most states -- 18 -- tied increases to the Consumer Price Index, but 7 of those capped the increase at 3 percent; 5 had a lower cap and 6 had a higher. Thirteen states had no system for guaranteed increases, according to the report.

STARTING RETIREMENT SALARY: This is the other element that's really important -- the amount of money you make when you begin your retirement.

The Wisconsin report didn't compare starting retirement salaries. It simply catalogued the elements each state used to calculate the amount. To do the calculation, you take a worker's final average salary (usually the average of the last three, four or five years of employment), multiply that by the number of years of service, and multiply that by a percentage that varies widely.

We couldn't come up with a calculation for every state. Alaska, for example, had a defined contribution plan without a multiplier. A few had a tiny multiplier combined with an annuity. In a few other cases, the report offered only enough information to make a rough guesstimate.

Rhode Island, like the majority of states, based the payment on the last three years of service. But while a typical multiplier nationally was around 2 percent, Rhode Island offered 3 percent for the 21st through 34th years of employment. Only workers in Kentucky, New Mexico and New York could get that amount, or more.

To get a rough comparison between states, we took the hypothetical case of an employee who was 65 years old, earned $50,000 per year, received 2-percent raises for each of the last 5 years, and was retiring in 2008 after 25 years of service.

When we ran the numbers, the hypothetical Rhode Island retiree in 2008 would have received about $25,000 in his first year. Only 11 other states would have paid out more. Suddenly, we didn't rank average or below average. If we had assumed 30 years or more of state employment, Rhode Island's ranking would have been even higher, because of the benefits structure that particularly rewards those who work for the state for more than 20 years.

But if we assumed just 20 years of service, Rhode Island's ranking dropped from 12th to 34th.

Cenerini correctly points out that pension benefits for Rhode Island employees have been scaled back in recent years.

In 2005, for anyone with less than 10 years of service, the minimum age was raised to 59.  In addition, the multipliers used to calculate future retirement checks were cut back. The highest -- 3 percent -- was scaled back to max out at 2.5 percent after 30 years of service. (Those changes would not have applied to our hypothetical Rhode Island retiree.)

In 2009, the retirement age was raised again, to 62, and the lower multipliers were applied to more people. In addition, the future retirement pay of many workers would be based on the last five years of service instead of the last three, and cost of living increases were tied to inflation, with a 3-percent cap.

And in 2010, benefits for future retirees were further restricted: cost of living increases didn’t kick in for three years or longer and they were restricted to the first $35,000.

If those changes had been in place years earlier,  retirees from 36 states would have had pension checks higher than our hypothetical Rhode Islander.

Cenerini said that when he asserted that Rhode Island's pension benefits were average or below average, he was comparing current features of the retirement system to the 2008 national statistics in the Wisconsin study, which offers the best data available.

But because the economic crisis is not restricted to Rhode Island, we're not sure that's the best comparison. Other states have dialed back their retirement packages as well. For  example, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in 2010, seven other states scaled back their cost of living increases.

In short, the formulas used to determine how much a retiree received in that first check in 2008 made the Rhode Island plan, combined with the 3-percent annual cost of living increase, among the most lucrative in the nation -- if you were employed by the state for more than 20 years. If your tenure was less, the payout was well below average.

Other elements of the system would give Cenerini good reason to argue that Rhode Island's state employee retiree benefits are not as good as people think. In 2008:

* The amount state workers had to pay for their retirement benefits was second-highest in the country

* Employees had to work longer to be eligible for retirement

* Most other states let their workers retire at an earlier age or with fewer years of service than Rhode Island

* When they retired, Rhode Island was one of a dozen states that fully taxed those retirement checks.

But the disadvantages (from the retiree point of view) seem to be more than offset by both the larger initial payouts -- if you worked for the state longer than 20 years -- and the higher cost of living increase that were in place for most who would have retired in 2008.

It is true that the benefits have how been scaled back significantly. But retirement packages in other states have been scaled back as well.

We do know that in 2008, some retirees got a benefit package that was below the national average while others received above-average retirement pay.

The situation may be different today, but we won't know until the 2010 numbers come out next year.

So for now, we rate his statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/03/james-cenerini/state-union-lobbyist-says-rhode-island-pension-ben/

Milwaukee County Board candidate Jason Haas says MillerCoors left Milwaukee because it lacks good transit
","
It’s not uncommon to hear politicians sing the blues about a community. It makes sense -- to win an election, candidates have to convince voters they are the ones who can fix the problems.

But singing the blues can include some sour notes.

Take Jason Haas, who is running for the 14th District seat on the Milwaukee County Board. In a statement to the Bay View Compass newspaper, he made a claim about Milwaukee County transit options that might make a voter in his district want to pony up more tax dollars for public transportation.

Haas and his opponent, trucking company owner Steve Kraeger, submitted written responses to questions from the Compass, which appeared in the newspaper's Feb. 27, 2011 issue.

In one of his responses, Haas discussed his views on the importance of public transit, including this observation:

""Businesses have decided not to locate (in Milwaukee) precisely because there are no effective transit options; Milwaukee lost the headquarters of MillerCoors to Chicago, in large part, for that reason,"" Haas said.

This caught our attention. It didn’t sound right that a multi-billion dollar company moved its headquarters out of its home town because of the transit system.

We called Haas for elaboration.

He said he based his comments on an article from the Business Journal, a MillerCoors press release and a study from the nonprofit Transportation Development Association.

We looked at Haas’ evidence and found what amounted to the old game of telephone, where a statement is made, misunderstood, repeated, and so forth. The trail links Haas’ statement to a misleading item from the Business Journal, and back to a Chicago Tribune article.

But let’s start at the beginning -- the MillerCoors marriage and the merged company’s decision on its corporate headquarters.

At the time of the merger in 2008, Milwaukee-based Miller Brewing Co. and Denver-based Coors Brewing Co. were the number two and three brewers in the United States, respectively.

The merger was a joint-venture, a 50-50 ownership deal that meant neither company was acquiring the other. Speculation was rampant for months over where the headquarters of the new company would be located.

Since both Miller and Coors had an equal amount of power in the new company,  the headquarters decision was a touchy subject. Give the HQ to Denver or Milwaukee and it would be clear that one brewery was the ""winner.""

A July 16, 2008 Journal Sentinel article quoted MillerCoors President Tom Long as saying it would have been ""too difficult"" to choose either Milwaukee or the Denver area as the MillerCoors headquarters location.

""We came to the conclusion that we did need a neutral third place,"" he said.

So, it wasn’t about transportation at all, at least not in eliminating Milwaukee.

So how did transportation come into this equation?

Back to the decision. Eventually, MillerCoors narrowed the list of potential locations to Chicago and Dallas and in July of 2008 announced Chicago as its new home.

The office is at 250 S. Wacker Drive, just across the Chicago River from Union Station.

The company didn’t abandon Milwaukee: It maintains a major brewery in Milwaukee, which employs about 800, as well as about 300 corporate jobs, said MillerCoors spokesman Julian Green.

Superior transportation system was part of the reason Chicago was chosen over Dallas.

And that’s where the game of telephone comes in.

A July 16, 2008 Chicago Tribune article quoted Long as saying Chicago was chosen as the company’s headquarters because of ""access to an attractive base of talent, transportation and business resources.""

The Business Journal and the Transportation Development Association interpreted Long’s comments in a different manner.

The TDA said ""the top reasons why MillerCoors chose to locate its corporate headquarters in Chicago rather than Milwaukee were access to an attractive base of talent, transportation and business resources.""

A July 27, 2008 article in The Business Journal suggested Milwaukee needs to upgrade its transit system, saying ""part of the decision"" as to why MillerCoors put its headquarters in Chicago was due to the city’s transportation system. This was accurate, since it referred to the Chicago vs. Dallas choice.

In a November 2008 editorial, however, The Business Journal said that the Chicago transit system was a ""key part of MillerCoors’ decision to locate the new joint venture’s headquarters in that city, rather than Milwaukee.""

Candidate Haas repeated -- and elaborated -- upon that statement.  He said Milwaukee’s lack of transit options was a ""large part"" of the reason MillerCoors went to Chicago.

So where does that leave us?

Haas said Milwaukee lost the MillerCoors headquarters because it lacks effective transit. Yet there is no evidence the brewing company chose against Milwaukee for those reasons. Milwaukee and Denver were never in play. The company chose Chicago over Dallas, and, in doing so, the top executive praised that city’s transit system.

State Rep. Sylvester Turner says that 90 percent of Texans don't want nursing homes to close — a position that polls higher than anything else
","
Urging his colleagues to tap more of the rainy day fund to close $4 billion deficit in the current budget, state Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, said nursing homes would shutter without the extra cash.

""Ninety percent of Texans say that they do not want the nursing homes to close,"" Turner said on the House floor March 31. ""It polls higher than anything else.""

Turner, who introduced an amendment to draw an extra $1 billion from the state’s savings to close the budget gap, hammered the point later: ""Not 9 percent, not 20 percent, but 90 percent of Texans. And I know not all 90 percent of Texans are Democrats.""

We wondered whether nursing homes really polled higher than any other service facing funding cuts as the state grapples with the budget crisis.

Backing up: Advocates have warned that 33 percent in cuts proposed for nursing homes that accept residents who are covered by Medicaid will force homes to close, according to a March 23 Austin American-Statesman article.

Allison Lowery, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, told us that of the 90,000 residents of nursing homes statewide, 56,000  — about 60 percent — are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities.

Alison Brock, Turner’s chief of staff, passed on a Feb. 22 press release from the Texas Health Care Association, that said ""a new University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll finding 90 percent of Texans expressing opposition to cutting state-funded nursing home care exemplifies the depth of public opposition to proposed"" cuts. ""The 90 percent opposition to nursing home cuts represents the highest level of opposition to all of the funding cut categories tested.""

Next, we looked at the relevant question in the Feb. 21 poll: ""The Texas Legislature is currently discussing different ways to reduce state spending in order to address the state’s budget shortfall. Please think about the following list of proposals for cutting the budget, and check all of the measures you think should be taken to reduce spending.""

The least popular budget proposal — cutting ""state funding for nursing home care"" — was checked by only 10 percent of respondents. And so it follows that 90 percent opted to not cut nursing home funding. The most popular proposal — ending ""funding for pre-kindergarten classes"" — was checked by 38 percent.

According to a Texas Tribune news article accompanying the poll results, ""voters were protective of state programs, and overwhelmingly so.""

Jim Henson, one of the pollsters who teamed up with the Tribune, confirmed the online poll’s results, which have a margin of error of 3.46. The sample size: 800 registered Texas voters.

Next, we looked for other polls.

A September UT/Texas Tribune poll found that more than half of respondents said they would support increased funding for border security, but oppose higher funding for community colleges (73 percent), pre-kindergarten programs (72 percent), nursing homes (68 percent) and increased exemptions from the business franchise tax (78 percent). The poll doesn’t ask respondents whether they’d want to cut spending for nursing homes.

A January poll commissioned by the Austin American-Statesman and other newspapers found that voters want to spare public education and health care programs from budget cuts, with about 70 percent of respondents saying lawmakers shouldn't cut school spending, while 61 percent said they want no cuts on health care programs for children and low- to moderate-income families. Respondents weren’t asked about nursing homes.

Henson told us this poll and the UT/Tribune’s poll are the only statewide surveys that he’s aware of that cover budget cuts.

Our results: The UT/Tribune poll found that 90 percent of respondents didn’t want state funding for nursing home care cut, and opposition to that idea polled ""higher than anything else,"" as Turner said. Though he erred when he couched that as opposition to closing nursing homes — the poll didn’t ask about that — it’s reasonable to assume that a comparable percentage of respondents would feel negatively about closures as well.

But gauging the strength of statewide public opinion on the basis of a single, online poll of 800 voters is a questionable proposition. We rate Turner’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/02/sylvester-turner/state-rep-sylvester-turner-says-90-percent-texans-/

Oregon district attorney says meth lab seizures and meth-related arrests both down considerably since 2006
","
Oregon got some press in a recent New York Times articleabout a growing methamphetamine problem in Southern and Midwestern states and their efforts to stanch it.

According to the article, a laundry list of states -- Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee and ""several other(s)"" -- are trying to reverse the growth of home-grown producers and Oregon might be a model.

Since 2006, Oregon has required a prescription for drugs that contain pseudoephedrine, like Sudafed. For those who don’t know the intricacies of meth production, pseudoephedrine is a key ingredient in the drug and can be leeched out of some over-the-counter medications.

The thinking goes that if you put drugs like Sudafed behind a prescription barrier, meth manufactures will have to close shop. The New York Times talks to one of Oregon’s very own, Lincoln County District Attorney Rob Bovett, about the state’s results.

Bovett tells the Times that the law is working well in Oregon. Specifically, he says, the rate of meth lab incidents has tumbled 96 percent since the law took effect while the number of meth-related arrests has shrunk by 32 percent.

Those are not numbers to ignore -- provided they’re accurate. We gave Bovett a call and he pointed us in the direction of the data he used.

First up was the claim that meth lab incidents are down by 96 percent.

For this statistic, Bovett gathered numbers from the Department of Justice’s High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. The program keeps tabs on the number of ""meth lab incidents."" These incidents, Bovett said, include three scenarios: full labs (whether operating or not), partial labs (a lab that’s not set up) and dump sites (discarded labs).

Bovett gathered month-by-month data from the organization going as far back as January 2003. The information is now in a handy tableon the Oregon Alliance for Drug Endangered Children website.

We looked over the data and calculated an average number of incidents per month in 2003 (roughly 40) and then did the same for 2010 (roughly 1.5). These numbers do, indeed, show a 96 percent drop in the number of meth lab incidents per month.

The New York Times article specifically talks about the drop occurring between now and 2006, so why did we look at numbers in 2003? Well, between the end of 2004 and the middle of 2006, Oregon instituted progressively more onerous requirements for the purchasing of products containing pseudoephedrine. First, the state put them behind the counter (November 2004 through May 2005) and then we started requiring an ID and logging the number of purchases (June 2005 through June 2006).

If you look at the numbers, these two moves actually reduced the number of meth lab incidents by 77 percent on their own. It might be easy, then, to assume that the prescription-only policy reduced incidents by only the remaining 19 percent. But, the 96 percent reduction has been sustained for more than four years now.

We feel comfortable giving the prescription-only law the credit here. So on the first statistic, Bovett is right.

Now for the claim that the number of meth-related arrests has shrunk by 32 percent.

For this statistic, Bovett relied on a data setpublished by Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. To avoid problems with changing populations, we went with the number of arrests per 100,000 Oregonians. This is typically how crime rates are assessed.

The prescription-only law went into effect in November 2006. We reached a peak of meth-related arrests in March 2007 when there were 25.3 arrests per 100,000. The number reached its lowest point since then in December 2009, 14.2 arrests for every 100,000. It’s seen a slight bump since that low and, as of February 2011, sits at 17 arrests per 100,000.

Compare that peak of 25.3 to our current 17, and you do, indeed, find a drop of roughly 33 percent. Again, Bovett appears to be right. (It’s worth noting here -- though it doesn’t affect the rating of these claims -- that overall drug-related arrests per 100,000 have declined by nearly 11 percent over the same time frame.)

We could be harder on Bovett’s number here and use the November 2006 figure of 23.7 per 100,000, which would cut into the decline somewhat, leaving it at 28 percent.

That said, it seems reasonable that it might take some time for the new law to really take hold and for current manufacturers to run out of whatever back-stock they might have held at the time. Even so, 28 percent is still a pretty nice drop and not all that far from 32 percent.

For our rating, Bovett’s statistics hold up to scrutiny: Since our prescription-only law went into effect, we have, in fact, seen meth lab incidents decline by 96 percent and meth-related arrests dip by about 32 percent. We rate Bovett’s claim True.

Donald Trump says South Korea doesn't pay United States for troop presence
","
A whirlwind media tour by Donald Trump -- the flamboyant businessman, reality show star and possible Republican presidential candidate -- took him to ABC’s The View on March 23, 2011. Trump discussed everything from the dynamics of the Republican primary field to his own personal life. But we were particularly intrigued by his comments on U.S. military support for South Korea, which came up in a discussion of U.S. intervention in Libya.

""If you look at North Korea, South Korea, we're protecting South Korea,"" Trump said. ""They're making a fortune. Let's call it hundreds of billions of dollars of profit on us. We have 25,000 soliders over there protecting them. They don't pay us. Why don't they pay us?""

First, some preliminaries.

Trump’s reference to ""hundreds of billions of dollars of profit"" sounds plausible to us, if you look at the size of South Korea’s gross domestic product -- $832 billion in 2009, according to the World Bank -- and consider the existential threat to the nation posed by North Korea, the heavily armed and unstable dictatorship on its border.

Meanwhile, Trump’s estimate of 25,000 soldiers is not far off: A Pentagon spokeswoman, Cmdr. Leslie Hull-Ryde, said there are approximately 28,500 U.S. service members stationed in South Korea today. Nick Sarantakes, a professor of strategy and policy at the U.S. Naval War College, notes that a majority of U.S. personnel based in Korea are actually in the Air Force, so Trump is technically wrong to use the term ""soldiers,"" which refers to Army troops.

But that's not the focus of our fact-check. We were curious if he's correct that South Korea does not reimburse the U.S. for those troops.

First, we should note that the number of U.S. service members is dwarfed by the more than 500,000 South Korean service members on active duty, plus many more South Korean reserve troops.

""The South Koreans defend themselves,"" said Allan R. Millett, a historian and director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. ""We do the high-tech things so they can have more shooters.""

But do they pay for the U.S. help?

Indeed, they do. South Korea has regularly signed agreements spelling out its ""burden sharing"" responsibility for U.S. troops. The current agreement, which was signed by representatives of the two governments in January 2009, covers the five-year period between 2009 and 2013.

The financial burden South Korea must shoulder, converted into dollars, is about $694 million. That amount will rise for each of the succeeding four years at an amount pegged to inflation. The prior agreement covered 2007 and 2008, with payments totaling $664 million and $678 million in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

The payments by South Korea fall into several sub-categories. Labor cost sharing, paid in cash, accounts for about 41 percent of the total. Logistics cost sharing, which is paid in kind, accounts for about 18 percent. And construction programs, which are a combination of cash and in-kind payments, account for the remaining 41 percent of the costs.

Trump’s statement that South Korea doesn’t ""pay us"" is a sweeping statement that suggests they get U.S. protection for free. But in fact, they are paying the U.S. hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

It should be noted that some have questioned whether South Korea is paying enough. Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan Administration Defense Department official who is now a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress, recalls that there’s been frustration on that point dating back to at least the administration of President Jimmy Carter.

But if Trump’s point is that we’re giving something away for free, experts note that the U.S. benefits from our military investment in South Korea, too. We’re not only helping protect a major trading partner, but the U.S. presence in South Korea is aimed at preventing a crisis that could have significant economic, military and humanitarian consequences around the globe.

""We are in the Republic of Korea for our own national goals, deterring a regional war"" between some combination of China, Russia, Taiwan, North Korea and Japan, Millett said.

When we contacted Trump’s organization, Michael Cohen, his political aide, said that the point Trump was making is that ""we have no money … and yet here we are playing police officer to the entire world, and we do it at whose expense?""

But Trump’s statement on The View is incorrect. South Korea has signed an agreement to cover labor, logistical and construction costs running into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. That may or may not be a big enough payment, but Trump is wrong to suggest that South Korea bears no financial burden at all. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-south-korea-doesnt-pay-us-troop-/

Jeff Stone says Chris Abele, opponent in Milwaukee County executive race, dropped out of three separate colleges
","
If philanthropist Chris Abele is elected April 5, 2011, he would become the second consecutive Milwaukee County executive without a college degree, following in Scott Walker’s footsteps.

But did he drop out of college three times?

His opponent, Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), makes that claim in a campaign flier that hit mailboxes the last week of March.

The flier recites a litany of newspaper stories that exposed issues from Abele’s past. We decided to zero in on the college degree one because questions remain about Abele’s academic career.

Abele pointedly evaded questions about why he didn’t finish at Lawrence University during a high-profile campaign appearance March 17, 2011.

So did Abele ""drop out"" three times?

We asked Stone to explain. After all, his flier cites as support a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that only discusses Abele’s departure from Lawrence without a degree.

Stone’s campaign manager, Vi Rowley Hammelman, pointed us to a 2005 Milwaukee Magazine profile that outlined the schools Abele had attended.

She said it was fair to say Abele ""dropped out"" of three schools -- Lawrence, Bennington and Boston University -- because he didn’t finish at those schools and ultimately did not get enough credits to earn a degree.

The basic information on Abele’s college days is incomplete.

It’s not clear how many credits Abele earned in his college career, which his campaign says ended at Lawrence but spanned at least three institutions from 1986 to 1994. Abele campaign spokesman Brandon Lorenz said he did not know how many credits short Abele was when he left Lawrence in 1994.

He said the campaign would not have time on short notice to find an academic transcript, and could not provide a résumé.

""Chris doesn’t have a résumé,"" Lorenz said. ""That’s why we can’t provide one to you.""

Let’s take a look, college by college. 

In 2002, Abele was referred to as a Lawrence graduate in The Business Journal’s story on a move to Milwaukee of the Argosy Foundation, run by Abele’s family. Similarly, a 2002 online newsletter posted by a national nonprofit referred to Abele as a graduate, citing his bio. A 2003 Journal Sentinel profile of Abele said only that Abele ""went to"" Lawrence.

Milwaukee Magazine reported in a Feb. 1, 2005, profile that the official biography Abele provided the magazine’s reporter said he graduated from Lawrence. That graduation claim was refuted by Lawrence officials in 2005, and they recently confirmed that for PolitiFact Wisconsin.

In our review, we found no evidence Abele has continued to circulate an inaccurate biography.

Lorenz, the Abele spokesman, didn’t dispute the ""dropout"" characterization in relation to Lawrence and Bennington.

He mildly challenged the term in relation to Boston University, saying, ""if you are not a full-time student I’m not sure how to characterize that as dropping out.""

Hammelman responded: ""Tell him to prove"" he went part time at BU.

The Stone campaign did not consider Abele’s 1992 summer school courses in making its claim. Abele enrolled in two extension courses through Harvard University. Harvard officials said their records showed he did not complete the courses.

We asked Abele’s campaign about Boston University and about his official bio.

Regarding BU, Lorenz would say only that Abele was contemplating a major in music at the time.

Regarding Abele’s biography, Lorenz provided a Feb. 15, 2005, letter to Milwaukee Magazine written on behalf of Abele by an Argosy Foundation official.

The letter says Abele’s bio ""is compiled and sent out by assistants in the office, not Chris. However, Chris takes fulI responsibility for any errors and sincerely apologizes to anyone who feels they've been misled or that he was being dishonest.""

Time for a final grade.

Stone -- who officials at public Washburn University in Kansas say earned a bachelor’s degree in 1983 -- claims Abele ""failed to finish"" at three schools, ""dropping out"" each time.

Abele does not dispute that he did not finish college, and confirms he attended the three schools Stone cites. His campaign takes issue with the ""drop out"" charge only in the context of Boston University.

If we could determine that Abele entered Boston University intending to continue toward a degree, Stone’s claim would likely rate True. Since we’re looking at a Stone claim, the burden of proof is on him. Of course, it’s Abele who won’t provide the crucial details -- and the full context about his college history and background.

That puts us -- barring new information -- at Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/01/jeff-stone/jeff-stone-says-chris-abele-opponent-milwaukee-cou/
