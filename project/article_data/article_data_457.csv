Herd immunity curbed COVID deaths? No
","There is no vaccine to protect against COVID-19.  So, is it possible a naturally occurring ""herd immunity"" has, in effect, inoculated much of California, keeping the number of the state’s coronavirus deaths a fraction of those in New York? That’s the claim of a lengthy Facebook post, titled ""CV-19 Hoax Update."" It starts with this: ""Do you wonder why CA only has 559 CV19 deaths compared to 7,067 deaths in NY? Welp, researchers at Stanford's School of Medicine suspect it's because CA had already developed ‘herd immunity’ to the virus. They're now conducting a study to find this out. Makes sense. … Building ‘herd immunity’ is the only way to get rid of a virus when there is no vaccine."" The post also claims that California is a leading tourist destination for people from China and theorizes that the virus has been ""kicking around"" California ""since October or November."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Herd immunity, also called ""herd protection,"" is a real phenomenon. It’s when the percentage of the population immune to a virus becomes so high that the virus virtually dies off. But experts, pointing to how relatively little testing is being done, say there is no evidence of herd immunity for COVID-19 anywhere, let alone just in California. The numbers of COVID-19 deaths cited in the April 10 Facebook post — 559 in California and 7,067 — were accurate. News reports at the time cited those figures from Johns Hopkins University.  That means New York had more than 12 times as many coronavirus deaths, even though its population is only about one-half that of California. Think of herd immunity as being a situation in which so many people — above 50% to perhaps 70% — are immune to a virus that it essentially stops spreading. It occurs when enough people in a community become immune through vaccination and/or prior illness, making the spread of the disease from person to person unlikely, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology says. The theory is that once many people develop immunity, the virus will eventually stop spreading to people who haven’t yet caught it.  It’s not easy to achieve.  Based on testing, even hard-hit Wuhan, China, where the virus was first detected Dec. 31, 2019, isn’t close to achieving herd immunity, the Wall Street Journal reported on April 16, 2020.  And in the days after the Facebook post, California Gov. Gavin Newsom talked about herd immunity as an aspiration for his state, not as something that has spared it. The Facebook post argues that it makes sense that California would have herd immunity because so many people travel there from China. It alludes to a Stanford University study as evidence. That study, which tested for coronavirus antibodies among 3,300 people in Santa Clara County, Calif., on April 3 and 4, 2020, was aimed at determining how many people in the county had unknowingly been infected with the virus, but didn’t become seriously sick.  Newsom said the project would show ""how far away we are from herd immunity."" The study concluded that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases — an estimated 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected in the county by early April, 50 to 85 times more than the number of confirmed cases. That’s likely due to several factors, including early spread, lack of systematic testing, and asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic cases that were previously undetected, the study said. But the study’s findings are not evidence that California has herd immunity, Dr. David Hamer, an expert on infectious diseases and global health and medicine professor at Boston University, told PolitiFact. Experts told PolitiFact that, because relatively little COVID-19 testing has been done, there simply is no evidence of herd immunity for COVID-19. ""We just don't have the testing data yet to determine who is protected. So, we are still not there in terms of declaring herd immunity,"" said Melissa Brown, professor of microbiology/immunology at Northwestern University.  Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University in New York, agreed. ""Since almost all of the testing is done only on sick (symptomatic) people, presumably due to limitations in testing capacity, and only a very few counties are testing more widely, we don’t know the level of immunity in either California or New York,"" he said. ""Therefore, we can’t say anything about herd immunity, as we simply don’t know."" While the federal and state governments are building up their testing capabilities, ""it’s not clear how good all these tests are,"" said Hamer. ""And we don’t have a clearly defined test to tell whether a person has had the disease"" and also has antibodies to protect from getting COVID-19 again. As a number of news reports have suggested, experts also told us that one explanation for California’s lower death toll is that it adopted stay-at-home orders and other responses before New York did. A widely shared post on Facebook claims herd immunity is probably why California has far fewer COVID-19 deaths than New York. Experts say that with relatively little testing having been done, there is no evidence to indicate that herd immunity explains the large gap in coronavirus deaths in the two states. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB37B40>],/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/herd-immunity-curbed-covid-deaths-no/

Fact-check: Hospitals and COVID-19 payments
","An article shared on Facebook questions whether the count of COVID-19 patients is inflated, saying hospitals have a financial incentive to claim that a patient has the virus. ""Hospitals get paid more to list patients as COVID-19 — 3 times as much if put on ventilator,"" the story’s headline states. The article was posted on WorldNetDaily, a conservative news website. It was produced by The Spectator, which describes itself as a conservative publication. The Spectator reported on comments made by Dr. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota physician and Republican state senator, in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Jensen said on Fox News that doctors are being encouraged to cite COVID-19 as a cause of death on death certificates and he suggested that money is a motivation. Medicare has determined that a hospital gets paid $13,000 if a COVID-19 patient on Medicare is admitted and $39,000 if the patient goes on a ventilator, he claimed. Jensen did not respond to our request for information. The federal government has decided to pay hospitals more for treating COVID-19 patients. But it isn’t a windfall in the way the headline suggests. And there is no indication that hospitals are over-identifying patients as having COVID-19. If anything, evidence suggests the illness is being underdiagnosed.  Medicare pays for inpatient hospital stays using a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system. The hospital assigns a code to a patient at the time of discharge, based mainly on the patient’s main diagnosis and treatment given.  Medicare then pays the hospital a prescribed amount of money — regardless of what it actually cost the hospital to provide the care. The amount can vary in different parts of the country to account for labor costs and other factors. The dollar amounts Jensen cited are roughly what we found in an analysis published April 7 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading source of health information. (Kaiser Health News, which partners with PolitiFact on health fact-checking, is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) There isn’t a Medicare diagnostic code specifically for COVID-19. Using payment rates for similar respiratory conditions, Kaiser estimated the average Medicare payment at $13,297 for a less severe hospitalization and $40,218 for hospitalization in which a patient is treated with a ventilator for at least 96 hours.  ""A COVID patient on a ventilator will need more services and more complicated services, not just the ventilator,"" said Joseph Antos, scholar in health care at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It is reasonable that a patient who is on a ventilator would cost three times one who isn't that sick."" Medicare will pay hospitals a 20% ""add-on"" to the regular DRG payment for COVID-19 patients. That’s a result of the CARES Act, the largest of the three federal stimulus laws enacted in response to the coronavirus, which was signed into law March 27. ""This is no scandal,"" Antos said. ""The 20% was added by Congress because hospitals have lost revenue from routine care and elective surgeries that they can't provide during this crisis, and because the cost of providing even routine services to COVID patients has jumped."" Julie Aultman, a member of the editorial board of the American Medical Association’s AMA Journal of Ethics, told PolitiFact it is ""very unlikely that physicians or hospitals will falsify data or be motivated by money to do so."" ""There are strict policies for reporting and, quite frankly, healthcare workers are only focusing on helping their patients and doing as much as they can with little resources,"" said Aultman, who is director of the medical ethics and humanities program at Northeast Ohio Medical University. ""Ohio is reporting confirmed and suspected cases and so this is how our providers are responding to their patients -- they are being very transparent about confirmed versus suspected."" As for the suggestion that there is an overcount of COVID-19 cases, ""the data has suggested that, in fact, there’s a significant undercount of deaths due to COVID,"" Jennifer Kates, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s director of global health & HIV policy, told PolitiFact. Here are some of those indications: Strict federal definition: Until April 14, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted as COVID-19 deaths only those in which the coronavirus was confirmed in a laboratory test — even as testing was not widely available; now, CDC counts probable cases and deaths. The day the change was announced, New York City’s COVID-19 death tally soared by more than 3,700 when it included in its total the deaths of people who were suspected of having COVID-19 but were never tested.  Surge in total deaths: The Economist reported on ""excess mortality,"" which is the gap between the total number of people who died from any cause during a given period, and the historical average for the same place and time of year. In New York City, for the four-week period ending March 28, there was an excess of about 1,400 deaths, compared with 1,100 official COVID-19 fatalities. A post shared on Facebook claims hospitals have a financial incentive to claim patients had COVID-19, saying payment is three times higher if a patient goes on a ventilator. An article the post links to includes comments from a doctor who suggests the number of coronavirus cases is being padded. It is standard for Medicare to pay roughly three times more for a patient with a respiratory condition who goes on a ventilator than for one who does not. That has nothing to do with the coronavirus. As part of a federal stimulus bill, Medicare is paying hospitals 20% more than standard rates for COVID-19 patients. Indications are that due to a lack of testing and other factors, the number of coronavirus cases has been undercounted, not padded.

Yes, this really is a photo of Jacksonville Beach during the pandemic
","On April 17, with the blessing of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the mayor of Jacksonville announced that beaches would reopen in Duval County, where Jacksonville is the county seat. As Floridians returned to the coastline, and local and national reporters published photos of people on the sandy shore, an unflattering hashtag started to trend on Twitter: #FloridaMorons. Elsewhere on social media, some took offense and claimed outlets were using an old photo that made it look like more people were descending on Jacksonville Beach than there actually were. ""I live in Florida & just to clarify,"" began one Facebook post showing two beach photos. ""The first picture is what was circulated as the ‘hundreds of people crowding the beach’ when Jacksonville Beach reopened from 5 pm to 8 pm on Friday. However, the picture shows the pier that no longer exists, as shown after the last couple of hurricane seasons. Half of the pier is now gone. The second picture is what the beach actually looked like Friday evening."" ""Once again the media is giving the public fake news,"" said another post making the same case with the same photos. ""They are lying again.""  These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The photo in question was taken on April 17. The caption of the photo, which we found on the Getty Images website, says: ""People crowded the beaches in its first open hour on April 17, 2020 in Jacksonville Beach, Fl."" Vic Micolucci, a reporter for WJXT, a local TV station in Jacksonville, tried to explain on Facebook on April 19 how that photo could look so different from some of the other images from the beach in which people look like they are, in fact, practicing social distancing. He posted eight photos: The one from Getty, a still from a WJXT video on the beach and a still from a WJXT video from a helicopter, photos from the Panasonic video camera that was used for WJXT’s live coverage — including an image of Micolucci standing on the beach with the pier in the background — and iPhone photos. The Jacksonville Beach pier was damaged by Hurricane Matthew in 2016. According to the Florida Times-Union, the last 300 feet of the 1,300-foot structure were destroyed. The pier closed to visitors last year and is being rebuilt to withstand future storms, according to Weather.com.  ""The moral of the story is different cameras, different lenses and different angles make the beach look differently,"" Micolucci said. ""If you take the miles of beaches up and down Duval County, there were indeed thousands of people. However, most kept their distance. And there was a lot of sand. … A helicopter shot looks different from a drone shot which looks different from a telephoto shot which looks different from a smartphone shot. The optics are different. The angles are different. As your car mirrors say, objects may appear further than they are. Use your best judgment."" On April 20, Micolucci posted on Twitter a few photos he took that evening from the spot on Jacksonville Beach where the Getty Images photo was taken.  ""I took first 2 photos with my iPhone: one zoomed in, one wide,"" Micolucci wrote on Twitter. The third shot is from our ENG camera. Same location for all. Different perspectives."" David Rosenblum, the photographer that shot the image in question, told us he was surprised people were claiming the pier in his photo looked the same as it did before it was battered by the hurricane.  ""Biggest giveaway would be the original had three bench/huts and a ‘T’ on the end,"" he said.

Are stay-at-home orders 'laws,' as Jay Inslee said?
","Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who issued some of the earliest social-distancing orders of any governor to combat the spread of the coronavirus, took issue with President Donald Trump’s tweeted solidarity with protesters in several states who were demanding an end to stay-at-home orders. On April 17, Trump tweeted, ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN,"" ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"" and ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA,"" apparently referring to demonstrations at state capitols where protesters called for lifting restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. On the April 19 edition of ABC’s ""This Week,"" host George Stephanopoulos asked Inslee, a Democrat, for his reaction to Trump’s tweets. Inslee responded: ""We have an order from governors, both Republicans and Democrats, that basically are designed to protect people's health, literally their lives, (only) to have a president of the United States basically encourage insubordination, to encourage illegal activity. These orders actually are the law of these states. And, again, these are not just Democrats. These are Republican-led states as well. To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I can't remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing."" We wondered whether it’s accurate to call state stay-at-home orders ""laws,"" and whether they conflict with freedoms of speech and assembly under the First Amendment. So we asked legal experts. They agreed that while most fall under the heading of ""proclamations"" or ""executive orders,"" they were issued under legal authority delegated by legislatures, meaning that have the same practical effect. The orders also would have a good chance of being deemed constitutional in court, they said. By now, most states have issued a stay-at-home order and/or requirements for business closures. (The National Governors Association has the complete list.)  However, most of these were not laws passed by the legislature and signed by the governor — the typical way of passing a state law. Instead, many of them have been made through executive orders, such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, and Illinois. Others have been made in the form of a ""proclamation,"" such as the orders in Louisiana; a ""directive,"" as was issued in Utah; or simply an ""order,"" as in Idaho. In Inslee’s case, he signed a proclamation establishing stay-at-home rules for Washington state. A spokesman for Inslee said, however, that the proclamation was tantamount to a law, because it was made under authority delegated to the governor’s office by another law that had been passed the conventional way. Inslee’s order was enacted under Washington’s emergency powers law, which authorizes him to ""proclaim a state of emergency"" and make a series of prohibitions pursuant to that emergency, such as ""prohibiting ... any person from being on the public streets."" Washington's Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, appeared on the April 19 edition of ABC's ""This Week"" Experts told PolitiFact that despite the linguistic and procedural differences between orders and law, the stay-at-home orders effectively carry the force of law. ""Calling it ‘the law of the state’ is fair,"" said I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor. ""Statutes passed by legislatures are what most people think of when one says ‘laws,’ but from a lawyer’s point of view, a common-law decision by a judge, a regulation, or an action by the governor would all qualify broadly as ‘the law.’"" James G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, called it ""entirely accurate"" to consider an executive order to be a law.  Laws can be derived from a constitution, a statute, a regulation, case law, ""or orders implemented through legal means, including emergency powers invoked by governors."" One thing many orders have in common with laws is enforcement power. Under Inslee’s order, certain violations can result in a misdemeanor. Several other states — including California, Hawaii, Michigan and Oregon — explicitly label violations as potential misdemeanors. New Jersey specifies that violators could be subject to disorderly-conduct charges, carrying imprisonment of up to six months or a fine. (The National Governors Association has a list of selected states’ enforcement powers here.) Just because law enforcement has arrest power in many of these states doesn’t mean they’ll be eager to use it. ""Police can and do enforce stay-at-home orders, but arresting violators and jailing them would defeat the purpose of the order,"" said Nicole Huberfeld, a professor of health law, ethics and human rights at Boston University School of Public Health. Inslee’s spokesman, Mike Faulk, said his boss is not eager to use law-enforcement powers. ""Do we want to bring charges against people? No, we never have,"" Faulk said. ""That’s why we are focused on education and soliciting voluntary compliance before taking legal or regulatory action."" Gubernatorial stay-at-home orders do pose special concerns for First Amendment rights, particularly freedom of assembly. But fundamental rights can be trumped by public health concerns, experts said. In the 1905 case Jacobson v. Massachusetts, for example, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that a mandatory vaccination law was a legitimate exercise of state power to protect public health and safety. As for the First Amendment, there are several longstanding exceptions, including the famous ""falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic"" exception, which dates back to the unanimous 1917 decision in Schenck v. United States. ""Time, place, and manner restrictions on speech, including protests, so long as they are not targeted to a particular message, are frequently upheld,"" Huberfeld said. In addition, she said, ""government authority to protect public health, safety, and welfare tends to be read more expansively during an emergency. While silencing people totally would be questionable, during a pandemic that involves a highly contagious disease, the government may find it necessary to prevent public gatherings until such gatherings are deemed safe by health experts."" Hodge agreed. ""The government can shut down protests to the extent they involve physical gatherings of persons in violation of specific state-based emergency orders,"" he said. ""Rights to speech and assembly do not constitutionally include endangering the health of others, especially in pandemic circumstances involving an easily spread, deadly condition like COVID-19."" Inslee said that stay-at-home orders ""actually are the law of these states."" Technically, many have been issued in the form of executive orders or proclamations, rather than a conventional law passed by the legislature and signed by the governor. However, a broad range of legal experts said that executive orders, proclamations and similar orders are equivalent to legislature-passed laws and can be enforced in essentially the same way, and in tandem with existing laws such as disorderly conduct.

No proof (yet) of a post-election “surge” in Wisconsin coronavirus cases
","Wisconsin’s mid-pandemic election was a unique spectacle. The courtroom drama preceding the vote — and Wisconsin’s status as the only state with a primary election around this time that didn’t delay or cancel in-person voting — drew national attention and criticism. The fundamental question was simple: What would this do to the state’s coronavirus trends? Though polling places attempted to institute social distancing, voters said it was impossible to maintain at all times, particularly in Milwaukee and Green Bay where masses of voters were shuttled through just a handful of locations. A few people have tried to answer this question in the time since, including an April 17, 2020, article shared widely on Facebook. The story claimed ""immense consequences"" from in-person voting, with this headline: ""New Virus Cases Surge in Wisconsin a Week After Republicans Forced In-Person Election to Go Forward."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Have confirmed coronavirus cases really surged after the in-person election? No, they haven’t. At least not yet. Here’s what we found.  The article, posted by the website Second Nexus, pulled its sole statistical evidence from a tweet by Topher Spiro, a health policy analyst with more than 100,000 followers on Twitter. He posted a chart showing a dip in the number of positive cases on April 13, followed by increases each of the next three days. The accompanying text said, ""Check out the uptick in transmission the GOP caused by forcing an in-person election in Wisconsin."" People who contract COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, typically don’t start showing symptoms for about five days. A study of 181 cases in China found the median incubation period — time before symptoms show — was five days, and only 1% first showed symptoms after 14 days (hence the standard 14-day quarantine). Spiro and the Second Nexus story are starting with a point a week after the April 7 election and saying the increase in new cases is connected.  But there are several critical data errors here. First, calling the post-April 13 increase a trend assumes that April 13 is a valid baseline. If the state had been at the April 13 level for some time, then an increase from that level could be proof of a new trend. But that’s not what happened. April 13 was a very unusual day for coronavirus testing. The state administered an average of 1,600 coronavirus tests daily in the first three weeks of April. But on April 13 it administered only 940 — 400 less than any other day. Predictably, with fewer tests came fewer positive results, and a large dip in the number of new confirmed cases. The rise in the days after — identified by the story as proof of the election impact — was actually just a result of the number of tests growing to 1,355, then 1,495, then 1,802 the four days after April 13. Before and after that date, the percentage of tests that came back positive remained about the same: between 9% and 10% When presented with this data, Spiro deleted his tweet. ""It looks like testing has increased since April 13 and the positive rate has remained roughly constant,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The truth is, at the time of the Second Nexus article — and this one — it’s too soon to say what impact the election had on Wisconsin’s coronavirus outbreak. But so far there is no sign of an increase, said Andrea Palm, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. In the state’s daily coronavirus briefing on April 20, 2020, she also noted the time between contracting the disease and being a confirmed case involves more than just the five-day median incubation time. ""I think folks do need to remember sort of the progression of this virus, from infection to symptoms to the conversation with your physician to the test to the test results,"" Palm said. ""It’s not surprising that we have not seen … a large uptick from in-person voting."" RELATED: Tracking coronavirus in Wisconsin If we look closer at the data before and after April 13, we see the state has so far seen no change in the frequency of new cases. The state averaged 153 new cases per day the week before April 13, and 153 the week after. The percentage of tests coming back positive remained relatively consistent throughout that span. And the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 actually dropped, from 431 on April 13 to about 360 every day from April 17-20. That’s not to say the election had no impact. There have been reports of infection potentially linked to the election. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported April 20 that seven people appear to have contracted COVID-19 through activities related to the April 7 election. Six are voters, and one is a poll worker. It’s too soon to say if there will be more, or if they in turn infected others. We don’t even know for sure that polling places are where those seven were infected. But that certainly doesn’t constitute a ""surge."" An article shared widely on Facebook claimed on April 17, 2020, that Wisconsin coronavirus cases had surged as a result of the in-person election. That’s not the case. The data the article cited failed to factor in a drop in the number of tests administered. It wrongly treated an unusually low number of cases on April 13 as a baseline against which to compare the following days’ new cases. The increase cited was in fact connected to an increased number of tests in the following days. We don’t know for sure what impact the election may prove to have, but we do know it’s wrong to say a surge has already surfaced. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7B0B00>],/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/no-proof-yet-post-election-surge-coronavirus-cases/

Still going in to work in Pennsylvania? Chances are, you're a low-wage worker, data show
","In the earliest days of the coronavirus outbreak, when public officials scrambled to close schools and businesses, a Facebook user lamented the inequity of the quarantine that Gov. Tom Wolf had imposed on Pennsylvanians. ""The poor are, ironically, the most likely to be employed in the industries deemed ‘essential’ while their upper-class peers are freed to bunker down for weeks until the first death wave passes,"" the Facebook user wrote on March 18. We wondered whether this claim would hold up when we looked at the data. Starting with Wolf’s executive order forcing all non-life-sustaining businesses to close, we pulled U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information on the number of Pennsylvania workers in each essential industry and calculated their average annual wages. The Facebook user is right. The vast majority of life-sustaining workers earn low and working-class wages. A quarter of Pennsylvania’s essential workers make less than $30,000 annually, and two-thirds make less than the state’s household median of $60,000, raising questions about whether the people keeping the rest of society afloat are being sufficiently protected and compensated. Grocery stores employ one of the largest groups of workers making the lowest wages. There are more than 120,000 grocery store workers in Pennsylvania, the data shows, and average annual wages for the sector are about $23,000. Gas stations, assisted living centers and building maintenance firms are among the other essential businesses employing large numbers of low-wage workers across the state. Philadelphia-area grocers including Giant, Acme and Aldi recently started limiting the number of shoppers allowed in their stores at once to protect workers. Still, across the country, dozens of grocery clerks have already been sickened with the virus. And a Trader Joe’s worker in Scarsdale, N.Y., a greeter at a Giant store in Largo, Md., and two Walmart employees from the same Chicago-area store have died from the coronavirus in recent days. Acknowledging how vulnerable essential workers are, Wolf recently announced new rules aimed at preventing the virus from spreading in businesses open to in-person customers. Grocery stores must now make all workers and customers wear masks and start taking employees’ temperatures if a worker tests positive. But even as the state rolled out these new protections, it hasn’t done any more to ensure that the workers Wolf deemed essential are fairly compensated besides asking employers to step up and do the right thing. Wolf called fair pay for essential workers ""the responsibility of the private sector."" Among the grocers that operate in the Philadelphia area, several chains, including Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Wegmans, Fresh Grocer, Giant Eagle and Acme have started offering workers bonuses or higher hourly wages to their workers because of the coronavirus outbreak. The second part of the Facebook post addresses the perk the user believes white collar workers have enjoyed since Wolf ordered millions of Pennsylvanians to stay at home – the freedom to work from home. Federal data from a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on the share of workers who say they’re able to telecommute shows a stark divide among industries, The Washington Post reported About 60 percent of people who said they work in ""management, business and financial operations"" said they can work from home. But fewer than 10 percent of workers said they could do so in categories such as ""services,"" ""construction and extraction,"" ""installation, maintenance and repair,"" ""production"" and ""transportation and material moving."" The Post also found divisions along race and class lines. Thirty-seven percent of Asian Americans and 30 percent of whites said they could work remotely. But only 20 percent of African Americans and 16 percent of Hispanics said they had that ability. Almost 52 percent of those with a college education or higher said they could work from home, but only 4 percent of those with less than a high school diploma said they could. The Facebook post stated that the poor are the most likely to be employed in essential industries while workers who earn more are free to shelter at home until the outbreak subsides. Our data analysis shows that the vast majority of workers Wolf deemed essential earn low and working class wages, and a recent analysis by The Washington Post shows that many white collar workers say they’re able to telecommute. For these reasons, we rate the Facebook post True. An earlier version of this article excluded several Philadelphia-area grocers that have offered employees bonuses or higher salaries.The story has been updated. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EACB3300>],/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/still-going-work-pennsylvania-chances-are-youre-lo/

A website glitch is fueling a conspiracy theory about coronavirus coverage
","Hundreds of beach-goers in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., hit the sand after the mayor decided to ease some social distancing policies. But a conspiracy theory on Facebook calls foul on the media for using what appears to be the same photo to report on beaches of the east and west coasts.  One post published April 19 shows two screenshots of news stories that appear to have the same lead image. The photo shows a beach crowded with people, not all of whom are staying six feet apart. But one headline is about Los Angeles County and the other is about Jacksonville Beach. ""How did all these SAME EXACT PEOPLE go to two different beaches and walk exactly the same?!"" reads the caption on the post. ""Media!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 12,000 times. (Screenshot from Facebook) We’ve fact-checked several hoaxes about the media exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus pandemic. So we wanted to check this post out, too. In this case, the reason for the matching photos appears to be much less interesting than a media conspiracy: It was a website malfunction. The Facebook post includes screenshots of two articles about the coronavirus: one from the New York Post about Jacksonville Beach and one about Los Angeles on a news aggregation site called News Break. The original article about Los Angeles was published by NBC News on April 18 as part of the outlet’s coronavirus live blog. The headline is not fully visible in the side-by-side, but on the NBC News website it reads: ""Los Angeles County records highest daily death toll."" The photo is real — but it was taken in Jacksonville, not Los Angeles. And we could find no evidence that any news outlets have used the image in coverage about the coronavirus in California. A Getty Images photographer took the photo in Jacksonville Beach on April 17 — the same day that Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry reopened Duval County beaches for restricted hours. The New York Post published that photo in its story about Florida, but it doesn’t appear anywhere in the NBC News story about Los Angeles.  The Jacksonville Beach photo does not appear in News Break’s version of the NBC News story either. Its site shows an image of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.  The image of Murphy appears to come from an April 18 press conference, which NBC News covered further down in its live blog. Sometimes when a link to a news story is shared on Facebook, the platform erroneously uses another image from that webpage as the share image. We tried sharing News Break’s version of the NBC News story. Facebook automatically pulled in the image of Murphy. (Screenshot from Facebook) We could not find the Getty Images photo included in any news stories about Los Angeles County.  News aggregation apps like News Break have seen an increase in downloads amid the coronavirus pandemic. It’s possible the same glitch that erroneously attached a photo of Murphy to NBC News’ story about Los Angeles also attached the Jacksonville Beach photo at some point.  Either way, the photo from Jacksonville Beach is a real one by Getty. We saw no evidence that it was repurposed from media coverage on the West Coast or vice versa.

News photo of stay-at-home protest was not doctored
","Conspiracies about mainstream news media are flourishing amid the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""What a bunch of BS,"" screamed a Facebook post about a news photo from a Wisconsin rally against stay-at-home orders. Sharing two images from the demonstration, the post essentially claims the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel doctored a photo to put a Confederate Battle Flag in the hands of one protester. But the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel did not alter its photo.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what happened. The Journal Sentinel, which publishes PolitiFact Wisconsin, posted a news story about the April 18 rally in Brookfield, a Milwaukee suburb. Nearly 1,000 people packed the sidewalk adjacent to a busy thoroughfare, most shoulder to shoulder, to protest Gov. Tony Evers’ decision to extend Wisconsin’s safer-at-home order until May 26. The Facebook post shows two photographs from the rally side by side — one from the Journal Sentinel and one said to be taken by the poster’s daughter.  The Journal Sentinel photo shows a man wearing a plaid shirt and jeans among a group of people and holding two flags — a Confederate flag and just above it, a yellow flag that is harder to make out.  The other photo with the post shows a man, also in a plaid shirt and jeans, who is not so close to other people. He is clearly holding only a yellow flag. The implication is that in its photo, the Journal Sentinel added the Confederate flag into the man’s hands. The two-flag photo is one of 13 images in a photo gallery that accompanied the Journal Sentinel’s news story about the protest.  After Facebook posts appeared making the specious claim, the Journal Sentinel published an article denying that its photo was doctored. The article explained what happened: On April 18, the reporter who wrote the news story sent the photo in question from his iPhone to an editor who loaded it directly into the Journal Sentinel's publishing system. The photo shows the man holding a yellow Don't Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag together on one pole.  On April 19, a Journal Sentinel photo editor examined the photo and determined it was never edited in Photoshop, even to receive the basic color-toning for reproduction. The article also pointed out that other images taken at the rally, including two videos posted on social media, show a man with the two flags. it has gotten much larger pic.twitter.com/vaOtRMrnxf (Confederate flag is visible at the 9-second mark in this tweeted video.) One video shows a man wearing a plaid shirt and baseball cap, holding just a Don't Tread on Me flag, a few feet away from the man holding the Don’t Tread on Me and the Confederate flags.  Another video also shows a Confederate flag flying below a Don't Tread on Me flag, with another Don't Tread on Me flag nearby. The Journal Sentinel reporter on the scene also captured an image in which both men can be seen. The photos are time-stamped at 11:40 and 11:41 a.m. PolitiFact did an Error Level Analysis on the image in question, using FotoForensics, and found that the flags and the people were part of the same JPEG compression. The photo’s metadata also does not show that Photoshop was used. In English: There’s no forensic evidence that the image was doctored.  A Facebook post showing two photographs from a rally that protested coronavirus stay-at-home orders suggests that one of the photos, taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was doctored. Our analysis found the photo, which shows one man holding a Don’t Tread on Me flag and a Confederate flag, was not altered. The person is visible in several other posts we found that were not from the newspaper.

Cuomo accurately says that other countries that reopened saw an increase in coronavirus infections
","During a recent press briefing regarding Covid-19 in New York state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the economy must be reopened and that people need to get back to work. But, he said the rate of infection is currently being kept down because people are staying in their homes.  ""And if you start acting differently, you will see a corresponding increase in that rate of infection. And the worst scenario would be if we did all of this, we got that number down, everybody went to extraordinary means, and then we go to reopen and we reopen too fast or we reopen and there’s unanticipated consequences, and we see that number go up again,"" he said.  He warned that people who think he is being ""hyper-cautious"" should look at what is happening in other countries and their responses to the new coronavirus.  ""Go look at other countries that went through exactly this, started to reopen, and then they saw the infection rate go back up again,"" he said.   Since talk of reopening, and the possible dangers of doing so, dominates headlines across the United States and around the world, we wondered about whether other countries have already experienced a second surge in infections after relaxing lockdown orders for people, schools, businesses, and borders.  In Asia, authorities have been dealing with Covid-19 for more months than the United States has, and they have more experience in responding to the virus.  In some cases, the number of infections in a city or country has increased after welcoming inbound travelers, or after a relaxing of social distancing measures.  In Hong Kong, an early response seemed to contain the virus, and then life resumed as people returned to work and restaurants.  ""With most everyone’s guard down, the predator lashed back last week. Cases of Covid-19 surged,"" STAT News reported on March 26. The government ordered people back home, and closed facilities that had been reopened.    In Hong Kong, it ""soon became clear that while the majority were coming from overseas, quarantine measures in place were not sufficient, and local transmission had resumed,"" CNN reported on March 23.  In Hokkaido, Japan, an island prefecture, social distancing measures were relaxed, and then there was a sudden increase in new coronavirus cases, according to news reports.  ""Hokkaido declared a three-week state of emergency in February that was lifted on March 19,"" NPR reported. ""The prefecture had begun to reopen schools and was even allowing carefully orchestrated public gatherings. But the latest order reverses all that, asking residents once again to refrain from nonessential trips outside their homes and closing prefectural primary and secondary schools until May 6."" Unlike in some other Asian countries, there was no evidence that the uptick in Hokkaido was because the virus was re-imported from outside Japan, the BBC reported. A lack of testing also contributed to health authorities’ inability to track and contain the virus, according to the BBC.   There is a surge in coronavirus cases in Singapore, which is concentrated in foreign worker dorms, where people live in close quarters. It's not clear whether the migrant workers arrived with the virus, or if it had been circulating among that population for some time, CNN reported.  Singapore has had to impose stricter measures to contain the virus.  We consulted with an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, on what is happening in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Hakkaido, Japan, and whether Cuomo’s statement is accurate.  ""We are definitely seeing rises in cases in those places,"" said Stephen Kissler, Ph.D., a research fellow in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. Kissler is a co-author of a paper that stated that ""prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022."" He said he is hesitant to link the increase solely to lifting social distancing measures, because there are a lot of reasons cases could rise after a period of sustained low transmission.  ""But on the whole I would say that the statement is correct,"" Kissler said.  Cuomo didn’t say that all countries had increased infections after they reopened, and he also didn’t say explicitly that reopening caused the increase in the statement we fact-checked. He said that people who are anxious to reopen should be aware that there are cases where other countries reopened and then saw the infection rate increase.   There have been reports of increased infection rates in some countries that reopened.  We rate Cuomo’s claim True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE85900>],/factchecks/2020/apr/20/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-accurately-says-other-countries-reopened-saw/

Georgia on pace for 1,200 roadway deaths?
","PolitiFact Georgia was revving up for the summer driving season when a statement from the head of the Georgia Department of Transportation caught our attention. The state is on pace to see 1,200 people lose their lives on Georgia roads this year, Commissioner Russell McMurry said in news reports. If that happens, it would be a reversal after nine years of declines. Is that possible, even before the busy season of summer? We set aside our packing – we’ll decide on a bikini or one-piece later – and decided to check. As recently as January, PolitiFact Georgia confirmed that road fatalities appeared to be declining again in Georgia. But by April, when five Georgia Southern nursing students died in a pileup crash outside Savannah, scores of single-car crashes had sent the trend line in the other direction. As of Tuesday morning, 465 people had been killed in vehicle crashes in Georgia, state DOT data show. That’s 69 more deaths, or 17 percent more, than during the same period in 2014. That keeps Georgia with an average of 100 deaths a month, which would result in a year-end total of 1,200 deaths for the first time since 2011. It would also be the first year-to-year increase in nine years, as this chart shows: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Totals 1,505 1,298 1,250 1,236 1,199 1,189 1,169 So the GDOT commissioner is right on the overall numbers – a scary enough prospect. But to compare apples to apples, it’s worth calculating the rates of death as well. That is, would the current pace create the first year deaths don’t decline relative to the number of cars on the road, too? Yes, according to data from the state Department of Revenue. The number of vehicles registered annually is: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Totals* 8.64 8.57 8.59 8.71 8.92 8.32 8.80 9.12 *In millions, rounded In 2008, there were about 8.6 million registered vehicles in Georgia. That translates into 1.7 deaths for every 10,000 registered car or truck. In 2014, with nearly 8.8 million registered vehicles but fewer fatalities, the rate dropped to .1.3 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles. Should Georgia stay on pace to an even 1,200 deaths – improbable but an exact number to compare against the 9.1 million vehicles registered this year – the rate holds at 1.3 deaths. It’s not an increase, of course. But it’s not the steady decline in rate, as well as overall numbers, that transportation officials had hoped to see continue and that McMurry noted. And, the rate still means that more people are dying in traffic accidents at a time when the state has seen 95 percent compliance in seat belt usage – a large factor in reducing fatalities, said Teri Pope, a spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region. DOT data shows that 62 percent of people killed in crashes are not wearing the simple safety devices. ""A lot of these deaths are preventable, and that’s the heartbreaking part of it,"" Pope said. In other words, driver behavior is the, well, driver of the spike in roadway deaths. In an effort to counter that, the DOT has partnered with the Governor’s Office on Highway Safety and the state Department of Public Safety to launch the Drive Alert, Arrive Alive campaign. The effort focuses on education efforts about the dangers of driving drowsy or while using mobile phones – both considered distracted driving – and greater enforcement of seat belt usage and safe driving. In other words, PolitiFact Georgia expects to see lots of safety reminder signs and state troopers on the roads. You should, too. Our ruling Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell McMurry said in recent news reports that the state is on pace to see 1,200 people die in traffic accidents this year – all before the start of the busy summer driving season. Transportation numbers back up that claim. That data, and figures about the number of registered vehicles in the state, also confirm that would be the first time in nine years that Georgia has not seen a decline in those deaths. We rate the commissioner’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC93B580>],/factchecks/2015/may/20/russell-mcmurry/already-deadly-georgia-roads/

Scott Walker says it was Thomas Jefferson who uttered the 'governs least' quote
","On his personal Twitter account, Gov. Scott Walker has been posting a number of tweets lately that espouse conservative principles. Some of the most recent ones were ""Stop the spending"" messages, with pictures of President Barack Obama, as well as Ronald Reagan quotes and a pro-gun rights sentiment. (There was also a tweet with a math error -- which was quickly criticized and corrected -- saying ""It's hard to believe that it has been 505 years since the first settlers arrived at Jamestown.""

Jody Hice, R-Georgia, who at the time was running for the seat he now holds. Hice attributed this quote to Jefferson in a tweet: ""That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves."" Our colleagues rated Hice’s claim False.   ""That sounds like something that he might have said or written, but in fact, he did not,"" Anna Berkes, the research librarian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, said at the time. Meanwhile, the quote Walker used is so often misattributed to Jefferson that it appears on the ""Spurious quotations"" page of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s website. That page says of the quote: ""Although the ideas expressed in this quotation may be in line with Jefferson's opinions to some extent, the exact phrasing is almost certainly not Jefferson's.  However, this quotation has been associated with the ideological descendants of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party for a very long time, and this is likely why it ultimately came to be attributed to him."" Berkes told PolitiFact Georgia that the quote used by Walker has also been attributed to Henry David Thoreau. But she said research indicates Thoreau was likely quoting the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where the sentiment first appeared in 1837. Berkes told us that she has done some further research and it's still clear the quote isn't Jefferson's. We also found that ""Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations"" also attributes the quote to the United States Magazine and Democratic Review.

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'Akbar Al Baker']","
Qatar Airways leader off the mark
","Some harsh words have been hurled by the CEOs at the forefront of what some say is a struggle for dominance of international aviation. They include recent remarks from Akbar Al Baker, chief of Qatar Airways, suggesting that his airline flies airplanes that are superior to those flown by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines by virtue of their age. ""I am delighted that (CEO) Richard Anderson of Delta is not here,"" Al Baker said in an interview March 16. ""First of all, we don’t fly crap airplanes that are 35 years old. The Qatar Airways average fleet (age) is only four years and one month."" PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Al Baker’s claim. But first a little background. Al Baker first made the unflattering claim about Delta’s fleet when he met with a reporter to address a complaint being spearheaded by Anderson. The complaint accuses three major Middle East airlines -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar -- of receiving $42 billion in ""unfair"" subsidies. Delta, United and American Airlines say the subsidies give the Gulf carriers an unfair advantage and are allowing them to expand around the world. Qatar Airways currently flies into Washington D.C., Chicago, New York, Houston, Miami and Dallas and is scheduled next year to launch service to Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta. Al Baker denies receiving any ""subsidies."" ""The state of Qatar is the owner of Qatar Airways and whatever funds are put into the airline is as equity, which is quite legitimate,"" he has said. Al Baker and Anderson sparred earlier this year after the Gulf carriers complained that some U.S. airlines received their own subsidies in the form of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and federal loan guarantees and aid after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. U.S. airlines countered that bankruptcy is not a subsidy, and the restructuring process is transparent. Anderson in February told CNN: ""It's a great irony to have the United Arab Emirates from the Arabian peninsula talk about [bailouts for U.S. airlines] given the fact that our industry was really shocked by the terrorism of 9/ 11 which came from terrorists from the Arabian peninsula that caused us to go through a massive restructuring."" Al Baker shot back: ""I think he should be ashamed to bring the issue of terrorism to try to cover his inefficiency in running an airline."" The numbers Now, to the specifics of Al Baker’s claim. Qatar Airways, the national carrier for the State of Qatar, was launched in 1997 and bills itself as ""one of the fastest-growing airlines operating with one of the youngest fleets in the world."" We contacted the airline for documentation that it had a fleet of airplanes, averaging 4.1 years in age. We received data that showed the fleet was actually newer -- averaging 3.1 years. The airline, based in Doha, has 152 passenger and cargo airplanes, including some Airbus A330s with ""designer sleeper suites’ for first-class passengers. Data on the age of U.S.-registered aircraft is available at the FAA website, which helped with our research. At Delta, spokesman Trebor Banstetter told us the the airline has about 1,250 airplanes, averaging 14 years in age and 15 years on its trans-oceanic fleet. ""Of our 1,200 plus aircraft, there are a total of four that are older than 30 years,"" Banstetter said. ""They are all about 30.5 years old, and all scheduled for retirement this year."" The average age of the fleet is shown as slightly higher -- 17 years --- on Delta’s quarterly filing to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s largely a reflection of change -- new Boeing 737s being purchased; planes being moved into retirement; and others salvaged for parts, Banstetter said. We were unable to contact Al Baker to ask where he got the information to suggest Delta was flying 35 year old airplanes. Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia said airlines are defined by their products, not the age of their jets. ""Business class passengers, who are the only ones who really drive these considerations, look at the state of interiors, seats, food, and other amenities,"" Aboulafia said.  ""Jet age is largely irrelevant. And Delta's average fleet age certainly is nowhere near 30."" Our conclusion Al Baker was conservative in saying that Qatar Airways had a fleet of airplanes that was 4.1 years on average. The age of Qatar’s 152 passenger and cargo airplanes is actually on average 3.1 years. But Al Baker veered off course when his comments morphed into an attack on Delta. Delta has more than 1,200 aircraft. Four are due to retire this year. Each of those is about 30.5 years old, Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. The majority of Delta’s fleet is much newer. Al Baker’s comments contain an element truth but they ignore critical facts that would give the average reader a different impression We rate Al Baker’s comments Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC958EC0>],/factchecks/2015/may/19/akbar-al-baker/qatar-airways-leader-mark/

And while some of the wounded are still being treated and other passengers are still unaccounted for, there has been a predictable but no less despicable rush to turn this crash into a political talking point."" Kelly then played a montage of Democrats and one Oklahoma Republican mayor saying the crash was a wake-up call to invest in infrastructure. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., said, ""Last night we failed them. We failed to invest in their safety."" Kelly said this blaming of ""stingy Republicans"" poured out before the fact was known that the train was more than two-times over the speed limit as it entered a curve. While a technology called positive train control (PTC) could have slowed the train in the case of human error, its absence in the Philadelphia crash, Kelly said, had nothing to do with Congress refusing to allocate money. ""Congress had already mandated that it be installed, and it's being installed on all these tracks,"" Kelly said. ""They hadn't gotten to this particular track yet. And according to our information, that wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They just passed it in the recent past. So they were working on it. So it's not a failure of infrastructure. It's a failure of an engineer to obey the speed limit."" The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing to investigate the reason behind the crash. But we wanted to dig into her claim about the lack of positive train control on that section of rail -- and whether congressional funding was an issue. What we found is that yes, Amtrak and Congress have been working for years to implement positive train control. And yes, the braking system -- which National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said would have prevented the crash -- is on schedule to be installed by the end of the year. But money from Congress could have pushed up that timetable, specifically when it comes to purchasing radio frequencies necessary for the braking program to work. The braking system and and the Amtrak crash Positive train control is a system that uses transponders on the tracks to communicate with controls on a passing locomotive. If the train is moving too fast, the system slows it down. Amtrak released a statement after the Philadelphia crash saying that ""installation is largely complete south of Newark, N.J., but the system is only in service on 50 miles of the 226-mile route between Washington and New York."" The statement said Amtrak is on schedule to have the system fully operational on the Northeast Corridor by the end of 2015. That, Amtrak said, will meet a deadline set by Congress in 2008. Put another way, the hardware for the new braking system was largely in place (though not specifically at the site of the crash). What was left was the final work to connect it to the trains and activate the system. PTC installation and funding  The core of Kelly’s claim is that the installation of the PTC braking system was not about funding. To back that up, Fox News sent us a Reuters article about delays in implementing PTC nationwide. ""Federal rules require the national rail network to have an operating PTC system by the end of the year, though many lawmakers have endorsed rail industry appeals for more time to comply,"" the article said. ""In March, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to extend the deadline for implementing PTC until at least 2020. Both Republicans and Democrats supported the measure, which will now go to the Senate floor."" That extension, however, served the needs of the freight and commuter rail companies who were unable to get their systems up and running by the end of 2015. Amtrak was a different story. David Hughes was Amtrak’s chief engineer until 2005 and now consults in the railroad industry. ""Amtrak may be the only major railroad to meet the original 2015 deadline,"" Hughes told PunditFact. Amtrak’s specific system is called the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System. A heavy duty plastic transponder tied to a cross-tie in the track sends speed and location information to the locomotive, which in turn radios that data to a ground control station. If something is going wrong, the ground control station sends a command via radio back to the locomotive, forcing it to slow down. Amtrak had this system fully operational north of New York City, and was close to putting it online in the section between New York City and Washington, D.C. The question is, would money have advanced the timeline? Karl Witbeck is consulting engineer with the Stantec firm. ""No doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak,"" Witbeck said. Witbeck studied a key link in the warning system, the radio communications needed to connect the ground control station with the trains. Witbeck, along with the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General, highlighted the lack of accessible, available radio frequencies as the single greatest barrier to completing the automatic braking system for all railroads, not just Amtrak. In 2012, the Amtrak Office of Inspector General called the radio link the ""most serious challenge"" to implementing the braking system.   Why? When Congress mandated that every railroad in the country have PTC by 2015, it failed to require that the Federal Communication Commission set aside radio frequencies for the railroads to use. That sent railroad operators such as Amtrak out into the private market on a hunt for frequencies. The inspector general report said that Amtrak ""faces the prospect of having to stitch together enough licenses in the 220 megahertz (MHz) range through piecemeal acquisitions, county-by-county, to ensure coverage along the NEC (Northeast Corridor)."" Acquiring that coverage costs money, and this is where the story gets complicated. In its 2012 report and in a follow-up a year later, Amtrak’s inspector general aimed many criticisms at Amtrak’s inability to manage its capital investment projects. While the 2012 report said a ""significant challenge is ensuring that Amtrak has enough funds available to implement PTC fully by the deadline,"" it underscored that Amtrak needed to request the funds for radio frequencies at least a year and a half before it planned to spend them, and Amtrak didn’t seem to be doing that. The request was missing from the railroad’s five-year financial plan and, according to the report, the cost estimates were ""potentially incomplete and unreliable."" We also found that Amtrak stopped listing PTC in its Fiscal Year 2014 and 2015 requests to Congress. In 2013, Amtrak’s inspector general skewered managers for failing to set clear priorities for its capital projects. It noted that the board had approved over $3 million to repair locomotives that were due to be replaced. Specific to PTC, it found that while the board had approved spending about $10 million in one year to knit together Amtrak’s system with that of the freight and commuter railroads, managers signed a multiyear contract costing $59 million. Clearly, Amtrak had internal problems managing its capital projects, including the system that could have prevented the fatal crash near Philadelphia. On the other hand, Congress has consistently given Amtrak about 60 percent of the money it requested each year to invest in its infrastructure. Year Amount requested Amount appropriated 2010 $975 million $594 million 2011 $1.02 billion $658 million 2012 $1.1 billion $657 million 2013 $1.4 billion $642 million 2014 $1.2 billion $800 million (Sources: General capital figures in Amtrak business plans, budget requests, and appropriations bills) The inspector general report noted that Amtrak’s ""needs have exceeded the level of funding that it received each year."" In the view of Hughes and Witbeck, Amtrak has always had to juggle how it would spend its capital budget and resolving the final issue of buying radio bandwidth for PTC was part of that. Our ruling Kelly said that the lack of a working fail-safe braking system at the site of the Philadelphia Amtrak crash,  ""wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They (Congress) just passed it in the recent past."" Congress actually passed the rule in 2008. The basis of Kelly’s claim was an article that said Congress had granted an extension for railroads to implement a positive train control system. But that extension had much to do with freight and commuter rail operators, not Amtrak. Amtrak is moving forward with its own braking system, and says it will be fully operational by the end of the year. Experts said additional resources to purchase radio frequencies needed to make the system work could have sped up the roll-out. Moreover, while Amtrak has been criticized for how it spends money on capital projects, it has consistently been funded at levels below what it has requested. Kelly’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8153C0>],/factchecks/2015/may/18/megyn-kelly/did-money-have-nothing-do-amtrak-crash/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Transportation', 'Charles Schumer']","
After derailment, Chuck Schumer says shortage of funds has delayed technological fix for Amtrak
","After an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, a safety official said a technological fix could have prevented the deadly accident. Talking to reporters the day after the crash, which killed eight and injured many more, Robert Sumwalt, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said positive train control, or PTC, would have prevented the loss of life on Northeast Regional train 188, which entered a curve at more than 100 miles per hour, or twice the posted speed. ""We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,"" Sumwalt said. Sumwalt’s claim quickly became a bone of contention between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. At a House Appropriations Committee meeting the day after the crash, the Republican majority cast votes to cut grants to Amtrak for capital spending by about 15 percent. Democrats and Republicans squabbled over both the substance and the timing of the move. At a news conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, rejected criticism by Democrats that linked congressional funding cuts to the crash. ""Listen, you know they started this yesterday -- ‘It’s all about funding, It’s all about funding.’ Well, obviously, it’s not about funding,"" Boehner said. ""The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there. No money's been cut from rail safety, and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs."" To that, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded, ""Speaker Boehner’s comments are patently false. Experts have made clear that positive train control could have prevented the tragedy in Philadelphia. It is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation of PTC, and to deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality."" A reader asked us to check whether Schumer was correct. What we found is that money is indeed one obstacle, but not the only one. Positive train control and its pricetag A positive train control system uses signals and sensors along the track to communicate train location, speed restrictions, and moving authority, according to the Congressional Research Service. If the train is going too fast, equipment onboard automatically acts to slow or stop it. In 2008, a Metrolink train crash in Chatsworth, Calif., killed 25 people and injured more than 100; investigators blamed the engineer for texting while driving. In response, Congress voted to require most of the national rail system -- about 60,000 miles -- to be updated with positive train control by December 2015. Amtrak was making progress on that goal and had installed positive train control on portions of the Northeast Corridor, but it had not yet done so on the stretch of track in Philadelphia where the accident occurred. Amtrak CEO Joseph Boardman told the New York Times that the system was close to being operational throughout the Northeast Corridor by the end of this year. Schumer has a point that cost has been an obstacle in meeting Congress’ requirements, both for private freight-rail companies and for Amtrak, which is dependent on federal funding. The Federal Railroad Administration has estimated that implementation of positive train control will cost roughly $14 billion. To put that in context, capital investment by U.S. railroads in 2010 amounted to $11 billion, about two-thirds for structures and one-third for equipment. So the estimated cost of meeting the mandate is ""roughly equal to the railroads’ total capital spending in a single year,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. When Congress enacted the requirement for positive train control, it did not designate funds to carry it out. Private freight rail carriers have dipped into their corporate pockets to install the new system -- and they acknowledge that they are behind schedule -- but Amtrak had little choice but to go to Congress to secure funding. ""Projects of this magnitude take many years for any public agency to work into their capital budgets,"" said Karl Witbeck, a principal in the transportation practice of the consulting firm Stantec. There’s ""no doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak."" The rest of the picture However, Schumer’s statement glossed over other factors that have hampered the implementation of positive train control. Here are a few of those suggested to us by experts. • Amtrak’s failure to seek, prioritize and use the money it did have. A report by the Amtrak inspector general released on Dec. 20, 2012, cited several obstacles in implementing Congress’ positive train control mandate. One was Amtrak’s failure to come up with ""complete and reliable cost estimates and budgeting"" for the system. The report called the budgeting process ""fragmented,"" noting that two different Amtrak departments are responsible for estimating the costs of positive train control, depending on whether the installation is on property owned by Amtrak or another entity. The report also says Amtrak never asked for enough funds to finish the project in either its five-year financial plan or its fiscal year 2013 budget request to Congress. A Transportation Department official was quoted in the report stating that the department purposely omitted installation costs from these documents because they ""would weaken Amtrak’s negotiating position with the host railroads because it would alert the railroads to the amount of money that was potentially available to pay these costs."" (Amtrak did not provide answers to questions submitted to PolitiFact by publication time.) • The system is technologically challenging. Even if funding posed no obstacle, overlaying a positive train control system over decades-old rail lines is a complex task. Positive train control ""is not off-the-shelf technology and has had to be developed from scratch,"" said Ed Greenberg, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, whose members include most major rail carriers, including Amtrak. In order to work properly, positive train control needs a certain amount of radio frequency available for the various pieces of the system to communicate with one another. The inspector general’s report cited this as the ""most serious challenge"" to implementing positive train control. The Federal Communications Commission -- which oversees the frequency spectrum -- told the New York Times that regulatory delays in approving antenna installation are now ""largely gone."" Still, the accumulation of past delays, whether attributable to the FCC or to Amtrak, have pushed back the implementation of positive train control, experts say. Part of the problem for Amtrak has been a need to purchase the rights to radio frequencies on the open market, from existing companies that use that spectrum. ""When spectrum is in short supply, as is the case in many urban areas, the railroads have to go to the secondary market and purchase it at a premium,"" said Joseph C. Szabo, a former administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, emphasized that the senator was not implying that the delay was solely the result of insufficient funds, but rather that it was a contributing, and perhaps even primary, driver of that delay. In addition, he said, the challenges of purchasing spectrum rights are intricately linked to Amtrak’s budgetary shortcomings. ""Had there been sufficient funding, the installation and broadband acquisition processes would have begun earlier and could have moved faster, and thus ended earlier,"" House said. Our ruling Schumer said that ""it is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation"" of a positive train control safety system. ""To deny a connection between the (derailment in Philadelphia) and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality."" Schumer has a point that insufficient funding has been an obstacle to implementing positive train control in locations like the one where the accident occurred. But other factors played a role as well, including administrative problems within Amtrak and technical challenges such as difficulty obtaining radio frequencies. The statement is partially accurate but oversimplifies by leaving out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A4800>],/factchecks/2015/may/18/charles-schumer/after-derailment-chuck-schumer-says-shortage-funds/
"['Iraq', 'Foreign Policy', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio's statements on Iraq have shifted but not flipped
","After former Gov. Jeb Bush’s comments about whether he would have invaded Iraq drew attention, other 2016 GOP presidential candidates staked out their positions, including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace aggressively questioned Rubio on his positions in an interview May 17, asking him if he’d changed positions on Iraq. After rolling film of previous interviews with Rubio, Wallace asked Rubio, ""Senator, isn't that a flip? Six weeks ago, it made sense to invade Iraq in 2003. Now, you say it was a mistake."" ""No, they're two different questions. It was not a mistake,"" Rubio answered. The two went back and forth in an animated exchange, with Rubio concluding: ""I doubt very seriously that the president would have gotten, for example, congressional approval to move forward with an invasion had they known there were no weapons of mass destruction. That doesn't mean he made the wrong decision, because at the time he was presented with intelligence that said there are weapons of mass destruction."" We decided to put Rubio’s statements on our Flip-O-Meter, which tracks whether a politician has shifted his views and to what extent without making a judgment about such changes. We found that Rubio’s positions have shifted over the years, but he hasn’t fully reversed himself, either. Rubio as a Senate candidate in 2010 Rubio was a state representative when Congress voted for the Iraq resolution in 2002 that led to the 2003 invasion. We searched and found no statements about the war by Rubio at the time. In October 2010, Rubio was asked about the Iraq war by Tampa Bay Times’ political editor Adam Smith during a Senate campaign debate on CNN. Smith: ""Mr. Rubio, is America safer and better off for having gone to war in Iraq?"" Rubio: ""I think the answer ultimately is yes. First of all, the world is better off because Saddam Hussein is no longer in charge in Iraq. And I think we have to remind ourselves of that, is that the world is a better and safer place because Saddam Hussein no longer is in charge of that country. …You know, there are a lot of issues that that society and that that nation-state faces. But it is better off today than it was when Saddam Hussein (was there)."" Rubio as a presidential candidate As Rubio moved toward his presidential bid in April, he has tried to establish himself as the hawkish foreign policy expert. He has called for increased military funding and building up weapons, and he often talks about threats faced from Iran and from ISIS. In March as a deadline approached on the nuclear deal with Iran, Rubio talked about both Iran and Iraq on Fox News’ The Five when asked, ""Was it a mistake to go to war to Iraq?"" ""No, I don't believe it was. The world is a better place because Saddam Hussein doesn’t run Iraq,"" he said, arguing that Iraq could have pursued a weapon. ""So I think, hindsight is always 20/20, but we don't know what the world would look like if Saddam Hussein was still there."" Weeks later, after Rubio’s speech to the Council on Foreign Relations May 13, journalist Charlie Rose asked: ""If you look at the Iraq war, after finding out there were no weapons of mass destruction, would you, if you knew that, have been in favor of the Iraqi invasion?"" Rubio: ""Well, not only would I not have been in favor of it. President Bush would not have been in favor of it. And he's said so."" Rose: ""But Vice President Cheney and others have said, in the same administration, we'd have wanted to go ahead, notwithstanding."" Rubio: ""Well, President Bush has said that he regrets that the intelligence was faulty. I don't think the Congress would have voted in favor of authorization if they didn't know that. But let's also be fair about the context. Yes, there was intelligence that was faulty, but there was also a history with Iraq of evasion. It was a country that had had mobile units in the past that it used for both C.W., you know, chemical weapons, and biological capability. It is a country that had actively not so long in the past, at the moment that that decision was made, had invaded a neighboring country in Kuwait."" So did Rubio change his tune here?  We asked experts if they viewed Rubio’s three key statements on Iraq -- in 2010, March and in May -- as a flip-flop or a change in stance. We did not find agreement. Danielle Pletka, a foreign and defense policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said she sees Rubio’s statements as consistent. ""Had he known that there were no WMD (in the form described at the time by the intelligence), he would not have ordered the invasion of Iraq. However, having invaded Iraq and deposed Saddam, the world is a better place,"" she told PolitiFact. ""One might add that the world would be a better place without Castro, Kim Jong Un, the Chinese Communist Party, and any number of others without implying any intention of invading those countries or removing those leaders."" But some other experts saw either conflicts in Rubio’s statements or said that his answers left holes -- albeit in part because of the question asked. ""Clearly at the CFR he was recognizing what the majority of the public realizes: The war in Iraq was a huge mistake. But he is also taking a similar line to Jeb Bush in nonetheless arguing that it is a good thing that Saddam is gone,"" Michael Desch, co-director of the Notre Dame International Security Program. ""While these two things are certainly in tension, they are not outright contradictory, which probably explains why they have become the talking point for a number of Republican nominees on a potentially very dicey issue for them."" Rubio’s comments during the 2010 Senate debate that the country is better off without Hussein ""leaves to the imagination whether we are enough better off to justify the costs,"" said Barry Posen, director of the MIT Security Studies Program. But in March on The Five, he was asked whether the war was a ""mistake."" ""This requires a full assessment. Not ‘given that we fought the war, did anything good come of it?’ but in the net, was it a mistake? And he answered no. So I think on that one, you can call it ‘flip flop,’ "" Posen said. Our ruling In earlier interviews, Rubio said that the United States is safer having gone to war and that it wasn’t a mistake -- but in those interviews he wasn’t directly asked the question about whether he would have favored the invasion, had we known in 2003 that we had faulty intelligence. Rubio was asked May 13 if he would have been in favor of the Iraq War if it was known at the time that there were no weapons of mass destruction. Rubio said, ""Not only would I not have been in favor of it. President Bush would not have been in favor of it."" As for what he would have favored if it had been known that there were no weapons, Rubio said on May 17 that it was unlikely that Congress would have given approval for Bush to move forward. All these statements seem a little different, and add up to a partial change of position. We rate Rubio’s statements on Iraq as a Half Flip.

Water expert says Austin only city in arid western U.S. depending on a single water source
","Austin’s not the only city in the midst of drought that’s grappling with long-term questions about its water supply. Still, could it be more vulnerable than others? Sharlene Leurig, who directs the sustainable water infrastructure program at the Boston-based nonprofit Ceres, recently called Austin’s dependence on the Colorado River for water a ""critical vulnerability."" Leurig went on at a Feb. 9, 2015, Austin City Council workshop: ""Austin is the only city in an arid landscape in the western United States dependent on a single source of water."" Leurig’s caveat Austin all alone? We sought elaboration from Leurig, who replied by email with a caveat: ""Of the top twenty major cities by population, Austin is the only city in an arid climate with a single source of water. Of course if you looked at all the cities west of the Mississippi, this isn’t true, but for major cities, it is."" Leurig, who chaired the city’s water resource planning task force in 2014, added by phone she’s never explicitly researched the question, but she’s become familiar with water systems nationally through her job advising investors who buy water utility debt. Austin has enjoyed abundant water for decades, Leurig said, thanks to the chain of dammed lakes breaking up the Colorado River. Meanwhile, she said, other cities west of the Mississippi have diversified their supplies because existing water wasn’t abundant or in reaction to ""stress events."" For instance, she said, the Dallas-Fort Worth region was motivated by the historic 1950s drought to build reservoirs farther east, in wetter parts of Texas. In contrast, she said, Austin faced its first comparable crisis with the Texas drought that started in 2008. Leurig was correct about Austin drawing all its drinking water from one source, the Colorado River. To be precise, river water is pulled from Lake Travis and Lake Austin, which are both part of the seven-member Highland Lakes system. There’s a long-term reason for this dependence. In 1999, the city prepaid $100 million to the Lower Colorado River Authority to guarantee water to Austin from the river through at least 2050. The authority manages a 600-mile stretch of the Colorado River in Texas and the Highland Lakes by Austin. Two of the lakes, Buchanan and Travis, have had historically low inflows of water in the drought, leading Leurig and others, such as Mayor Steve Adler, to say Austin’s long-term rights to water matter not if there isn’t enough water in the lakes--and that it’s time for Austin to look at diversifying its sources. Nature Conservancy scientist For another take on Austin’s unusual reliance on a single water source, we turned to Rob McDonald, a senior scientist of urban sustainability at the Nature Conservancy, who worked on a project mapping the water sources of 220 U.S. cities plus 534 cities outside the U.S. (A Google search led us to the map; a Nature Conservancy spokesman connected us to McDonald.) McDonald pointed out that if all western cities are considered, Austin likely wouldn’t be the only one to use a single water source. According to McDonald’s map and city websites, some smaller towns--as close to Austin as Killeen 70 miles northwest or as distant as Billings, Montana--rely on just one source. Also, McDonald said, numerous cities essentially rely on a single source because they draw 80 to 90 percent of the water supply from one surface source like a river or lake, McDonald said. He pointed to Las Vegas as an example; the Las Vegas Valley Water District’s website says southern Nevada gets almost 90 percent of its water from that state’s Colorado River; 10 percent comes from groundwater. It’s also not always clear, McDonald said, whether a particular body of water should be counted as one or two sources. Yes, Austin draws its water from the Colorado River, he noted, but water from the Edwards Aquifer flows into the river. Asked about this point, an Austin Water Utility spokesman, Jason Hill, agreed that various ""tributary creeks and rivers, runoff, and springs"" flow into the Colorado River. But, Hill said by phone, it’s a ""stretch"" to consider the Edwards Aquifer a city water source. That’s because the city doesn’t pump water directly from the aquifer, Hill said. All the water the city uses, all the water the city has rights to, is in the river, Hill said. Checking city water supplies We endeavored to test Leurig’s claim for ourselves by fetching a U.S. Census Bureau list of the top 20 U.S. cities by population as of July 2013. Then, we mapped out those cities and narrowed the list to the ones west of the Mississippi River: Austin (of course), Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. Next, we contacted each city’s main water supplier, in many cases the city’s utility. Each of the 10 other populous cities reported more than one source for water though our hunt proved a little muddy in that cities varied in how they defined a ""water source."" Who knew? By phone, Leurig said that in her view, a source is ""hydrologically distinct."" For instance, a river and its tributary are not hydrologically distinct, but two rivers that don’t merge are, Leurig said. Separately, to our inquiries, representatives of the American Water Works Association and the Texas Water Development Board each advised there isn’t a standard definition of a water source, leaving this aspect unsettled. Houston: As of 2015, the Bayou City was getting 75 percent of its drinking water from the San Jacinto and Trinity rivers. The remaining 25 percent came from the Chicot and Evangeline aquifers, city spokesman Alvin Wright told us by email. San Antonio: Officials with the San Antonio Water System told us the utility taps seven water sources, topped by the underground Edwards Aquifer, which provided 77 percent of the water in 2014. (The system serves most of Bexar County, which is home to San Antonio, and other nearby areas). A report emailed to us by water system spokeswoman Anne Hayden showed that in the year, other water sources were: Edwards Aquifer water pumped out of the aquifer and stored in the Carrizo Aquifer (8 percent) Groundwater from the Carrizo Aquifer in southern Bexar County (4 percent) Surface water from Canyon Lake, which is part of the Guadalupe River system (4 percent) Groundwater from the Carrizo Aquifer in Gonzales County (3 percent) Groundwater from the Trinity Aquifer (2 percent) Groundwater from the Carrizo Aquifer in Guadalupe and Gonzales counties, and surface water from Lake Dunlap, which is part of the Guadalupe River system (2 percent) Hayden said by phone the water system previously drew water from Medina Lake, which is fed by the Medina River, but recently stopped after its level sank. Though the San Antonio Water System clearly has more than one source of water, we wondered if the system overcounts. After all, some of the listed sources appear to originate from the same place, such as the Carrizo or Edwards aquifers, or the Guadalupe River. Hayden and Darren Thompson, the director of water resources for the San Antonio Water System, said by phone there are key differences between those sources, such as who regulates the water. For instance, the city pulls some of its water directly from the Edwards Aquifer under a permit from the Edwards Aquifer Authority, Thompson said. Once that water is put into the Carrizo Aquifer and later taken out, it doesn’t fall under the authority’s regulations. Different bodies regulate different supplies from the Carrizo Aquifer, Hayden said. Thompson also pointed out that the city draws from different points of the expansive underground source in three counties: Bexar, Guadalupe and Gonzales. The water can have different characteristics, such as mineral level, depending on where in the aquifer it is taken, Thompson said. Phoenix: This city’s hydrologically distinct sources as of 2015 were the Salt River, the Verde River, the Colorado River and groundwater from the Salt River Valley Aquifer. Just over half of the city’s water was coming from the Salt and Verde rivers, a little less than half from the Colorado River and the rest is from the aquifer. Kathryn Sorensen, water services director for Phoenix’s water services department, said by phone the city has ""roughly 100 legally distinct supplies."" For instance, the city’s rights to water from the Salt and Verde rivers have different priority levels depending on what date the water was first put to ""beneficial use,"" she said. Priority matters, because the lower the priority, the sooner the water will be cut off when river flows slow. Phoenix's access to Colorado River water  - which also has different priority levels - comes through subcontracts with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, settlement agreements approved through the U.S. Congress, and leases with various Indian communities in Arizona. Dallas: In 2020, according to Dallas Water Utility projections, about 47.5 percent of the city’s water will come from the Trinity River, with the Sabine River and its tributary making up 52.5 percent, Denis Qualls, a senior program manager with the Dallas Water Utility, told us by phone. Fort Worth: As of 2015, about 80 percent of the city’s water was coming from the Cedar Creek and Richland-Chambers reservoirs, said Mary Gugliuzza, spokeswoman for the city’s water department. Cedar Creek is fed by Kings Creek while Richland-Chambers is fed by Richland Creek and Chambers Creek - all of which are separate from the Trinity River, said Chad Lorance, spokesman for the Tarrant Regional Water District, by phone. The Trinity River provides the rest of the city’s water, Gugliuzza said. El Paso: As of 2015, El Paso Water Utilities was getting 70 percent of its water from the Mesilla Bolson and Hueco Bolson aquifers, utility spokesman Javier Camacho said by email. Another 4 percent of its water consisted of brackish Hueco Bolson water treated in the Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Facility. The remaining 26 percent was coming from the Rio Grande and is stored about 120 miles north in Elephant Butte, New Mexico. San Diego: As of 2015, the city got nearly all its water--85 to 90 percent--from two sources, city spokesperson Arian Collins said by email, namely the Colorado River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta with 10 to 15 percent coming from rainfall runoff captured in reservoirs. The delta, where the rivers merge to flow to the Pacific Ocean, provided water to two-thirds of Californians, according to the California Department of Water Resources. Los Angeles: On average in 2009-14, the city got a little more than half its water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and the Colorado River; 34 percent from the Los Angeles Aqueduct, fed by snowpack from the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains; and 12 percent from the San Fernando Valley Aquifer, a source mostly replenished with stormwater, Michelle Figueroa, city water and power department spokeswoman, told us by email. San Jose: John Tang, a spokesman for the San Jose Water Company, said that as of 2015, the company served about 80 percent of the city and was pulling 40 percent of its water from the Santa Clara Groundwater Basin. Another 50 percent was coming from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Tang said, with the rest consisting of rainfall captured in a reservoir in the Santa Cruz mountains. San Francisco: As of 2015, most of the city’s water, 85 percent, was coming from the Hetch Hetchy watershed in Yosemite National Park, originating as snowmelt and running into the Tuolumne River, said Paula Kehoe, director of water resources for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Some 15 percent of the city’s water came from the Alameda and Peninsula watersheds, where reservoirs captured rain and runoff and also stored Hetch Hetchy water, Kehoe said. Less than 1 percent of the city’s water was coming from groundwater from the Sunol Filter Galleries. Our ruling Leurig said Austin is the only city in an arid landscape in the western United States dependent on a single source of water. That’s not so, as she acknowledged to us, and even if you limit the focus to big cities, some of those--such as San Francisco and arguably San Antonio, which seems to overcount its sources--get more than four-fifths of their water from a source.

Trump tees off on Tom Brady's suspension, says players with murder charges not suspended
","Donald Trump is on Team Tom. The billionaire who loves to dabble in politics recently tweeted his reaction to the NFL’s decision to suspend New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady four games over his alleged role in ""Deflategate."" The league punished Brady, who is appealing his suspension, after an independent report found it was ""more probable than not"" that Brady knew about the Patriots staffers who released air from game balls after the referees’ inspection. He tweeted, ""You can be an @nfl player with murder charges and not be suspended. Yet with NO EVIDENCE, @nfl targeted Tom Brady. B.S.!""  As referees of factual claims, we wondered about Trump’s statement. We don’t know specifically who Trump was thinking about — his press team didn’t respond to us — but we were unable to find a situation that precisely supports his claim. The closest parallel is the case of former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis. Lewis was indeed arrested on murder charges, and he was not suspended by the NFL. But there’s more to the story as to why. Lewis was arrested on charges of murder and aggravated assault in the Jan. 31, 2000, stabbing deaths of two men after a Super Bowl party in Atlanta. Prosecutors worked out a deal with Lewis where the murder charges would be dropped if he testified against two friends who were with him that night. (They were acquitted.) Lewis’ arrest and plea all took place during the 2000 offseason, so there were no games for which he could have been suspended. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor obstruction of justice charge in June 2000. After Lewis’ plea, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Lewis would not be suspended. ''It's the courts who have the primary responsibility in this case,'' Tagliabue said in a July 2000 conference call with reporters, according to the New York Times. ''We're not a substitute for the courts.'' The NFL put Lewis on probation for a year and fined him $250,000, which Lewis called disappointing. More recent cases contradict Trump’s claim. The New England Patriots’ Aaron Hernandez was convicted of first-degree murder in the June 2013 death of Odin Lloyd. When Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder on June 26, 2013, the Patriots didn’t suspend him — they cut him. Before Hernandez, Rae Carruth was the only active NFL player to be convicted of a murder-related charge. The Carolina Panthers wide receiver was arrested for first-degree murder in the death of his pregnant girlfriend, who was killed in a drive-by shooting while sitting in her car on November 1999. (The unborn child survived.) Carruth was accused of setting up the shooting. He was acquitted of the first-degree murder charge but was found guilty of murder conspiracy, among other charges. He is in prison. After Carruth’s arrest, the Panthers waived him and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. Vehicular homicides Other NFL players have faced charges for killing people due to reckless driving. Those crimes came with suspensions or worse. In 2003, Dallas Cowboys cornerback Dwayne Goodrich hit three men on a Dallas interstate with his BMW, killing two and shattering the other’s left leg. The men were trying to save a man from a burning car. Goodrich was convicted of criminally negligent homicide with a deadly weapon and failure to stop and render aid, and he spent six years in prison. The Cowboys released him upon his arrest. Donte Stallworth, formerly of the Cleveland Browns, was suspended without pay for the 2009 season after he hit and killed a man, Mario Reyes, with his Bentley in Miami. His blood-alcohol content was .126, more than three times Florida’s legal limit. He pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter, bounced around a few NFL teams after the Browns cut him, and eventually landed a reporting internship at the Huffington Post.  In 1998, St. Louis Rams player Leonard Little killed a woman after drinking and driving, hitting her car with his SUV. The team put Little on paid leave. After he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, the league placed Little on a suspension of eight regular season games. Other examples Some players were involved in deaths, even if they were not charged with murder. In July 1995, Seattle Seahawks receiver Brian Blades shot and killed his cousin, Charles, and was charged with manslaughter, which in Florida is a second-degree felony applied when a killing occurs because of negligence or without a legal reason. Blades said the shooting was accidental, and went on to play all 16 games in the 1995 season. A jury initially convicted Blades of manslaughter in June 1996, but the verdict was overturned a week later by a Florida judge. During the same month of Hernandez’s high-profile arrest in June 2013, Cleveland Browns rookie Ausar Walcott punched a man in the head outside of a New Jersey gentleman’s club, and the man suffered critical injuries. The Browns cut Walcott from the team the day after he was arrested. Another player, Jovan Belcher of the Kansas City Chiefs, killed his girlfriend and then shot himself to death at the team’s training facility on the same day, Dec. 1, 2012. New code However you view the old case of Lewis, it’s important to note that the NFL tightened player conduct rules after taking heat for allegations of violent crime against players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson in 2014. The player conduct policy released in December 2014 lays out procedures for handling players charged with violent crimes, including some form of paid leave amid law enforcement and league investigations. The NFL Players Association takes issue with this policy, as it prevents players from team activities even though they may end up not guilty of their charges. So while it’s possible that a past player — namely Lewis — has been charged with murder without being suspended, it’s not likely that would happen today. Our ruling Trump claimed, ""You can be an NFL player with murder charges and not be suspended."" Today, that’s at best a highly unlikely scenario . The closest historical example we could find came from 2000 involving the case of Ray Lewis, but there is the wrinkle that his murder charges came and went during the 2000 offseason. He eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC921B80>],/factchecks/2015/may/18/donald-trump/trump-tees-tom-bradys-suspension-says-players-murd/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'Jeb Bush']","
Obama refused to sign plan in place to leave 10,000 troops in Iraq, Bush says
","During a tough campaign week focused on the Iraq War, former Gov. Jeb Bush shifted blame for problems there to President Barack Obama, saying that Obama’s actions helped hand the country over to Islamic State. A University of Nevada student attending a town hall-style meeting in Reno asked Bush why he was placing the burden on Obama, at one point telling Bush, ""Your brother created ISIS."" Bush countered that the Obama administration hadn’t followed through on proper planning. ""We had an agreement that the president could have signed that would have kept 10,000 troops, less than we have in Korea, that could have created the stability that would have allowed for Iraq to progress,"" Bush said. (Watch video of the exchange above.) The claim came in the middle of a rough few days for Bush, who was being criticized for his changing answers on whether he would have invaded Iraq. We wondered if it was true that Obama could have signed a deal to leave 10,000 U.S. troops in the country after the war’s end. The exit When Obama took office in January 2009, he inherited a plan that President George W. Bush forged in 2008 with then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. That Status of Forces Agreement called for the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 2011. It was widely assumed a new plan would be negotiated after the 2008 version expired in 2011. There were no stipulations about a specific number of American military personnel to be left behind. Obama ran on the campaign pledge of bringing a responsible end to the Iraq War, and announced shortly after taking office that combat operations would end in 2010. A high of 168,000 U.S. service members were in the country after the 2007 surge, drawing down to about 43,000 after combat troops left in 2010. He said in October 2011 almost all troops would be home by Christmas. About 200 Marines would stay to train the Iraqi army and act as security for diplomatic personnel. In short, he kept the 2011 timeline Bush and al-Maliki had chosen. When it came time to renegotiate a new agreement, there was little consensus on whether a residual force should stay in the country. Military leaders in Baghdad and the Pentagon pushed for as many as 24,000, but the White House rejected that amount. (For the record, U.S. forces in South Korea number more than 28,500.) Obama reportedly did consider leaving up to 10,000 troops in strategic locations after the exit, but that plan faced opposition both in the United States and in Iraq. Obama ruled out a force that size during an August 2011 conference call. Negotiations led to the idea of a smaller, continuous force of 3,500 troops, with up to 1,500 more rotating in and out, and about a half-dozen F-16’s. But this plan ran into several roadblocks, including the insistence by Washington that those troops be immune to Iraqi  -- although not American -- prosecution should they commit a crime. Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor, said al-Maliki allegedly supported the residual force and may have signed a new plan, but the Iraqi parliament would not. Facing the prospect of a weak agreement that didn’t protect remaining troops the way the United States wanted, when neither Baghdad nor Washington wanted to leave them there, negotiations broke down. No new agreement was reached, and no residual force was formed. There has been plenty of debate whether it was Washington or Baghdad that was more intractable on a new agreement. The aftermath So a plan to leave 10,000 troops didn’t exist when Obama took office and was never fully realized by his administration. But would an agreement to leave American troops have stabilized the nation the way Jeb Bush claimed? We were curious what experts would say about this point. (Bush’s campaign didn’t return our requests for comment.) ""I think most observers would agree that a residual U.S. force would have prevented the Islamic State from achieving as much as it has in Iraq,"" Long said. ""But it is also unlikely that a residual force would have completely stabilized Iraq, as the sources of instability are fundamentally political."" Remember that the country was considered relatively stable in 2011; ISIS elements existed prior to that, but largely formed into the force it is today after American troops left -- and mostly in Syria at first. Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said a recent Iraqi delegation to the institute agreed the terms of the planned renewal could not have passed parliament. ""They said that the Iraqi government was too weak, and unwilling to go against the wishes of those Iraqis who wanted the Americans to leave,"" Preble said. Our ruling Bush said, ""We had an agreement that the president could have signed that would have kept 10,000 troops, less than we have in Korea, that could have created the stability that would have allowed for Iraq to progress."" Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from George W. Bush and followed it, but there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. The Obama White House considered 10,000 troops for a short time but ruled it out, suggesting a much smaller force. Negotiations with Iraq broke down, however, and there was no agreement that met conditions Washington wanted. Experts told us Bush parsed his words carefully enough to have a point that a residual force would have likely helped Iraq fend off ISIS. But there was no consensus to leave 10,000 troops in place. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE37A80>],/factchecks/2015/may/18/jeb-bush/obama-refused-sign-plan-place-leave-10000-troops-i/
"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'David Perdue']","
Fair Tax claim ignores contradictory economic models
","Georgia’s freshman Senator David Perdue is a big advocate of the Fair Tax – a proposal long linked to the Peach State that calls for replacing federal income taxes with a national sales tax on all goods and services. Perdue talked up the plan in the GOP primary and general election, and included it in his first speech from the Senate floor last month. The former Fortune 500 CEO said the Fair Tax would boost the national economy. ""Our archaic tax system is choking growth, holding back innovation, and discouraging investment,"" Perdue said, in calling for a transition to the Fair Tax to ""level the playing field with the rest of the world."" PolitiFact Georgia wondered if evidence exists that the plan would boost investment and innovation, thereby improving the economy, and decided to check it out. So what is the Fair Tax? Broadly, it is a plan to abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes (including the inheritance and gift taxes) and set up a federal retail sales tax. Not surprisingly, the wholesale upheaval of the current tax system has been controversial. Advocates claim that since taxes apply only to what you buy, individuals or businesses will have more money on hand to invest. Critics, including many sympathetic to the idea of tax reform, claim the plan places too much of the overall burden on the middle class. The two sides can’t even settle on just what the sales tax rate would be. Perdue is among 74 co-sponsors of the current proposal, which specifies ""the tax rate of 23 percent of the gross payments for the taxable property or services."" That means the plan calls for a 23 percent tax-inclusive rate. But when translated to a sales tax, which is typically expressed in tax-exclusive terms, the rate is 30 percent. So the current plan assumes $30 in taxes on every $100 spent, with no tax cheats on sales for everything from mortgages to groceries to doctor visits. (More on that calculation is available from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and an essay by Bruce Bartlett, a supply-side economics expert who  served under former presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush.) A bipartisan panel convened by former President George W. Bush reported that the plan would require a sales tax of at least 34 percent, a rate that would grow if exemptions were added back for popular items such as mortgages. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated the sales tax would need to be 45 percent to be revenue neutral, as the proposal pledges, and also account for tax cheats. The rate matters when deciding if the proposal will do as Perdue suggests and boost economic activity. Americans for Fair Taxation, the non-profit arm of Fair Tax advocates, reported to the House Ways and Means Committee that investment would be 75 percent higher the first year of the new system and 76 percent higher over a decade. That’s because without corporate taxes, businesses will be more inclined to use foreign and domestic profits to grow operations. That jump in investment will naturally lead to greater innovation, the report concludes. Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economist hired by Fair Tax advocates, said that conclusion builds on a long line of research that shows the path to increased investment is more saving. A standard life cycle model shows that the people who are most likely to spend, not save, are older people, he said. That puts the tax burden on younger people. The Fair Tax reverses that, shifting the burden from ""young savers to old and rich spenders,"" Kotlikoff said. ""You redistribute from the old to the young, and the bread and butter models say you have less consumption,"" he said. ""Less consumption means more savings and more saving means more investment."" But the tax shift is what critics point out make the plan most unworkable.  The Fair Tax is a regressive sales tax, because it applies to all expenses (after a prebate), and spending on essentials such as food and shelter tends to make up more of a lower-income person’s budget. Put another way, regressive taxes come more from the poor and middle class than the rich. Allen Buckley, an Atlanta attorney and CPA who has run for statewide office as a Libertarian, said the fastest way to summarize that shift is to say the Fair Tax shifts the tax burden from the upper-middle class and rich to the middle class and elderly. Moreover, Buckley said, a history of major innovations do not show any relation at all to the tax system.  For instance, the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S. peaked at 94 percent in 1944 and remained as high as 70 percent through the 1970s. Yet in that same period, public-private partnerships and businesses invented and developed commercial computers, heart-lung machines and various vaccines that saved millions of lives. ""The only positive I see, if it’s truly revenue neutral, is there will be some increase in economic activity,"" Buckley said. ""But that will be because the rich have more money to invest in the stock market, while a lot of retirees and ordinary Joes will see their savings and investments in real estate reduced in the shift."" Some economic models back up the idea that businesses will invest that money in research and development as part of their growth, said Bruce Seaman, a professor of economics at the Andrew Young School of Public Policy at Georgia State University. But those models can be overstated, considering some don’t control for very human factors such as greed and simple bad decisions, Seaman said. For instance, businesses have been reporting record profits during the economic recovery – yet that has not translated into raises for workers or enough new jobs to significantly cut the unemployment rate. Instead, economists find that investment is lagging because consumption is lagging. Businesses need customers for profit, so encouraging consumption actually puts less money in the economy, Seaman said. ""Economists do have a concern about the corporate income tax as a double taxation, but even if you are broadly sympathetic to the idea here, the Fair Tax is a grotesque exaggeration,"" he said. ""If a business person took it seriously, and didn’t want you to buy anything, imagine what would happen to his business if suddenly no one wanted to spend money,"" he added. Our ruling David Perdue claimed the Fair Tax will boost the economy by increasing investment and innovation, making American companies more competitive on a world stage. There are some models that reinforce the idea that the way to encourage investment is to free up more money in private sector – something the Fair Tax pledges to do. But the claim ignores contrary economic models that show the additional money stays as profit for companies – or investments for the wealthy – while lower-income taxpayers spend most of their income. What exactly would happen can’t be known unless the change is fully implemented. But the Fair Tax also ignores political realities, such as tax evasion and potential uproar at increasing taxes on the powerful voting bloc of the elderly. There is some truth that broad consumption tax will help the economy, but the specific Fair Tax has too many questions to be a certainty. We rate Perdue’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC53200>],/factchecks/2015/may/18/david-perdue/fair-tax-claim-ignores-contradictory-economic-mode/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Alex McMurtrie Jr.']","
Alex McMurtrie says Va. lawmakers shifted $2 billion from education to roads
","Alex McMurtrie Jr. is billing himself as the ""education candidate"" in his bid to win a three-way Democratic primary June 9 for the state Senate seat that’s been long held by John Watkins, R-Powhatan. On his campaign website, McMurtrie laments, ""Too many Democratic and GOP legislators along with lobbyists quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building."" He calls that decision ""wrong,"" saying, ""Education trumps developers and special interests. We must put our children first."" McMurtrie made a similar claim in a campaign flier he mailed earlier this month. It contains pictures of former Democratic governors Chuck Robb, Doug Wilder and Tim Kaine. ""They would NEVER shift potentially BILLIONS from education to road building,"" the flier states underneath the photos. ""But in 2013 too many Democrats and Republicans did."" At the request of a reader, we looked into McMurtrie’s claim about the multi-billion dollar transfer from schools to roads. McMurtrie’s campaign notified us on Twitter that the candidate’s source was a Feb. 23, 2013, article in The Washington Post about a sweeping transportation bill the General Assembly had just approved.   The measure was signed six weeks later by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell. It was projected to raise $3.4 billion for state transportation during the next five years through a series of tax increases and budgeting steps. Lawmakers replaced a 17.5-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax -- which had not changed since 1987 -- with a 3.5 percent wholesale levy on gas that would keep pace with inflation. They also increased taxes on motor vehicle sales and for obtaining a driver’s licenses. But the key to McMurtrie’s claim lies in changes that were made to the state’s general sales tax. Since 1987, the levy had been 5 cents on the dollar. Of that nickel, 3.5 cents went to the state’s general fund, which pays for education, public safety and health programs. One penny went to local governments and a half-cent was earmarked for transportation. The legislation raised the sales tax to 5.3 percent and gave all of the increase to transportation. In addition, the bill provisionally took a small share of the existing sales tax revenues that went to the general fund and redirected it to highway maintenance. At most, 0.175 cents on the dollar would be diverted to transportation, phased in over five years. That switch, when completed in 2018, would generate $198 million a year for transportation. The general fund’s share of the sales tax would fall from 3.5 cents on a dollar to 3.325 cents. The Post, in its article, accurately wrote that the bill devoted ""a fatter slice of existing revenues to transportation instead of schools, public safety and other services."" McMurtrie, however, takes liberty with the Post article. He assumes that all of the general funds being moved to transportation will be stripped from education when, in fact, public schools traditionally receive about one-third of the fund. Then he takes the full $198 million general transfer in 2018 and multiplies it by 10 to reach a conclusion that, over a decade, the loss of education money will total $2 billion. There’s another fundamental problem. The Post article, on which McMutrie bases his claims, is more than two years old. The provisions of the sales tax transfer have changed, making all of McMurtrie’s numbers outdated and even more inflated. Here’s why: The 2013 bill assumed that Congress would pass legislation to help states collect taxes on goods bought through the Internet. Virginia’s new proceeds -- about $180 million a year -- would be earmarked for transportation. Congress demurred, however, and a backup plan in the state transportation bill went into effect at the start of this year that reduced the potential loss for public schools. Under Plan B, only 0.1 cent of the sales tax that once went to the general fund is being shifted to transportation -- now and in the future. That comes to about $113 million a year, according to the Department of Planning and Budget. What’s the likely impact on education? Let’s do the math: Public schools, as we noted, receive about one-third of general fund revenues. Assuming that trend holds up, about $38 million a year that would have gone to schools will be sent to transportation. Over 10 years, as McMurtrie likes to calculate, it would come to $380 million. For perspective, schools are slated to receive nearly $6.5 billion in state funding during the budget year that will start on July 1. A $38 million transfer would come 0.6 percent of the funding. There’s one last point to address: McMurtrie’s contention that lawmakers and lobbyists ""quietly shifted"" the money  from education. The General Assembly publicly debated the transportation bill. Newspapers, including the Richmond Times-Dispatch, reported extensively on it in 2013, often on the front page. Our ruling McMurtrie says legislators ""quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building"" in 2013. He backs his statement with hyper-inflated numbers multiplied over a 10-year period and a contorted interpretation of a newspaper article. An outdated provision in the bill McMurtrie refers to would have transferred $198 million a from the general fund to transportation. McMurtrie assumes all of that money would have been stripped from public schools when, in fact, the general fund also supports public safety and health programs. About one-third of the fund pays for education, so the hit to schools likely would have been around $66 million a year, or $660 million over a decade. The updated provision in the bill, ignored by McMurtrie, will shift $113 million from the general fund to transportation. If budgeting practices hold up, that should mean about a $38 million annual hit to education, or $380 million over 10 years. Either way, McMurtrie’s claim of a $2 billion raid on education doesn’t hold up. Nor does his subsequent claim that the bill ""potentially"" took billions from schools. And the legislature’s public debate on the bill, amplified by extensive media coverage, dissolves McMurtrie’s claim that lawmakers ""quietly"" shifted education dollars. We rate McMurtrie’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB32700>],/factchecks/2015/may/18/alex-mcmurtrie-jr/alex-mcmurtrie-says-va-lawmakers-shifted-2-billion/

Bill Gates: High taxes and high growth can co-exist
","With a net worth in the neighborhood of $80 billion, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has no hesitation answering questions about what sort of economic policies the country should follow. When he was asked this Sunday how he’d respond to those who think cuts in taxes and regulations will unleash productivity, Gates criticized the notion. ""The highest economic growth decade was the 1960s. Income tax rates were 90 percent,"" he said on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS May 17, 2015. ""I mean, the idea that there's some direct connection that all these innovators are on strike because tax rates are at 35 percent on corporations, that's just such nonsense."" Gates was making the point that low tax rates do not necessarily lead to economic prosperity. To do so, he mentioned a time when high growth and high marginal tax rates co-existed. Marginal tax rates are tax rates applied to each bracket of income. The more money people make, the higher their marginal tax rates, and the people with the highest income pay the top rate.  We decided to check Gate’s statement about growth and personal income taxes in the 1960s. The man who helped revolutionized personal computing is for the most part correct. Using inflation-corrected rates of growth in Gross Domestic Product from the government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 1960s tops the decades of the post-World War II era. We lined those up with the highest marginal tax rates on the IRS website. Here’s what we found: Decade Average GDP 
growth % Highest marginal 
tax rate % 1950s 3.09 90+ 1960s 4.36 90+ then 70-77 1970s 3.13 70+ 1980s 3.09 50 then 38.5 then 28 1990s 3.56 31 then 39.6 2000s 1.72 38.6 then 35 (Note: In some cases, the highest marginal tax rate changed during the decade.) While GDP growth varied year-to-year, the 1960s saw the greatest average growth by decade. But that growth didn’t line up with a top tax rate of 90 percent in every year. For the first four years of the 1960s, individuals faced a top tax rate of 91 percent on each dollar over the $400,000 mark. In 1964, the top rate dropped to 77 percent, followed by another decline to 70 percent (this time on every dollar over $200,000.) By the end of the decade, it inched back up to 77 percent. So the top tax rate wasn’t always 90 percent throughout the 1960s, as one hearing Gates’ claim might think. And like today, there were tax breaks and deductions that would lower someone's effective tax rate -- or what they actually pay. No end to this debate Gates’ point was that lowering tax rates does not, by itself, create a more prosperous economy. But the reverse also must be said: Higher tax rates don’t mean a booming economy. In fact, many factors drive the economy, from energy prices and global competition, to interest rates and government spending. A more sober analysis comes from William Gale at the Brookings Institution and Andrew Samwick at Dartmouth College and the National Bureau of Economic Analysis. In a 2014 article, the two economists found that ""U.S. historical data show huge shifts in taxes with virtually no observable shift in growth rates."" One of the complicating factors in drawing firm conclusions is that tax cuts often come as part of a larger package of changes which makes it tougher to tease out the impact of each policy shift. To further muddy the waters, the rest of the world doesn’t conveniently stand still to let America’s fiscal policy experiments play out in peace and quiet. If China tweaks the value of its currency, or South America has a banking crisis, that affects international capital markets, American trade and thus American growth. Another problem is the timing of spending cuts to offset tax cuts. Gale and Samwick concluded that the failure to cut ""unproductive"" spending at the same time that tax rates are reduced undermines any positive effect of the tax cuts. But there are studies that reach other conclusions. Two economists at the University of California-Berkeley, Christina Romer and Dave Romer, broke down tax changes based on the driving purpose behind them. For example, it is very different if taxes were cut because the economy hit the skids, rather than wanting to shrink the size of government by curtailing revenues. Romer and Romer -- they’re married -- figured that separating the reasons for tax changes allowed them to factor in a number of outside conditions that determined the impact of the policy shifts. Their key finding? ""Our estimates suggest that a tax increase of 1 percent of GDP reduces output over the next three years by nearly three percent,"" they wrote. (Christina Romer is former chair of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.) So there you have it. Some economists find no real link between tax shifts and economic activity. Some find a direct link. Add to this the debate over different kinds of taxes, such as capital gains and corporate tax rates, and it’s clear why there are so many differing perspectives. For the record, Gates himself favors a shift to taxing consumption rather than labor and income. We reached out to Gates through his foundation but did not immediately hear back. Our ruling Gates said that in the 1960s, high taxes, 90 percent, and high economic growth came at the same time. The underlying reasons are complicated, but the numbers largely bear out. On average, annual growth was about 4.3 percent for the decade, higher than any other post-World War II period. Gates was a bit off in talking about a 90 percent tax rate. During the 1960s, the marginal rate fell for a time to 70 percent. Gates did not go so far as to say that higher taxes bring higher growth. And for good reason. The connection between taxes and growth is quite tricky. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB32340>],/factchecks/2015/may/17/bill-gates/bill-gates-high-taxes-and-high-growth-can-co-exist/

Fast-track trade authority: Has every president since FDR had it?
","President Barack Obama has an unusual ally in pursuit of his foreign trade agenda -- Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan believes that Congress should grant Obama trade promotion authority, something many pro-union Democrats oppose. Trade promotion authority would allow trade agreements (such as the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership) to move through Congress under special rules intended to speed up the process, thus it is known colloquially as ""fast-track."" Congress would not be able to amend or filibuster a trade agreement, and the deal would only need 51 votes in the Senate to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes otherwise necessary. ""Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had this ability,"" Ryan said on CNN’s State of the Union May 17. The claim that every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt has been granted some sort of fast-track authority is a common talking point among supporters, so we decided to look into it. We found that today’s fast-track has a connection to 1930s trade policy, but the particulars have evolved significantly over the past several decades. First, we’ll go over the broad history of fast-track authority, then we’ll get into whether every single president had it. Tariff-ic  ""Fast-track and (trade promotion authority) trace their origins to the Trade Act of 1934,"" said Hal Shapiro, an international trade adviser who wrote a book on fast-track authority. But the trade promotion authority bill currently before Congress has more in common with legislation passed in 1974 than the original 1930s legislation, which was narrower in scope and had more limitations on Congress. First of all, the fast-track of the 1930s only pertained to tariffs -- taxes imposed on imported goods. For most of the country’s history, Congress set tariffs. But in 1934, they gave that authority to Roosevelt under the the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. Congress pre-approved a range of tariffs, and Roosevelt settled on the final rate in negotiations with foreign countries. Today’s fast-track authority requires Congress to give final approval to trade agreements. But the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act did not. Setting the pre-approved range of tariffs was Congress’ final involvement in the tariff negotiation process. Roosevelt’s signature was the final word. Congress renewed presidential tariff reduction authority about a dozen times through the 1960s, into President Lyndon Johnson’s administration. So how did it morph into today’s law? A big shift in international trade talks happened in the 1960s: Tariff reductions became less important in negotiations; instead countries focused on non-tariff barriers, which are aspects of domestic policy that are believed to hinder trade. Johnson returned from a round of international negotiations having struck a deal that modified tariff policy but also two non-tariff policies that required changes to domestic law. Because the trade agreement went outside the scope of tariff policy changes, many members of Congress felt Johnson had overstepped his bounds, and Congress decided not to implement the parts of the agreement pertaining to non-tariff barriers. This debate eventually led to the creation of the Trade Act of 1974, which has been renewed periodically since then, and is currently in front of Congress as the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. The idea behind the 1974 legislation was that it would give Congress more oversight than it previously had on trade negotiations -- specifically non-tariff barriers policy -- by increasing review processes and requiring final congressional approval. But by implementing the fast-track procedures, such as prohibiting amendments and filibusters, Congress would not be able to dismantle a long-fought final deal. Nearly ‘every president’ A 2015 Congressional Research Service report treats both the tariff legislation and today’s fast-track policies as one in the same in comparing trade authority given to each of the 12 presidents since Roosevelt until Obama. (See Appendix A.) Going by that account, Ryan is close but wrong. Presidents Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Johnson, all had tariff reduction authority at some point in their administrations. And Congress gave Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, trade promotion authority. But missing from this list is Richard Nixon, who was president during -- and involved with -- the debates that led to the 1974 trade promotion authority law. ""Technically, Nixon never had the authority, but the process was well advanced when he resigned,"" said Mac Destler, an expert in American trade politics at the University of Maryland. In other words, Nixon would have gotten the authority had he not resigned. (Gerald Ford did get fast-track authority.) Ian Fergusson, the Congressional Research Service report author, affirmed Ryan’s claim -- saying, ""Every president except Nixon"" had fast-track trade authority. Fergusson noted, though, that Clinton only had trade promotion authority in the first two years of his presidency, and Congress denied his 1997 request to renew. (Obama hasn’t had it yet.) Of course, reasonable people can disagree over whether the 1930s legislation is equivalent to the fast-track authority that’s been around since 1974, affecting interpretation of the list. ""No, FDR did not create fast-track trade authority. And, JFK did not celebrate its renewal,"" wrote fast-track critic Lori Wallach, director of global trade for advocacy group Public Citizen, in a 2014 blog. Wallach, who wrote a book on fast-track, argued that allowing the president to negotiate non-tariff barriers, not just tariffs, sets modern legislation apart. Our ruling Ryan said, ""Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had"" fast-track trade authority. From the 1930s until today, Every president except Nixon (and Obama) has had the ability to negotiate aspects of foreign trade policy with limited congressional involvement. But these policies aren’t 100 percent apples to apples. For one, today’s policy involves more congressional oversight than the policy in place through the 1960s. Additionally, the original policy only pertained to tariff reductions, while today’s policy includes non-tariff barriers to trade. (Up until the late 1960s, foreign trade negotiations focused nearly exclusively on tariffs.) On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFF9080>],/factchecks/2015/may/17/paul-ryan/fast-track-trade-authority-has-every-president-fdr/

Anti-marijuana advocate says treatment levels have reached their highest point in 20 years
","When the House Judiciary Committee was considering legislation to tax and regulate marijuana, Kathleen Sullivan, Warren’s substance abuse coordinator, stepped forward to warn the committee about the dangers of marijuana use. ""We do know that the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years,"" she told the committee during the April 29 hearing. When we contacted her for details, she emailed statistics collected from the states by the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Her data on admissions for substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, ranged from 1993 through 2011, a year shy of the 20 years she spoke of. According to those statistics, the rate of admissions in 1993 was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older. In 2011, the rate was 166 admissions. But this wasn’t the highest that the rate has ever been over the past two decades. It peaked at 218 in 2009 and then declined in the next two years. The number of admissions, unadjusted for population, peaked that year as well, and then dropped. When we looked at the number of admissions that the federal agency reported online for 2012 and 2013, we found that the decline has continued, showing a drop each year since 2009. In her email, Sullivan qualified her statement saying: ""I was referring to the overall trend in marijuana admissions."" So we took another look at the data and examined the trend in admission rates, even though she didn’t make this distinction in her testimony. The trend from beginning to end for admissions per 100,000 teens and adults has been up over the past two decades. But if you look at the trend line since 1999, there has been no statistically significant increase.   We also contacted the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration directly and officials there told us there are limitations to the data that make Sullivan's position problematic. One major problem is that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times he or she has been admitted for treatment, explained Kelley Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. Smith said the data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set or TEDS, do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. ""Not according to TEDS,"" Smith said in an email. ""According to TEDS, the percentages have remained relatively stable."" Our ruling Kathleen Sullivan said the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, has reached its highest point in 20 years. Her documentation shows a peak in 2009, but then admissions decline through 2011. More recent data show the decline has continued. Further, our trend analysis shows no increase since 1999. And a federal statistician at the agency that compiled the data said admission rates have been ""relatively stable"" over the past 20 years. We rate her statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE94E40>],/factchecks/2015/may/17/kathleen-sullivan/anti-marijuana-advocate-says-treatment-levels-have/

Children's Defense Fund-Texas says Texas failure to expand Medicaid caused rural hospital closings
","Hold up on providing Texas tax cuts, an advocacy group says, because the billions of dollars in play would be better spent on children. Patrick Bresette, executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund-Texas, maintained in an April 28, 2015, statement sent to reporters that more than $4 billion in tax reductions under consideration by the Republican-led Texas Senate and House would serve the state’s wealthiest. ""We are further distressed,"" Bresette said, ""that the House is considering such deep reductions to its revenue stream while our state is standing on the brink of a health care crisis. ""In the last 24 months,"" Bresette said, ""ten rural Texas hospitals have been forced to shut their doors because state leaders have chosen not to invest in our state’s health care systems by rejecting billions in available Medicaid funds to cover more of our state’s uninsured."" Ten country hospitals shuttered due to leaders spurning Medicaid? We confirmed some closings while learning about multiple factors for the closings including GOP resistance to expanding the Medicaid program to many Texas adults as intended by the 2010 Obamacare law. Let’s tally the closings, then cover possible reasons. Children's Defense Fund backup Anat Kelman Shaw of the Children’s Defense Fund-Texas emailed us web links to news stories declaring 10 rural hospitals had closed of late. We also reached the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, which provided its April 2015 list of rural hospitals shut down since 1995. The list showed 10 that closed from February 2013 through December 2014 though we confirmed that within that group, the Central Texas Hospital in Cameron was later succeeded by the Little River Healthcare (its website says it’s Cameron Hospital) and the shuttered Cozby-Germany Hospital in Grand Saline was later converted to the Texas General Hospital Van Zandt Regional Medical Center, which opened April 18, 2015, Suleman Hashmi, president of Texas General Hospital LP, told us by phone. The other TORCH-listed hospitals and their closing dates: Renaissance Hospital in Terrell (February 2013) Shelby Regional Medical Center in Center (July 2013) Lake Whitney Medical Center in Whitney (April 2014) Good Shepherd Medical Center in Linden (April 2014) Cleveland Regional in Cleveland (August 2014) East Texas Medical Center in Gilmer (December 2014) East Texas Medical Center in Mount Vernon (December 2014) East Texas Medical Center in Clarksville (December 2014). Another aspect: While checking these hospital names, we noticed the ones in Terrell, Center, Grand Saline and Whitney had been owned by a legally embattled physician, Tariq Mahmood, who was found guilty in Dallas County in July 2014 of defrauding Medicare by submitting more than $1.1 million in bogus billing claims—making us wonder to what extent his involvement drove those closings. Separately, we asked the Texas Department of State Health Services about the closings. By email, spokesman Chris Van Deusen guided us to an agency chart showing that as of April 2015, more than 660 hospitals were licensed by the state. The list didn’t lead us to identify any additional hospital openings in rural Texas over the 24 months in question. So, did the state’s non-expansion of Medicaid cause the closings? Texas Republican opposition to expanding Medicaid To be sure, Texas Republicans have staunchly opposed Medicaid expansion. The Obamacare law required states to widen access to Medicaid. But after the U.S. Supreme Court found the mandate unconstitutional, the government left it up to each state to widen access with Uncle Sam covering related costs for three years. In July 2012, Texas Gov. Rick Perry rejected the deal, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. In 2013, in turn, the Republican-led Legislature ""shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid,"" according to a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story. Through the first four months of the 2015 legislative session, Shaw pointed out, Democratic attempts to win a reversal didn't get traction. Non-expansion has left many Texas adults uninsured. In March 2015, we found Mostly True a claim by the Texas Democratic Party that more than 1 million Texans lacked affordable health care due to the decision not to expand. That is, around 1 million adults were making too little money to qualify for private insurance subsidies offered under the Obamacare law and they also remained ineligible for Medicaid because Texas did not expand access. Closed hospitals cite various factors Shaw, asked to elaborate on the state not expanding Medicaid causing rural hospitals to close, pointed out a March 2015 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal news story quoting TORCH’s Don McBeath, the former judge of  Lubbock County, saying: ""Rural hospitals have always operated on a very narrow financial margin and have been hit with a series of payment cuts from Medicaid and Medicare in the past four years."" An April 4, 2015, Graham Leader news story quoted Larry Kovar, chairman of the board of the Graham Regional Medical Center, which had laid off 15 workers, saying the hospital had lost significant revenue because Texas opted out of Medicaid expansion. ""A lot more people would have been eligible for Medicaid (had Texas accepted the expansion), and the government was paying 100 percent of that Medicaid, certainly for the next several years,"" Kovar said. ""And that would have brought in more money to the hospital, obviously."" Kovar also said: ""Unfortunately, to the extent that we didn’t accept that Medicaid, the hospital is funding those patients now through indigent care and such programs in lieu of the expanded Medicaid. We still treat those people, but they’re not eligible for Medicaid, so it hurts the hospital to some extent."" Earlier, a March 6, 2015, news item in the Quorum Report, a Capitol newsletter, quoted Jack Endres, the administrator of East Texas Medical Center-Jacksonville, saying financial troubles led to its closing the hospitals in Clarksville, Mount Vernon and Gilmer. Endres said cuts in state and federal payments needed to be reversed or more hospitals would close. By phone, Endres told us he doesn’t know if the state’s resistance to expanding Medicaid was the driving factor in the closings. ""It was certainly a factor,"" Endres said. ""We’re basically getting death by a thousand cuts, one thing after another."" In that vein, a March 20, 2015, Texas Tribune news story declared multiple factors behind such rural shutdowns, stating hospitals were suffering due to unfulfilled promises ""of federal health reform, payment cuts by both government programs and private insurers, falling patient volumes and a declining rural population...  Add to that Texas’ distinction as the state with the highest percentage of people without health insurance and you get a financially hostile landscape for rural hospital operators."" The story, written in partnership with Kaiser Health News, affiliated with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, quoted John Henderson, chief executive of the Childress Regional Medical Center, taking note of the state’s historically huge uninsured population and saying: ""And we took Medicare cuts hoping that we could cover more people."" Henderson, the story said, was referring to an agreement negotiated by the American Hospital Association when Democrats in Congress were drafting the Obamacare law. ""The idea was that hospitals would take cuts to their Medicare payments, but in return they would have to spend less on ‘charity care’ because most patients would have health insurance,"" the story said. ""But because Texas' Republican leadership has vehemently opposed expanding Medicaid to low-income adults, hospitals say they are paying the price for cost savings they didn't receive."" Moreover, the Tribune reported, federal health reform mandated penalties for hospitals, rural and urban, that had too many patients readmitted for follow-up care. Another program, the story said, cracks the whip on hospitals where too many patients get sick during their stay. On top of that, federal sequestration, the fairly new budget-cutting practice, ""has meant a 2 percent across-the-board cut to Medicare payments,"" the story said, with rural hospitals taking a further hit from the Obamacare law’s reductions in ""disproportionate share hospital"" payments to hospitals with large numbers of indigent and uninsured patients. Meanwhile in Texas, the story said, the 2011 Texas Legislature imposed a 10 percent cut in payments for all Medicaid outpatient care as part of balancing the state budget; that reduction remains. Upshot: It looks like various federal and state actions contributed to reduced revenues. Other views We asked TORCH’s McBeath and a national representative of rural hospitals to discuss Bresette’s statement. By phone, McBeath and Alan Morgan, chief executive of the Washington, D.C.-based National Rural Health Association, each said multiple factors including Texas not expanding Medicaid access have played into hospital closings. Morgan said factors include the Obamacare law reducing payments to hospitals for uncompensated care (services to individuals lacking health coverage)--the wrinkle intended to take advantage of more Americans getting covered by Medicaid. Also, Morgan said, Congress approved reductions in Medicare payments--focusing on outcomes rather than procedures--which reduced income streams. Nationally since 2010, Morgan said, about 50 rural hospitals have closed compared to none the prior decade. ""Of the 50 rural hospitals that have closed, I’ve heard 50 different stories. Poor leadership, lack of community support, board relations"" plus, he said, a lack of financial support at the state, local or federal levels. McBeath said he sees no single reason rural hospitals have closed in Texas. ""In simple terms, those hospitals closed because their revenue did not match up to their expenses,"" he said. Outside factors, he said, included the reduced federal payments for uncompensated care. Also, he said, there was the 2011 Legislature’s 10-percent cut in Medicaid outpatient payments to hospitals and a change cutting 20 percent from payments for patients treated in an emergency room whose needs weren’t emergencies. It’s worth noting, McBeath said, rural hospitals serve a large share of uninsured Texans. Per the closings, McBeath said, ""it’s not correct to blame one thing. But the lack of Medicaid expansion continues to be"" a factor. We followed up with Bresette, who said by email that if he had a chance to make his statement afresh, he’d say the decision not to expand Medicaid access was among actions forcing hospitals to shut their doors. Our ruling Children’s Defense Fund-Texas said: ""In the last 24 months, 10 rural Texas hospitals have been forced to shut their doors because state leaders have chosen not to invest in our state’s health care systems by rejecting billions in available Medicaid funds to cover more of our state’s uninsured."" Ten rural hospitals closed, we found, though different hospitals later opened on two sites. Also, as Bresette acknowledged, the non-expansion of Medicaid wasn’t the only reason for the rural closings. Our sense is they occurred due to various squeezes extending, in a few cases, to an owner’s fraudulent acts. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 2:01 p.m., May 15, 2015: We revised the wording of our ruling to clarify that Bresette acknowledged the non-expansion of Medicaid wasn't the only reason for the hospital closings and to make it clear we found a range of factors.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC630E80>],/factchecks/2015/may/15/childrens-defense-fund-texas/childrens-defense-fund-texas-says-texas-failure-ex/

Labor Secretary Thomas Perez weighs incarceration's role in inner-city Baltimore's bleak job picture
","When Baltimore erupted into riots after the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who had been taken into police custody, many politicians addressed deep-seated economic problems affecting some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe on May 7, 2015, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez what could be done to increase economic opportunity and stability in low-income urban areas in Baltimore and the rest of the country. ""First of all, the over-incarceration that you've talked about on this show so compellingly, you see it in Baltimore city,"" Perez said. ""In 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce. The incarceration challenges -- there are so many people who lack a role model and they lack a bread-earner in their family. And so we spend a lot of time talking about how do we help people who are coming out of prisons to get those skills and jobs to compete."" We were struck by the claim that ""in 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce,"" and especially by how much had to do with ""over-incarceration."" When we looked through the data and talked to economists, we found that Perez had a reasonable point to make but that the numbers he cited glossed over some important complicating factors. Looking at Perez’s data When we checked with Perez’s office, a spokesman said his comment referred to data cited by Jason Furman, the chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in a 2014 speech at the Brookings Institution. In that speech, Furman cited the employment-to-population ratio for black men ages 16-24 for both 1950 and the second quarter of 2014. The employment-to-population ratio, which economists call EPOP for short, is a rough measure of how common it is for a population to be working. In most cases, a higher EPOP is preferable to a lower one, because it indicates that more of the population is engaged in productive economic activity. According to Furman, in 1950, the EPOP for black men from that age group was 65 percent, which is close to the ""two out of three"" that Perez cited. In the second quarter of 2014, according to Furman, the rate had fallen to 37 percent, a little higher than the ""one out of three"" that Perez cited. So on the numbers, Perez was close. But we found some caveats that weaken the usefulness of those numbers for making his case. • This calculation ignores a great increase in educational opportunity for young black men. Remember how we said ""in most cases"" a higher EPOP is better than a lower one? Well, there are certain situations in which that’s not necessarily the case. Back in 1950, a large share of young black men faced Jim Crow policies and poor educational options, leaving them with little alternative but finding a job. This would tend to raise the EPOP for young black men, but for a reason we would consider negative. While educational opportunities for young black men today are far from perfect, they are nonetheless much improved. The data shows that in 1972, the oldest year available, 21 percent of black men were in college; by 2012, that had risen to 34 percent. And black high school dropout rates have fallen over the same period. If you were to start the statistical clock at 1950, the improvement might be even more dramatic. In other words, increased educational opportunity and attainment among young black men -- which is usually a positive development -- almost certainly accounts for part of the decline in EPOP. This ""should mitigate our concern about the declining rates of young black men,"" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings economist. Burtless did emphasize, though, that it’s hard to know how much concern should be mitigated by the expansion in educational opportunity, since other, more negative trends -- such as incarceration -- have also likely contributed to the decline in employment among young black men. Indeed, Perez’s office noted that the decline in EPOP was twice as big among young black men as it was for another group that saw increasing enrollment -- young white men. • All of the data Perez cites actually excludes incarcerated individuals. For various technical reasons, federal labor-force statistics tend to look only at the ""civilian, non-institutionalized population."" For starters, this means that those employed in the military are excluded from the calculation -- not a trivial factor in this case, since blacks were underrepresented in the military between 1940 and 1973 but overrepresented in more recent years. The more important consequence of this methodology is that individuals who are incarcerated aren’t counted in the statistics Perez cited, even though his comment seemed to link ""over-incarceration"" with the statistical comparison. Perez’s office did note that the statistics do capture people who were previously incarcerated and are, as a result, put at a disadvantage once they re-enter society and the labor market. That’s correct, but once again, the picture is more nuanced on this point than Perez let on in his interview. Where Perez has a point At the same time, several economists told us that even if Perez used a questionable statistic in making his point, the point he was trying to make had merit. ""In general, my impression is that Perez is pointing to a serious social problem, even if his statistics are a bit off or poorly defined,"" Burtless said. Since the 1950s, ""young black men have been less likely to find and hold jobs, and one reason is that they are more likely to have become entangled with the criminal-justice system, making it harder for them to get job offers."" In addition, he said, ""the neighborhoods of a lot of black youth are often some distance from where there are plentiful job openings. Whatever the reasons, black male youths nowadays have fewer connections to the job market and more to the criminal justice system than was the case in the 1950s and early 1970s."" Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, agreed that Perez had a point. ""What he was saying was reasonable, even if he did not use the right statistic to back it up"" Our ruling Perez said due to ""over-incarceration … in 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce."" Perez has a point that incarceration has made it harder for many young black men to find jobs. Perez’s problem was choosing a statistic that doesn’t precisely support his point. The decline in employment rates for young black men stems at least partially from improved educational opportunities -- which is generally a positive development -- and the data he offers specifically excludes currently incarcerated individuals. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA7FCC0>],/factchecks/2015/may/15/thomas-perez/labor-secretary-tom-perez-discusses-incarcerations/

Rob Wittman says 2005 BRAC round of base closings hasn't led to savings
","U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman is trying to thwart the Pentagon’s efforts to begin a new round of military base closing. There have been five rounds of closures in recent decades, starting in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union collapsed and the U.S. military retooled for a post-Cold War mission. The last round took place in 2005 and talk of new spate is worrying congressmen who have bases in their districts. Wittman, a Republican, represents Virginia’s 1st District which includes the Army’s Fort A.P. Hill and the Marine base in Quantico. He recently questioned whether a new round of the Base Realignment and Closure program -- known as BRAC -- made strategic and economic sense. ""We cannot forget that the 2005 BRAC round has not yet resulted in savings,"" he stated in an April 30 news release. We checked to see if he was right about the lacking of savings. Gordon Neal, Wittman’s spokesman, sent us a 2009 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that examined the bottom line of the 2005 BRAC, which shuttered 24 bases, realigned 24 others and eliminated about 12,000 civilian jobs. Calculations in the report were based on a Pentagon estimate that the 2005 BRAC would save Uncle Sam $3.9 billion a year -- an estimate that the GAO said is probably high. The GAO also noted that the military spent $35 billion implementing BRAC, far above the original $21 billion estimate. For example, it cost $1.7 billion more than expected to close Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington and move its operations to Fort Belvoir, Va. and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. A chart in the report shows the annual savings started in 2006, but those economies weren’t expected to be enough to pay off the upfront costs of BRAC until 2018, five years later than originally projected. The GAO updated its analysis in 2012 and found that the savings and cost estimates were still about the same. That’s the last time the agency did a cost analysis of the 2005 BRAC. ""So 2018 should still be about the time that the savings would exceed the cost,"" Brian Lepore,  GAO’s director of defense capabilities and management, wrote in an email. We spoke to two defense budget analysts and they both told us that Wittman’s statement is correct that the U.S. hasn’t yet pocketed ""net savings"" from the realignment. But that doesn’t mean the program isn’t paying off. Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the last round of BRAC is producing savings but, for the moment, they’re going towards recovering the costs of implementing the program. ""We are going to hit the break even point, and after that it’s all savings,"" Harrison told us. Harrison was among nearly 40 defense analysts who late last month signed a letter supporting the Pentagon’s call for another round of closings, saying there are surplus military installations around the nation. Harrison said Wittman’s use of the 2005 BRAC to argue against another round is off base. The last realignment round was different from the four that came in the 1980s and 1990s, Harrison said, because it focused much more heavily on base consolidations than previous rounds that were mostly directed at merely shuttering facilities. Consolidations are more expensive, he said, because they entail moving operations from one place to another, which means buildings have to be constructed. In 2012, Dorothy Robyn, then deputy under secretary of defense, made the same point in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. ""In short, the 2005 round took place during a period of growth in the military, and it reflected the goals and needs of that time. Because the focus was on transforming installations to better support forces -- as opposed to saving money and space -- it is a poor gauge of the savings that the Department can achieve through another BRAC round,"" she stated in written testimony.
