Chris Abele says Mitchell Park Domes cost taxpayers 1 million a year, have fewer visitors
","In February, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele declared the Mitchell Park Domes must be closed, at least temporarily, after chunks of concrete fell from high above. Meanwhile, a consultant told the county it could cost $65 million to $75 million to repair the deteriorating Domes, which house plants from around the world. Almost overnight, the future of the popular attraction became a key issue in the April 5, 2016 election between Abele and challenger Chris Larson, a Democratic state senator. Larson calls the three-dome complex a county treasure and vows to keep the facility running. Abele has been more open to a change, even suggesting residents may prefer something else, such as an amphitheater, to replace them. In a March 3, 2016 interview on WISN-TV, Abele argued it is important to keep options open because the Domes are expensive to operate and not as popular as in past years. ""What most people don't know is that the Domes lose $1 million-plus each year,"" he said in the interview. ""The number of people going to the Domes has been going down."" That doesn’t sound good. But the county’s own web site offers a different take. ""The Domes run an annual operating deficit averaging $630,000 per year, even as attendance has increased,"" it says, crediting creative programming. Indeed, that programming has taken place under Abele’s watch. So, which is right? Losing money Unlike a freestanding business, the Domes don’t report a ""loss"" when expenses exceed revenue. Rather, the difference falls to county taxpayers. The loss refers to how much in general property tax money it costs to keep the attraction open, above and beyond admissions and space rental fees (and after expenses). County figures show that going back five years, taxpayer support has ranged from a low of $386,803 in 2015 to a high of $1.11 million in 2014. That was the only year the loss topped $1 million, undermining the ""each year"" part of Abele’s claim. The average amount spent by taxpayers in that five-year period was $628,000 – just about what the county’s web site said. A memo provided by Abele spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said that ""spikes in expenses in recent years are due to engineering studies and significant remedial work completed on the structure."" The costs for 2016, of course, are likely to be higher. For instance, the county plans to spend $500,000 on netting and other measures so the facility can reopen while officials sort out its long-term future. Attendance Likewise, the numbers show the opposite of what Abele claimed when it comes to attendance. There has been a steady increase in the past five years, from 187,658 in 2011 – the first year that Abele was in office – to 240,179 in 2015. Baldauff acknowledged the recent growth in attendance, but noted: ""In the past the Domes saw annual attendance of more than 374,000 people."" She added: ""We are far away from the attendance the Domes used to see."" We asked: When did the Domes last have 374,000 visitors? The answer: 1988. But that was a generation ago. There have undoubtedly been ups and downs over the years since, but there’s no question attendance has been on the rise. Our rating Abele says the Domes lose more than $1 million every year and that the number of people visiting the attraction has been declining. He’s wrong on both counts. In the past five years, the tab for county taxpayers exceeded $1 million once. On average it was $630,000. Meanwhile, attendance has actually increased 28 percent under his watch.

Katie McGinty: Daycare costs almost at college tuition levels
","Working class families need more support for child care costs, according to Katie McGinty, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate and Tom Wolf’s former chief of staff. In her recently released ""Agenda for Working Women and Working Families,"" she threw support behind the Sen. Bob Casey-sponsored Child CARE Act, a measure that would beef up tax credits for low-income parents to help with make early childhood programs more affordable. McGinty’s agenda offers figures to back her rationale: ""Here in Pennsylvania, the annual cost for infant childcare is over $10,000 per child, which is more than most families pay in rent and almost the same cost as in-state college tuition."" The senate candidate’s figures on child care, rent and tuition all hail from a Child Care Aware of America report released this past December. The following are the yearly averages provided in this report for Pennsylvania: Sending a toddler to daycare ($10,640) is 20 percent less expensive than sending a kid off to college to a state four-year institution ($13,246), but indeed costs more than a year of rent ($9,780). But where did Child Care Aware of America, a consumer education network, get their numbers from exactly? The estimates for child care costs they tabulated themselves, culling data from local chapters nationwide, sourcing market surveys from state departments of human services and adjusting for inflation when applicable, in Pennsylvania’s case, for figures from 2012. But with that said, Kait Gillis, press secretary for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the department is ""comfortable with that number."" The report says it pulls its rental estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the tuition price from the 2013 College Board ""Trends in College Pricing"" report. However, these are not where the numbers are from, a Child Care Aware of America researcher confirms. The correct College Board trends report sourced was the 2014 edition. Annualized rent came not from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but a 2013 Census monthly estimate. Cross-referencing with the accurate sources shows that these numbers were recorded exactly in the report. The five-figure expense of early childhood programs may come as a surprise, but according to economics reporter Jordan Weissmann, the enrollment costs have been scaling upward since the ’80s. In a report for Slate last year, Weissmann debunks an earlier inkling of his: That tight government regulations on educator ratios and facility size might be causing costs to rise. Studies prove otherwise, he wrote. ""It’s fairly simple. You have to pay human beings to watch over kids. And while child care workers aren’t paid especially well, they do have to be paid,"" explained Weissmann. ""If you look at sample budgets for day care centers, or talk to people in the industry, they’ll tell you that, aside from real estate, most of the costs boil down to labor."" Our ruling McGinty said, ""Here in Pennsylvania, the annual cost for infant childcare is over $10,000 per child, which is more than most families pay in rent and almost the same cost as in-state college tuition."" 
Average infant childcare costs in Pennsylvania do surpass rent prices, as McGinty accurately states. The questionable portion of this claim is the comparison between child care and college tuition and whether these prices are ""almost the same."" Average college tuition for public colleges in the Keystone state is 20 percent higher -- not the largest difference, but still significant, especially to lower-income families. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/18/katie-mcginty/child-care-pennsylvania-more-expensive-rent-and-co/

Mike Honda shares accurate graphic about past Supreme Court nominations
","In a Medium post titled, ""It’s Time for the Senate to Do Its Job,"" Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., urged senators to hold a vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Senate Republicans have so far held firm in saying they will not vote on the nomination until the public weighs in after Election Day 2016. Democrats counter that this is out of step with Senate norms, and they have created a graphic to make that case. ""Let’s give President Obama’s #SCOTUSnominee a fair hearing and timely vote,"" the graphic says. At the top of Honda’s March 16 Medium post is a graphic created by the House Democratic Caucus. Under the title, ""6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912,"" the graphic shows photographs of all six justices who fit that description. Is it accurate? Of the six examples cited in the graphic going back to 1912, five were both nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year. They are summarized in the following chart. (We’ve corrected the spelling of Clarke’s name, which is incorrect in the Democrats’ graphic).  The sixth case involves a future justice who was nominated prior to an election year but was confirmed during one. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who’s still on the court, was confirmed in February 1988, but President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated him in November 1987 to succeed the retiring Louis Powell. It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. Finally, in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a ""recess appointment"" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. Our ruling The graphic Honda used said that ""six justices"" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been ""confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."" That is correct, so we rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/17/mike-honda/mike-honda-shares-accurate-graphic-about-past-supr/

Clinton ad claims Arizona lags in K-12 education
","With Arizona’s Presidential Preference Election set for Tuesday, presidential candidates -- and their accompanying advertisements -- have picked up steam. Hillary Clinton’s campaign aired a 30-second spot on Arizona airwaves on March 16 specific to K-12 education. ""Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student,"" the ad states. ""Hillary knows our kids deserve better, education means a good job, a decent living."" The ad proposes preschool for every student as well as college without ""crushing debt."" The ad cites a January 2016 Education Week ranking for the 45th in the nation claim. Education Week uses several measures, including finance, achievement and chance for success. Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said the numbers were accurate based on the sources cited. For the dead last in funding per student part of the claim, the ad cites the Arizona School Boards Association, a statewide nonprofit. Clinton campaign spokesman Tim Hogan noted that both claims were from the Education Week report. Education Week uses data from several federal agencies, including the U.S. Education Department, U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Commerce Department. According to the data, Arizona spends $7,733 per student, almost 35 percent less than the national average of $11,841 per student. The numbers are adjusted for regional cost differences. In fiscal year 2013, Arizona ranked 49th, out of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, in per student spending, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""That’s the sad reality, the lack of investment in human capital,"" said Arizona School Boards Association Executive Director Timothy Ogle. However, Arizona isn’t dead last in per-student spending -- Utah is. According to Education Week’s regionally adjusted numbers, Utah ranks 51st, spending $7,084 per student. The data includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. However, the actual text of the advertisement does mention that Arizona is 50th in per student funding though, which is correct. They’re just not dead last. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign said, ""Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student."" Education Week data vets the first claim, but the advertisement is off by one in its claim that the Grand Canyon State is dead last. Utah is.

USAID head overshoots gains on getting more kids into school
","The new head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Gayle Smith gave policymakers a first look at her vision of what USAID should be doing. As she steps into the early rounds of defending the administration's budget request, Smith said in a speech on Capitol Hill that she’s grateful that most of America’s foreign assistance debate enjoys a lot of bipartisan support. She listed a number of fronts where this has helped lead to global progress, from curtailing the spread of HIV/AIDS to reducing extreme poverty. Smith also mentioned successes in education. ""I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress,"" Smith said. ""Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago."" We wanted to fact-check Smith’s claim about how many children are out of school. For the record, the first part of Smith’s statement about boys and girls enrolling at equal rates is largely on the money. According to the World Bank, most parts of the world are at or close to parity in terms of seeing equal percentages of girls and boys who go to school. The two regions that lag behind are Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, but the gap is not enormous and they have made a lot of progress since 2000. Now, are there half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago? Benjamin Edwards, spokesman for USAID, told us that Smith’s source was the United Nations 2015 Millennium Development Goals report. In the section on education, it says, ""Currently, 57 million children of primary school age are estimated to be out of school, down from 100 million in 2000."" And in a list of bullet points, the report says the number has ""fallen by almost half."" We note that if you do the math, the actual estimated decline is 43 percent. So what we have is a sort of statistical glide. The writers of a UN report massaged 43 percent to make it ""almost half,"" then someone at USAID moved things a bit further by dropping the qualifier ""almost"" and Smith ends up saying ""there are half as many children out of school."" This might not matter, except there’s reason to question the underlying estimate in that UN report. In fact, while the gains since 2000 are significant, current trends could be negative, not positive. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, better known as UNESCO, is the keeper of the original data. The most recent information goes only to 2013. Based on UNESCO's actual figures, the number of out-of-school children fell by 40 percent from 2000-13, as we can see in this table: 2000 2013 Change 2000-13 World 98,654,408 59,256,395 40% Caucasus and Central Asia 358,127 342,111 4% Latin America & the Caribbean 3,330,636 4,066,213 -22% Northern Africa 1,935,001 232,304 88% Sub-Saharan Africa 42,873,204 32,960,434 23% Western Asia 3,039,656 2,045,168 33% Eastern Asia 5,924,921 2,680,949 55% South-Eastern Asia 4,745,734 3,636,624 23% Southern Asia 33,849,211 10,349,757 69% Oceania 330,316 188,308 43%   So based on hard data, the gains look less and less like ""about half."" On top of that, in its 2015 report on out-of-school children, UNESCO flagged that there has been largely no progress since 2007. That year, about 60 million young children were not in school. And the agency warned that the situation could deteriorate. ""Progress has stalled and there are serious concerns that unless something changes — and fast — hard-won achievements on primary enrollment could begin to erode,"" the report said. A 2015 UNESCO policy paper put the problem in starker terms. It highlighted that the number of out-of-school children has been rising since 2010. That is true for both primary and secondary school-age children. Curiously, the writers of the UN Millennium Development Goals report had this information and posited that progress, at least globally, would continue. We looked at their statistical annex and found no explanation for this positive forecast. Elaine Unterhalter, professor of education and international development at University College London, told us there’s even more reason today to doubt that steady progress is under way. ""The gains are based on data before the large-scale refugee crisis engulfing Syria and Iraq, and the internal displacement in Nigeria and Sudan,"" Unterhalter said. ""So, while definitely there are gains, we must be cautious about over-claiming."" Uneven gains and stalled progress While Smith’s figure is a bit high and runs counter to the trends since 2010, a further flaw is that it masks enormous regional variation. Southern Asia, which includes India, drove down the number of out-of-school children by nearly 70 percent. Northern Africa, reaching from Morocco to Egypt, had far fewer children to educate but saw nearly a 90 percent decrease in those that were not in school. Those gains stand in sharp contrast to the numbers for Latin America and the Caribbean where the problem grew worse, not better. In Sub-Saharan Africa with the largest number of young children, the decline was only about 25 percent. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a particular challenge. It is a region where the rising population of school-age children is rapidly outstripping the capacity of governments to expand their education systems. In its 2015 report, UNESCO said that decreases in just 11 nations accounted for over half of the global decline. Nicole Bella, a senior policy analyst at UNESCO, told us a key factor in those gains was pretty basic -- money. ""Low- and lower-middle income countries have allocated a higher percentage of Gross National Product to education since 1999, and aid to education has more than doubled in real terms,"" Bella said. Governments built more schools, hired more teachers and cut or eliminated school fees. Bella said some also started feeding students and passed laws designed to reach kids who live in poorer households. She noted that the poorest children are ""four times more likely not to go to school than the richest children, and five times more likely not to complete primary school."" But Bella told us that government efforts to get more children into school have slowed. Unterhalter said that there’s no simple solution to dealing with the remaining out-of-school children. The issues are many, and so a wide range of strategies would need to be brought to bear. Major hurdles The UNESCO study found that the single greatest reason why children aren’t in school when they should be is war and other forms of armed conflict. Fighting destroys schools, scatters students and teachers, and often draws teenagers directly into the conflict as fighters themselves. Following the impact of war on schooling, the report cites ""entrenched gender roles"" that systematically reduce the opportunities for girls to go to school in the first place, or to remain in school if they start. The demand for child labor, and the family’s need for a child to work, also diverts children from an education. One of the original Millennium Development Goals was to ensure that every child would be able to complete primary school. That goal has not been met and according to UNESCO, there is a real risk it will slide further out of reach. Our ruling Smith said that there are half as many primary-age children out of school today as there were 15 years ago. That’s a bit high. Smith took the words in an UN report that described the gains as ""almost half"" and dropped the qualifier. That would be a minor issue except the UN language itself was based on a projection that runs counter to the findings of the UN’s main agency on education, UNESCO. Based on hard data, the actual number is about 40 percent, and most important, the trend since 2010 is negative. We also note that the global figure masks large regional differences where progress has been absent or much more limited. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Don Gaetz']","
Legislature provided $428 million worth of property tax relief, Sen. Don Gaetz says
","The Florida Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott didn’t see eye-to-eye on much during the 2016 session, but they both acknowledged education spending should go up. Even then, however, they couldn’t agree on how to do it. Scott wanted to pay for it almost entirely by increasing a share of property taxes known as the Required Local Effort. Legislators balked at that idea, especially in the Senate, because they didn’t want homeowners to bear most of the burden by paying more in taxes. After several rounds of negotiation, the House and Senate settled on a solution of reducing the rate of property taxes and supplementing spending with more money from state coffers. They passed their compromise as part of the overall budget on March 11, 2016. ""You can go home and say that under President (Andy) Gardiner, we were able to provide $428 million worth of property tax relief,"" Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said on the Senate floor. That’s a hefty tax break while boosting the education budget by almost half a billion dollars. We wondered whether the math added up the way Gaetz and other lawmakers said it did. It turns out the state did chip in an extra $428 million to keep property tax bills from going up, but it’s a pretty wonky process. An education in taxes We’re going to explain this in the simplest terms possible, because education funding and property taxes are complex. Just look at your property tax bill in November and you’ll see what we mean. The education budget the Legislature passes each year is based on two parts: state funding and local funding. This local funding includes a discretionary millage rate on property that counties control, and a millage rate for the so-called required local effort. (A ""mill"" is a levy of $1 for every $1,000 in taxable value on a property. If your house is worth $100,000, a one-mill rate equals $100.) The required local effort is paid for through a millage rate the Legislature sets annually, and local governments must assess that rate on property owners in order to kick in enough cash for schools and get their share of state funding. While lawmakers in Tallahassee set the rate each year, what they’re really doing is setting a dollar amount local governments need to contribute.   We should note that the overall projection of what the required local effort would bring in doesn’t differentiate between counties or specific real estate markets. Because of the way the Department of Education revises its budget over the course of the year, different counties will be paying different amounts, based on their markets and school districts’ needs. Keep in mind, the state’s economy has rebounded from the recession fairly well. Property values are up, and so are tax collections on those properties. That’s because even if the government is charging the same millage rate on a property as the year before, the taxable value has increased, raising the tax bill. Last year, when the millage rate was 4.984 mills, the required local effort was $7.6 billion. The projected local property tax collections for the 2016-17 budget were set at more than $8 billion, if they kept the same millage rate. Scott was largely banking on this increase to pay for a bigger budget, but legislators said no. They didn’t want property owners paying more than the $7.6 billion they paid in 2015, so they used state tax money instead of more local property taxes. To use Gaetz’s term, the budget-writers ""bought out"" the required local effort. They moved $428 million from the general revenue fund, which includes money from practically every other tax and fee except ad valorem taxes. Then they reduced the millage rate to 4.694 mills, a 0.29-mill decrease, to counter higher taxable values and bring in the same $7.6 billion in property taxes. According to state projections, the next fiscal year’s property taxes are actually slated to be $724,000 less than last year. Whether you want to consider this ""tax relief"" depends on your point of view. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at watchdog group Florida TaxWatch, said only the $724,000 reduction in property taxes could be considered an actual tax cut based on current rates. That $724,000 is literally the amount people will be saving this year over last year. The $428 million, meanwhile, is preventing an increase that is projected to happen, not cutting current taxes that people are paying now. But Gaetz was careful to say ""tax relief,"" not tax cut. There’s a lot of leeway in how you could define that. In the end, that’s $428 million homeowners will not be paying in any event. Wenner said the truest measure of whether the Legislature’s actions saved property owners any more money over last year would be to compare the new school property tax rate to the so-called ""rollback rate."" The state devises the rollback rate to show what the millage rate would have to be this year in order to collect the same amount as last year. If the rollback rate were higher than 4.694 mills, we could clearly define how much less property owners would be paying. But unfortunately we can’t examine it that way. The state doesn’t calculate rollback rates until July. Our ruling Gaetz said, ""We were able to provide $428 million worth of property tax relief."" The Legislature approved an increase to local school funding while cutting a key millage rate used to calculate the Required Local Effort. That will keep property tax collections essentially the same. The $428 million is an infusion of general revenue cash that will cover the boost in the education budget. We could quibble with Gaetz referring to this as ""tax relief,"" because the plan is altering future collections, instead of cutting current collections. But property owners are shielded from shouldering the burden of increased education spending, so we rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/17/don-gaetz/legislature-provided-428-million-worth-property-ta/

Singer Roy Zimmerman's measure of public support for Senate Republicans isn't pitch-perfect
","Progressive activist-songwriter Roy Zimmerman took a musical jab at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell amid the debate over whether Senate Republicans should consider President Barack Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. The issue is McConnell's position, coming about an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death had been confirmed, that the vacancy should not be filled until the election of a new president. Zimmerman, best known for singing about obsessive liberals and the hypnotic arguments of Republicans, contends in the song ""65 Million"" that far more people voted for the Democrats in the Senate than voted for Republicans. ""Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats,' he says between verses. 'In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people."" We wondered if Zimmerman's two points were in tune with the facts, specifically whether his numbers were correct and whether Republican senators represent a minority of the people. When we emailed his website, his wife and co-writer, Melanie Harby, immediately sent along the most recent vote totals for all the senators culled from Wikipedia. The two-thirds ratio First, we checked the Wikipedia totals against the elections database Ballotpedia.org. The Wikipedia vote tallies were different in nearly one-third of the races — in one contest the discrepancy was 71,936 votes. So we turned to a third source, the post-election reports of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Using the federal numbers as the standard, Wikipedia reported different vote totals in 31 of 100 races. Ballotpedia had discrepancies in nine of 100 races. When we used the official numbers to determine the ratio, it wasn't exactly two-thirds, but it was very close to what Zimmerman said. Congress' 54 GOP senators were elected with 47,068,532 votes. The rest of the senators collectively received 67,933,645. That means Republicans got just 69 percent of the votes garnered by all of the other senators, or just over the two-thirds that Zimmerman talked about. However, two of the non-Republicans are independents. Because they caucus with the Democrats, Harby said, it's fair to include them. That's debatable. Nonetheless, if you exclude them, the Democrats accumulated 67,355,217 votes. Put another way, Republicans earned 70 percent of the votes earned by Democrats. (The percentage only increases slightly because the independents come from states with relatively small populations — Maine and Vermont.) Why would a majority of the senators be elected by a minority of the United States population? The founding fathers allowed for that when they decided that every state — with populations large and small — would only elect two senators. So there's nothing extraordinary about having a group of senators (in this case, the Democrats) who are in the minority even though they were elected by the most votes because they won seats in large states such as California and New York. Voters vs. 'the people' But Zimmerman strikes a sour note in the second half of his statement where he says, ""In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people."" There are several reasons this is off-key. First, the Democratic victors may have garnered 20 million more votes than the Republicans who won, but that doesn't represent 20 million more voters. Remember, every voter gets to pick two senators for their state. In this case, one vote doesn't equal one voter. Second, the numbers can be skewed by the size of the population in each state. A Democrat who wins 51 percent of the vote in California (population: 39 million) can rack up a disproportionate number of votes compared to a Republican from Wyoming (population: under 600,000) who wins 95 percent of the vote. Third, the typical winning candidates in the 2012 Senate election probably got a lot more votes than the winning candidates running in 2010 or 2014 because 2012 was a presidential election year, when turnout is significantly higher. Only 58.2 percent of eligible voters voted in the 2012 presidential contest, 41 percent in 2010 and 35.9 percent in 2014. Historically, a higher turnout tends to favor the Democrats. Finally, it's problematic to suggest, as Zimmerman does, that the person who won the majority of the votes represents the majority of the people. Some candidates win with less than half the vote, which can happen in races with more that two candidates. Candidates in uncontested races may lose out because many voters don't bother to vote in those races. Candidates who get more than half the vote may not represent the majority of the people. As we alluded to above, even in the best years, more than one-third of the people eligible to vote don't go to the polls. The nation hasn't seen a turnout higher than 66.7 percent since the 1900 presidential election. The national turnout for a midterm election hasn't been above 50 percent since 1914, according to the United States Election Project. In the 2014 midterm election, it was just 36 percent. Our ruling Zimmerman said, ""Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats. In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people."" He's very close on the numbers, but he adds a sour note when he tries to equate the vote totals for the current members of the Senate to the general population.

No, Donald Trump, we are not giving Iran $150 billion for 'nothing'
","Donald Trump, fresh off winning four states in the March 15 primaries, rattled off a series of domestic and foreign policy ""disasters"" that he’ll fix, from businesses leaving the United States to terrorist threats to poorly negotiated deals. ""One of the broadcasters was saying, ‘Is there anger?’ "" Trump said. ""I’m supposed to say, ‘No there’s not, we love the way things are working. We love the deal you made with Iran. We give them $150 billion, we get nothing. We love all the deals. The trade deals are wonderful.’ ""   Okay, $150 billion in exchange for nada does sound like a pretty terrible deal — but is that actually what was agreed upon? According to all the experts we talked with, Trump’s claim is inaccurate. ""The best I can say is that he got the name of the country right. Almost nothing else in there is right,"" said Michael Malloy, an expert on economic sanctions at the University of the Pacific. No hundred-billion giveaways Trump’s statement makes it sound like we’re cutting Iran a $150 billion check. In reality, the money is already Iran’s to begin with, just frozen under the many economic sanctions levied against the country. Restrictions on Iranian assets — such as the $1.9 billion the National Iranian Oil Company was restricted from collecting from Shell for delivering crude supplies — began to thaw this year. Per the Iran deal, nuclear inspectors verified in January that Tehran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program, prompting the United States and other countries to lift the sanctions. Just how much money was being held up? Experts say $150 billion is the high end of estimates or, as Malloy put it, ""what it could possibly be in the broadest imagination."" Most peg the the total value of Iranian assets at around $100 billion, but Iran probably still won’t be able to access all of it. The deal only releases assets frozen because of Iran’s nuclear program. Assets blocked because of other sanctions (on terrorism, human rights, and missile technology) won’t change as a result of the agreement. Also, Iran won’t suddenly have all the assets at its disposal because some of it is tied up in debts. For example, about $20 billion is obligated to China, which worked around the sanctions to finance infrastructure projects in Iran. The actual amount available to Iran is about $60 billion, estimates Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew pinned it at $56 billion, while Iranian officials say $35 billion, according to Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In return, no bomb While the United States doesn’t get a cash bonus for lifting sanctions, Trump’s claim that we got ""nothing"" in return misses the point of the deal: blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb. ""We got major restrictions and intrusive transparency on Iran's nuclear program. Beyond being not ‘nothing,’ this is the entire reason why we put the sanctions on in the first place,"" Nephew said. ""Reasonable people may disagree whether we got enough for the sanctions relief, but it wasn't nothing."" ""There’s a long list (of things we got), such that even the Israeli intelligence community has concluded that, for the duration of the deal, Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon,"" said George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Under the deal, Iran agreed to lose 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium and give up 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, which are needed to enrich uranium. It also agreed to curb production of plutonium (the other element that can be used to build a bomb) and dismantle its one plutonium reactor. To make sure Iran holds up its end of the bargain, the deal also permitted international inspectors to ""implement continuous monitoring."" (What that means and whether it’s enough are up for debate.)  In other words, said Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Jim Walsh, we got Iran to nip its nuclear ambitions in the bud before the cash was released. Experts also pointed out that there’s also a host of diplomatic advantages gained from the deal, such as the goodwill of the five other countries involved in the deal and potentially more cooperation from Iran in the Middle East. For example, the deal has ""reduced the chances of a war between Iran and Israel,"" and Iran ""could eventually de-escalate tensions with Saudi Arabia and contribute to a political settlement of the crisis in Syria,"" said Iradian. ""In the big game, that counts for something,"" said Malloy. Our ruling Trump said under the Iran nuclear deal, ""we give them $150 billion, we get nothing."" Trump is referring to the amount of previously frozen Iranian assets the deal releases. To be clear, this is money that already belongs to Iran so we’re not ""giving"" them anything. The $150 billion is a high estimate, and most experts say the real figure is closer to $100 billion, while Iran is probably only able to access a fraction of that. In exchange for lifting the sanctions, the United States and its allies get to block Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in the near future. One can argue whether we got enough, but we didn’t get ""nothing.""   We rate Trump’s claim False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/17/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-we-are-not-giving-iran-150-billion/

Barack Obama, in Austin, says illegal immigration at 40-year low
","Barack Obama fired up supporters at a Democratic National Committee reception in Austin by insisting the country is ""pretty darn great"" toward the end of his eight years as president -- despite what Republicans say. According to a White House transcript of Obama’s March 11, 2015, remarks, Obama said to applause: ""You’ve got all these candidates on the other side tripping all over themselves to talk down the economy when it is the bright spot in the world economy. You’ve got folks talking about how weak America is when we're the most powerful nation on Earth."" Those two judgments, you might say, are not-fact-checkable opinions. But next Obama said: ""You’ve got these folks saying immigration is our biggest crisis when illegal immigration is lower than it’s been in 40 years."" Republicans including prospective wall-builders Donald Trump and Ted Cruz say illegal immigration adds up to a huge crisis. So, is Obama right that illegal immigration is at a 40-year low? Experts agree that some 11 million to 12 million U.S. residents lack legal permission to live here. In July 2015, when PolitiFact Florida looked into such estimates, Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said the total number of illegal immigrants had essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status. For this story, we took Obama as referring to the flow of immigrants, many of them across the Rio Grande. And while it’s impossible for anyone to know the exact level of illegal immigration--most people don’t want to get caught--there are ways to gauge changes. A 2014 fact check of a similar Obama claim identified U.S. Border Patrol border apprehension statistics as the best yet imperfect indicator of changes in illegal immigration. PolitiFact Florida found Half True this Obama claim: ""Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is the lowest it has been since the 1970s."" Obama failed to acknowledge both that in the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple border crossings and that the decline in border apprehensions began before his presidency. Generally, the flows of immigrants across the border correlates with economic conditions outside the president's full control. In his Austin remarks, Obama didn’t take credit for changes in illegal immigration. Regardless, he did retread his historical comparison. PolitiFact Florida, citing Border Patrol data, found that apprehensions of individuals illegally crossing the border annually decreased from 2007 through 2011, when there were 340,252 such apprehensions. Yet the agency also reported upticks in apprehensions in both 2012 and 2013, then the latest year of available data. The latest figures After Obama spoke, we spotted Border Patrol counts indicating that in fiscal 2015, which ran through September 2015, the agency reported 337,117 ""illegal alien apprehensions"" nationally including 331,333 in the Southwest Border sector, which runs east from San Diego through the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Another Border Patrol chart lists the agency’s total apprehensions nationally since 1925. According to the chart, its 2015 apprehensions were the fewest since the agency reported 302,517 apprehensions in 1971, 44 years earlier. And what about apprehensions near the southern border? A Border Patrol chart listing Southwest Border apprehensions since 1960 indicates apprehensions in that sector in 2015 were the least since 2011 when there were 327,577 apprehensions. You have to go back to 1972 to find fewer border-zone apprehensions--321,326, the chart says. Caveats Obama could have added caveats to his direct comparison of apprehensions 40 years apart. As PolitiFact Florida noted, there were far fewer Border Patrol agents in the 1970s and no barriers like the fencing ordered in place by Congress in recent years. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said the lack of barriers helped lead more people to enter or attempt to enter multiple times. The fine point is that apprehensions don’t break out entirely to individuals apprehended. In this vein, a 2011 Department of Homeland Security report cautioned against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. ""Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals,"" the report said. ""The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown."" A Georgetown University professor, Susan Martin, previously told PolitiFact too that with the addition of fencing and more agents in more recent years, people use smugglers to cross the border, which is more expensive and results in less traffic. In the 1990s, the U.S. strategy changed from trying to apprehend as many people as possible to trying to deter them from entering, Martin said. Federal officials used sensors, cameras and other technology to identify recidivists and get a better sense of the actual numbers. Administration response We asked the White House how Obama reached his conclusion. After we’d looked at government apprehension figures, we heard back from Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard who sent an email stressing Southwest sector apprehensions: ""Over the last 15 years, our Nation – across multiple administrations -- has invested a lot in border security, and this investment has yielded positive results. Apprehensions – which are an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally – are a fraction of what they used to be. ""In FY 2014, overall apprehensions increased, as we saw a spike in the number of families and unaccompanied children from Central America during the spring and summer of 2014. That year the overall number of apprehensions was 479,000. Across the government, we responded aggressively to this surge and the numbers fell sharply within a short period of time. ""In FY 2015, the number of those apprehended on the southwest border was 331,000 – with the exception of one year, this was the lowest number since 1972."" Our ruling Obama said illegal ""immigration is lower than it’s been in 40 years."" Worth noting: There’s no direct indicator of illegal immigration. Folks don’t report in. But the best-available metric, Border Patrol apprehensions, reached a 44-year national low in 2015. Still, apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border were even lower four years before. The previous Southwest sector low occurred in 1972. Significantly too, Obama didn’t claim credit for this change. We rate his Austin statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Light a match to Greg Abbott's ridiculous claim about 'rampant voter fraud'
","Greg Abbott took exception to President Barack Obama’s pokes about voter turnout and the governor followed up with a claim that, if supported, would arguably justify Texas Rangers manning polling stations. Obama, kicking off the South by Southwest Interactive conference March 11, 2016, told Evan Smith, CEO of the Texas Tribune, that the U.S. is the world’s only advanced democracy that ""makes it harder for people to vote,"" perhaps referring to voter registration hurdles or the mandate in dozens of states, including Texas, that voters present a photo ID before casting a ballot (he didn’t specify). Obama otherwise called it important for conference participants to study ways of redesigning ""our systems"" to step up voter turnout. Then the Democratic leader said, to laughter, ""the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate."" Abbott, a Republican, told reporters three days later: ""To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment."" We’re separately checking his turnout tout. Abbott, the former longtime state attorney general, went on: ""The fact is voter fraud is rampant--and in Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud."" Rampant fraud? We wondered, especially because we’ve looked into identified instances, finding them rare. Abbott offers no backup Abbott didn’t respond to our request for elaboration. So we don’t know the basis of his ""rampant"" claim. But generally, the prevalence of voter fraud has widely been doubted. In 2013, for instance, a chart provided by then-AG Abbott showed 18 convictions, no-contest pleas or guilty pleas on voter fraud charges from 2002 through 2012. That’s not a lot of fire but it was sufficient for us to find False a Democrat’s claim that studies had shown voter fraud to be non-existent in Texas. No surge, state records suggest After Abbott disagreed with Obama, we asked the Texas attorney general’s office for its latest breakdowns. Could there have been a fresh surge in fraud? Not according to the state documents, updated through February 2016. But we did learn of the 2015 case of Rosa Maria Ortega, charged with illegally voting in 2012 and 2014. A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Ortega for illegally voting in five Dallas County elections dating from 2005 through May 2014, according to a Nov. 9, 2015, Dallas Morning News account. The story said  she’d allegedly registered to vote by swearing incorrectly that she was a citizen and it quoted Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County criminal district attorney, saying: ""This is a big deal. People insist this kind of thing doesn’t happen, but it’s happening right here at home."" According to the state's updated information, about 20 voting-related referrals to local prosecutors have occurred since 2014 including a few ""illegal voting"" matters such as the Ortega case. A conservative compendium Nationally, the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2015 posted a state-by-state breakdown of voter and election fraud convictions. Its Texas section walks through convictions reached against a dozen Texas residents from 2006 through 2015 for schemes ranging from vote-buying to impersonation fraud at the polls to, in a 2012 instance, trying to register to vote despite lacking citizenship. In 2015, most recently, Francisco ""Frankie"" Garcia, Rebecca Gonzalez, Diana Balderas Castaneda, and Guadalupe Escamilla were convicted of trying to buy votes in a Donna school board race with cocaine, cash, beer and cigarettes, the foundation says, with all four pleading guilty. Also in 2015, Hazel Woodard of Fort Worth pleaded guilty to impersonation fraud; Woodard had been a candidate for Democratic precinct chair who had her teenage son vote for her husband at the polls out of concern the elder Woodard wouldn’t make it to the polls, the foundation says. The gig was up, according to the foundation, after the dad showed up to vote after all. More rare than a lightning strike? Other resources indicate there’s not much there there. In 2012, the News21 investigative project headquartered at Arizona State University’s journalism school compiled a database that showed 104 Texas cases of alleged election fraud among 2,068 nationwide since 2000. The News21 students, who published their results Aug. 12, 2012, gathered allegations through public information requests, news accounts and court records. According to the project’s website, the students included all cases ""that had reached some level of official action: That is, someone was charged, an investigation was opened, a specific accusation was made against a named person."" All told, News21 determined that 37 of the 104 Texas allegations were made against voters. Most of the cases were still pending at the time the students published their project in 2012, but 15 had resulted in a guilty plea or conviction, according to the database. A follow-up PolitiFact fact check, posted in August 2015, found that in Texas since 2002, there had been 85 election fraud prosecutions, not all resulting in convictions. Some perspective: From 2000 to 2014, per the Texas Secretary of State’s online record, about 72 million ballots were cast in Texas (and that’s not counting municipal and other local-only elections). In 2015, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the Texas prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law. ""There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots.  There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls,"" Levitt said. ""There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls."" Also in 2015, Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist professor who has testified as an expert on behalf of plaintiffs challenging the Texas voter ID law, pointed out 2012 court testimony by Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General’s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that two of the cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people. According to an August 2014 analysis posted by the Washington Post, Levitt found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 which the state’s Republican-brought voter ID law was crafted to prevent. Separately, Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014. Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes cast suggests the incidence of Texas voter fraud was about 1 in 18 million. Plaintiff’s lawyer: ‘Not rampant’ While we didn’t hear more from Abbott, we did reach Jennifer Clark, a voting-rights lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which represents the Texas State Conference of the NAACP and the state’s Mexican American Legislative Caucus in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the Texas voter ID law. By phone, Clark told us that ""under no definition of rampant is voter fraud rampant in Texas and the United States,"" though, she said, ""that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen."" Our ruling Abbott, defending the Texas mandate to present a photo ID at the polls, said: ""Voter fraud is rampant."" If Abbott has the goods on this, he’s keeping secrets. Best we can tell, in-person voter fraud--the kind targeted by the ID law--remains extremely rare, which makes this claim incorrect and ridiculous.

Urging vote on Merrick Garland, congresswoman says 6 justices have been OK'd in presidential years
","As President Barack Obama was nominating Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore argued that despite pushback from Republicans, there is precedent for a Supreme Court nomination to be approved during a presidential election year. The Milwaukee Democrat urged in a tweet on March 16, 2016 that the U.S. Senate give Garland a 'fair hearing' and a timely vote on his nomination. Her claim was made in an image she attached, which said: '6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912.' Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Democrats such as Moore and Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin contend that Obama should make an appointment, regardless of the fact the presidential election will be held in November 2016. Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, both of Wisconsin, argue the Senate should not confirm any nominee until after Obama is replaced in January 2017. So let’s see if Moore is right -- that six times since 1912, a justice nominated to the high court during a presidential election year has been confirmed by the Senate. The nominee According to The HIll: Garland, 63, is a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; he currently serves as chief judge, a position he’s held since February 2013. He was nominated to that court by Democratic President Bill Clinton. He is sometimes described as a moderate, though some conservatives label him anti-gun. In nominating Garland, Obama highlighted his work as a top Justice Department official in directing the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the 1994 Oklahoma City bombings. The president noted that Garland received past praise from John Roberts, the current chief justice, and GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. A partisan battle over the nomination is expected. Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, reiterated immediately after Obama’s announcement that Scalia’s seat should not be filled until a new president is elected. The history As to Moore’s claim, we covered much of this ground in a March 2016 fact check when Ryan said: ""There is a precedent"" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court ""in the middle of a presidential election."" We rated his statement False. We found that going back to 1912, five nominees who were nominated during a presidential election year were confirmed:   President Nominee Nomination Outcome Franklin Roosevelt (D) Frank Murphy, to replace Pierce Butler January 1940 Confirmed Herbert Hoover (R) Benjamin Cardozo, to replace Oliver Wendell Holmes February 1932 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) Louis Brandeis, to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar January 1916 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) John Clarke, to replace Charles Evans Hughes July 1916 Confirmed William Taft Mahlon Pitney, to replace John Marshall Harlan February 1912 Confirmed As Moore’s tweet notes, current Justice Anthony Kennedy also was confirmed in a presidential election year -- in February 1988. President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated Kennedy in November 1987, a year ahead of the election, to replace Louis Powell, who retired. It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. We’ll also note that in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a ""recess appointment"" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. Our rating Moore said ""six justices"" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been ""confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."" The number is correct.

Did Bernie Sanders make a rape comment similar to one by Wisconsin Justice Rebecca Bradley?
","In this item, we see if what conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote years ago about date rape is similar to something Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wrote years ago about rape fantasy. Yes, the 2016 campaign season has come to this. The claim we’re checking was made on March 11, 2016, at the end of a week in which Bradley was in the news for writings she did in college and for a case she handled as a private attorney. Bradley viewed the disclosures as aimed at boosting JoAnne Kloppenburg, a state appeals court judge and former Supreme Court candidate who is challenging Bradley in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election. The claim The claim we’re checking was made on ""Here and Now,"" a Wisconsin Public Television public affairs program. There were two Madison-based guests: Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, which revealed Bradley’s college writings; and political consultant Bill McCoshen, a former Republican state official who said Bradley’s commentaries were written too long ago to be relevant.   Ross said Bradley had written that ""women have a legitimate role in date rape. I mean, these are ugly things to say. They're out of touch ..."" McCoshen then interjected, saying: ""By the way, that last comment -- Bernie Sanders said something very similar when he was in college, and he just won the Michigan Democratic primary. So, let’s have the same standard for all candidates for public office."" Sanders’ comments about rape also were viewed by some as demeaning to women. It’s fair to say up front: Both Bradley’s and Sanders’ comments are open to interpretation. What Bradley wrote The 1992 student magazine column in question by Bradley (her maiden name was Grassl), who was 21 at the time, was an opinion piece against feminism, which she said ""has adopted an agenda that no longer articulates the feelings of the average American woman; instead, it advocates the extremist platform of the issues advanced by the political left."" The portion of the column highlighted by One Wisconsin Now referenced author Camille Paglia, a professor at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Bradley wrote that Paglia had been ""prevented from speaking at several colleges"" after Paglia ""legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape."" (In a column of her own published the previous year, Paglia had written: ""A girl who lets herself get dead drunk at a fraternity party is a fool. A girl who goes upstairs alone with a brother at a fraternity party is an idiot. Feminists call this perspective ‘blaming the victim.’ I call it common sense."") Of Bradley’s column, One Wisconsin Now said: ""It is abhorrent to blame the victim of a sexual assault, whatever the circumstances."" So, in an anti-feminism column, Bradley stated that in her opinion, another writer ""legitimately"" suggested that women play a role in date rape. What Sanders wrote Sanders’ comments about rape were also in written in a newspaper column and also drew criticism -- although he made them at age 30, eight years after he graduated from the University of Chicago. The column generated news in the presidential campaign after it was referenced in a May 2015 profile about Sanders by the magazine Mother Jones. Sanders’ column was published in the Vermont Freeman alternative newspaper in 1972, the year he began running for public office. The column was about gender stereotypes and changing gender roles. But it started with what Sanders -- when the issue came up in the presidential campaign -- described as ""bad fiction"": ""A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously …. Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like ‘Girl, 12, raped by 14 men’ sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?’’ New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, who McCoshen cited to back his claim, wrote in June 2015 that the column ""disgusted"" her, adding: ""Did Sanders confess that he finds real-life instances of sexual violence against children titillating?"" So, in a column about changing gender roles, Sanders made reference to a woman fantasizing about being gang raped. Our rating McCoshen says that when Sanders was in college, he said ""something very similar"" to what Bradley had written -- that ""women have a legitimate role in date rape."" Bradley was in college when, in an anti-feminism column, she wrote that a professor had ""legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape."" Sanders was eight years out of college when he wrote in a column about gender roles: ""A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.’’ So, both Sanders and Bradley wrote about rape in ways that were offensive to some women, although their columns were about different and broader topics.

Indeed, McCain was front and center in a well-publicized effort that killed an Air Force plan to lease 100 Boeing 767s and use them for refueling tankers. The plan eventually led to one of the more notable Washington scandals in years, resulting in prison terms for Mike Sears, a top Boeing official, and Darleen Druyun, the Air Force's No. 2 weapons buyer. Druyun admitted to giving Boeing preferential treatment and negotiating a $250,000-a-year job with the company while overseeing the deal.
 
It is well-documented in media and government reports that McCain was quick to identify the $23.5-billion deal as a bad one for taxpayers. He found it in December 2001, tucked into a little-noticed amendment to the 2002 defense budget.
 
Earlier that year, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Boeing had convinced the Air Force that it could start replacing its aging fleet of refueling tankers more quickly by leasing the aircraft rather than purchasing them. Air Force officials acknowledged that leasing would be more expensive, but they said the estimated extra cost — $150-million — was worth it.
 
There were two problems. One, the Air Force previously expressed no great urgency to replace its tanker fleet. Two, government investigations prompted by McCain's public outrage found that the Air Force vastly underestimated the extra cost of leasing. In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office put the extra cost at $1.3-billion to $2-billion, which is where McCain gets his number.
 
Other senators and watchdog groups took up the fight against the deal, but only after McCain and his staff revealed the makings of a scandal. A 2005 report by the Defense Department's Inspector General found that the Air Force circumvented normal procedures, conducted no analysis of the alternatives to leasing and collected no pricing data to justify the deal.
 
""If it wasn't for Sen. McCain, the scrutiny that occurred about this deal would never have happened,"" said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""It was probably the best example of oversight in the 108th Congress.""
 
Boeing paid a record $615-million to settle the civil and criminal allegations that arose in the scandal.
Since the tanker deal never went through, it's hard to say McCain saved taxpayers $2-billion. It might be more accurate to say he kept the government from entering into a deal that would have caused it to overspend by as much as $2-billion.
 
Despite that quibble, we find his statement True.

What about the daily English paper?
","Illegal immigration is one of the key targets of Congressman Tom Tancredo's campaign for president.
He wants to secure borders, reduce job prospects for border-crossers and end the ""bilingualization"" of America.
 
The latter goal is behind this statement on Fox News'

The Big Story,

where he makes the case that bilingual countries don't work. He cites the newspaper in Ottumwa, Iowa, as an example of things gone wrong.
 
Problem is, his example is wrong.
 
The regular newspaper for Ottumwa, Iowa, is the

Ottumwa Courier,

published six days a week in English, says

Ottumwa Courier

publisher Tom Hawley. Reported circulation is around 14,000.
 
Once a week, the

Courier

publishes a couple thousand Spanish editions along with the regular paper, Hawley says. The top story is printed in English and Spanish and the rest of the paper, which is a compilation of stories from the week, as well as Mexican soccer scores, is printed in Spanish. The Spanish papers are free and distributed across the city.
 
""It's really aimed at just helping (Hispanics) assimilate in the community,"" Hawley says. In Wapello County, where Ottumwa is the county seat, 7.4 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, according to a 2006 report from the State Data Center of Iowa.
 
So as far as the regular newspaper for Ottumwa, Iowa, being bilingual, Hawley said: ""That's not true.""
 
""He was a little confused,"" Hawley said of Tancredo. ""We had him in for the editorial board and explained it. He didn't really say much. ... He continued to say the same thing even after we explained it.""
 
We took this information to the Tancredo campaign, and press secretary Alan Moore disagreed with our findings.
 
""We stand by our statement,"" Moore said. He added, ""How do you define regular?""

It's a number that has been used in so many descriptions of suffering fans (""86 years of despair and disappointment"" . . . ""86-year drought"" . . .

Tuition bill wasn't that strict

Though the bill never made it out of the legislature, critics still question his support of it.
 
Huckabee described the law's requirements as stringent, applying only to students ""if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student, you'd completed the core curriculum, you were an exceptional student, and you also had to be drug- and alcohol-free — and the other provision, you had to be applying for citizenship.""
 
That's quite a number of restrictions. Did the bill outline all that?
 
No. The bill, proposed by Rep. Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, said that students had to have spent three years in Arkansas high schools and graduated, and they had to sign an affidavit saying they intended to pursue citizenship. Then they would be eligible for in-state tuition and a popular state scholarship program, the Academic Challenge Scholarship, just like their fellow classmates.
 
Huckabee conflates the proposed law with rules for the scholarship, which does have requirements for a core curriculum and drug-testing. Maybe Huckabee was confused on which programs he was talking about; he had mentioned the Academic Challenge Scholarship by name a few moments earlier.
 
But even granting a mix-up, Huckabee is plain wrong about the A-plus average — the scholarship requires a 3.0 out of 4.0. And there's no requirement for attending state schools since age 5 or 6.

Giuliani was welcoming to immigrants
","At the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg on Nov. 28, 2007, Mitt Romney tried to use Rudy Giuliani's words to make him look soft on illegal immigration.
 
The full quote from Romney: ""The mayor said -- and I quote almost verbatim -- which is 'if you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status - and that means you're here illegally - then we welcome you here. We want you here. We'll protect you here.'""
 
Romney is referring to a statement Giuliani made at a 1994 news conference: ""If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.""
 
Romney says that shows Giuliani is too welcoming to illegal immigrants and that his policies made New York a ""sanctuary city."" We've addressed the sanctuary city debate in

this item

this article,

so we'll simply focus here on the quote.
 
Indeed, Romney accurately summarized what Giuliani said. The quote came from a 1994 story in the

New York Times

that was headlined ""New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal.""
 
The article noted that Giuliani had given a ""spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City."" It quoted him saying, ""Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens. ""
 
Giuliani has not denied the comment but, in discussing immigration, has emphasized the need for more border security and tougher enforcement by the federal government.

Right facts, but they don't prove Romney weak on immigration
","The Giuliani campaign has responded several times to Romney's attacks on ""sanctuary cities"" by alleging that it was Romney who was weak on immigration because he did not speak up or take action against Massachusetts cities that had similar policies to New York's.
 
Giuliani is on solid ground with this attack. There's no evidence that Romney spoke up or took action against those cities.
 
But Romney's inaction does not necessarily confirm the Giuliani campaign's larger point –- that Romney was soft on illegal immigration.
 
Late in his term, Romney approved a plan to deputize state troopers to help enforce immigration laws, although the plan was not implemented because it was rescinded by his successor, Gov. Deval Patrick.
 
We expect to see this allegation repeated as the campaign goes on, though. The Giuliani campaign has apparently been searching for cities with policies of not turning in illegal immigrants; they recently upped their count of Massachusetts sanctuary cities from three to six.
 
We rate Giuliani's claim as Mostly True because, although the facts are right, there's not enough evidence to back up Giuliani's larger point that Romney was not aggressive on illegal immigration.

Hired help haunts Romney
","Fending off an attack by Romney that implied he was soft on illegal immigration, Rudy Giuliani asked the former Massachusetts governor: ""You did have illegal immigrants working at your mansion, didn't you?""
 
Romney's response was a flat, ""No, I did not.""
 
Oooops.
 
Romney did amend that statement with a vague ramble that homeowners shouldn't have to ask for the papers of anyone with a funny accent who is working on their house.
 
But he never corrected or clarified his initial response, which is barely true.
 
It's not as if Romney was caught off guard. Giuliani has leveled this charge before. It's good opposition research that comes courtesy of the

Boston Globe.

It broke the story about Romney's hired help late last year.
 
The newspaper sent a team of reporters to Guatemala after getting a tip that Romney had hired a landscaping company notorious for using illegal immigrants.
 
Reporters tracked down three former landscapers who claimed to have been in the United States illegally when they worked on Romney's lawn.
 
One of the workers, Rene Alvarez Rosales, said he worked for Romney eight years landscaping his lawn, occasionally getting a ""buenos dias"" from Romney himself. Others told the

Globe

of casual encounters with Romney over the years, during which he had never inquired about their status.
 
The

Globe

said Romney, for an entire decade, used a landscaping company that relied on illegal Guatemalan immigrants. Employees at the company, Community Lawn Service with a Heart, said its owner hadn't asked them to provide documents showing their immigration status.
 
The workers said they were paid $9 to $10 an hour, in cash, for working sometimes 11 hours a day.
 
When confronted by

Globe

reporters about the landscapers, Romney replied, ""Aw geez,"" and walked away. Several hours later, the

Globe

said, a spokesman issued a statement that the governor knows nothing about the immigration status of the landscaping workers, and that his dealings were with owner of the company, who is a legal immigrant from Colombia. The owner of the company told the

Globe

that Romney never asked him about the status of the workers.
 
A day after the

Globe

story, the

Los Angeles Times

followed up. This time, a Romney spokesman said ""Gov. Romney has no information or knowledge to corroborate the

Globe's

allegations. He hired a legitimate lawn service company and he knows the owner as a decent, hardworking person who is a legal resident."" Later, the standard reply from Romney's campaign didn't even contest that the landscaping company working on his lawn had hired illegal immigrants. Rather, the campaign draws a distinction between the company and its employees.
 
""Governor Romney hired a company, not the individuals who were not of legal status,"" Romney's spokesman, Kevin Madden, told the McClatchy-Tribune News Service in November. ""The owner of the company was a legal immigrant who claimed that workers were legal, though he did not request documentation.""
 
Considering Romney's forceful rhetoric on illegal immigrants, this explanation hasn't satisfied his opponents. Since April, the Democratic National Committee has hammered Romney with frequent citations of the

Globe

article.
 
Even nice guy Mike Huckabee has joined Giuliani, piling on after Romney criticized him over his plans to offer tuition breaks for children of illegal immigrants while serving as governor in Arkansas.
 
Huckabee, appearing on Fox News Channel, said, ""I guess Mitt Romney would rather keep people out of college so they can keep working on his lawn.""
 
Romney's ""I did not"" statement racks up a barely true on the Truth-O-Meter. We cut him a little slack for doing what most Americans would do and rely on the legal status of the company hired to do the job. But he could have scored even better if he had at least spoken about his own situation, rather than speaking in general terms about the pitfalls of finding good legal help.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Fred Thompson']","
He's right on
","At first, one might wonder: How can former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson claim ""a 100 percent pro-life voting record"" when the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest and most prominent antiabortion advocacy group, graded him at only 33 percent during his last term in Congress? And 77 percent the term before that? And 87 percent in the term before that?
 
The answer is in the details.
 
As a senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2002, Thompson's voting record indeed shows he compiled a perfect record on voting against abortion rights, cloning and certain research that many antiabortion advocates find objectionable.
 
He voted against a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion. Several times, he voted for a ban on late-term abortion, called partial-birth abortion, except when the life of the woman -- not her health - is at stake. He supported a ban on abortions in U.S. military hospitals and clinics, voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide, and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion.
 
So what's with the middling marks from the National Right to Life Committee's grade, then? The Washington-based group, which boasts 3,000 chapters in all 50 states, ranks members of Congress each year on their votes.
 
But Thompson was docked not for his votes on so-called ""life issues;"" instead, he lost points for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that sought to limit the contributions or advertising of outside interest groups. Many advocacy organizations opposed these reforms because they feared they'd lose influence in Congress.
 
In 1995, he also supported a welfare reform bill the group opposed, said David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life.
 
But on matters dearest to their members' hearts, Thompson is right on, O'Steen said. He also voted with the group against cloning and fetal tissue research, and for limits on how federal funding could be used for family planning activities abroad, his voting record shows.
 
In fact, the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed him for president.
 
""It's very fair for him to say that on every bill that came forward, he cast a pro-life vote,"" O'Steen said. ""I think he's fairly characterizing this. He's got a very pro-life record, and that was a big part of our endorsement –- it's not just talking the talk, but walking the walk. He was there, and he wasn't one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be. He was solid.""
 
The ad, which aired first in Iowa, then nationally on Fox News, is designed to help Thompson set himself apart from his chief Republican rivals, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in the race for the GOP nomination. Romney says he now opposes abortion; when he ran for governor, he said he was in favor of abortion rights. Giuliani publicly supports abortion rights.
 
By contrast, Thompson's commitment in public life to the policies espoused by antiabortion groups has never wavered. We find his claim True.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Mike Huckabee']","
The facts behind the numbers
","Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister and the former governor of Arkansas, has been trying to win over the same social and religious conservatives that Thompson is wooing, and abortion is a big issue for many of them.
 
Huckabee's claim here is technically true: As a U.S. senator from Tennessee from 1994 to 2002, Thompson never earned a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest and most politically powerful antiabortion group.
 
The group grades each member of Congress on their votes on its key issues, and Thompson's grades, at times, appeared downright dismal: During the last session he served in Congress, 2000 to 2002, he earned a grade of just 33 percent from Right to Life.
 
In 2000, the group gave him a 77. In 1998, his grade was 87. In 1996, he scored 86 percent.
But Thompson wasn't losing points for his position on so-called life issues. Rather, he was penalized mainly for supporting a series of campaign finance reform bills that limited how much outside interest groups could give to political parties, and when they could advertise during election campaigns. Many advocacy groups, including National Right to Life, opposed these bills on grounds that they would thwart their influence on Capitol Hill.
 
On issues dearest to the antiabortion movement -- abortion rights, fetal tissue research, cloning, euthanasia and the like -- Thompson was solidly with them. In fact, his staunch opposition to those practices helped earn him the endorsement this month from the National Right to Life Committee, which boasts 3,000 chapters in 50 states.
 
His record includes a vote against a resolution supporting Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that requires all states to permit abortion, and he consistently voted for a ban on late-term abortion, called partial-birth abortion, except when the life of the mother -- not her health - is at stake. He voted to ban abortions in U.S. military hospitals and clinics, voted to block federal funding for assisted suicide, and voted to make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion.
 
""He's got a very pro-life record, and that was a big part of our endorsement – it's not just talking the talk, but walking the walk,"" David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life, said of Thompson recently. ""He was there, and he wasn't one of the members that vacillated and you wondered where he was going to be. He was solid.""
 
As for Huckabee's claim that Thompson doesn't support a constitutional amendment banning abortion nationwide, that's true. Thompson has consistently opposed such an amendment. He has said he would like the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, but that each state should then be able to decide whether to allow abortion.
 
Consider this exchange on the Nov. 4 edition of NBC's Meet the Press with Tim Russert:
 
Thompson: I think people ought to be free at state and local levels to make decisions that even Fred Thompson disagrees with. That's what freedom is all about. And I think the diversity we have among the states, the system of federalism we have where power is divided between the state and the federal government is, is, is—serves us very, very well. I think that's true of abortion. I think Roe v. Wade hopefully one day will be overturned, and we can go back to the pre-Roe v. Wade days. But...
 
Russert: Each state would make their own abortion laws?
 
Thompson: Yeah. But ... to have an amendment compelling — going back even further than pre-Roe v. Wade, to have a constitutional amendment to do that, I do not think would be the way to go.
 
We find Huckabee's claim about Thompson's antiabortion bona fides to be Half-True. But Huckabee should be careful about casting stones. Last year, citing the 10th Amendment, Huckabee told Right Wing News that abortion should be left to the states.

Indeed, abortions are covered
","Fred Thompson's campaign is trying to take the much-touted health insurance program that Mitt Romney helped create as governor of Massachusetts and turn it into a liability with conservative Republican voters who dominate the party's primary elections.
 
The Thompson campaign, which has been playing up the former U.S. senator's antiabortion stances, sent out this e-mail in November 2007:
 
""So what sort of services does Romney's health care plan provide? Per the state Web site: $50 co-pay for abortions.
 
""While court mandate requires Massachusetts to cover 'medically necessary' abortions in state-subsidized health plans, Mitt Romney's plan covers ALL abortions -- no restrictions.""
 
And it's true.
 
One of the crowning moments of Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts was the creation of Commonwealth Care, a state-run, state-subsidized health insurance program for people making up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Although private insurers provide the coverage, the state helps pay the bills and determines what services must be covered.
 
That list includes abortion. And the co-pay is indeed $50.
 
Romney has recently sought to distance himself from some details of the plan, but he has touted it in debates and interviews as a model for the nation.
 
""I love it. It's a fabulous program,"" Romney said during a May 3, 2007, Republican debate in Simi Valley, Calif. ""Now I know there's some people who wonder about it. Sen. Kennedy at the signing of the bill, we were all there together, he said, 'You know, if you've got Mitt Romney and Ted Kennedy agreeing to the same bill, that means one thing -- one of us didn't read it.'
 
""But I helped write it. And I knew it well. ...The market can work to solve our health care needs, and 27 other states are working on health care programs now. It's a great program, a great opportunity for the entire country.""
 
Romney's campaign counters that the decision about what services to cover was ultimately left up to the independent Commonwealth Care Authority.
 
But Romney was well-represented: Of the six policy-making members of the authority's 10-member board, half are appointed by the governor, and half by the state attorney general. Half of the ex-officio members also are appointed by the governor, including the chairman -- the governor's secretary of administration and finance -- and the state insurance commission.
 
Although Romney shares responsiblity with the state legislature and the program's board, Commonwealth Care was his pet project, and he takes credit for it. We find Thompson's claims true.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Fred Thompson']","
Facts don't always tell the truth
","Although the statement is technically correct, the facts clearly don't support the point that former Sen. Fred Thompson is trying to make about his rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.
 
 
It is true the Massachusetts state law passed under Romney's leadership gave the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts a seat on an advisory board for MassHealth, the state's Medicaid health insurance program for the poor.
 
 
But the board advises MassHealth on service costs and reimbursement rates, not policy, and the board's members represent the state's major providers of medical care, including the extended care industry, physicians, hospitals and community health centers, as well Planned Parenthood.
 
 
Planned Parenthood is Massachusetts' largest provider of sexual and reproductive health services, with 55,000 patient visits last year at four clinics statewide, the group says. It does perform abortions, but Angus McQuilken, vice president of public affairs, says gynecological exams, birth control, treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy testing and the like make up the bulk of its services for MassHealth patients.
 
 
MassHealth only pays for abortions deemed ""medically necessary,"" or in the case of rape or incest.
 
 
Thompson's campaign further charges that although Planned Parenthood got a seat on the board, antiabortion groups did not. That's true, too. But by the nature of the advisory board, there would be no reason for such groups to get a seat: Although some antiabortion groups provide pregnancy counseling and adoption services, they are not major providers of health care.

RNC makes $80-billion baby bond boo-boo

Clinton, at one point in 2007, talked about offering every newborn child born a $5,000 bond as part of an effort to encourage savings for such things as college tuition. The estimated cost would be $80-billion over four years. The RNC included the proposal in its Spend-O-Meter.

RNC number-crunchers crunch Hillary accurately
","Attempting to portray Hillary Clinton as a big spender, the Republican National Committee recently unveiled a ""Spend-O-Meter"" to tally up Clinton's policy proposals. ""If Sen. Hillary Clinton could enact all of her campaign proposals, taxpayers would be faced with financing more than $777.6-billion in new spending over one White House term,"" the RNC says on its Web site, where the meter is prominently featured.
 
Putting the RNC's Spend-O-Meter to the Truth-O-Meter test, we find the Republicans are doing a reasonably good job of accounting for Clinton's spending proposals. In 19 out of 24 examples cited by the RNC, the Spend-O-Meter correctly explained Clinton's proposals.
 
However, in one case, the RNC includes $80-billion baby bond proposal that Clinton quickly dropped after talking about it. Since Clinton never formally proposed the idea, you can subtract $80-billion from the $777.6-billion.
 
We realize the RNC had to make some assumptions to keep the arithmetic simple. For instance, their calculations assume that each program becomes law at the very start of Clinton's first term, allowing the Spend-O-Meter to add things up over four full years. Of course, it can't really happen that way, but for purposes of keeping tabs on the cost of Clinton's proposals it's within reason.
It's also true that the RNC doesn't note that some of Clinton's proposals, already in legislation in Congress, have drawn the support of some Republicans.

Clinton is right in her broader point that Obama's plan does not include a mandate for people to have health insurance, as hers does. He believes his plan would lower health care costs enough that most of the 47 million Americans without coverage would be able to find a plan they could afford.
 
But with no mandate, some people would inevitably go without coverage. But how many? Clinton says 15 million; health care experts it's impossible to come up with a reliable number without more details on Obama's plan.
 
Clinton's 15 million number could be a reasonable estimate -- it's 30 percent of those currently without insurance -- but it's at best a guess. For that we reason, we rate her claim half true.

Overall violence declined under Romney
","After Rudy Giuliani attacked Mitt Romney for rising crime rates in Massachusetts, Romney shot back: ""The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent. So he's wrong again on the facts.""
 
Take apart the FBI crime figures, and you'll see that Romney is right. But Giuliani is also right on a couple of points, particularly on rising murder and robberies. Here's how the numbers break down:
 
Romney became governor in January 2003 and left office in January 2007. Comparing FBI crime statistics in Massachusetts for 2002 and 2006, we can calculate how crime rates changed during the Romney administration.
 
To count violent crime, the FBI includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2002, that number was 31,137 in Massachusetts. In 2006, it was 28,775. That means violent crime declined 7.6 percent, just like Romney claims.
 
But let's take a closer look at murders and robberies.
 
Murders went up from 173 in 2002 to 186 in 2006, an increase of 7.5 percent. The murder rate — the number of people murdered per 100,000 people — moved up from 2.7 to 2.9.
 
Robberies increased more than murders. Robberies in Massachusetts increased from 7,169 to 8,047, an increase of 12.2 percent. The robbery rate increased from 111.5 to 125.
 
So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up? The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14.6 percent.
 
Given these numbers, Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up, but wrong when he says violent crime went up. Romney is correct when he says violent crime in Massachusetts declined, so we rate his claim True.
