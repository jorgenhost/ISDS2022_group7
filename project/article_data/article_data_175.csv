Dewhurst decreased, then increased Texas Senate Democrats chairing committees
","Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst talked up his toughness on Democrats during a Republican lieutenant governor candidate forum in Houston. Dewhurst, who presides over the 31-member Texas Senate, zeroed in on the topic in response to a question about what each candidate might have done differently to speed along anti-abortion legislation in 2013. Senate Democrats, helped by hollering spectators, kept the Republican-sought restrictions from surviving in one summer special session, though they subsequently passed into law. Dewhurst, speaking after another candidate pooh-poohed the idea of not appointing Democrats as chairs of Senate committees, said: ""Now, I’ve been reducing the number of Democratic chairs since I came in."" As recorded by David Jennings of the Republican-oriented Big Jolly Politics blog, Dewhurst continued: ""You know how many committees we have? 17. You know how many Democratic chairs we have? Five. OK? So, I’ve been reducing them — and not one of them is one of the critical committees."" He said, too, that ""at the end of the day,"" senators turn to him when it comes to raising the Senate votes needed to advance legislation. Besides, he said, he ultimately succeeded in breaking the filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis. We’re not getting into which committees are critical; that’s debatable. But we wondered if it’s correct that Dewhurst has been whittling Democratic committee chairs in the GOP-majority Senate since he assumed his gavel-wielding post in 2003. One of the lieutenant governor’s roles is to appoint committee rosters. That includes deciding which committees to continue or create and whom to appoint to each panel’s coveted chair and vice chair slots. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us a document indicating that Dewhurst appointed seven Democratic committee chairs in 2003 and one less in 2013. Considine said he did not have information on changes in the intervening years. To reach a comprehensive count, we scrolled through information posted online on a searchable web page overseen by the Texas Legislative Council. That information indicates that in 2001, before Dewhurst took his helm, Democrats held seven of 15 Senate committee chairmanships, or 47 percent. In 2003, according to the information, Dewhurst appointed Democrats to six of 15 committee chairmanships, or 40 percent. (Unlike Dewhurst’s campaign, we did not consider chairmanships of limited-life select committees.) And according to the same source, Dewhurst named Democrats to six of 18 committee chairmanships, or 33 percent, in 2013. And what precisely happened in the years between? Information on the council’s site indicates that Democrats were appointed to five of 15 committee chairmanships in 2005 and 2007, or 33 percent. Dewhurst named Democrats to six of 18 committee chairmanships, again 33 percent, in 2009, 2011 and 2013. On Dewhurst's watch, the number of Republican chairs has escalated, going from nine in 2003 to 12 since 2009. Our ruling Dewhurst said he has been reducing the number of Democratic Senate committee chairs since becoming lieutenant governor. He cut the number of Democratic chairs, from seven to six, in his first year in the leadership office. Then in 2005, he cut the number from six to five, a total that held in 2007. But as in 2003, Dewhurst named six Democratic chairs each regular legislative session from 2009 through 2013. Upshot: Dewhurst twice reduced the number of Democratic chairs, getting to five, but he also has bestowed chairmanships on six Senate Democrats for nearly half a decade. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth but ignores critical facts, as Mostly False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

GOP state leaders funding tech schools at 1989 levels, Democratic Party says
","Soon after students slung backpacks over their shoulders for the start of a new school year, the Wisconsin Democratic Party threw the book at Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature for an ""ideological attack on higher education."" An article posted Sept. 18, 2013 on the party’s website made a number of charges, including one about the Wisconsin Technical College System. The 2013-’15 state budget, the party declared, ""left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels."" The 1989 reference would mean state funding for tech schools is the same as it was when the parents of today’s students were on campus. It was a repeat of a claim the party had made before, and a statistic we alluded to in an item in 2012. So, let’s see if the folks on the left are right about the folks on the right. Overall tech school funding The state’s 16 technical colleges serve some 360,000 Wisconsinites per year -- those taking a class here and there as well as those seeking a two-year diploma or other credential. Based on a 2007 study by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, the system has an economic impact of about $7 billion per year. Before we dig into the fact check, it’s important to know that state money makes up a relatively small portion of the tech schools’ overall funding. The technical colleges get their money primarily from three sources, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In 2011-’12, the latest figures available, those three sources accounted for $1.15 billion -- two-thirds ($771.3 million) from property taxes, one-fourth ($279 million) from tuition and fees, and 9 percent ($101.2 million) from the state. Of the $101 million in state money, $83.5 million was unrestricted -- and is known as general state aid -- while the rest was earmarked for certain purposes. So, any reduction in state aid wouldn’t affect the lion’s share of the tech schools’ overall funding. Nevertheless, the claim we’re testing focuses on the state budget and how much of it goes to tech schools. State funding of tech schools To back its claim, the Democratic Party cited a state budget document and legislative testimony that show general state aid -- the unrestricted funds -- was $85 million for the 1988-’89 budget year. Since that time, general state aid to the tech schools has trended upward. It reached $119 million in 2010-’11, the final budget year before Walker took office. But Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, imposed a 30 percent cut -- nearly $72 million over two years -- in general state aid to the tech schools. The tech schools cite a Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimate, however, that they were able to recoup at least 70 percent of the cut. They did so primarily by taking advantage of Walker’s 2011 collective bargaining law and requiring employees to pay more toward their health care and pensions. The Democrats’ claim, however, referred to Walker’s second state budget, for 2013-’15. That budget keeps general state aid to the tech schools at $83.5 million for the first year, but raises it to $88.5 million the second year. So, the current budget provides an average of $86 million per year in general state aid to the technical colleges -- virtually the same as the $85 million in 1989. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson took issue with the measure singled out by the Democrats, saying all state aid -- not just the unrestricted general aid portion -- should be considered. Total state aid is $108 million in the first year of the current budget and $113 million in the second, exceeding total state aid of $93.5 million in 1989. Budget experts we spoke to said either measure -- total state aid cited by Walker’s office or the general aid portion cited by the Democrats -- is valid. Of course, neither takes inflation into account. Had general state aid kept pace with inflation over the years, the $85 million allocated in 1989 would have been $160 million in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index calculator. Our rating The Wisconsin Democratic Party said the current, 2013-’15 state budget adopted by Walker and Republican lawmakers ""left our technical colleges funded at 1989 levels."" That’s correct for the unrestricted general aid portion of state funding, which is the part the Republicans dramatically cut in the previous state budget. However, total state aid in the current budget is higher than it was in 1989. We rate the statement Half True.

Charlie Crist: Florida teachers at risk of having pay affected by test scores of students they do not teach
","Pay raises for new teachers in Florida will be partially tied to how their students perform in the classroom, but school districts are struggling to find ways to measure how a teacher affects a student’s score on a test. Using reading and math scores from the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test may make sense for reading and math teachers, but what about educators who teach electives, language and arts courses? Those subjects do not come with a standardized test. It’s a fundamental flaw in the merit-pay system, one that prompted Gov. Charlie Crist to veto the Republican-led proposal in 2010. Crist’s successor and potential 2014 opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, signed a similar bill into law in 2011. ""The results were, unfortunately, as expected,"" Crist wrote in a Sept. 22 column in the Tampa Bay Times. ""Today many Florida teachers are at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas."" We decided to see if Crist is right: Are Florida teachers ""at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas""? Under the law, teachers are evaluated based on a scoring system with categories of highly effective, effective, needs improvement and unsatisfactory. (Performance-based evaluations started in the 2011-12 school year but will not be tied to salary increases and job status until the 2014-15 school year, at least statewide.) How districts measure a teacher’s influence is basically up to them. About half of the teacher’s grade is based on student performance. For teachers who teach reading and math in grades tested by the FCAT, the assessment data was pertinent. But for the thousands of teachers who teach other subjects, such as art, music or social studies, or those grades that are not measured by FCAT, districts had to think of another way to gauge their performance. Most went with schoolwide FCAT scores, which measure reading (grades 3-10), math (grades 3-8) and science (grades 5 and 8). The decision was controversial enough that seven teachers, with the backing of the Florida Education Association, sued the state’s education commissioner and board. One plaintiff, Hernando County teacher Bethann Brooks, was evaluated based on reading test scores of freshmen and sophomores, but Brooks taught juniors and seniors health science. In the new system, Brooks’ performance fell from ""highly effective"" to ""effective."" As evidence to back up his claim, Crist sent us an April 2013 Washington Post blog post highlighting the lawsuit. But that’s not the latest news on this issue. Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, tried to improve the 2011 law by inserting language in a 2013 bill that said teachers had to be evaluated on the performance their students. But the change was hardly a magic wand. It told districts what not to do, but not how to avoid it. Take Pinellas County, where the school board tried to comply with the new state law by passing a plan that greatly reduced the number of teachers evaluated based on students they did not teach. However, many teachers will continue being evaluated by student scores in subjects they do not teach. Schoolwide reading and math FCAT scores will continue to be used in evaluations for teachers in non-core subjects, such as art, music and physical education, as well as middle and high school science teachers, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hillsborough County schools were in a better position than most, because the system developed end-of-course exams for all academic subjects including electives a few years ago because of a grant, said district spokesman Stephen Hegarty. In other words, much is still being worked out. Thanks to a $20 million federal grant, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Duval and Polk counties are developing assessments for ""hard-to-measure"" subjects that do not have statewide assessments, including physical education, performing arts, visual arts, world languages, and career and technical education. The result will be a bank of test questions for districts to use for those subjects. The goal is to have an assessment for every subject, said Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, but it’s not ready yet. Education groups will continue to push for changes in the evaluation formula so it does not rely so much on test scores in the 2014 legislative session, said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association. ""The bottom line is the testing and assessments of teachers have not been fleshed out to the point where everyone in the education community is comfortable with it,"" he said. Our ruling Crist is echoing a legitimate concern of teachers, administrators, lawmakers and unions of the performance pay law. Crist neglects to mention the Legislature tried to address this in a new law that says teachers can only be evaluated by students in their classrooms. Until more assessments are prepared for more subjects, some teachers, particularly in non-core classes or in grades without assessments, will continue to be evaluated not based on the subjects they teach but on overall student scores in FCAT reading and math. Crist’s point is largely accurate given the first round of evaluations, but a new law aims to reduce the problem.

Carol Shea-Porter says repealing Obamacare “would increase the budget deficit”
","Since the health care law proposed by President Barack Obama passed in 2010, Republicans have made it a top priority to dismantle the program. The latest attempt involves a House spending bill, which would keep the federal government running through mid-December, but also strip all funding for the Affordable Care Act. Obama has already threatened to veto the bill, but as the proposal was being debated, U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, was quick to denounce it. When it came up for a vote on Sept. 20, 2013, Shea-Porter joined nearly every other member of her party in voting against the resolution, which passed the House, 230-189. In a written statement, Shea-Porter called the resolution (H.J.Res.59) an ""irresponsible political ploy,"" and said repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit. She cited information from the Congressional Budget Office, which provides nonpartisan analysis of the federal budget and the economy to Congress. ""I agree with most Americans that we should keep the government open, but Speaker Boehner and House Republicans are threatening to shut it down unless Congress defunds the Affordable Care Act, a law that was passed by Congress, signed by the President, and upheld by the Supreme Court,"" Shea-Porter said in the statement. In addition to risking a government shutdown, she added, ""according to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit."" We wondered if her claim was true, so we checked the CBO’s published research. We found that the CBO has been asked to estimate the cost of repealing Obamacare twice previously. First, in July 2012, CBO projected that repealing the new health reform law would increase the deficit by an estimated $109 billion over a decade. CBO was asked to study repealing Obamacare a second time in May 2013. The office determined it didn't have enough time to do a full study, and referred Congress to its earlier projections from 2012. A closer look at the CBO’s research shows that repealing Obamacare would increase the deficit because the net savings from eliminating new insurance mandates would be offset by spending increases and revenue reductions. Here’s a broad look at the CBO’s calculations: • The health care law expands health insurance coverage, but not without increasing some costs for the federal government. The law provides subsidies for some people who buy health insurance through new exchanges. It also increases spending on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and establishes tax credits for certain small employers. Repealing the new coverage provisions would yield a net savings of $1,171 billion over 10 years. • The new health care law would also bring in new revenue, mostly by increasing a payroll tax for Medicare hospital insurance and extending it to net investment income for high-income taxpayers. The law also imposes new excise taxes on some equipment manufacturers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over 10 years. • CBO has also calculated that the Affordable Care Act would produce major savings in health care costs, primarily through reductions in Medicare spending. Repealing those efforts would increase direct spending by an estimated $711 billion over 10 years. We should note a few caveats, however. First, the CBO acknowledges those projections are only estimates, since it’s still highly uncertain what the effects of the Affordable Care Act will be. Second, the CBO analysis referenced above was based on a 2012 proposal to repeal Obamacare. In her press release, Shea-Porter blurs the difference between defunding and repealing Obamacare -- two approaches that sound similar but actually are somewhat different. Unlike a repeal of the law -- that is, completely striking it from existence -- defunding it would leave all of the provisions in place. Because defunding is a more complicated proposal to analyze than a simple repeal, the CBO did not do a full analysis of the defunding proposal. So the most recent numerical CBO estimate of the impact on the budget deficit is one based on a prior proposal to repeal the law, not the more recent proposal to defund it. Our ruling Shea-Porter said that, ""according to the Congressional Budget Office, repealing Obamacare would increase the budget deficit."" She phrased her press release carefully -- she said ""repealing"" the law would increase the deficit. The CBO did indeed make that projection more than a year ago. However, it’s worth noting that her release targeted a different legislative approach -- defunding Obamacare, rather than repealing it -- and that’s an approach about which the CBO has not yet passed judgment. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/25/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-says-repealing-obamacare-would-i/

Rick Scott says Floridians pay far more into flood insurance than they get back in claims
","Some Floridians are about to face a wallop of an increase on flood insurance -- and that’s something Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is campaigning for re-election, hopes to stop. Scott wrote a letter to Florida’s U.S. senators, Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson, urging Congress to delay a planned rate hike on some flood insurance policies and to continue federal subsidies. For that to happen, the Senate needs to vote on a proposal that the House approved in June. Nelson has indicated he supports a delay, while Rubio’s position has been less clear. The Tampa Bay Times reported in September that Rubio ""will continue to work with colleagues on solutions to make the flood program sustainable 'without excessively burdening Florida's families,' spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said."" Florida has already gotten the short end of the stick on flood insurance, says Scott. ""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements,"" Scott wrote in a Sept. 17 letter. We wanted to research Scott’s claim about how much Floridians have paid into the program and how much we have received in claims. Flood insurance reform The National Flood Insurance Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, started in 1968. More than 5 million property owners nationwide hold flood insurance, and about 20 percent are subsidized. After the 2005 storm season -- which included Hurricane Katrina -- the program became indebted to the U.S. Treasury. As of May 2013, it owed about $24 billion. (A recent General Accounting Office report gives a full dissection of the program’s shortcomings.) In an effort to avoid insolvency, lawmakers passed the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act in 2012. The law requires the program to raise rates about 25 percent a year for certain properties until they reflect true flood risk. The increases apply to businesses, second homes and homes that have had severe or repetitive losses -- that’s about 50,000 policy holders in Florida. For policy holders who own just one home, the increases won’t kick in until they sell their home, their policy lapses or they have severe or repetitive losses. The increases don’t apply to about 115,000 subsidized condos or multifamily homes or about 1.8 million policies that aren’t subsidized in Florida. According to a FEMA map, many of Florida’s affected homeowners are in coastal Miami-Dade, Pinellas and Lee counties. For those facing the flood insurance hike, it’s a double whammy on top of increases for Citizens hurricane insurance. Florida’s premiums vs. claims The state’s Office of Insurance Regulation directed us to an issue brief written by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes. (Scott’s office directed us to a 2013 Tampa Bay Times article that cited the Wharton Center’s research.) The 2010 study showed that in some states policyholders paid far more in premiums than they collected in claims between 1978 and 2008 -- a 30-year stretch. (That's five years fewer than Scott claimed, but as we’ll see, the numbers likely hold true through 2013, for a total of 35 years.) In Florida, ""policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements,"" according to the study. Florida wasn’t alone in paying more into the program than receiving back in claims. Thirteen states had an even higher ratio, and Colorado was the highest. (Florida was tied for 14th with Montana.) ""The situation is reversed in Texas, where flood insurance policyholders paid $4.5 billion in premiums but collected a larger $6.7 billion in claims,"" the study states. The study was based on data from the flood insurance program, so we went directly to the program and FEMA to check the data ourselves. We found fairly similar numbers to the Wharton study. The author of the Wharton study, Erwann Michel-Kerjan, told PolitiFact that his figure of $4.5 billion for claims in Florida through 2008 was higher than FEMA’s of $3.7 billion through mid 2013 because he accounted for inflation. Also, it’s worth noting that many of our big storms were in 2005-06, not in more recent years. So the trend in payments from 1978 to 2008 likely continues today. We asked Michel-Kerjan if we should expect Floridians to continue paying more in premiums than they receive in reimbursements. ""Keep in mind though that if there is a severe hurricane hitting the state and massive storm surge, the situation could well reverse: Florida might become a net beneficiary of the program, rather than being a net contributor,"" he said. ""This is what happened to Louisiana with Katrina in 2005."" The Tampa Bay Times explained: ""Like any other insurance, flood premiums don't reflect real-life events; they reflect risk. With its 1,200 miles of coastline, Florida is still considered more at risk than any other state. Just one major, slow moving hurricane that hits a populated part of Florida's coast could dramatically increase the state's flood claims. And private insurers have been unwilling to provide flood coverage."" Our ruling Scott said ""Over the past 35 years, Florida families have paid into the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) over $16 billion, four times more than the amount they have received in claim reimbursements."" A study from the Wharton Center concluded that Florida’s ""policyholders paid $16.1 billion in premiums but collected only $4.5 billion in claims reimbursements: that is, premiums paid over time were about 3.6 times the insurance reimbursements."" That statistic from the study covered 1978-2008, but it’s likely the trend has continued through 2012. The only key point that Scott omits is that this imbalance is common: Lots of states pay more in premiums than they receive in claims. A major storm could change that dynamic, and the purpose of insurance is to protect against such an event.

Tom Graves says Obama has changed the Affordable Care Act 19 times
","The Republican effort to defund Obamacare threatens a government shutdown at the end of the month. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., is one lawmaker who believes the dangers of the health care law justify extreme measures. Over the summer, Graves called the Affordable Care Act ""destructive"" and a ""job killer."" ""We need to make every effort to ensure Obamacare is never implemented,"" he said. Graves said President Barack Obama’s actions highlight the law’s terminal flaws. ""Something very important has happened since the president did win the election,"" Graves said on ABC’s This Week. ""He himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law. So if it's so good for America, then why he is delaying it for his friends in big business?"" We wondered if in fact, Obama has made that many changes in the law. Graves’ office pointed us to a letter from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress. The Congressional Research Service review listed 19 times the Affordable Care Act changed since it was passed in 2010. The report counted 14 public laws and five administrative actions that made a variety of modifications to the law. For the record, we note that a dozen of those adjustments took place before the 2012 election, and not after as Graves said. The timing seems less important than the substance of what was done. Changes to the Affordable Care Act Some items on the list qualify as significant in the eyes of the health policy experts we contacted. One of the country’s leading authorities on health care law, Timothy Jost at the Washington and Lee School of Law, pointed to three: A one-year delay in requiring firms with over 50 workers to provide insurance Scrapping a long-term care insurance program (for nursing home care, for example) called the CLASS Act Lifting the requirement on businesses to file a form called a 1099 for a variety of business expenses The administration acted on its own to delay the employer mandate, explaining that the systems were not in place to implement it. The other two changes came through votes in Congress. ""Congress couldn’t find a way to make the CLASS Act actuarially sound,"" Jost said, ""so they repealed it and put the money elsewhere."" As for the business reporting rule, ""businesses said this was a huge burden and Congress responded,"" Jost said. ""There was strong bipartisan support, and you could find the votes to make those sorts of changes."" In addition to those three, a program to create consumer health insurance cooperatives was retained but lost $2.2 billion in funding. Most of the items on the Congressional Research Service list, however, are less dramatic. Several clarified that certain government health insurance programs would count as coverage under the individual mandate. This included Tricare, which covers the military, and insurance through Veterans Affairs. Other adjustments extended tax breaks, such as a tax credit for families that adopt a child. There were changes in the Medicaid federal matching formula (to keep money flowing to Louisiana after Katrina), and a tweak to the calculation of income that determines the level of premium subsidies in the insurance exchanges. Such changes are common in Congress, according to our experts. ""Legislators aren't perfect,"" said Jost. ""They don't get everything right the first time. That’s the nature of the legislative process."" It is also clear that Obama did not drive the majority of the changes. They emerged as Congress worked on various elements of a multi-faceted law. Still, Obama signed off on those changes as part of larger pieces of legislation. We’ve been here before Graves’ comments suggest that so many changes to the health care law means it's fundamentally flawed. Actually, major pieces of legislation rarely remain the same as the day the president signs them into law. The Medicare prescription drug benefit, passed under President George W. Bush, was changed several times after its initial passage. Both that law and the recent health care law lay a government program on top of a complex private market system, said Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University. ""Patches on a patchwork mean making a coherent quilt very difficult,"" Marmor said. Even though the country had about two years to get ready for the Medicare drug program, about the same as with Obamacare, some pieces were not in place when the program launched, said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University. ""States were worried that bunches of people would show up on Jan. 1, 2005, and not be able to get their prescription drugs,"" Hoadley said. ""So some of them started picking up the tab."" Later, Hoadley said, the Bush administration pulled money from another fund to reimburse the states. The law required insurance plans to set up systems to keep an eye on people who took many different medications. The goal was to make sure the drugs were compatible. The purpose was sensible but as of 2005, the technology wasn’t ready. ""The decision was made that while that requirement was still there, there would be no enforcement until they had time to get things up and running,"" Hoadley said. ""It took several years of saying ‘Lets not focus on this; it’s not the most important thing’."" Our ruling Graves said Obama ""himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law."" Based on the analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Graves has the right number. However, he simplifies the way that many of those 19 changes came about, and by doing that, makes it seem as though the president were more directly involved. Graves cited these changes as evidence that the law is fatally flawed but he glossed over the differences among them. Some of the changes were significant and some were technical or tangential to the health care law itself. The basic number is right but there are lot of details of details missing from Graves' assertion.

1982 Supreme Court decision in Texas case said public schools must educate non-citizen children
","Running for Texas land commissioner, Republican David Watts noted in a campaign email Sept. 16, 2013, that a big part of the job is managing public land to generate money for public schools. To make that money go farther, he said, Texas should use it only for educating children here legally. ""Unfortunately,"" Watts wrote, ""the (U.S.) Supreme Court decided in 1982 (Plyler v. Doe) that non-citizen children of illegal immigrants (children born in another country and brought into the U.S. by their illegal immigrant parents) must be given a free K-12 education."" We wondered about the details of this 30-year-old decision in a Texas case that is sometimes compared to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education anti-segregation ruling but has ""none of the same fame,"" as a Dallas Morning News retrospective news story said June 11, 2007. ""It is absent from Texas history lessons. … Yet the Plyler case has been used as a defense against countless proposals aiming to deny rights to illegal immigrants,"" the News story said, because it affirmed that a constitutional protection covered people who were illegally living in the United States. Watts, a businessman who lives outside Longview, emailed us links to the Plyler opinion and analysis of it, plus a Dec. 5, 2010, Dallas Morning News news story that used data from the Pew Hispanic Center, state government and other sources to estimate that 3 percent of Texas schoolchildren in 2009 were in the United States illegally and educating them cost the state more than $1 billion per year. Texas’ Legislature, the Plyler opinion said, changed state education law in 1975 to let school districts refuse entry to children who weren’t legal U.S. residents and to allow the state to hold back money being sent to districts to educate such students. Two years later, Tyler’s school district began charging $1,000 tuition per year for children without legal documentation. A class-action lawsuit naming Tyler school superintendent James Plyler went to Judge William Wayne Justice’s U.S. District Court for Texas’ Eastern District. In his 1978 ruling, Justice, already known for groundbreaking decisions in civil rights cases, agreed with the plaintiffs that Texas’ law (and Tyler’s policy) broke the 14th Amendment ""equal protection"" guarantee that laws in the U.S. be applied to all people in the same way. Undocumented children, Justice found, have the same right to attend public schools in Texas as U.S. citizens. His decision was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then, in 1982, by the U.S. Supreme Court, which extended the right nationwide. Texas had argued, in part, that illegal immigrants were not protected by the 14th Amendment. Justice found, and the Supreme Court affirmed, that though not citizens of the U.S., they were ""within its jurisdiction,"" as the amendment puts it, and so effectively denying the children an education because of their illegal status was unconstitutional. We checked Watts’ claim against the Supreme Court’s words. Watts specified that the ruling applied to ""non-citizen children of illegal immigrants (children born in another country and brought into the U.S. by their illegal immigrant parents)"" and that the Supreme Court said they   ""must be given a free K-12 education."" The parents’ legal status wasn’t at issue in this case, and how the children entered the country was raised in the legal debate -- typically it was held that the children were not responsible for breaking immigration law because their parents made the decisions -- but it also was not an essential part of the law or the court rulings. The high court’s Plyler opinion begins, ""The question presented by these cases is whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens."" K-12, kindergarten through 12th grade, spans elementary education plus middle school and high school, which is what Texas school districts provide at no cost to students, though families and others pay school-supporting taxes. Public state universities offer ""higher"" education, but charge tuition and also depend on tax-generated aid. (Texas and some other states, using logic similar to that in the Plyler decision, offer in-state tuition rates to non-citizens who graduated from the state’s public schools.) Texas’ 1975 election law changes, as quoted in Justice’s opinion, said any child who was ""a citizen of the United States or a legally admitted alien"" could attend Texas districts’ public schools and benefit from state education dollars. The Supreme Court decision, which was delivered by Justice William Brennan and frequently cited Justice’s findings, examined the parts of Texas’ argument that hinged on the children’s illegal status and concluded Texas had not proven it was justified in singling them out. Texas argued it was in the state’s interest to keep resources focused on educating legal residents. In the Supreme Court opinion, Brennan wrote that because citizenship was a federal status, Texas’ law had to fit in with the purposes of federal laws. If Texas was claiming it would help keep illegal immigrants out of the U.S., Brennan said, then this education law was a poor way to achieve that. If Texas was claiming that these children imposed a financial burden that lowered the statewide quality of education, Brennan said, then it had failed to provide (as Justice wrote) ""any credible evidence"" that was so. Finally, Brennan said, Texas appeared to be suggesting that these children were less likely to stay in the U.S. because of their legal status, meaning the state would not benefit from their future productivity -- so using their legal status as a criterion for keeping them out was justified. Brennan said Texas had no way to know whether any schoolchildren, legal or not, would use their education in Texas, and that ""the record is clear"" many non-citizen children would stay in the U.S. ""It is difficult to understand precisely what the state hopes to achieve by promoting the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime,"" he wrote. ""It is thus clear that whatever savings might be achieved by denying these children an education, they are wholly insubstantial in light of the costs involved to these children, the state, and the nation."" Brennan concluded, ""If the State is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state interest. No such showing was made here. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these cases is affirmed."" Our ruling Watts said the Supreme Court decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get a free K-12 education.

Does Obamacare claim get clean bill of health?
","Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel was the first of the Republican candidates for U.S. Senate to cut a commercial in the campaign, and we thought one specific line in the ad was worthy of an examination. Here’s what Handel said about it in her radio ad that premiered Sept. 6. ""Under Obamacare, members of Congress and their staffs are required to buy health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges or plans created under Obamacare – just like you and me,"" Handel said. ""But unlike you and me, Congress gets to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies – all thanks to a special deal worked out with President Obama. Handel and her GOP competitors are united in their opposition to the health care law, which most Republicans and the president call ""Obamacare."" House Republicans, including some candidates in the Senate race, are involved in a ninth-inning effort to defund the law through a bill floating in Congress. Handel has bashed one particular aspect of the law, a recent decision by the Obama administration to provide federal funding to offset health care coverage for members of Congress and eligible staff members. So, do members of Congress and their staffs get to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies? Handel, who almost won the GOP nomination for governor in 2010, is one of six Republicans who’ve announced plans to run for the Senate seat currently held by Saxby Chambliss that’s up for grabs in 2014. Chambliss has announced he is not running for a third term. Handel has attempted to separate herself from three House members running for the Senate seat -- Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston -- by linking them to contentious congressional policies. On Sept. 9, though, Gingrey introduced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from receiving any money from the federal government to help pay their health care coverage through an exchange plan. Earlier this month, PolitiFact Georgia researched Handel’s claim that Congress secured special Obamacare rules ""to prevent their health care costs from rising"" and rated it as Half True. So did Handel receive a clean bill of health from the Truth-O-Meter for the most recent claim? Obamacare boots members of Congress and their staffs from their generous Federal Employees Health Benefits plans at year's end, meaning they will have to select an insurance plan from exchanges designed for those who lack employer-based health insurance. When Congress passed the health care law, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, included an amendment that required lawmakers and their staffs to buy health insurance through the online exchanges created by the law. There was uncertainty that federal contributions for health care coverage to members of Congress and their staff would continue when the law passed. On Aug. 7, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the contributions provide up to $5,000 a year for individual coverage and as much as $11,000 for families under some of the most popular health plans, The New York Times reported. That is a subsidy of about 75 percent of the health insurance costs for members of Congress and their staffs, according to a Sept. 18 article in The Atlanta Journal Constitution. Some lawmakers were not happy with the decision. ""[T]his behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans,"" U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, said after the OPM’s announcement. ""When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats."" In Georgia, census reports show that the median household income from 2007 to 2011 was $49,736. Most households in Georgia would qualify for some kind of subsidy if they bought health insurance through an exchange. Most members of Congress currently make an annual salary of $174,000. The leaders in both chambers make more, with House Speaker John Boehner at the top of the list at $223,500 a year. Some chiefs of staffs to lawmakers make annual salaries exceeding $135,000, according to a December 2010 Sunlight Foundation report. Assistants and clerks make in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, the report found. The Office of Personnel Management’s website contains a state-by-state breakdown of the cost for various health care plans for non-U.S. Postal Service workers. The highest monthly subsidy the government would pay for family plans in each state and the District of Columbia was $920.73. Multiplied by 12 months, and that total is $11,048.76. Loren Adler, research director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said she believed Handel’s claim in the radio ad is accurate. ""[T]he statement is correct, especially since it’s worded as getting ‘to keep’ the subsidy,"" said Adler, who has worked with some senators on health care issues. We asked Adler how many lawmakers would maximize their coverage. He directed us to an August study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that found the average monthly health care premium for family coverage in 2013 will be $1,363. Some single-coverage health care plans in Washington, D.C., that Adler has seen cost $9,700 a year. ""Since family plans generally cost more than twice a single one, there should be at least some offerings expensive enough for a congressional employee to get the $11,000 subsidy for them and their family,"" Adler said. Again, Handel claimed in a radio ad that members of Congress get to keep up to $11,000 a year in taxpayer subsidies to offset health care coverage costs after an arrangement made by the Obama administration. Lawmakers can get as much as $11,000 for family coverage. This is a continuation of a prior funding policy for lawmakers and their staffs that seemed to be unclear when the health care law was passed. Members of Congress and their staffs, however, aren’t the only ones getting taxpayer-funded subsidies. Millions of Americans could get them, based on their incomes. Members of Congress and the high-paid members of their staffs are unique in one important sense. They far exceed the income caps put on the subsidies for average Americans. Handel’s statement is partially accurate, but it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate this statement as Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/25/karen-handel/does-obamacare-claim-get-clean-bill-health/

Bill Young says military pay would be delayed during government shutdown
","U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and other House Republicans oppose Obamacare and recently approved a measure to fund the government only if President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act,  is defunded. But while addressing the House on Friday, the longest-serving Republican in Congress called the House plan a ""painful and inefficient way to govern,"" and cautioned his peers against a government shutdown. Young included impact on the military in his list of examples of what would happen should the shutdown come to pass. ""All military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available,"" he said. We wanted to see how soldiers’ wallets would be impacted if the government shuts down. First, let’s review shutdown logistics. If the president and Congress can’t agree on funding for the new fiscal year, federal agencies can’t operate, except in emergencies. The last shutdowns were in 1995 and 1996. In November 1995, the shutdown lasted five days, which was not long enough to affect military pay. From mid December 1995 to early January 1996, a 21-day shutdown occurred, which would have affected paychecks, if not for defense appropriations enacted on Dec. 1 that made funding available. This time around, however, no such budget appropriations have been passed, or at least not yet. Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, said there is still enough time for the government to pass them. Back in January, Sens. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., introduced legislation that would allow both troops and civilians to get paid in the event of a shutdown, but the bill never made it out of committee. Urban said the Defense Department was making plans based on its past experience with government shutdowns. In April 2011, before Congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown, the department announced that the military would continue to work but would be paid retroactively. That would likely be the same plan this time around. If the government shutdown does occur on Sept. 30, military members would receive their Oct. 1 paychecks on time, but Oct. 15 paychecks would be delayed. We should note that civilians who work for the Defense Department wouldn’t fare as well, based on the 2011 report. Many would go on unpaid furlough during a shutdown. ""It would put a good bit of stress on an already stressed workforce,"" Urban said. Our ruling Though Young supported a House measure to defund Obamacare, he’s now urging the House to avoid a government shutdown, reminding fellow members of how that affects military pay. A Defense Department official said the department’s plan will be similar to plans from past threats of government shutdowns. That means the military would delay paychecks. Young’s claim is that the military cannot be paid without appropriations is correct.

Kelly Ayotte says mental health amendment to gun bill “got over 90 votes in the Senate”
","U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is again backing programs aimed at identifying mentally ill people who pose a risk for mass killings. Ayotte, saying she has strong bipartisan support, has co-sponsored a bill geared toward education, awareness and intervention relating to mental illness since the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. Ayotte introduced the Mental Health First Aid Act in January 2013, which never made it past a congressional committee. However, elements of that bill went into the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act that was part of the gun control legislation the Senate voted down in April. Two days after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in September 2013, Ayotte and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, issued a joint statement to Senate leadership advocating programs to educate teachers in recognizing symptoms of mental health illness and how they could defuse potentially dangerous situations. Soon after, she appeared on CNN’s The Lead With Jake Tapper. She said a bill that addresses mental health issues would pass the Senate easily. Ayotte said the mental health amendment that was attached to last April’s gun-control legislation passed easily. However, it was not enacted because the gun bill itself lost. ""I actually think it can be taken up separately and easily passed because of the mental health provisions. It got over 90 votes in the Senate and very little gets 90 votes around here,"" Ayotte said. We wondered whether the mental health amendment really got such overwhelming support. We looked at the official roll call vote on the amendment and found that it had indeed passed by a 95-2 vote on April 18. Despite voting for the mental health amendment she co-sponsored, Ayotte later became one of 41 Republicans who voted against the gun control proposal sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have expanded background checks. Five Democrats also voted against it. The mixed messages these votes sent drew sharp criticism from critics. Ayotte responded with a statement that said: ""I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales."" Our ruling Ayotte said that mental health provisions related to mass shootings ""got over 90 votes in the Senate."" While an early version of the bill never made it out of committee, the Senate did eventually vote, 95-2, for a mental-health amendment to a gun control bill. The full bill lacked enough votes to pass and was pulled from the floor, but she is correct that the amendment did get 90 votes.

Mike Turner says Delphi retirees lost pensions to political favoritism and backroom deals
","In April 2012, PolitiFact Ohio issued a ""Mostly False"" rating to a claim by a congressman from Dayton, Michael Turner, over the loss of pension benefits of salaried retirees from Delphi, the auto parts maker. Turner had said that some ""20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions"" as a result of ""political favoritism and backroom deals."" A rating of Mostly False means that the statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. In this case, the loss of pensions was not in question. The pensions were cut after Delphi, which once was part of General Motors, hit deep financial problems. But the rest of the claim, ascribing blame to political favoritism and Obama administration backroom deals, was not supported by facts. We based the ruling on the available evidence, which included Government Accountability Office reports and congressional testimony. We also noted that eventually, a fuller accounting of the Delphi matter would come out from a special inspector general. When it did, we said, we’d consider taking another look. That report is out. And based on it, we are upgrading the rating a notch to Half True. Some background: In 2009, GM was in financial trouble and the federal government bailed it out with a financial package worth more than $50 billion, including a loan and an equity stake in a post-bankruptcy, restructured company. There were others in the auto industry also in trouble, including Delphi. And GM and Delphi were the corporate equivalent of step brothers, if not blood relatives. Delphi was a division of GM until the parts maker was spun off as an independent company in 1999. Before the spinoff, Delphi maintained separate pension funds for its unionized and non-unionized workforces. The non-unionized workers were salaried, many in white-collar or support jobs, and their pension fund was flush. The union pension fund, however, was not. In other cases, this might have meant that the unionized workers would eventually get smaller pensions than planned. But in this case, GM made a deal that kept the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, or UAW, happy, which helped facilitate the Delphi spinoff. The deal was this: GM would make up, or ""top-up,"" the difference between the underfunded pension payments and the amounts the workers would have gotten if their pension fund were in fine health. This was not just benevolence. By agreeing to the top-up, GM was able to hand off Delphi operations without union opposition and keep its outside supply chain running. And so the parties codified the top-up provision and kept it in force. But a decade later, the twin bankruptcies of GM and Delphi created a wrinkle. GM had the right in bankruptcy to void its contracts. That could have meant the end to the top-up agreement. It so happened that by now, the fortunes of Delphi’s nonunion workforce and retirees had turned. The once-full pension fund for non-union, or salaried, retirees was underfunded as well. But unlike their unionized colleagues, the salaried or non-unionized retirees had no top-up deal. So what would happen? Two things: First, the Obama administration would agree to bail out General Motors and give it money to keep operating. But before the final sign-off,  the administration through its Treasury Department-appointed auto task force would need to review GM’s obligations and make decisions about what and whether it owed Delphi retirees. Bankruptcies typically involve many parties being told to accept the fact that they are never going to get every penny they are owed. Yet that’s not what happened in the case of the Delphi unionized-worker pensions. GM, with considerable help from the Treasury auto team, agreed that even as it exited bankruptcy as a new organization, it would continue to top-up the UAW pensions from its parts supplier. It also agreed to continue top-ups for the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America. But GM and Treasury’s auto team left the salaried retiree pensions alone. The non-union retirees would get no top-up. As a result, those retirees would only collect 30 percent to 70 percent of their expected pensions, which would be paid by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., or PBGC, the federal agency that takes over failing pension plans. Was this fair? Turner and other lawmakers from auto states said no, as did Delphi retirees. They said that despite the pre-existing top-up agreements, GM’s bankruptcy gave the automaker the right to rewrite the top-up contracts, just as it rewrote a number of unrelated terms with the union’s consent. Even better, they said, GM and Treasury could have worked out a way to make all Delphi retirees whole. But that didn’t happen. There were winners (the union) and losers (the non-union retirees), and that looked like political favoritism and backroom dealing to Turner and other critics. But in 2012, congressional testimony and GAO reports led PolitiFact Ohio to conclude that Treasury and GM made the decision because: (a) the union had long-standing top-up agreements and salaried retirees did not, and (b) any attempt to end those agreements would have caused the UAW to balk or even strike. Treasury maintained that it was vital to get GM stabilized quickly, and an interruption to its ability to get parts for its cars -- due to labor unrest -- could be fatal. There was nothing to back up Turner’s claim that the top-up decision was made because of political favoritism and backroom dealing. The GAO said that ""court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GM’s business judgment."" Based on this, PolitiFact Ohio gave Turner’s claim a ""Mostly False"" rating."" That’s where matters stood until Aug. 15, when additional information was released though the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, provided federal funds for bank bailouts as well as the auto rescue, and was overseen by Treasury. The report by the special inspector general, an independent watchdog, provided a long-awaited assessment of Treasury’s role in the pension controversy. The SIGTARP report confirmed much of what the GAO already said. It reported that GM and Treasury were concerned about getting the automaker back on its feet quickly -- and that, in the words of Steven Rattner, head of the auto team, trying to get more on pensions ""was a game of chicken we didn’t want to play. We were under incredible time pressure."" Why, then, upgrade PolitiFact Ohio’s rating? The SIGTARP report contained new information about the dominant role that Treasury’s auto team played. The team’s role in the decision to top-up the pensions of UAW workers was not just advisory, the SIGTARP report said. Treasury’s financial role gave it a dominant position. GM could not make decisions without Treasury. GM’s chief financial officer at the time, Ray Young, told SIGTARP that Treasury’s influence, a result of its financial stake, was such that GM ""put forward recommendations, but at the end of the day (Treasury) makes the final decision."" This was all done privately. Those with leverage, particularly Treasury and the UAW, were able to make their demands. Delphi’s salaried retirees, who believed the government could make them whole, had no leverage and were largely kept on the outside. That is a clear impression from the SIGTARP report. This is the way most negotiations occur, including many involving individual Congress members, as a Treasury spokesman noted as we discussed this with him. But Turner’s claim did not involve other deals. He was speaking specifically of the Delphi pension matter. So we return to Turner’s claim about ""political favoritism and backroom deals."" A rating of Half True means the statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Turner’s claim is partially accurate. Treasury’s heavy role, well-reasoned or not, was largely played out in closed meetings. It was not subject to transparency -- a key reason why the White House and members of the House of Representatives government oversight committee, on which Turner serves, continue to spar over the committee’s demands for more information and testimony. Was there political favoritism? We can’t know for sure because of the lack of transparency, nor can Turner, but there isn’t evidence to prove it. And the claim still requires a considerable amount of context to understand fully. But until the SIGTARP report’s release, the extent of Treasury’s role -- the backroom considerations -- were more a matter of speculation than fact. We believe this warrants an upgrade. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/24/michael-turner/mike-turner-says-delphi-retirees-lost-pensions-pol/

Texas governor's 'bad budgeting' not to blame for announced plans to convert 83 miles of roads to gravel
","A Democratic group reacted to Republican Gov. Rick Perry bringing his move-to-Texas pitch to Maryland by airing an ad on Baltimore radio stations. In the ad from the Texans for America’s Future PAC, two men twang about Texas starting with one reminding listeners of Perry’s ""oops"" when during a 2011 Republican presidential debate he did not come up with the name of the third agency he intended to eliminate. Perry similarly has forgotten that one in four Texas children ""lives in poverty,"" the fellow says in the ad. In 2011, some 26 percent of the state’s children lived in households with incomes below the federal poverty line, according to a Sept. 12, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article. In the ad, the second man intones: ""And thanks to Perry's bad budgeting, the highway department has to convert some modern paved state roads back to gravel."" The Texas Department of Transportation has revealed plans to convert to gravel some paved roads battered by heavy trucks traveling to oil and gas fracking sites. And did this decision result from Perry’s ""bad"" budgeting? Jeff Rotkoff, Austin spokesman for the group, reminded us by email that as governor, Perry signs lawmaker-advanced state budgets into law. More specifically, Rotkoff said, news accounts show that TxDOT cited finances as a reason to gravel the selected roads. On July 25, 2013, TxDOT’s chief engineer, John Barton, told the agency’s oversight commission that a dozen short farm-to-market road segments, adding up to 83 miles of pavement, were in such poor shape that they were not worth repairing, the Statesman reported in a news article posted online that day. The story said that concurrently, speed limits on the roads would be reduced from a typical 55 mph to 30 mph. The paper quoted Barton as saying TxDOT also planned to post weight limits on an additional 518 miles of roads, some to as low as 20,000 pounds, and restrict vehicles widths to 10 feet or less on an additional 517 miles of road. ""We’re at a point where it’s really not safe to have them be asphalt,"" Barton told the Texas Transportation Commission. A Texas Tribune news story posted that day said that the chosen roads were in four South Texas counties — Live Oak, Dimmit, LaSalle and Zavala — and two West Texas counties — Reeves and Culberson — and that they included a three-mile stretch of frontage road for Interstate 37 in Live Oak County. A month later, though, the agency announced a pause, saying that aside from more than three miles of damaged roads that had already been converted to ""high-end gravel,"" it would enter a two-month review period for the other proposed conversions to see if county governments stepped forward to pay for maintaining the paved roads, the Statesman said in a news story posted online Aug. 29, 2013. Several news accounts said budgetary pressures played into the initial decision to gravel roads.   A July 26, 2013, Houston Chronicle news story, for example, quoted Barton as saying: ""Our resources are being strained to the point we are having to make difficult decisions."" The July Statesman story said that ""TxDOT, thanks to more than $20 billion of borrowing, has had a several-year surge of road building, but that bubble of money is due to pop in the next couple of years."" The newspaper described TxDOT executive director Phil Wilson as saying that unless lawmakers found new TxDOT funding sources, the agency’s existing level of road contracts, about $6.2 billion this year, would fall to $2.5 billion by the 2015-16 fiscal years and stay there. A Sept. 11, 2013, San Antonio Express-News news article quoted Barton as telling residents at a community meeting about the asphalt-to-gravel plans: ""If resources were different, different decisions would be made."" The story also quoted Wilson as saying the intent is to repave the roads in the future when funding is available. But none of that news coverage referred to Perry as being to blame for TxDOT’s budget crunch. Perry has long opposed pitches to raise the state’s gas tax, which would generate more money for roads. But he’s also called for money for building and keeping up roads. In his Jan. 29, 2013 State of the State address, Perry urged lawmakers to shift $3.7 billion from the state’s rainy day fund to make one-time investments in road and water projects. Perry also called for ending the diversion of tax revenue from the state’s highway fund, which he said would free up $1.3 billion every two years for road maintenance and construction. Lawmakers later agreed to prevent the diversion of $400 million from the highway fund through 2014-15 and also sent voters a proposed constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would shift $1.2 billion a year in ""rainy day"" funds to building and maintaining roads and acquiring related right-of-ways. By email, TxDOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer sent figures indicating that during Perry’s governorship, the agency has annually committed at least $3 billion a year to build and maintain highways. More than $9 billion in commitments occurred in the fiscal year running through August 2009, Beyer said. Over all of Perry’s years, she said, expenditures came from the highway fund, bond funds approved by lawmakers and/or voters and federal aid. Beyer said bringing the 83 miles of roads slated for gravel up to highway strength would cost more than $40 million. Separately, we reached Tim Lomax, a senior research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, which says it annually works on hundreds of transportation-related research projects. Lomax, who said he has worked on projects for TxDOT, said by phone he doubts budgetary moves by Perry drove the roads-to-gravel decision. Instead, he suggested, TxDOT rationalized that keeping the particular roads paved didn’t make sense. ""Those roads are difficult to maintain,"" Lomax said. ""They could keep pouring money into those roads and still struggle to keep them up… The specifics are (that) if this oil and gas development is going to continue; they’re going to have to keep going out there to repair those roads or they’d have to spend a whole bunch of money to keep those roads in good shape… Why would you invest a whole bunch of money in a road to make it solid and then five years from now, it isn’t being used or not being used for what it was designed?"" Our ruling The PAC said that thanks to ""Perry's bad budgeting, the (Texas) highway department has to convert some modern paved state roads back to gravel."" TxDOT indeed cited financial pressures as a reason for not repaving 83 miles of rural roads that it wants to convert to gravel. But we saw no sign of Perry playing more than his role of signing budgets into law. Those actions don’t strike us as sufficient to blame Perry for the gravel plans, which also reflect the agency’s judgment that it doesn’t make sense to repave certain roads only to have them repeatedly buckle under big trucks part and parcel of the fracking boom. Significantly, too, Perry sought billions of dollars in additional road funding from the 2013 Legislature; some funding came through and voters could approve more. While this claim has a pebble of truth, we stripe it as Mostly False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

","A group called Oregon 2014 is trying to collect enough signatures to put a measure on the ballot that would prohibit taxpayer spending on abortions. The group tried to do the same in 2012 but failed to collect enough signatures. In any case, on its website is this statistic: ""In 2012 there were 9,015 abortions in Oregon. In fiscal year 2011-2012, 4,191 abortions were paid for by taxpayers via the Oregon Health Plan.""   The suggestion came to us via a reader, who had heard a signature gatherer cite the statistic. Was it true? We contacted Oregon 2014 right away, where a co-chief petitioner said the statistic was solid and that he welcomed a fact check. ""I’ve been called a liar to my face,"" said Jeff Jimerson, ""and I try to direct them to the information."" The information comes from the Oregon Health Authority. The number of abortions paid by the state has fluctuated from 4,105 in 2002-03 to 3,424 in 2008-09 to 4,191 in 2011-12. This is the most up-to-date information available, said Karynn Fish, an OHA spokeswoman. But isn’t there a restriction on using public money to finance abortions? There is. The Hyde Amendment, first approved by Congress in 1976, prohibits the use of public money to pay for abortions, except in case of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life, for the most part. This affects low-income women who receive health care through federal Medicaid. In response to the Hyde Amendment, Oregon’s Department of Human Resources then issued a rule limiting reimbursement for abortions. People sued. The appellate court voted the rule unconstitutional, in that it violated the equal privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution. In 1984, the Oregon Supreme Court took a different approach, ruling that Human Resources had overstepped its rule-making authority, which was to pay for medical services for needy people. In Oregon, the Health Plan uses a mix of federal and state monies to provide health care for low-income residents. Oregon is among a minority of states that allow using state taxpayer money for elective abortions. Petitioners hope to change that by adding these words to the Constitution: ""No public funds shall be used to pay for any abortion, except when medically necessary or as may be required by federal law."" We may see this measure on the 2014 ballot; we may not. But it is accurate to say that state taxpayer money paid for about 4,000 abortions in the most recent year available.

"['State Budget', 'North Carolina', 'Sydney Batch']","
This NC Democrat said the NC budget had passed. It hadn't.
","Democrats are mad that Republicans plan to change state government spending without their direct input. Republicans, who hold a supermajority in the North Carolina Legislature, are mostly negotiating budget changes amongst themselves and intend to block any proposed amendments to their bill. But, if voters were to read one Democrat’s newsletter, they’d get an entirely different picture of the situation. A May 23 newsletter distributed by Sydney Batch, a Democratic candidate for NC House, overstates what has happened so far. ""Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget,"" the newsletter said. It adds: ""For the first time in (the) history of our great state, they are not allowing any debate or input on our budget."" Batch is running for a House seat representing Raleigh’s southern suburbs. That district's incumbent, a Republican, isn't running for re-election so Batch will face Republican candidate John Adcock. The problem with Batch’s statements is that they aren’t accurate.   As we write this fact-check, legislative Republicans have yet to vote on or even reveal their full budget plans. And her statement about the lack of debate is also misleading. Republican leaders plan to gut an old bill and amend it as a ""conference report"" to include their budget plans, meaning state lawmakers will have no method for amending the legislation. But it remains to be seen whether Republicans will allow debate on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As for the historical precedent of blocking amendments, The News & Observer story, which Batch linked to in her newsletter, says amendments won’t be allowed for the first time in ""modern history."" Gerry Cohen, former head of the bill-drafting division in the Legislature, told the Associated Press that legislators haven’t completely skipped the amendment process since at least the early 1970s.  When contacted by PolitiFact, Batch referred to the claim as ""an inadvertent typo."" An apology ""I meant to type, ‘Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly decided that they are going to use the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget,’"" Batch wrote in an email (Whether or not the process Republicans are using can be referred to as ""the nuclear option"" is another debate altogether.) ""I will retract and edit the statement with the email list shortly. Thanks for bringing it to my attention,"" Batch wrote. And retract the statement, she did. On May 24, Batch distributed a newsletter apologizing for her mistake. ""Friends and supporters, yesterday, there was an error in oversight,"" she wrote. In using a conference report, ""the leadership does not have to allow debate or input on the bill. This enables leadership to stop any changes to their bill, that has become NC's budget. This bill is expected to pass immediately in both chambers when properly introduced. It is a secretive and unethical way to govern,"" she said, concluding: ""I apologize for the mistake in the language used in yesterday's title and if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact the campaign."" Our ruling Batch said, ""Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget."" In fact, the budget hasn’t been approved yet. It hasn’t even been put up for a vote. Batch apologized for the mistake and retracted her statement in a new email – which PolitiFact applauds. But that doesn’t protect her first statement from our Truth-O-Meter. We rate her claim False. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misquoted Gerry Cohen, former had of the bill-drafting division in the legislature, saying that a state budget had previously been approved without going through the amendment process. To clarify, Cohen isn’t sure whether it has happened before. This error doesn’t affect PolitiFact’s rating.",/factchecks/2018/may/25/sydney-batch/nc-democrat-said-nc-budget-had-passed-it-hadnt/

Do more than 7 in 10 police bullets miss their mark, as this gun control advocate said?
","Calls to arm school teachers grew louder after a gunman at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school on May 18 killed eight students and two teachers, and injured 13 others. Second Amendment proponents, with backing from President Donald Trump, say putting guns in the hands of volunteer personnel would make schools safer. But gun control advocates argue the proposal would lead to dangerous unintended consequences. ""Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time, yet the @NRA wants to arm volunteer teachers,"" Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, tweeted May 21. ""It's on each of us to prevent this NRA dystopia, and stop letting the gun lobby write our gun laws. We're sacrificing our children at the altar of gun manufacturers' profits.""  Trained police hit their targets less than 30% of the time, yet the @NRA wants to arm volunteer teachers. It's on each of us to prevent this NRA dystopia, and stop letting the gun lobby write our gun laws. We're sacrificing our children at the altar of gun manufacturers' profits. https://t.co/mWCBVrrLNH Watts may have a point that the average armed teacher might be less accurate than a trained cop. But her claim that trained police hit their target ""less than 30 percent of the time"" is not as clear-cut as Watts suggests. For starters, national numbers on police marksmanship are not readily available. But we found data on some individual jurisdictions, including several major metropolitan police departments. An aide to Watts pointed us to a 2008 Rand study that looked at the accuracy of New York Police Department officer-involved shootings. The key data point is the ""hit rate,"" the number of rounds that struck a suspect divided by total shots fired. The Rand study looked at NYPD firearm-discharge reports from from 1998 through 2006. Some of the findings point in Watts’ favor, while other data refutes her point. Hit ratios were below 30 percent for gunfights (18 percent) and from long ranges (23 percent from more than seven yards away). However, in cases where suspects did not return fire, NYPD officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time. Accuracy levels were above 30 percent when the target was seven yards away or closer (37 percent).  Recent data shows a further uptick in the NYPD’s hit rate compared with the Rand study. Inspector Kevin Maloney, who headed up the NYPD unit that oversees police-involved shootings, told the New York Daily News in December 2017 that the NYPD fired a record low number of rounds that year. The department’s hit ratio also exceeded those in the 2008 Rand study in 2017. NYPD cops fired 170 shots and hit their targets 75 times, for a hit ratio of 44 percent for the year, as of Dec. 21, 2017. In 2016, police landed 107 of a total 304 shots fired, a hit ratio of roughly 35 percent. Again, Watts said the hit rate was less than 30 percent. Recent data from the Los Angeles Police Department further undermines Watts’ claim. According to the LAPD’s 2016 report, the average annual hit ratio from 2012 through 2016 was 33.4 percent, with a substantial uptick in 2016.  ""With a lot of training and reform, LAPD has a hit rate of 48 percent (in 2016). That is likely at the high end of hit rates,"" said Gregory Ridgeway, an associate professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Their number of rounds per incident is also way down in the last five years."" In a 2006 study, Michael D. White, a criminology professor at Arizona State University, provided a roundup of hit ratio data from various jurisdictions and timeframes. (This data is quite old but we provide to give a broader cross-section of jurisdictions.) JURISDICTION HIT RATIO TIMEFRAME 155 Michigan police departments 27% 1976 to 1981 New York Police Department 26% 1987 New York Police Department 31% 1988 New York Police Department 23% 1990 Los Angeles Police Department 56% 1970s Los Angeles Police Department 28% 1980 to 1988 Metro-Dade, Florida 31% January 1984 - June 1988 Memphis 25% 1991 San Antonio 100% 1991 San Francisco 100% 1991 ""Hit rates vary notably across police agencies but rarely exceed 50 percent,"" White wrote. ""The research examining shooter accuracy overwhelmingly debunks the Hollywood myth of police officers as sharp shooters who can wing suspects in the shoulder or leg or shoot weapons out of suspects’ hands."" Firearms training varies across jurisdictions. Some major metropolitan police departments require officers to qualify up to four times a year on handgun marksmanship and undergo simulated training exercises. Police experts say that armed teachers should also be forced to undertake specialized and repeated training regimens. ""Simply putting a gun on the premises and hoping someone’s going to do the right thing with it is baseless,"" Chris Grollnek, a former law enforcement officer who specializes in security issues told the PBS Newshour. ""All you’re doing is signing people up for PTSD."" Trump first proposed arming teachers following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 14 students and three staff members, and wounded 17 others. Administration officials in March said the White House wants to partner with local official to give teachers and other volunteer school personnel ""rigorous firearms training,"" but offered few details on a concept that has been embraced by the National Rifle Association. Neither the White House nor NRA responded to requests for a comment. Watts said, ""Trained police hit their targets less than 30 percent of the time."" By saying less than 30 percent, Watts is distorting the facts. A national figure for police marksmanship is not readily available.  Overall, data from some jurisdictions supports Watts’ claim, while other data refutes it. This claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True. ",/factchecks/2018/may/25/shannon-watts/do-more-7-10-police-bullets-miss-their-mark-gun-co/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Negative Campaigning', ""The 2018 California Governor's Race"", 'California', 'John Cox']","
Did a GOP candidate for California governor really donate to Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom?
","Did Travis Allen, arguably the most conservative candidate for California governor, donate campaign money to three of the state’s leading liberal Democrats? That’s the Republican-on-Republican attack levied by John Cox’s campaign for governor in a recent TV ad that goes after Allen, an Orange County assemblyman who’s positioned himself as a GOP populist. Here’s the full text of the ad, which includes three attacks on Allen: Narrator: ""For Republicans, the race for governor is crystal clear: There’s conservative businessman John Cox, leading the opposition to Jerry Brown’s Sanctuary State and chairman of the initiative campaign to repeal the gas tax.  Then there’s career politician Travis Allen. He gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown. Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer. And on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens. The conservative choice is clear: John Cox for governor.""  The ad was paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018. We’ll examine the other two attacks on Allen in future fact-checks. In this piece, we’ll focus on the claim he donated to top Democrats. Background on GOP rivals Recent polls show growing support for Cox’s campaign for governor, less than a week after President Trump endorsed the San Diego businessman. A survey released Wednesday night from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Newsom, the state’s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent,  State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent. Cox and Allen have sparred at campaign events over who is the most conservative candidate. They’ve both criticized California’s Democratic leadership over the gas tax increase and sanctuary state protections. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Donating to Democrats? The ad accuses Allen of donating to three of the state’s top Democrats. The irony, of course, is that Allen’s run for governor has centered on criticizing those same politicians, particularly Brown and Newsom.   We found clear evidence supporting the claim, though Cox’s ad ignores the fact that the contributions took place nearly a decade ago, before Allen ran for elected office, and that he also donated to Republicans. Campaign finance records show that in October 2010, Allen donated $1,000 to Jerry Brown for Governor, through Wealth Strategies Group, his wealth management firm in Huntington Beach. In August 2010, Allen gave $100 to Gavin Newsom for Lieutenant Governor. And, in October 2010, he donated $250 to Barbara Boxer for Senate.  SOURCE: Campaign finance records from the California Secretary of State's website.  Asked about this, a spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign said in an email that the contributions took place ""before Travis was an elected official, as a businessman, he purchased tickets to some events."" A November 2017 Mercury-News article summarized these and additional donations Allen made to Democrats in 2010 and 2011. He told the paper at that time: ""As a businessman I was invited to some events by friends, and I purchased tickets to these events. Attending these events, however, opened my eyes to the damage the Democrats were doing to California, and brought about my decision to do everything in my power to stop them, including running for public office."" Similar claim In April 2016, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True a similar claim about then Presidential candidate Donald Trump donating to Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, at the time Trump’s rival for the Republican presidential nomination, claimed Trump ""has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris."" Campaign finance data showed the claim was accurate, though we noted Cruz left out that the donations took place long before Trump announced his run for president. The contribution to Jerry Brown took place in 2006, while the donations to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013. Our ruling In a recent TV ad, John Cox’s campaign for governor claimed rival GOP candidate Travis Allen donated to three of California’s top Democrats. Campaign records prove the claim, though the contributions took place a decade ago, before Allen entered politics. The statement is accurate but needs this clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

Did Congress approve $1.6 billon for school safety?
","It isn’t often that President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., use a similar talking point. But it happened recently with regard to funding for school safety — and neither Trump nor Pelosi was accurate. In remarks to the National Rifle Association on May 4, Trump said, ""I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security and mental health."" Two weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence repeated that $2 billion figure in a speech in Indianapolis. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded these comments Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Pelosi, however, used much the same logic during a CNN town hall on May 23. She touted new funding for school security, using a somewhat smaller figure of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Here’s the exchange with host Chris Cuomo: Cuomo: ""The building we're in now, the building that you work in, the point of entry there is secure. You don't walk in with a trench coat with a shotgun underneath your jacket and get in. It doesn't happen. You know this. Why can't that be part of the equation? Talk about universal background checks, fine. Talk about mental health, how to identify them. The money for treatment. But why either/or? Why not make the schools safer? I know it's a state issue, but they're going to ask for money…"" Pelosi: ""It is a state issue."" Cuomo: ""And that's where the federal government comes in. … You could offer them money to make schools so that when you go there as a guest, and you walk in, of course, they'll have multiple points of egress for emergencies. But you're going to be looked at when you go in that school and you're not going to walk in with a gun under your coat."" Pelosi: ""In our omnibus bill that we passed just a few weeks ago, we had $1.8 billion — I think it was $1.8 billion, it could be $1.6 billion — in there for this purpose, for schools to make — to give them an opportunity to secure them. And those schools have to make those decisions."" So, did a recent spending bill include at least $1.6 billion for school security or safety? No. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they said she was referring to the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program, known as SSAE for short. This program, run by the Education Department, has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion. However, both the dollar figure and the nature of the grants don’t hold up to scrutiny. First, while the program has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion, the most recent spending bill only provided a portion of that amount, $1.1 billion. Pelosi ""misspoke on the specific amount,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill. It’s important to remember that Cuomo’s question focused on what could be done to boost security against armed school attacks. The SSAE program, it turns out, isn’t geared exclusively toward school security. Rather, it’s focused broadly on providing ""all students with access to a well-rounded education,"" improving ""school conditions for student learning,"" and improving ""the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students."" School violence is one of the specific areas cited in the law. The grants may also be used for improving school-based mental health services, which can ease the causes of some school-violence incidents. However, these are just two of the areas these grants can be used for. Some of the others are: • Technologies such as software, simulations, online databases, computer-based assessments, and educational access tools for rural areas. • The prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation referral, recovery support services, or education related to the illegal use of drugs. • Schools, or dedicated programs within schools, to engage students in ""rigorous, relevant, and integrated learning experiences focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including computer science."" The explanation of the spending bill published in the Congressional Record on March 28 emphasized that SSAE grants ""can be utilized for a wide range of uses."" While the uses mentioned in the explanation included ""school-based violence prevention strategies,"" the explanation emphasized that the bill ""encourages the department to especially support pre-kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line."" And a House committee report describing the bill highlighted that ""programs designed to support non-cognitive factors such as critical thinking skills, social skills, work ethic, problem solving, and community responsibility are an eligible use of funds under SSAE grants supporting a well-rounded education."" So the $1.1 billion in the spending bill won’t necessarily be spent on school security of the type Cuomo was asking about. Ultimately, ""school safety has to compete with STEM, foreign language learning, technology enhancements and numerous other educational priorities for those SSAE funds,"" said Bob Farrace, the director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. ""With that single funding pool, school leaders have to balance the need to safeguard the school with the need to make the school a place worth coming to."" Pelosi’s spokesman, Hammill, emphasized that protecting students from attacks is about more than just hardening infrastructure. The grants, he said, promote "" ‘soft’ efforts to ensure schools can combat bullying, harassment, while offering school personnel training, mental health resources, comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services, drug and violence prevention, training on trauma-informed practices, and health and physical education."" While those areas are covered as acceptable uses, the expressed desire by Congress is that these grants also foster such goals as boosting STEM education, digital learning and distance education — and that suggests that not all $1.1 billion will be used on efforts that address school violence, even indirectly. Responding to a question about preventing gun violence in schools, Pelosi said that a recent spending bill had at least ""$1.6 billion in there ... for schools to give them an opportunity to secure them."" Her office acknowledged to PolitiFact that she should have said $1.1 billion, the amount devoted to a federal grant program for schools that was funded in the bill. Still, even that figure is likely exaggerated. When the Education Department distributes $1.1 billion in grants under the program she was referencing, school security will have to fight for that money against such items as STEM education and digital education. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/may/24/nancy-pelosi/did-congress-recently-approve-16-billon-school-saf/

Has Milwaukee, where police tased NBA's Sterling Brown, paid over $22M in police misconduct cases?
","By the evening of May 23, 2018, a newly released video -- showing the arrest and tasing of NBA basketball player Sterling Brown by Milwaukee police -- was going viral. The incident occurred Jan. 26, 2018, when Brown drew police attention by parking across two handicapped spaces outside a Walgreens about 2 a.m. The police bodycam footage showed officers had been confrontational from the start of their interaction with the Milwaukee Bucks rookie, who was thrown to the pavement and tased. As the video was being released, the Milwaukee police chief apologized to Brown, a 23-year-old African-American, and said officers had been disciplined. Brown has hired a prominent Wisconsin lawyer to bring a civil rights lawsuit against the City of Milwaukee. That raises the possibility of taxpayers having to pay for the police actions and made us wonder about an alderman’s statement made in connection with the incident: Has the City of Milwaukee paid, since 2015, more than $22 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits? Statement by an alderman The incident with Brown never sat well with Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, who represents the south side neighborhood where it occurred -- but not necessarily because of how Brown was treated. Days after the incident, Donovan accused Mayor Tom Barrett, a frequent political rival, of having ""ordered"" that Brown not be charged with a crime -- allegations Barrett strongly denied. (Brown had been arrested on a tentative misdemeanor charge of resisting or obstructing an officer. But ultimately police decided not to request criminal charges be filed.) Now back to the release of the videotape. It had been reported two days before the release of the video when it would be released. Several hours before the release, Donovan issued a news release that didn’t mention Brown, but seemed to allude to him. The release carried this headline: ""Has policing in urban America become an undoable job?"" Donovan, who is known as strongly pro-police, lamented a lack of respect for officers, saying: ""And there’s another thing that I just don’t get: Why someone would refuse to obey a lawful order given by a police officer."" Just before using the Taser, which emits an electrical shock, on Brown, officers had told him to remove his hands from his pockets. Brown, who had taken his hands in and out of his pockets several times before that, replied: ""Hold on. I've got stuff in my hands."" The Donovan statement from the news release that we want to check is this: ""Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct."" The figures In October 2017, seven months before Donovan made his claim, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: Police misconduct has cost Milwaukee taxpayers at least $17.5 million in legal settlements since 2015, forcing the city to borrow money to make the payouts amid an ever-tightening budget.

That amount jumps to at least $21.4 million when interest paid on the borrowing and fees paid to outside attorneys are factored in, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis found. At the time, the city was considering whether to close six fire stations, leading Ald. Bob Bauman to say: ""Just have the police stop violating civil rights, and we’d have plenty of money for fire houses."" So, the $21.4 million is close to Donovan’s claim of more than $22 million. Official tally: $20.2 million When we asked Donovan the source for his statement, he provided us a May 3, 2018, memo from the city’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau. The memo says that since 2015, the city has paid $20.2 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits or claims against the city, including four that exceeded $2 million: Case Amount Chaunte Ott, wrongfully convicted of 1995 homicide $6.5 million 74 African-Americans subject to strip, body cavity searches $5 million Woman raped by officer after he responded to her 911 call $2.5 million Dontre Hamilton shot to death by officer in a park $2.3 million But more pending The memo goes on to say that the total is $22.1 million if a pending settlement of $1.9 million in a stop-and-frisk lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union is included. On May 8, 2018, a Common Council committee postponed a vote to recommend approving the settlement when aldermen were told the estimated settlement could be much higher -- some $6 million. So, that settlement has not been finalized. Our rating Donovan says: ""Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct."" The city’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau puts the tally at $20.2 million, but notes that a pending settlement in one case would push the total to $22.1 million.

Online story gets details wrong about informant payment in Trump Russia probe
","As President Donald Trump tweeted that the Russia investigation is fake news, USbreakingnews.net flashed the headline, ""BOMBSHELL!! Obama Paid FBI Informant Over $1 MILLION To Do It To Trump!"" Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Is it true? No. The facts behind this claim The FBI informant in question has been reported by the Washington Post and others as American foreign policy academic Stefan Halper. According to news reports, the FBI asked Halper to talk to several people involved with the Trump campaign during the summer and fall of 2016. Halper had conversations with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, then foreign policy advisers to the Trump campaign, and campaign co-chair Sam Clovis. Early on in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians in 2016. Trump has said the informant got a ""massive amount of money,"" but we don’t know if the FBI paid him at all. It’s simply unknown at this point. Where is the money coming from? Here’s what the USbreakingnews story got right: Halper received over $1 million to do work for the U.S. government. Washington’s spending database shows the government signed four contracts with Halper totalling $1,058,161 between 2012 and 2016. The dates fall during the Obama administration. Award ID Amount Start date End date Funding office HQ003416P0148 $411,575 9/29/2017 3/29/2018 DOD Office of Net Assessment HQ003415C0100 $244,960 9/24/2015 9/27/2016 DOD Office of Net Assessment HQ003414C0076 $204,000 7/31/2014 7/31/2015 DOD Office of Net Assessment HQ003412C0039 $197,626 5/30/2012 5/29/2013 DOD Office of Net Assessment In the key period in 2016, Halper worked on a study of Russian-Chinese relationships. But the money came from the Defense Department’s Office of Net Assessment, not the FBI. The Pentagon describes the Office of Net Assessment as ""an independent organization within the Department of Defense charged with identifying emerging or future threats and opportunities for the United States."" The USbreakingnews piece gets a bit confused on this point. It asks, ""Why would anyone receive that kind of money ($1,058,161) from the DOJ?"" But the money did not come from the Department of Justice, where the FBI sits. It came from the Pentagon. The article then asks why ""someone like Halper"" would get such money. Halper’s professional biography gives a few answers. He’s professor emeritus at Cambridge University in England where he lectures on international security issues. He served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Political-Military Affairs in the Reagan administration. The headline says Obama had a direct hand in the payments, but it offers no evidence that Obama had anything to do with the contract awards. Some money came before Trump announced he was running The article’s math is also off. About 40 percent of the money was awarded before Trump even got into the race in June 2015. So even if there were a tie between the contracts and Halper’s conversations with Trump campaign advisers – and there’s zero indication of that —  the amount would be less than $1 million. The article strings together a handful of facts to gin up a compelling headline, but nothing holds together.

No, a German submarine wasn't just discovered in Great Lakes
","A headline would have readers believe that a ship discovered at the bottom of Lake Ontario by the Coast Guard is a German submarine, but this is fake news that has circulated for years. ""USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes,"" said a May 22 headline on Cvikas. A similar story has appeared on various websites since 2016. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The story said that amateur scuba divers first spotted the boat in January and contacted authorities. Then, the story went, archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard determined that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II and recovered it. But we found no legitimate news articles stating that such a sunken ship was recently discovered. The story included a photo of a rusted submarine. Snopes found in 2016 that the photo was an unrelated image of a rusting, decommissioned Russian submarine from the Cold War era. The story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at the Niagara University. Thomas Burns, a spokesman for the university, said they do not have a professor by that name. The Coast Guard told PolitiFact that the story about a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. However, something similar has happened in the past. ""Years ago the Navy brought a WWII submarine onto the Great Lakes and at some point sank the submarine. So there is a WWII submarine sunken in the Great Lakes, but the Coast Guard didn’t work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. ABC 7 Eyewitness News in Chicago reported in 2013 about the history of a sunken German submarine in Lake Michigan. The German mine-laying sub U-C 97 was brought to the midwest on tour in the summer of 1919. ""The U-Boat was on tour. It was kind of a post-war, 'we won' tour, and so people got to go on to it and see it, and then as a condition of the armistice, it had to be sunk,"" Pritzker Military Library CEO Ken Clarke told ABC news. In June of 1921, the sub was sunk by the military. But in this case, the story declaring that a mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII was discovered in Great Lakes is made up.

Donald Trump's false claim that Nancy Pelosi 'came out in favor of MS-13'
","President Donald Trump cast Democrats as supporters of MS-13 gang members and uninterested in fighting crime. Trump routinely brings up brutal crimes committed by MS-13 members while highlighting his administration’s goal to incarcerate or deport them from the United States. At the May 22 Susan B. Anthony List’s Campaign for Life Gala, Trump claimed Democrats want open borders and don’t want to stop illegal immigration. ""And the other day — just the other day — Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of MS-13,"" Trump said. ""That’s the first time I’ve heard that. She wants them to be treated with respect, as do other Democrats."" Trump repeated the charge against House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on May 23 during a roundtable discussion on MS-13, saying: ""I noticed recently where Democrats, Nancy Pelosi as an example, are trying to defend MS-13 gang members. I called them animals the other day and I was met with rebuke. They said, ‘they are people.’ They are not people. These are animals."" We wondered about Trump’s claim that Pelosi ""came out in favor of MS-13"" and that she has defended gang members. Trump distorted the facts. Pelosi said ""calling people animals is not a good thing,"" but did not focus her comments on MS-13 gang members. Trump made headlines earlier this month after labeling some people who come to the United States as ""animals."" His comment came during an immigration meeting with California officials. While Trump did not specifically mention MS-13 gang members in the ""animals"" sentence, his statement came after a sheriff spoke about ""bad guys"" and MS-13 gang members. (Here’s the full context.) Some interpreted Trump as saying all immigrants are ""animals."" Trump went on Twitter May 18 to fight back that assessment: ""Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, ‘Animals.’ Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as ‘Animals,’ a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!"" Trump tweeted. Pelosi clearly chose the interpretation of Trump’s words at the roundtable that was least favorable to Trump. But that doesn’t mean she was embracing violent gang members. At a May 17 press conference, the day after Trump’s ""animals"" comment, Pelosi said ""calling people animals is not a good thing"" and defended ""undocumented immigrants."" She did not mention MS-13 gang members. Pelosi said ""we're all God's children"" and spoke about ""a spark of divinity in every person on Earth."" ""And so when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, ‘These aren't people. These are animals,’ you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person? ‘These are not people. These are animals.’ The president of the United States,"" Pelosi said. White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement, ""Pelosi either is peddling an out-of-context quote that mainstream media outlets have corrected or retracted (AP and CNN), or defending MS-13 gang members whose motto is rape, control, and kill."" The White House said the ""animals"" term is language Trump has used before when talking about MS-13 gang members. Still, Pelosi did not defend MS-13 gang members or come out in their favor, as Trump claimed. She centered her comments on ""undocumented immigrants"" and rebuked using the word ""animals"" to refer to people. Trump said Pelosi ""came out in favor of MS-13."" Trump’s claim is based on Pelosi’s criticism of Trump for using the word ""animals"" during an immigration meeting with California officials. Trump used that term after a sheriff spoke about MS-13 gang members. A day after Trump’s comment, Pelosi said ""calling people animals is not a good thing"" and defended ""undocumented immigrants.""

No, John Kerry is not headed to prison
","A story on Facebook said that former Secretary of State John Kerry is headed to prison for allegedly meeting with Iranian leaders in an attempt to save the nuclear agreement he helped broker during President Barack Obama’s administration. ""Just in: John Kerry facing prison,"" said the May 21 headline on Conservative Stories, a website that supports President Donald Trump. The website copied the story about Kerry from the Any Politics website. ""SHARE this story if you think John Kerry should be LOCKED UP!"" the story said. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Republican operatives have claimed that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris just days after Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the international accord. Trump had promised during the campaign to renegotiate the deal. As their supposed proof, operatives have pointed to a May 12 tweet of a photo by a lobbyist with the firm Turnberry Solutions that appeared to show Kerry walking near the trendy L’Avenue restaurant in the French capital’s Champs-Elysées neighborhood. ""So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians. A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting @realDonaldTrump. The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?"" Jason Osborne tweeted, referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act that requires Americans to disclose activities taken on behalf of foreign governments.   No Iranians were in the photo. But people produced other photos of Iranians, reportedly in Paris. An Iranian dissident named M. Hanif Jazayeri identified the photographed Iranians as former Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi and Iran's Ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi. To be clear, none of the photos showed Kerry and the Iranians together. The tweet followed reports about Kerry’s unsuccessful 11th hour bid to preserve a deal he played an instrumental role in crafting. Kerry was in Paris at the time his photo was allegedly taken, his office has told PolitiFact. But his team denied any Paris meeting with Iranians took place. What does this have to do with Kerry ""facing prison""? Trump and right-wing backers challenged Kerry’s actions as violating the 18th century Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to undermine U.S. foreign policy. The law says that the punishment for violating the act is a fine or imprisonment of not more than three years, or both. But the Conservative Stories website, which has no contact information, provided no actual evidence that Kerry was found in violation of the act and faces prison. Two University of Chicago Law professors, Daniel J. Hemel, and Eric A. Posner, wrote in the Lawfare blog in December that there are only two known instances in which individuals have been indicted for violating the Logan Act, the last of which came in 1853, and neither indictment resulted in conviction. The story said Kerry was caught ""blatantly commiting treason."" But again, the story provides no evidence beyond the photos. Treason is defined in the U.S. Constitution as consisting ""only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" Treason trials are rare in the U.S. So, to recap: Whether Kerry and the Iranians met is contended. As such; There is no evidence Kerry violated the Logan Act. And even if he did; Nobody has been convicted of violating the Logan Act, ever. A headline said ""Just in: John Kerry facing prison."" The story relies on a tweet that showed Kerry was in Paris -- that part is true. But the allegations that Kerry was meeting with Iranian officials in an attempt to salvage the international nuclear agreement are unproven. So saying he violated any law is nothing more than guesswork. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2018/may/24/conservative-stories/there-no-evidence-john-kerry-headed-prison/
"['Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Senate Majority PAC']","
Is Bill Nelson one of America's most independent senators?
","For weeks, Gov. Rick Scott has hammered incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson for voting with the most liberal members of Congress. But a new ad from a Democratic PAC supporting Nelson’s re-election bid portrays Nelson as an independent voice. ""He served his country as an Army captain and as an astronaut on the shuttle Columbia,"" the narrator says. ""And as one of America’s most independent senators, Bill Nelson has delivered for Florida."" Scott, expected to be Nelson’s toughest re-election challenger yet, has repeatedly tried to poke holes in this characterization — saying that Nelson moved closer in step with the Democratic Party in recent years, a departure from his earliest days in the House. Given the competing claims before voters, we wanted to get to the bottom of his record. Is Bill Nelson one of America’s most independent senators, as the Senate Majority PAC says? While it’s difficult if not impossible to define independence, multiple studies show Nelson voted against his party more so than other Democrats. However, other experts cautioned that a moderate or centrist voting record does not necessarily equate to being independent. As evidence of this claim, the Senate Majority PAC cited a Congressional Quarterly voting study from 2017. According to that study, Nelson voted with his party 88 percent of the time during 2017. Only Sens. Joe Donnelly, Susan Collins, Angus King, Claire McCaskill, Jon Tester, Mark Warner and Joe Manchin voted with their party less often, according to that analysis. (The lowest percentage was 64 percent, from Manchin.) ""In 2017, Nelson was tied with Senator (Tom) Carper in being ranked by CQ as the eighth-most independent senator,"" said spokesman Chris Hayden. Congressional Quarterly study didn’t actually rank the lawmakers by independence based on these findings. That’s just how political groups are framing it. Nelson has been in the Senate since 2001, so we wanted to take a longer view of his CQ average. The average of his CQ score for voting with the party is 89 percent. His lowest Senate scores came in 2002 and 2006, at 77 percent and 76 percent, respectively. His highest level of support was in 2013 and 2014, at 98 percent. Another analysis by voteview.com concluded Nelson was one of the most conservative Democrats while in office. (Political science experts have told PolitiFact Florida that voteview.com is the best site for mapping ideological locations for elected officials.) Session Vote View analysis 107th More conservative than 89 percent of Democrats 108th More conservative than 89 percent of Democrats 109th More conservative than 92 percent of Democrats 110th More conservative than 88 percent of Democrats 111th More conservative than 84 percent of Democrats 112th More conservative than 92 percent of Democrats 113th More conservative than 92 percent of Democrats 114th More conservative than 94 percent of Democrats 115th More conservative than 93 percent of Democrats The studies suggest Nelson votes with his party-line less than most other Democrats. But is that evidence he is ""one of America’s most independent senators?"" We reached out to several Florida political science experts for their take on the claim. One theme from their responses is that it’s hard to define and measure ""independence."" Steven Tauber, the director of the School of Interdisciplinary Global Studies at the University of South Florida, said ""independence"" is a subjective and multidimensional term. ""If we equate independence with a ‘moderate’ or ‘centrist’ legislative record, then I think it is definitely fair to say that on his legislative record, Nelson is one of the independent members of the Senate,"" he said. However, being moderate or centrist does not always equate to being ""independent."" ""To me, (independence) implies more than occasionally voting against one's party; it means speaking honestly and working with members of the other party on legislation,"" said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. ""These are measurable things, but I don't know if anyone has done it yet."" To bolster this idea, the Senate Majority PAC pointed to several newspaper editorials endorsing Nelson in his 2012 Senate run that touted his ability to work across the aisle. ""Sen. Nelson has repeatedly shown an ability to work across the aisle on Florida’s behalf, the kind of voice Florida needs in the Senate,"" the Miami Herald editorial board wrote in 2012. ""With Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, he successfully co-sponsored the legislation to ensure that NASA would remain committed to a space exploration program. And with former Republican Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida, he co-authored a bill to keep Florida’s beaches safe from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico."" The Fort Myers News-Press editorial said, ""(Nelson) has a history of bipartisan cooperation, which is fundamental right now as Americans demand an end to gridlock, which threatens to take Americans off a fiscal cliff, come the end of the year due to expiring tax cuts."" Nelson and fellow Republican Sen. Marco Rubio have worked together on numerous issues throughout the years. Most recently, the pair has co-authored letters regarding Puerto Rico, introduced a bill addressing the opioid epidemic and introduced legislation to proactively mitigate threats of violence at schools. Rubio has said he won’t campaign against Nelson but still supports Scott. Scott’s team has been watering down Nelson’s moderate image with claims that he has grown to be a definite party-line voter. To back this point up, Scott’s team compiled 28 years of party-unity voting data from Congressional Quarterly. That data shows Nelson started out voting an average of 50 percent in the 1980s with the Democratic party and now has voted with Democrats nearly 90 percent of the time for the past decade. The political environment has shifted substantially, to say the least, said Susan MacManus, a professor emeritus at the University of South Florida. It is isn’t just Nelson who has grown more partisan. ""The increase is natural,"" she said. ""Congress is more partisan."" The Senate Majority PAC said Nelson is ""one of America’s most independent senators."" There are multiple ways to conceptualize independence, so any claim stating that a lawmaker is independent requires context. If we liken independence with a ""moderate"" legislative record, then it is fair to say that on his legislative record, Nelson is one of the more independent Senate members. Analyses suggest Nelson voted with his party-line less than other Democrats. That said, experts cautioned there’s more that goes in to being an independent then just a moderate or centrist voting record — including having an open dialogue with both sides of the aisle, which can be hard to measure.

Schumer once opposed the Iran nuclear deal he now supports
","President Donald Trump posted on Twitter last week that Sen. Charles Schumer flip-flopped on the Iran nuclear deal. The tweet came two days after Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Obama deal — a move Schumer criticized. ""Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!"" Trump tweeted. ""Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that!"" Trump promised during his campaign to renegotiate the Iran deal, an agreement he opposed since its inception. Then-President Barack Obama announced the pact with five other countries and Iran to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for lighter sanctions in 2015. Is Trump right about Schumer’s record on the deal? Schumer in 2015 A spokesperson for Trump referred us to comments Schumer made about the Iran deal in 2015. Obama announced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran nuclear deal, in July of that year. The agreement did not require a vote from Congress because it wasn’t a trade deal. Past deals, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, had to be approved by Congress before they were implemented. Instead, Republicans who controlled the Senate introduced a measure to reject Obama’s deal. Schumer came out against the deal about a month before the Senate voted on the measure. In a statement, he said he would vote against the deal for three reasons: • The U.S. could not unilaterally demand inspections of Iran’s nuclear sites at any time. • Iran would have more resources to develop nuclear weapons after a decade of lighter sanctions, Schumer argued. As we’ve rated before, Iran was not free to build nuclear weapons after a decade. • Iran would also have more money to expand its influence in the region. The U.S. State Department has labeled the country a state sponsor of terrorism. Schumer wanted to keep the sanctions on Iran and pursue a different path to denuclearization. ""I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power,"" Schumer said. A few days after his break with Obama, Schumer said the U.S. ""should go back and try to get a better deal."" He voted to reject the nuclear agreement but Republicans in the Senate didn’t have enough votes to send the measure to Obama. Schumer was one of four Democrats to support it. When asked after the 2016 election if he would support leaving the deal with Trump as president, Schumer told POLITICO he wanted to see how it played out for a few years and that ""it would be wrong to repeal it now."" Schumer in 2018 Schumer has been critical of Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal he once opposed. A reporter asked him earlier this month if he supported leaving the deal based on his position in 2015. ""No. There are no reports that Iran has violated the agreement and to me, the greatest worries from Iran are not right now the nuclear side,"" Schumer said,""but rather what they’re doing in Syria, what they’re doing to arm Hezbollah with rockets."" Schumer said he wants the U.S. to work with its allies to curb Iran’s influence in the region while maintaining the country’s nuclear restrictions. He clarified his position on the Senate floor a few days later. ""Telling Iran, you continue giving missiles to Hezbollah, you continue sending troops to Iran, you continue your stuff with the Houthis, developing missiles, we’re going to put additional sanctions on you,"" Schumer said. ""That to me is the smartest thing to do."" Schumer also said he did not regret voting against the deal in 2015. ""I didn’t think the deal was a good deal. Proud I voted no,"" Schumer said. ""But at this time and this place for so many reasons, pulling out precipitously without our allies involved, does not achieve any of the goals we need to achieve and hurts Americans in different ways."" Our ruling Trump said Schumer wants to keep the U.S. in the Iran nuclear deal after opposing it three years ago. That’s all true. Schumer came out against the Iran deal and voted to reject it in 2015. He disagreed with Trump’s decision to leave the deal this month, saying the U.S. should have threatened Iran with tougher sanctions alongside the nuclear restrictions.

Race for Governor: Molinaro's record on taxes and spending
","Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, a Republican running for governor, wants to cut state spending and reduce taxes for New York state residents. That’s something he’s already done in his county, State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox said. ""He has really done very well in each of the offices he’s held, particularly as the county executive of Dutchess County, where he has cut taxes, his budget now is lower than it was six years ago,"" Cox said in a radio interview. Molinaro has been the top elected official in Dutchess County since 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Medicaid and unfunded mandates from the state that drive up local property taxes. He wants the state to shoulder more of the cost for those services. At the same time, he wants to cut state spending to keep state taxes low. Is Cox right that Molinaro has already cut spending and property taxes in Dutchess County? Property Taxes A spokesperson for Cox pointed to the county’s approved budgets while Molinaro’s been in office. This year’s budget in Dutchess County reduced both the county property tax rate for residents and the tax levy for the fourth consecutive year, according to budget documents. But his first two budgets increased property taxes by about 2 percent in 2013 and again in 2014. The lower tax rates and levies don’t mean property taxes have gone down for every resident in Dutchess County. Property tax bills are a combination of taxes levied by the county and each municipality. While the county’s tax levy has gone down, some local taxes may have increased. Property taxes levied by Poughkeepsie, for example, rose by 16.5 percent in 2017. Total spending Dutchess County spending, on the other hand, has gone up every year Molinaro has been in office. Total spending increased by about 6 percent between his first budget and 2017, according to the county's budget office. Total spending for 2018 won't be known until next year. Part of that is mandated spending by the state. Budget documents show the cost of mandated services has increased by close to $3 million since 2015.  Cox’s spokesperson said he was thinking about the county’s workforce when he said total spending was down in Dutchess County. Molinaro has approved cuts in the county workforce since taking office. Budget documents show the county planned to employ 1,753 full-time employees in 2018, down from 1,823 when Molinaro took office.  Our ruling Cox said Molinaro has cut taxes and spending as Dutchess County Executive. He’s right that county property taxes are lower. But spending has risen more than 6 percent since Molinaro's first budget. Cox’s claim is partially accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True. EDITOR'S NOTE: A previous version of this article used numbers from county budget documents to show changes in spending.

Rauner says Texas is more union job friendly than Illinois
","At a recent forum on workforce participation, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner claimed the state couldn’t give away, let alone sell, a shuttered auto plant in downstate Normal ""because our regulations are so hostile to business and our taxes are so high."" In fact, Rauner’s own administration last year lured a new tenant for the old Mitsubishi Motors factory, an electric car startup. That misrepresentation sparked a lot of controversy, but something else the governor said at the forum also caught our attention. He claimed laid-off Mitsubishi workers, all union members, told him they were moving to Texas. ""There’s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois, and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois. That’s where the opportunity is,"" Rauner said. Rauner has long attacked union power in Illinois as an impediment to the state’s economic vitality. Usually, however, he compares Illinois’ job growth to neighboring Indiana, which like Texas is also a so-called right-to-work state where union membership can’t be compelled. That got us wondering: Is Rauner right that the job picture is brighter for union members in Texas? And why is he now pointing to the Lone Star state, with an energy-rich economy that has little in common with Illinois, instead of Indiana next door? Rauner often complains that pro-union, anti-business policies of Illinois Democrats have worked to the advantage of other neighboring states, especially Indiana. ""They’re kicking our tails,"" is a frequent refrain. But new data have rendered such comparisons problematic, making Texas a more appealing focus despite vast differences from Illinois in economy and population. In 2017, while Illinois saw a modest gain in its unionized workforce, Indiana lost more than 37,000 union jobs, according to data from Unionstats.com, a long-running tally of federally compiled employment numbers for union workers created by professors at Georgia State University and Trinity University. What’s more, other federal data show Illinois workers employed in the manufacturing sector — the closest approximation to Rauner’s reference to factory workers — make an average $9,200 more per year than their counterparts in Indiana. A Rauner spokeswoman did not respond to our questions about why the governor in his recent talk stressed comparisons with Texas and not Indiana or other neighboring right-to-work states. She did, however, point us to U.S. Census Bureau data showing that Texas in 2017 added more than 52,000 private-sector union jobs while Illinois lost over 9,000. The distinction between private-sector versus total union jobs, however, was not one made by Rauner during the event. As for pay, his spokeswoman noted that other federal data show manufacturing workers in Texas make, on average, $100-a-week more than their Illinois counterparts. In the strictest sense, then, Rauner’s assertions about Texas pan out. But labor experts cautioned against drawing conclusions about employment opportunity based solely on the number of union jobs gained or lost. Robert Bruno, director of the the labor education program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it’s important to bear in mind the vast difference in scale between Illinois and Texas, which has more than twice the population and more than twice the overall workforce. Texas is adding more union jobs because it’s adding more jobs period and is much bigger than Illinois, not because it’s more union-friendly, Bruno said. ""Some of (those jobs) happened to be union jobs and as a result, they're added to the roll,"" Bruno said. ""They don't indicate that you're in a workforce where workers found it easy and doable to join a union."" Indeed, less than 5 percent of the total Texas workforce is comprised of union members, a share no higher than it was a decade ago despite growth in the number of union jobs, according to Unionstats. In Illinois, the comparable figure was 15 percent, up slightly over the last decade. ""Your chance of finding a union job is going to be much greater in a state that has twice the percentage of union employers, twice the percent of union members and one half the size of the labor force than if you jump into this enormous pool in Texas,"" Bruno said. Another key point the governor leaves out: what’s behind Texas’ surging union employment figures. Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., said Texas’ gains in manufacturing employment are largely a byproduct of its booming energy sector, an artifact of geological luck that Illinois and most other states can’t match. And energy jobs also tend to pay more than other manufacturing jobs. ""When you're a state like Texas that's growing manufacturing, industrial jobs — natural gas, pipelines, refineries — those jobs are likely to be unionized and they’re going to be expanding,"" said Hicks, who tracks job trends in the Midwest. While making a point about Illinois’ business climate, Rauner said ""there’s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois."" His office sent us data indicating Texas grew more union jobs, and at a faster clip, than did Illinois. It also pointed to federal data showing manufacturing workers in Texas made $100 more per week on average than their Illinois counterparts. But such numbers belie the fact that Illinois couldn’t be Texas if it tried. The more populous state has grown its manufacturing — and therefore, its union — jobs thanks to a booming economy that’s received a major boost from its oil and gas industry, something Illinois thanks to its geography and geology simply doesn’t have. And despite a stalled economy in Illinois, union workers still make up a greater share of the workforce in Illinois than they do in Texas, which, according to labor expert Robert Bruno, is a more accurate indicator of employment opportunity for those seeking a union job.

False meme suggests Texas rapper faces death penalty but Santa Fe school shooter does not
","A U.S. Supreme Court ruling keeps the admitted shooter in a Santa Fe, Texas, school from facing the death penalty. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, would have had to be 18 to qualify. Still, a meme brought to our attention by readers suggests he's getting a special lift up. The meme shows an African-American 17-year-old Texas rapper, Taymore ""Tay-K 47"" McIntyre, and says that he faces the death penalty if convicted of capital charges pending against him. Meantime, the meme says, Pagourtzis--who admitted to the May 18, 2018, mass shooting at Santa Fe High School that killed 10 and wounded at least 10 others, according to court documents--faces no death penalty plus ""parole in 40 years."" Rapper T.I. recently shared the meme on his Instagram, saying, ""So the question is how is the D.A. seeking the death penalty for Tay K & not the other guy?"" T.I. went on to note that McIntyre is a minor, like Pagourtzis. They’re ""the same age!!!!!!,"" T.I. wrote. According to a May 10, 2018, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story, McIntyre has been charged in two capital murders — one in Mansfield and one in San Antonio — as well as in an aggravated robbery that left an Arlington, Texas, man seriously injured. The story said he remained in jail. After the Santa Fe shootings, the Houston Chronicle, a Houston TV station and the Star-Telegram each declared that the disparity for capital crime convictions suggested by the meme lacks factual footing because of the 2005 Supreme Court ruling. To get our fix on the meme’s accuracy, we turned first to the court decision. Supreme Court acts On March 1, 2005, the court held by 5-4 that the Constitution’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment means the death penalty could no longer be imposed on juvenile offenders under 18. The Eighth Amendment provides: ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."" The ruling, in Roper vs. Simmons, stemmed in part, the majority wrote, from 30 states already prohibiting the juvenile death penalty. The ruling removed 72 people from death rows in a dozen states, according to a March 2005 news story in the New York Times, and ""represented an about-face for a court that only 16 years ago rejected the argument that the execution of those who kill at the age of 16 or 17 violated"" the constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishments. By phone, Sarah Guidry, who directs the Earl Call Institute for Legal and Social Policy at Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law, said that after the high court acted, Texas lawmakers amended state law. Section 8.07(c) of the state’s penal code states: ""No person may, in any case, be punished by death for an offense committed while the person was younger than 18 years."" Before the Supreme Court ruled, Texas was among 12 states with juveniles on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that compiles information and statistics about the death penalty. From 1976 until the court acted, the center says, 22 defendants were executed for crimes committed as juveniles. By phone, the center’s Robert Dunham told us 13 of the death penalties were carried out in Texas. Dunham, calling the meme false, said the Roper ruling left no room for states to sentence to death any individuals younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. By phone, Texas state senators versed in criminal justice told us the court’s ruling in Roper means no juvenile can be sentenced to death. Sen. Juan ""Chuy"" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the ruling ""changed the lay of the land when it came to the death penalty and juveniles."" Parole in 40 years? Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, vice chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, said state law otherwise backs up the meme’s indication that Pagourtzis could be imprisoned yet paroled after 40 years. That's so, she said, thanks to legislative action in the wake of a June 2012 Supreme Court ruling. The majority opinion in Miller v. Alabama states: ""By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment."" In 2013, Texas lawmakers reacted to the ruling by passing into law a measure mandating that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. Previously, juveniles 17 to 18 convicted of capital offenses faced life-without-parole sentences. We asked Dunham to speak to the parole part of the meme. He cautioned that Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years; the law doesn’t say anyone automatically gets paroled. Summing up, Dunham said: ""If you are age 17, the most you can get for capital murder in Texas is life with the possibility of parole after 40 years."" Our ruling A meme suggests a Texas rapper charged with capital offenses faces the death penalty while the alleged shooter in the Santa Fe school faces prison only and then parole after 40 years -- even though both are 17. That disparity isn’t backed up by state laws which, in compliance with Supreme Court rulings, potentially subject both the rapper and the alleged school shooter to sentences of life in prison with parole possible after 40 years. U.S. juveniles haven’t been subject to death sentences since the high court ruled out that prospect in 2005. We rate this meme False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Did ex-intelligence chief Clapper say FBI spied on Trump campaign? No
","President Donald Trump has hinted that the Obama administration inserted a mole in his presidential campaign to undercut his candidacy. In an early morning tweet, he offered what seemed to be proof, from none other than former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. In a tweet, Trump appeared to quote Clapper as saying, ""Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign."" Trump followed that with,  ""No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!"" “Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign” No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot! Whatever people might think amounts to spying (and we wrote that there’s no agreed-upon definition), Clapper didn’t say what Trump claimed. Clapper said the opposite. Clapper was interviewed May 22 on ABC News’ The View. Here’s the exchange with co-host Joy Behar: Behar: ""I ask you, was the FBI spying on Trump's campaign?"" Clapper: ""No, they were not. They were spying on — a term I don't particularly like —  but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage and influence which is what they do."" Behar: ""Well, why doesn't he like that? He should be happy."" Clapper: ""He should be."" The White House press office confirmed that Trump was referring to Clapper’s ABC interview. But that wasn’t the only time Clapper addressed the question of spying. Clapper repeated his point the same day in an interview on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360. ""The objective here was actually to protect the campaign by determining whether the Russians were infiltrating it and attempting to exert influence,"" Clapper said. After Trump's tweet, Clapper said May 23 on CNN it was ""a distortion of what I said."" The FBI’s guidelines say direct investigation of a campaign should only come after a high-level review. ""It is not invariably illegal to spy on a campaign or people in it,"" said Robert Litt, former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence. ""The question is, why are you doing it? Are you doing it for legitimate investigative purposes – for example if you have information that people in the campaign are engaged in criminal activity – or is your purpose to glean information that you would provide to the candidate’s opponents for political use?"" Trump said that Clapper had affirmed that the FBI had spied on the Trump campaign. That does not reflect Clapper’s words. In two separate interviews Clapper said that the FBI was looking for Russian interference in the election with the aim of protecting the campaign. He specifically said that the FBI had not spied on the campaign. Trump turned Clapper’s statements upside down and for that, we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/may/23/donald-trump/did-ex-intelligence-chief-clapper-say-fbi-spied-tr/

Senate Democrats flub stat on increase of gas prices this year
","  Cable news is focused on the investigations surrounding President Donald Trump, but there’s an issue of intense interest to many Americans that has gotten relatively little media play recently — a rise in prices at the pump. On May 23, Senate Democrats tried to change the media narrative by holding a news event at a gas station near Capitol Hill. The Senate Democrats’ collective Twitter account documented the event. The account posted a Spanish-language tweet featuring a clip of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., talking about high gasoline prices and placing the blame on Trump. The Spanish-language text says: ""El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año. Los analistas dicen que el presidente tiene la culpa. Gracias @realDonaldTrump."" In English, that translates as: ""The price of gas has increased 25% this year. Analysts say the president is to blame. Thanks, Trump."" (Menendez, speaking in Spanish in the tweet’s uploaded video clip, didn’t use those exact words and didn’t cite a percentage increase.) So is the tweet correct that gas prices are up 25 percent since the start of the year? Not quite. While prices have increased, they haven’t risen by that much. We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal statistical clearinghouse. We found that retail gasoline prices were $2.52 a gallon on Jan. 1, 2018, and rose to $2.92 on May 21, 2018. That’s an increase of 15.9 percent — a distinct bump, but smaller than the tweet had said. When we looked at crude oil prices, the increase was a bit larger than for gasoline but still not 25 percent. On Jan. 2, 2018, crude was $60.37 a barrel and on May 21 it was $72.26. That’s an increase of 19.7 percent. Sandy Fielden, a commodities analyst at Morningstar Inc., told thestreet.com in late April that Trump may be at least a partial cause of the price rise, citing threats of a trade war with China, heightened tensions in the Middle East, and the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal, Fielden said. ""All these bearish factors pushing prices higher are arguably directly caused by Trump administration policies,"" Fielden told the website. Trump’s suggestion that the OPEC oil-producing companies may be to blame for higher prices ""is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black."" After we inquired with the Democratic Senate leadership, the tweet was deleted and a replacement was posted. The new tweet’s caption stuck closely to Menendez’ wording in the video, saying, ""El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente."" (That translates as, ""The price of gasoline keeps rising and rising. And it is, to a large extent, due to the president's policies."") The Democratic staff on the Senate Finance Committee subsequently told PolitiFact that the 25 percent figure stemmed from a ""math error"" and has since corrected the report it came from. El precio de gasolina sigue subiendo y subiendo. Y es por consecuencia, en gran parte, de la política del presidente. pic.twitter.com/yLbrmBwtxR The original version of the tweet said, ""El precio de combustible ha aumentado un 25% este año,"" which translates as, ""The price of gas has increased 25% this year."" Gas prices have risen, but not by that much — 15.9 percent, rather than 25 percent. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/may/23/senate-democrats/have-gas-prices-soared-25-year/
