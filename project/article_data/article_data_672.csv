Rick Perry says loan program he oversaw wasn't bailed out by state of Texas
","
In the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was asked to account for a loan program he oversaw as the state’s agriculture commissioner, the elected post he held from 1991 through 1998.

Neil Cavuto of Fox News noted that Perry wants Congress to stop spending so much. 
""But as Texas agriculture commissioner, you oversaw a loan guarantee program that, as the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time, had so many defaults that the state had to stop guaranteeing bank loans to start-ups in the agribusiness, and eventually bailed out the program with the taxpayer money,"" Cavuto said. ""So aren't you guilty of the same behavior you rail against as a presidential candidate?""

Perry replied: ""Number one, don't believe everything you read in the Austin American-Statesman. And the second side of it is, we had that program put in place, and the state did not bail (it) out; those programs worked as they were supposed to work. Just like in any bank or any business, you are going to have some that fail.""

No bailout?

As agriculture commissioner, Perry oversaw the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority, which was created in 1987. The authority was launched to boost the agricultural economy by selling state-backed bonds to guarantee bank loans to entrepreneurs who could not get commercial loans. The goal was to create small businesses and jobs by processing — rather than simply growing — Texas agricultural products.

A revamped version continues today. The authority’s Agricultural Loan Guarantee program provides loan guarantees to lenders for eligible applicants who wish to establish or enhance their farm and/or ranch operation or an agriculture-related business. According to the Texas Department of Agriculture, applicants may seek a loan of any amount from their local lender, but the guarantee may not exceed $750,000 or 70 percent of the loan amount, whichever is less. Other offerings include a young farmer grant and interest-rate reduction programs.

From 1997 through 1999, the Texas state auditor alerted officials to problems in the program, with the problems growing each successive year.

Responding to the first hint of problems, Perry said the program was positioned to thrive. In a Jan. 15, 1998, guest column in the Amarillo Daily News, Perry said the program was ""on solid footing with a positive balance projected by 2010."" He noted too that the loans were funded by debt — commercial paper: ""No taxpayer money has ever been used to make TAFA loans.""

In May 1999, though, the auditor’s office warned that if the program’s loan-guarantee program did ""not improve its financial position, appropriations may be required in the future to meet its general obligation debt."" The auditor said the loan-guarantee program had a ""negative fund equity"" of $6.9 million through August 1998 because 22 of 83 loans had defaulted since 1993. ""An additional $4.5 million, associated with loans currently in default, may have to be written off,"" the auditor said.

""Because it provides loans that otherwise would not be made, the authority has had difficulty attracting good loans to act as a buffer against its riskier loans,"" the auditor said. ""A certain volume of good loans is needed to ensure that losses are offset and that the programs are self-sustaining; however, the authority has not yet developed financial projections to identify that volume.""

As bad debt accumulated, the agency in 2002 put a moratorium on new loans in five of eight TAFA programs. As of the end of August 2008, the agency later reported, TAFA had $25 million in outstanding debt with only $6.4 million in loans and $4.1 million in cash available to service the debt.

In 2009, the agency asked the Texas Legislature to pay off the loan guarantees with a $14.7 million appropriation. An April 24, 2009, Statesman news article says the authority’s bad loans had been pronounced uncollectable.

At the time, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples told the newspaper in an interview that the authority had distributed about $82 million in loans through the program’s suspension in 2002. Some loans worked out, Staples said, and a study showed the program had created jobs, but Staples acknowledged that the $14.7 million in defaults -- about 18 percent of the total amount lent -- represented a dismal track record.

""It's bad,"" Staples said. ""Unfortunately, taxpayers are on the hook for something that happened as long ago as 1987.""

According to records, the authority’s first bad loans were written off in August 1995. Twenty-nine of 102 guaranteed loans defaulted, almost all of them during Perry's tenure, according to the records, which were provided to the Statesman by the agriculture department.

As governor, Perry signed the program’s infusion of aid into law by approving the 2010-11 state budget sent to him by lawmakers. A provision specifies that $14.7 million is appropriated to ""retire the debt of the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority,"" which was restructured by a separate measure.

We asked Perry’s campaign about his no-bailout debate statement and didn’t hear back. Asked to describe the 2009 spending, Bryan Black, a spokesman for the agriculture department, called the action a ""one-time state appropriation to pay off the debt.""

Our sense? Taxpayers picked up built-up costs that otherwise could not be covered. It seems reasonable to call that expenditure a bailout.

Further, Perry’s contention there was no bailout runs counter to his signing the spending into law -- making his debate claim ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/dec/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-loan-program-he-oversaw-wasnt-bail/

Tim Kaine says George Allen cast ""the deciding vote"" for 2003 Bush tax cuts
","
Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine recently took a swipe at his likely Republican opponent, George Allen for supporting tax cuts passed under former President George W. Bush.

Kaine charged the tax breaks have exacerbated the country’s deficit, and he argued Allen shared the blame for that.

""These (Bush) tax cuts were put in place, I believe in 2003. George (Allen) was the deciding vote for them to be put in place,"" Kaine said during a Dec. 7 debate between the two candidates.

Did Allen cast the pivotal vote on whether those tax cuts went into effect? We decided to check.

The Bush era tax cuts were enacted in two phases.

The first phase, in 2001, lowered income tax rates, levies on estates, and rebated money to tax filers. The package, projected to cost $1.35 trillion over 10 years, easily passed the Senate by a 58-33 vote with Allen’s support.

The second phase, in 2003, lowered taxes on stock dividends and long-term capital gains, among other provisions. The package, projected to cost $350 billion over six years, passed by the slimmest of margins in the Senate.

Allen was among 48 Republican senators and two Democrats who voted in favor of the bill. On the other end, 46 Democrats, three Republicans and one independent voted against it. That led to a 50-50 split.

Vice President Dick Cheney, a Republican, cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate and the measure passed, 51-50.

So did Allen have the deciding vote?

Yes, said Michael Kelly, a spokesman for the Kaine campaign. He said if Allen had voted against the 2003 tax cuts, they would have failed by a 51-49 Senate vote.

We read news articles that ran the day after the vote in The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer. They all prominently stated that Cheney cast the tie-breaking vote. None of them mentioned Allen.

Our Conclusion:

Kaine said Allen cast ""the deciding vote"" in passing the 2003 package of Bush tax cuts.

It’s true that Allen’s support helped lead to a 50-50 split, setting up a tie-breaking vote for the tax cuts by Vice President Cheney. And Kaine accurately argues that had Allen voted differently, the legislation would have failed.

But the outcome would have been altered if any of the 50 senators who supported the tax cuts  had voted differently. And we can add Cheney, who broke the tie. That brings us to 51 people who, by Kaine’s rationale, cast ""the deciding vote.""  

Let’s compare the scenario to a basketball game that’s tied, 50-50, after four quarters of play and won, by one point, on a dramatic shot at the end of overtime by a player named Jones. Fans would marvel at how Jones’ shot won the game. But Kaine, under his logic, could attribute the ‘‘deciding’’ basket to anyone who scored for the winning team, including Smith, who sank a free throw in the second quarter.

It would be misleading to spread word that Smith hit the the game winner. It is similarly misleading for Kaine to claim Allen cast the ""deciding vote"" on the 2003 tax cuts when Cheney broke the tie at the end. We rate Kaine’s statement False.

Do 77 percent of Portland's elementary school students really graduate without taking an art class?
","These are hard times for Oregon schools -- budgets are tight, teachers are being laid off and class sizes are increasing.

The Creative Advocacy Network, a group that seeks to expand access to the arts, added to that list early this month with a tweet that ""77% of Portland's students finish elementary school without taking even one art class.""

We loved art class back in the day, so this tweet took us by surprise. Was it true that the vast majority of the city’s students went through elementary school without an art class?

We phoned the Creative Advocacy Network to see how the staff had arrived at their figures. The executive director, Jessica Jarratt Miller, laid it out for us. The group called around to the six area school districts (Centennial, David Douglas, Parkrose, Portland, Reynolds and Riverdale) and got two pieces of information: The number of students in each of those districts’ elementary schools (kindergarten through fifth grade) and then the number of dedicated visual arts teachers in those schools.

If a school had even one art teacher -- heck, even a part-time art teacher -- staff counted those students as having had an art class. When they tallied up the number of students who went to a school with an art teacher, they found they accounted for only 23 percent of the students in Portland schools. (A quick aside: They didn’t count charter schools.)

We decided to replicated their investigation. First we got enrollment figures for the six districts from the Oregon Department of Education. The department also gave us the number visual art teachers in each of those districts. To be sure we had the teacher figure right, we compared that to the information the arts group had used and also called around to the districts for confirmation.

Our numbers differed slightly from the art group’s, but we came pretty close. We found that Portland had the equivalent of 12.5 art teachers. Reynolds and Riverdale had one each, though Riverdale’s wasn’t full time. David Douglas and Centennial had none.

After we’d sorted that out, we looked at the number of students attending a school that employed an art teacher. We found that number at just 20 percent -- even lower than what the art group initially estimated. (They later revised down their number as well.)

The percentage, then, squared pretty closely with what the group had reported.

That seemed fine and good, but we still weren’t sure about the statement. We wanted to get some thoughts from state and local education officials.

First up, we spoke with Christine Miles, the spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Education. ""That's a pretty broad statement,"" she said. ""Our kids are exposed to visual arts, even though we may not have the money for a specialty visual arts instructor. A lot of regular teachers do put a lot of work into their art curriculum for their students. And some may not.""

Next, we called Portland Public Schools. That district educates the vast majority of elementary school students in the city of Portland and, according to the methodology used above, 72 percent of their students go to schools without dedicated art teachers.

Erin Hoover Barnett, a spokeswoman for the district, echoed much of what Miles said, and added a personal twist. Hoover Barnett has a child a Rieke Elementary School, one of the schools that has no art teacher.

During his two years at Rieke, she said, her son has been exposed to collage making, poster projects, puppetry and sculpture among other visual arts.

""He gets a lot of art in his curriculum. All of our teachers work to integrate some art into the work they do,"" she said. ""There's no question that in the best-case scenario we would have a licensed art educator in front of all our elementary school students. But we're not in that position with our budget and the way we're funded by our state.""

Hoover Barnett said teachers work the material into the curriculum, parents visit classes to share their expertise and outside groups bring artists into classrooms. ""It's become a community effort to get our kids what they need,"" she said.

We’d asked Miller, the art group’s director, about some of these programs at the outset of our fact check. ""We can really value and celebrate the kinds of community programs that come into schools,"" she said, but it’s not the same as having a certified art teacher available to students.

Miller also pointed out a 2011 report by the Oregon Arts Commission that looked at art education statewide. One of the big takeaways from that report was that 20 percent of Oregon’s public schools ""did not offer any regular, stand-alone arts courses"" and that nearly 10 percent of all students ""attended a school with no access to arts instruction.""

That brings us to our ruling. In an effort to draw some attention to the lack of arts education at the elementary school level, the Creative Advocacy Network tweeted a pretty shocking statistic: 77 percent of all Portland elementary school children graduate without having taken one art class.

They based this statement on the fact that most schools don’t employee dedicated art teachers. The statement is true but needs some context. Students throughout Portland -- and Oregon -- are being exposed to visual arts in different ways through different programs.

We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/16/creative-advocacy-network/do-77-percent-portlands-elementary-school-students/

Michele Bachmann claims Newt Gingrich promised support for abortion proponents
","
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann says that, as president, she will be ""100 percent pro-life from conception until natural death."" And she says the same can’t be said of her opponents.

In a Republican presidential primary debate in Sioux City, Iowa, on Dec. 15, 2011, Bachmann attacked front-runner Newt Gingrich, the former U.S. House speaker, for his past actions on abortion. She said he passed on a chance to defund Planned Parenthood, then lobbed this bombshell:

""And also I think even more troubling, when he was in Washington, D.C., he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who are in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion,"" Bachmann said.

Did we hear that right? The man who led the Republican takeover of Congress and authored the conservative Contract with America said he’d campaign for late-term abortion proponents? This called for a fact check.

The background

In 1998, when Gingrich was speaker, a feud erupted within the Republican National Committee over a proposal to cut off funding for any Republican candidate who refused to support a ban on partial-birth abortion, a procedure involving the extraction of a late-term fetus.

Republicans in Congress had failed to get a ban enacted -- President Bill Clinton had vetoed two measures. So GOP leaders sought to ensure that any Republican who got elected would support the ban.

But many in the party -- Gingrich among them -- objected to the funding cut, saying the approach would ""set an unhealthy precedent -- the party hierarchy trying to dictate to rank and file voters whom they should elect and why,"" according to the Boston Globe.

Gingrich spoke at a luncheon during the RNC’s winter meeting in California on Jan. 16, 1998. Here are excerpts of his remarks on the subject:

""Let me make very clear I have voted to ban partial births. I have consistently sided with Henry Hyde and Chris Smith on issues that are matters of right to life. I believe deeply and passionately in the right to life, and I think those of us who believe that have an obligation to do all we can.

""I am also the Republican speaker of the House, and I can tell you that Henry Hyde would not be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Orrin Hatch would not be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee if the Republican Party decides that we are no longer a broad party that invites people who broadly share our views, but we are going to start going down a road where we start limiting who people get to pick in primaries. After all, it is the voters of America who choose who the nominees are. It is the voters of America who have a right -- some places they are going to pick people who are to my right; some places they are going to pick people who are to my left.

""And in both cases, if they are the Republican nominee, I am going to actively campaign for them, because when they get to Congress, whether they are a moderate Republican from the Northeast, whether they are a very conservative Republican from the South or West -- whatever their background, I am going to turn to them and say, ‘This is the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- of course you are going to vote to make him chairman.’""

He called the funding ban a ""tactical mistake"" because it pulled focus from Clinton’s vetoes.

""The country doesn't think it makes any sense to have children killed in the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth months, particularly killed in this horrible, barbaric procedure. That's where the attention was focused, on the president's veto. And we should go back,"" Gingrich said.

The funding ban failed on a voice vote in the RNC. A substitute amendment, saying that the party ""reaffirms its principled opposition to partial-birth abortions and commits to banning this heinous procedure from America forever,"" passed instead.

When we contacted the Bachmann campaign, a spokeswoman sent us a press release that included this quote from an Associated Press story dated a week after the RNC meeting.

""Gingrich said he opposes the ‘barbaric’ abortion procedure, and would continue to vote to ban it. But he argued that the resolution was the wrong way to eliminate partial-birth abortions. ‘We don’t want to say to that the Republican National Committee is going to say to the primary voters of Charlotte, the primary voters of Greensboro, the primary voters of Columbia, S.C., if you pick the wrong person, we’re not going to support you,’ Gingrich said. ‘I think there’s a certain arrogance in saying (RNC members) nationally are now going to dictate in the primaries in every part of the country,’ he said.""

Our ruling

Bachmann said of Gingrich, ""When he was in Washington, D.C., he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion.""

She correctly stated what Gingrich told the RNC in 1998. She even used his exact words to describe partial-birth abortion, calling it a ""barbaric procedure."" Gingrich said he was being a pragmatist in order to maintain a majority in Congress so that it could successfully ban the procedure. He said he’d campaign for all Republicans, even those to the left of him, because he didn’t think party leaders should be ""purging"" Republican candidates and dictating to voters whom they should choose.

Bachmann left out that context and thus, gave an incomplete impression of Gingrich’s position. Given all that, we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/16/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-newt-gingrich-promised-sup/

Department of Fish and Wildlife says there have been no wolf-related deaths in the Rockies
","
The story of OR-7, the young gray wolf who has settled in southwest Oregon after a 750-mile trek, has captured headlines around the world. He’s also reignited local debates about the place for wolves in rural communities, and their potential threat to people and livestock.

In a recent article in The Oregonian, Michelle Dennehy, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, spoke some about those risks.

""Wolves have attacked and killed people in Canada and Alaska,"" Dennehy told The Oregonian. ""It is extremely rare and has never happened in the Rocky Mountain states, but we advise people to keep your distance from wolves and any wild animals.""

Oregon is home to an estimated 24 wolves, a small population. But a 2010 reportby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountain population (which includes Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon) at more than 1,650.

This got us wondering whether it could be true that there have been no documented cases of run-ins with wolves in that fairly large area. Plus, we’re always looking for a change of pace.

We started where we always start: the source. Dennehy pointed us to a 2002 report from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research called ""The fear of wolves: A review of wolf attacks on humans.""

Because ""the vast majority"" of global wolf research happens in North America, the report says, wolf attacks in Canada and the U.S. have been extremely well documented. That documentation -- and the fact that attacks are so rare -- allowed the authors to detail every attack in the past century.

All told, the study’s authors found 18 wolf attacks in North America -- 12 in Canada and six in the U.S. Of the attacks in the U.S., four occurred in Alaska (as did an unspecified number of small incidents along a road where truckers had taken to feeding the wolves) and two in Minnesota, in which the victims weren’t injured. Two of the attacks in Alaska left the victim dead of rabies. Both of those happened in the 1940s.

Dennehy also sent us a news clip from a paper up in Saskatchewan that detailed the 2005 deathof a young Ontario student who was on a walk near a Saskatchewan mining camp when he was attacked and killed. A sad story to be sure, but one that happened a ways away from the Rocky Mountains.

We try to be thorough, so we also placed a call to the International Wolf Center, an organization that tries to advance the survival of wolves through education.

We spoke to Jess Edberg, who is based in Ely, Minnesota. Minnesota has the most robust wolf population outside of Alaska.

""Overall, in North America and around the world, a wolf attack on humans is very rare,"" Edberg said. ""In the lower 48, we haven't had any attacks on humans.""
She added that many of the attacks that do occur often involve sick animals or animals who had been fed or allowed to become accustomed to humans.

Edberg did point out the Alaska Department of Fish and Game had recently concluded that a woman found dead in 2010 on the Alaska Peninsula was killed by wolves.

Finally, she sent us looking for two studies on wolves. One report, which shared an author with the first Norwegian report, looked at Scandinaviaand found that over the past 300 years, 94 people have been killed by wolves. All of those cases, the report found, were before 1882 and most were children under the age of 12.

The second, more pertinent report, done in 2002, by Mark E McNay for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game looked at wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada and found that ""despite (a) large and widely distributed wolf population, no human deaths have been attributed to wild, healthy wolves since at least 1900, and biting incidents or bluff charges are rare enough to warrant publication in scientific journals.""

Of course, that report was published before the two deaths we mentioned above.

Still, the reports support Dennehy and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. There’s no evidence that a wolf has attacked a human in the Rocky Mountain states, let alone killed one. We rate this claim True.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Obama has ""racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined.""
","
During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy and the federal budget.

""We all understand that the spending crisis is extraordinary, with $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that’s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined.""

If this sounds familiar, it is: It’s a variation on a claim we’ve addressed before.

Romney said something similar at a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., on June 27, 2011. Romney said that Obama ""is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined."" We rated the statement Mostly True.

But the second statement won’t get the same rating, for a couple of reasons.

Type of debt being measured

There are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities.
   
The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future.

In June, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us that the candidate was referring to debt held by the public, so we used that for our measurements. But Romney’s comment from the Sioux City debate was less clear. In the debate, Romney initially said the nation is ""$15 trillion now in debt."" That’s a measure of gross federal debt -- which is not the measurement he’d been using in previous statements.

We were confused about how to proceed, so we checked with the Romney camp. They confirmed that Romney was basing his comparison on public debt. That clarifies our assignment, but it does mean that Romney offered contradictory information in making his debt comparison.

Time frame

In the earlier statement at the New Hampshire roundtable, Romney was pretty clear that he was talking about how much Obama will have added ""by the end of his first term."" By contrast, the more recent statement from Sioux City lacks that qualifier, and instead makes it sound like Romney was referring to the amount of debt Obama has racked up so far in his term. The extra year or more in Obama’s first term adds enough debt to make a significant difference in the result.

To analyze Romney’s comparison requires determining the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama’s first term. This is not as easy as it sounds.
   
Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who ""owns"" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush’s term, and it does not really bear Obama’s imprint.

When judging Romney’s claim from the Sioux City debate -- how much debt has accumulated so far during Obama’s term -- we believe that there are three plausible date ranges:
   
-- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Dec. 14, 2011 (the day before the Sioux City debate)
-- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama’s inauguration) to Dec. 14, 2011
-- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Dec. 14, 2011
   
We are able to calculate the debt figures using the U.S. Department of Treasury’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator. Here are the public debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above:
   
* End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined.

* Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined.

* End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined.

What’s the meaning of ""almost""?

In the Sioux City debate -- but not the New Hampshire roundtable -- Romney gave himself some breathing room by inserting the word ""almost."" But what he meant by that ""almost"" is not so obvious.

In the actual quote, Romney places ""almost"" before ""every president."" We’re not quite sure how one would define ""almost every president"" -- do you drop George W. Bush, who accumulated a lot of debt, or William Henry Harrison, who died a few weeks into his term? If you subtract George W. Bush from the calculation, it's a very favorable way to calculate it from Romney’s perspective, and in fact for one of the measurements -- comparing the accumulated debt level at the start of fiscal 2001 to what Obama has added so far, Obama’s figure is higher.

But when we talked to the Romney camp, they said that the candidate had actually meant to say, ""almost as much debt as."" So how does that formulation mesh with our math above?

Under the first of our three scenarios, the debt under Obama has increased by about 78 percent of the amount it rose under the previous 43 presidents. That’s off by more than 20 percent. The other two scenarios don’t come that close. For the second scenario, it’s 65 percent, and for the third, it’s 38 percent.

An additional point that affects all comparisons of this sort: Because of the effects of inflation, it’s not entirely fair to compare debt accumulated today to debt accumulated in the time of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt. But neutralizing that problem isn’t easy, so we won’t do anything beyond noting the issue.

Our ruling

Romney was trying to revive a talking point -- that by the end of his first term, Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined -- that was accurate enough to earn a Mostly True from PolitiFact. This time, though, he allowed small but significant changes to creep in and weaken its accuracy.

Romney confused public debt and gross debt; he failed to clarify that he was talking about the debt accruing during the entirety of Obama’s first term; and he misplaced the word ""almost"" in a way that makes it hard to parse his claim. If we use the public debt figure and put the word ""almost"" where the Romney campaign says it should be, ""almost"" might apply to one of three comparisons -- one in which the debt is about four-fifths of the way to equalling totals under previous presidents. That’s a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-has-racked-much-debt-almost/

Nevada is No. 1 in unemployment, divorce and violent crime, Florida chamber claims
","
As the January 2012 state legislative session draws near, supporters and opponents are organizing to make their voices heard about a proposed bill that would allow three massive casino resorts in South Florida.
   
On Dec. 8, 2011, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- both Republicans -- held a press conference with opponents to publicly denounce the gambling bill.
   
In an article about that press conference posted on WTSP 10 News, a Tampa Bay station, Mark Wilson, the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, piped up about his opposition, too.
   
The report paraphrased Wilson as saying that the casinos would take money away from existing businesses and lead to other problems. He pointed to the state of Nevada, where gambling is prevalent, as an example.
   
Nevada, he said, ""can keep their recent No. 1 rankings in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce. They can keep their No. 1 rankings.""
   
For this fact-check, we won't begin to address whether gambling is to blame for the statistics Wilson cited. We are examining whether he had them correct.
   
Wilson's spokeswoman, Edie Ousley, said that the unemployment and foreclosure data came from 2011 data, that the personal bankruptcy statistic was from 2010 and the violent crime and divorce data was from 2009. She sent us a document from CQ Press that pulled numbers from many sources including the census, Small Business Administration, FBI and administrative office of the U.S. courts. Katy Sorenson, a former Miami-Dade County Commissioner who is now the CEO of The Good Government Initiative at the University of Miami, also cited similar statistics attributed to the Congressional District Ranking Book in a guest editorial in the Miami Herald Dec. 10.
   
We will use CQ's research as well as our own to look at each category cited by Wilson:
   
Unemployment: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in October 2011 unemployment in Nevada was 13.4 percent -- the highest state (the list includes Puerto Rico at 16.1 percent but Puerto Rico is a territory not a state).
   
Foreclosures: RealtyTrac shows a map of foreclosures nationwide as of October 2011 which shows for Nevada one home in every 180 is in foreclosure -- the highest in the country in terms of the ratio. (Nevada isn't the highest in sheer numbers -- there are more foreclosures in more populous states such as California and Florida.)

Violent crime: The FBI's 2010 statistics show 17,841 violent crimes (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the state of Nevada, for a rate of 660.6 per 100,000 occupants. Nevada's rate was the second highest in the country behind the District of Columbia, which had a rate of 1,330.2. (Nevada wasn't the second highest in sheer number of crimes because some states with larger populations, for example New York and California, had higher numbers of total violent crimes.) Since the chamber said Wilson was referring to 2009, we looked at the FBI's violent crime report for 2009, too, and found again the District of Columbia at No. 1 at 1345.9 and Nevada's rate at 702.2. The District of Columbia isn't a state so we think it's fair here to say Nevada had the highest crime rate amongst the states.
   
Personal bankruptcy: Using data collected from U.S. Bankruptcy Courts during a 12-month period ending in September 2010, Nevada ranked No. 1 in terms of the personal bankruptcy rate. The state had 1,121 nonbusiness bankruptcies per 100,000 population. We found bankruptcy statistics for the 12-month period ending in September 2011, but it showed the number of bankruptcy cases -- not the rate.
   
Divorce: CQ used 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate among states reporting (6.7 per 1,000 population). We corroborated the data through the National Center.
   
However, six states did not collect the information for 2009. Center spokesman Jeffrey Lancashire said the group no longer collects detailed divorce data because not all the states collect the information. 
""The exact reasons vary from state to state, but likely it is budget-related,"" he said in an e-mail. ""But when a state like California doesn’t collect the information, it is real problematic to produce good national data.""
   
The census also measures marital status rates for each state. The census shows that Nevada had a divorce rate of 12.3 percent for males and 14.6 percent for females between 2005 and 2007. According to the census, Wyoming had a slightly higher rate of divorced males -- 12.6 percent -- but Nevada was No. 1 for divorced females.
   
Another product created by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2010 American Community Survey showed that Nevada had a 12.4 percent divorce rate for women -- placing it in a tie for 9th place with Tennessee -- and a 14 percent divorce rate for men -- ranking it first.
   
Which divorce statistic should we give most weight?
   
Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the census, suggested that we use the National Center for Health Statistics data because that represents the official divorce rates and is based on vital statistics while the American Community Survey data are based on responses by survey respondents. That puts Wilson on solid footing.
   
Our ruling
   
Mark Wilson, the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, said that Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce. The state of Nevada is clearly No. 1 in its unemployment and foreclosure rate -- and it's the highest for violent crime, too, if we omit the District of Columbia, which isn't a state. CQ's analysis shows Nevada at the top spot for personal bankruptcy. The statistics on divorce are somewhat more complicated but one recent source, the National Center for Health Statistics, concluded Nevada's overall divorce rate was the highest in the country in 2009 among the states for which such data was available.

Newt Gingrich said he never lobbied for Freddie Mac 'under any circumstance'
","Is Newt Gingrich a conservative firebrand who can take the fight to Obama? Or just more Washington same-old, same-old?

Put Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., down for the second option. She laid into him at a Republican debate for the presidential nomination for his work with Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government.

""Well, it's the fact that we know that he cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That's the best evidence that you can have, over $1.6 million,"" Bachmann said on Dec. 15, 2011, in Iowa. She added, ""We can't have as our nominee for the Republican Party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up.""

When asked for his response, Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said, ""Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this.""

The conversation got weird after that, with Bachmann claiming that ""after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true."" That’s not true, and we gave her a Pants on Fire for saying it.

Gingrich, meanwhile, said his policy now is to break up both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. He also claimed that he was too well off to sell influence: ""I want to state unequivocally, for every person watching tonight, I have never once changed my positions because of any kind of payment, because the truth is, I was a national figure who was doing just fine, doing a whole variety of things, including writing best-selling books, making speeches.""

Here, we decided to examine Gingrich’s statement, ""I never lobbied under any circumstance.""

Our research showed that Gingrich is technically correct: If you search public records databases for registered lobbyists, you won’t find Gingrich’s name.

But his statement doesn’t tell the whole story.

To be clear, Gingrich acknowledges that he worked for Freddie Mac, and his campaign released a statement affirming that Nov. 6, 2011.

The statement, which you can read in full, said that Gingrich’s consulting group was retained by Freddie Mac in 2006. ""To be clear, Speaker Gingrich did no lobbying of any kind, nor did his firm. This was expressly written into the Gingrich Group contracts. Instead, the Gingrich Group was hired to offer strategic advice to Freddie Mac on a number of issues,"" the statement said.

The statement said Gingrich advised Freddie that it was dangerous to buy mortgage-backed securities based on questionable home loans. He also told Freddie on how to lower prescription drug costs for its employees. Finally, Freddie Mac ""was interested in advice on how to reach out to more conservatives.""

Because he was not a registered lobbyist, neither Freddie Mac nor Gingrich is required to disclose how much Gingrich was paid nor the exact dates of his work. Bachmann said it was $1.6 million. This number likely came from news stories from Bloomberg News, which reported last month that Gingrich received between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in fees from two separate contracts. We've seen nothing questioning the accuracy of that report, but the number also came from unnamed sources, so we can’t confirm or refute the number Bachmann mentioned. Bloomberg also reported that Gingrich worked with Mitchell Delk, Freddie's chief lobbyist. Delk told Bloomberg that Gingrich provided ""counsel on public policy issues,"" but did not do formal lobbying work.

So Gingrich was paid for ""strategic advice"" without having to register as a lobbyist. How does that work?

To be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year n behalf of a client. Also, the lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist’s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.)

Experts we spoke with and the research we reviewed showed the ""strategic advice"" category is a way of using influence without having to register as a lobbyist.

They said strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients like Freddie Mac without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can stay at the client’s office and give their best advice on with whom to meet and what to say. They can give instructions to someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what points to address. They can take their clients to meetings with groups that aren’t part of the government, such as grassroots political groups. They can even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client.

""There’s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn’t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn’t,"" said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb.

Sandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest. One of its recommendations was that people who give strategic advice disclose their work under a new category of ""lobbying support.""

We should also note that both parties play this game. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was a ""policy adviser"" at the lobbying firms Alston & Bird and DLA Piper. He had to answer many questions about his work when President Barack Obama selected him to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. (Daschle ended up withdrawing over tax issues connected to another client giving him the use of a car and driver.)

""Newt Gingrich is certainly not alone among well-heeled political players who say they just offer consulting services or strategic advice -- without needing to register as lobbyists. But it's a stretch to claim that they aren't part of the influence game,"" said Michael Beckel, a spokesman with the Center for Responsive Politics, via e-mail. The nonpartisan group monitors lobbying and campaign spending.

""The distinction isn't as important as Gingrich is making it out to be,"" he added.

Our ruling

Gingrich is technically correct that he was not a registered lobbyist for Freddie Mac. But it appears he took pains to avoid being subject to the rules. Giving strategic advice is widely considered a way of using political influence without having to register. We rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a3809163-f465-4790-89e5-46d3c3a5af8a",/factchecks/2011/dec/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-said-he-never-lobbied-freddie-mac-un/

DNC says presidential candidates usually release tax returns but Romney won't
","
More than one political opponent has attempted to make an issue of Mitt Romney’s personal fortune.

Romney’s years leading the private equity firm Bain Capital — which sometimes made money by laying off workers and closing businesses it had acquired — have led to charges that he is a creature of Wall Street and disconnected from the lives of average Americans.

According to the financial disclosure required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission, Romney’s personal fortune is between $190 million and $250 million. All presidential aspirants are required to file Office of Government Ethics Form 278 with the Federal Election Commission.

Details about Romney’s wealth are scarce, however, because he is only required to fill out the standard disclosure form about his assets. And unlike some past and present presidential candidates, Romney has not released his income tax returns during this campaign or in previous races for state and federal office.

Another GOP contender, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has called on Romney to go beyond the legal requirements and release his tax returns. Perry released his own returns in October 2011.

The Democratic National Committee raised the tax return issue in a video released earlier this month, ""What Is Mitt Romney Hiding?""

In it, the DNC makes the point that Romney’s father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, released his tax returns during the 1968 primary campaign when he sought the Republican presidential nomination. George Romney put pressure on his opponents by releasing 12 years of income tax returns in November 1967.

The DNC narrator states in the video: ""Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns. ... Mitt Romney still won’t.""

So, do presidential candidates really have a tradition of releasing their tax returns? And has Mitt Romney refused to do so?

What constitutes a tradition?

In the post-Watergate era, many, but not all, primary candidates have released their personal tax returns, in some cases going back decades. Here's a sampling of some recent elections, based on news coverage, publicly available returns and a list put together by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that promotes ethics and accountability. Presidents and vice presidents routinely release their returns in office.

2008 
Tax returns were an issue in the 2008 primary campaign. Sen. Barack Obama went first, releasing returns dating back to 2000 in March 2008. Sen. Hillary Clinton waited until April to release tax records dating back to 2000 for herself and former President Bill Clinton. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., also released tax returns during the primary, but Joe Biden didn’t release his returns until September, when Obama selected him as a running mate. John Edwards did not release tax returns, though he had released a decade of returns in September 2004, when he became John Kerry’s running mate.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who eventually won the Republican nomination, released his individual tax returns in April. Cindy McCain, his wife, initially refused but then released summaries for 2006 and 2007.

Romney declined to release returns, as did former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who both had released tax returns during earlier runs for state and municipal office.

2004
All the major Democratic contenders for the nomination released at least one year of tax returns, a list that included Kerry and Edwards, as well as Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Richard Gephardt, Dennis Kucinich and Joseph Lieberman.

2000
George W. Bush largely cleared the GOP field early in the primary season. He and running mate Richard Cheney were the only Republicans to release returns. Vice President Al Gore and his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, of New Jersey, both released returns as well. Ralph Nader, whose third party candidacy played a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the general election, did not release his returns.

1996
Among GOP primary candidates in 1996, Sens. Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and Jack Kemp released their tax returns. Publisher Steve Forbes, columnist Pat Buchanan and Sen. Richard Lugar did not.

1992
In April of that year, Bill Clinton released tax returns dating back to 1980. His closest rival for the nomination, former California governor Jerry Brown, did not.

1988
The top two Democrats in the race to face Vice President Bush, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, both released returns.

1984
The controversy over tax returns fell on the vice presidential candidates when Geraldine Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro, acquiesced to pressure and released their individual tax returns. After they did, the couple ended up paying more than $50,000 in back taxes.

1980
President Ronald Reagan, who like Romney had refused to release his tax returns during previous campaigns for state and federal office, relented in August and released his tax returns for 1979 after it became clear he was the likely nominee. Reagan’s chief rival for the 1980 nomination, George H.W. Bush, had released his in April, pressuring Reagan to do the same.

1976
Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford both released their 1975 tax returns and it was noted that an investment tax credit signed into law by Ford resulted in a significant tax windfall for a peanut warehouse owned by Carter.

Is it true that Romney ""won’t"" release his tax returns?

Romney’s camp did not respond to questions about if and when he would release his income tax returns. In response to the question when the Perry camp raised the issue, a Romney spokeswoman said the campaign would revisit the question during the next tax-filing season, presumably in April.

Our Ruling

Of 34 presidential and vice presidential candidates reviewed above, only seven -- Brown, Buchanan, Huckabee, Forbes, Giuliani, Lugar, Nader -- declined to release personal tax returns. So while most follow the practice, not all do. We rate the DNC’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-says-presidential-candidates-usually-release-t/

Jon Huntsman says U.S. natural gas in greater supply than Saudi Arabian oil
","
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says that protecting the environment while securing new sources of energy and creating jobs will be a ""balancing act"" for the next president.

""The job we've got to undertake as American people is to fuel our future,"" Huntsman said in a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Dec. 15, 2011.

Where does he want to find the fuel? Right here at home.

Huntsman frequently decries U.S. dependence on foreign oil while trumpeting the need for energy independence. To support his point, in the debate he cited a statistic that ""in this country … we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

Our New Hampshire team checked this exact claim before and found that Huntsman is comparing apples and oranges and getting it wrong.

Complex math

PolitiFact's New Hampshire team contacted the U.S. Energy Information Administration to break down the issue, which involves comparing energy sources that are measured differently. Oil supplies are calculated in barrels, while natural gas supplies are calculated in cubic feet. And the two fuels have different energy content, which means it takes still more math to compare them.
   
Converting the energy content into the standard measure British thermal units, 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil, according to Steven Grape, an EIA expert in the Office of Oil, Gas, and Coal Supply Statistics.
   
In addition, there are two ways to look at how much of each resource is available. One is to look at proved reserves -- those that are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions.
   
Another, more uncertain approach is to look at technically recoverable resources. These are resources that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost.
   
Starting with proved reserves, Saudi Arabia has 24 percent of the world’s proved reserves of crude oil, or about 264 billion barrels, Grape said. The U.S. proved reserves of natural gas are 284 trillion cubic feet. Punch those figures into the equation, and U.S. proved reserves are equal in energy content to about 46.8 billion barrels of oil -- considerably less than Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of oil.
   
Now let’s look at the technically recoverable figures. Resource estimates for Saudi Arabia are thought to be as high as 700 billion barrels of crude oil, and the technically recoverable resource estimate for the United States is about 2,500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is equivalent to 412.5 billion barrels of oil.

Again, that's much less than the 700 billion barrel estimate for Saudi Arabia.

Current production
   
Huntsman’s claim is correct only if taken to be referring to production. ""We don’t have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil, but we produce more natural gas in this country per year than Saudi Arabia produces oil,"" Grape said.
   
The U.S. produces the equivalent of 12.14 million barrels per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's 9.8 million barrels of oil per day, Grape said.

But Huntsman didn’t say we ""produce"" more natural gas than Saudi Arabia produces oil. He said we ""have"" more.

Our ruling

In the debate, Huntsman said, ""we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil.""

By two of the three measures to consider that claim, Huntsman is off base. Looking at proved resources, Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves. Considering technically recoverable resources, Saudi Arabia is still the front runner. Only when comparing current production levels does Huntsman’s statistic hold up. But Huntsman didn’t refer to production. Additionally, in talking about moving America toward energy independence, we think reserves are more relevant than current production and rule his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/16/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-us-natural-gas-greater-supply-sa/

Newt Gingrich repeats claim about his record of balancing budget, reducing debt
","During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Newt Gingrich touted his record when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Gingrich’s comment came after moderator Bret Baier said that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ""just yesterday said you're an unreliable conservative. Now, obviously, he's your opponent. … But even Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said today he respects you greatly, but he openly questioned whether you had the discipline and focus to be president.""

Gingrich responded, ""Well, those are two different questions. .... I have a 90 percent American Conservative Union voting record for 20 years. I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt. Pretty conservative. … I think on the conservative thing, it's sort of laughable to suggest that somebody who campaigned with Ronald Reagan and with Jack Kemp and has had a 30-year record of conservatism, is somehow not a conservative?""

The claim that Gingrich ""balanced the budget for four straight years (and) paid off $405 billion in debt"" sounded familiar. It turns out that we originally fact-checked it when Gingrich made it on May 11, 2011, when he released a video to launch his presidential campaign.

In that video, he said, ""for four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt."" With soft music in the background, Gingrich said with a smile, ""We’ve done it before. We can do it again.""

Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs.

First, the balanced budget.

The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.

By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.

But that’s only two balanced budgets he can claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House.

Now for Gingrich’s comments about the debt.

The national debt was slightly above $4.8 trillion when Gingrich became House speaker in January 1995. By the time he left the position in January 1999, the debt was more than $5.6 trillion. That’s an increase, not a decrease.

If you look just at the two years Gingrich can claim credit for where the federal government was in surplus -- fiscal years 1998 and 1999 -- the government did pay down about $200 billion in debt. But that would be cherry-picking, because over the full four years of his speakership, the debt rose by about $800 billion.

A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, as in this case, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified.

With this statement, even if Gingrich’s numbers had been correct, his language suggested that he deserved sole credit for the achievement, when in fact it was a collective accomplishment with a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. That further downgrades the accuracy of his claim.

Our ruling

Gingrich was off on both claims concerning the budget. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years. As for paying off $405 billion in debt, the data we found shows the debt actually increased during Gingrich’s four-year tenure as speaker by more than $800 billion.

Texas Democratic leader says author who believes registering poor to vote is un-American spoke at tea party event
","
In an email, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Boyd Richie appealed to supporters for donations so the party could continue ""fighting against the King Street Patriots,"" a Houston tea party group that the Democrats sued last year. 
The Nov. 15, 2011, email blast added to the party’s charges against the Patriots: ""Yesterday, in an almost gleeful admission that folks who tend to vote Democratic should be denied their fundamental right to vote, this tea party group held a Houston fundraiser featuring Matthew Vadum. Yes, the ultra-right-wing author who believes that 'registering the poor to vote is un-American.' "" 
We wondered whether Richie was right: Did the King Street Patriots throw a fundraiser featuring an author who espouses such a view? 
Some background: The King Street Patriots was launched in 2009, according to its website, ""to battle the most brazen attempt by liberals in the last 50 years to further an agenda which Patriots consider diametrically opposed to the welfare of all Americans."" The Patriots are ""committed to freedom, capitalism, American exceptionalism, constitutional governance and civic duty,"" the site says. The group has made voter fraud its signature issue and launched an initiative in 2010 called True the Vote that trains poll-watchers. 
The state Democratic Party and the Patriots group have been embroiled in a legal dispute since October 2010, when the party accused the Patriots of illegally aiding Republicans — through its poll-watcher training — without registering as a political committee. In a countersuit, the Patriots denied the allegations and challenged some state election laws cited by the party, including the limits on corporate campaign contributions. 
Back to Richie's Nov. 15 email. To back up the first half of its claim — that Vadum spoke at a King Street Patriots fundraiser — party spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña sent us the online invitation to the third installment of the Patriots' ""visiting author series."" According to the invitation, the Nov. 14, 2011, luncheon was to feature Vadum talking about his 2011 book, Subversion Inc.: How Obama’s ACORN Red Shirts Are Still Terrorizing and Ripping Off American Taxpayers. 
Vadum is an editor at the Washington-based Capital Research Center, whose website says it ""analyzes organizations that promote the growth of government and identifies viable private alternatives to government regulatory and entitlement programs."" 
The price of admission to the luncheon was listed as $100, which the invitation said would entitle attendees to a four-course meal and an autographed copy of Vadum's book. Catherine Engelbrecht, president of the King Street Patriots and a resident of Richmond, southwest of Houston, confirmed that the event was a fundraiser, telling us that about $40 out of every $100 ticket sold for the author series went to the Patriots. 
The invitation also included a blurb about Subversion Inc.: ""America is under siege by radicals who are determined to pulverize the U.S. Constitution, deliberately bankrupt the nation, destroy the electoral system, and drive the economy into the ground. Subversion Inc. isn’t just the story of ACORN. It’s the story of how community organizers just like President (Barack) Obama are undermining American from within — and it’s a story we must understand if we are to save our nation."" 
ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 after a video sting showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The 40-year-old, liberal-leaning group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, was also accused of committing fraud in voter registration drives. 
In his book, Vadum says that ""rumors of (ACORN's) death have been greatly exaggerated"" and that the group's leaders have acknowledged that they are building a network of activist groups to continue ACORN's work. 
As backup for the second part of its claim — that Vadum believes registering the poor to vote is un-American — the Democratic Party pointed us to an opinion article by Vadum that was posted Sept. 1, 2011,  on the conservative website American Thinker. The headline: ""Registering the Poor to Vote Is Un-American."" 
Vadum begins his piece by writing that ""left-wing activist groups"" are eager to register the poor to vote because they always support politicians who want to expand government benefits — which Vadum objects to and views as a coercive redistribution of wealth. 
Besides the headline, the word ""un-American"" appears in the piece's third paragraph: ""Registering (welfare recipients) to vote is like handing out burglary tools to criminals. It is profoundly anti-social and un-American to empower the nonproductive segments of the population to destroy the country."" 
Later, Vadum expands on his point: ""Encouraging those who burden society to participate in elections isn't about helping the poor. It's about helping the poor to help themselves to others' money. … It's about moving America ever farther away from the small-government ideals of the Founding Fathers."" 
In his article, Vadum attacks the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known as the ""motor voter"" law, for encouraging more poor people to register to vote, saying the law ""turned welfare offices into voter registration centers and encouraged nonprofit groups to conduct registration drives."" According to a summary on the Justice Department's website, the 1993 law required most states to give citizens the opportunity to register to vote at offices that provide public assistance and when they apply for or renew their driver's license. 
In an email, Vadum told us that he stands by his article but has had regrets about his wording. ""In retrospect, I believe that calling it 'un-American' to register the poor to vote was rhetorical overkill,"" Vadum said. ""I continue to believe that actively encouraging welfare recipients to vote to enlarge the existing welfare state apparatus and move America farther down the road to European-style socialism is a terrible idea. It is, in the American context, anti-social in that it promotes dependency and the social pathologies associated with it."" 
According to a video posted on the Patriots' website, Engelbrecht asked Vadum about the article at the Nov. 14 event. She said: ""You wrote an article for American Thinker, and I'm not sure if any of you (the audience) have seen this, but the left has already come out swinging against the fact that you wrote the article, that we had you here after you wrote the article. And, you want to speak to that?"" 
Vadum responded: ""I wrote an op-ed, perhaps indelicately worded, called 'Registering the Poor to Vote Is Un-American,' but I wasn’t saying that people shouldn’t have the right to vote if they’re poor. I was talking about the — and I’ll just be a little bit more careful when I write op-eds in the future; it's mostly the tone that some conservatives objected to, and I can appreciate that."" He went on to criticize the motor-voter law. 
Engelbrecht told us in an interview that Richie's statement — that her group held a fundraiser featuring an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American — was not true. Engelbrecht said that she was unaware of his American Thinker article at the time that Vadum was invited to speak and that the point of his appearance was to discuss his book. 
In his email to us, Vadum said his American Thinker article was drawn from material in his book. We checked Subversion Inc., and although we didn’t find the title of Vadum's American Thinker article in the text, Vadum makes essentially the same argument as he does in the article. On page 102, he writes: ""There's no way to overstate just how profoundly anti-social and un-American the Cloward-Piven voter registration strategy is. It is akin to the government handing out taxpayer-purchased burglary tools."" 
In that sentence, Vadum is referring to Richard Cloward, a Columbia University social work professor who died in 2001, and his wife, Frances Fox Piven, a professor of sociology and political science at the City University of New York. They have been described as driving forces behind the 1993 motor-voter law; Cloward’s obituary in The New York Times noted that he and his wife were invited to the White House when President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law. 
The Times story also mentions a 1966 article that the pair wrote for the Nation magazine calling for a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the voter rolls as a means of forcing radical welfare reform. The Times describes the article as ""perhaps (the couple's) most controversial writing,"" saying it ""helped to foster the emergence of a more militant welfare rights movement, including the occupation of welfare offices in many cities and other acts of civil disobedience."" 
Our ruling: The guest speaker at the Nov. 14 King Street Patriots event wrote an article suggesting that registering the poor to vote is un-American, further likening the registration of welfare recipients to offering burglary tools to criminals (though Richie did not mention this aspect).

Rick Perry says the federal government catches and releases non-violent violators of immigration laws
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a Republican presidential debate that President Barack Obama's administration has fallen short of enforcing immigration laws.

At the ABC News Iowa Republican debate Dec. 10, 2011, Perry said that when he's president, you ""will not see a catch-and-release program like this administration has today … where people who are caught who are illegally in this country and because they haven't been caught in a violent situation, they're released … into the general population. That's the problem that we've got in this country.""

We’d already started reviewing a similar Perry claim. Stumping in New Hampshire with Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Perry said at a New Hampshire diner Nov. 29, 2011, that ""the Obama administration has a catch-and-release policy where nonviolent illegal aliens are released into the general public,"" ABC News recapped.

""My policy will be to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend,"" Perry said, according to an NBC News account. ""That is how you stop this. And we'll do it with expedited hearings so that millions of illegal immigrants are not released into the general population until a hearing date's set several weeks or months later, as we have now.""

""Catch and release"" sure is catchy. We wondered if Perry's statement accurately describes current practices.

Perry’s campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, offered as backup information an Aug. 18, 2011, entry on the White House blog. The entry by Cecilia Muñoz, White House director of intergovernmental affairs, states that for the first time, the Department of Homeland Security has prioritized the removal of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes in the United States. Homeland Security announced that day, the entry says, that officials would be ""making sure they are not focusing our resources on deporting people who are low priorities for deportation.

""This includes individuals such as young people who were brought to this country as small children, and who know no other home,"" the entry says. ""It also includes individuals such as military veterans and the spouses of active-duty military personnel. It makes no sense to spend our enforcement resources on these low-priority cases when they could be used with more impact on others, including individuals who have been convicted of serious crimes.""

Muñoz added that the government would be reviewing the ""current deportation caseload to clear out low-priority cases on a case-by-case basis and make more room to deport people who have been convicted of crimes or pose a security risk. And they will take steps to keep low-priority cases out of the deportation pipeline in the first place.""

Her blog entry says such decisions would be based on ""common sense guidelines,"" a phrase that she hyperlinked to a June 17, 2011, memo from the director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, urging agency officials to use discretion in deciding which apprehended violators of immigration law should be removed from the country. Morton’s memo urges that particular care be taken with veterans, long-time legal permanent residents, minors, elderly individuals, pregnant or nursing women and individuals here since childhood, among people, though negative factors also should be weighed, including whether individuals pose a risk to national security, are serious felons or known gang members, or have egregious records of immigration law violations.

Frazier also guided us to mention of a June 2010 memo from Morton, obtained by Judicial Watch, similarly encouraging ICE officials to apply prosecutorial discretion.

From the top, then, it looks like the administration has been focusing on holding and removing illegal immigrants with criminal convictions instead of others, though an attorney for the Migration Policy Institute, which studies the movement of people worldwide, told us that prosecutorial discretion has long been a tool in enforcing immigration laws. Muzaffar Chishti pointed out in an interview that the June 2011 ICE memo is presented as building on previous instructions by officials in five administrations, starting in July 1976, stressing prosecutorial discretion.

In this way, Chishti said, Morton was ""reinforcing what has been longstanding policy."" He speculated that Morton’s 2011 memo was issued because apprehensions and deportations have surged, straining government resources.

In testimony prepared for an Oct. 12, 2011, House hearing, Morton said ICE is focused on removing people who pose threats to safety, as well as repeat immigration law violators, recent border crossers and fugitives. ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen later told us by email that in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, the government removed over 396,000 individuals, 216,000 of them (55 percent) who had  been convicted of a criminal offense. The year before, Chishti told us, 44 percent of nearly 390,000 individuals removed by the United States had a criminal conviction -- up from 33 percent in 2009 and 27 percent in 2008.

Put another way, the figures show that more than 40 percent of the illegal residents removed last year had been convicted of no misdeeds outside of immigration violations.

A twist: Most U.S. deportation cases of late were not built around potential deportees’ criminal convictions, according to a review by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The clearinghouse said in a Dec. 5, 2011, online post that from July through September 2011, 13.8 percent of individuals in deportation proceedings were targeted based on criminal activities — down from the ""already low level of 16.5 percent"" in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2010. The share of individuals facing deportation based on criminal activity ""has been declining steadily throughout the past year,"" the clearinghouse said.

ICE’s Christensen called TRAC’s analysis ""wildly misleading,"" saying the immigration agency is not required to bring up an individual’s criminal record, if any, in removal proceedings. She said: ""In these cases, an individual's criminal history, while relevant to ICE's decision to seek removal, is largely irrelevant to the legal question of whether the person has a right to remain in the U.S.""

Our ruling

Perry’s statement oversimplifies the administration’s focus on detaining and deporting certain violators of immigration law over others. In fact, people removed from the country on Obama’s watch include both individuals convicted of crimes and those with clean records aside from immigration violations. That said, a majority of the removed detainees last year had a criminal conviction and the share of deported individuals separately convicted of crimes has been on the rise.

No, a silver solution won’t cure the coronavirus
","As the novel coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, so does misinformation surrounding the illness, heightening global anxiety. On March 10, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) filed a lawsuit against televangelist Jim Bakker and his production company for advertising and marketing a silver solution that he and his guest, Sherill Sellman, falsely implied could cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the broadcast, naturopathic doctor Sherill Sellman claimed the silver solution had killed other viruses. Coronavirus is a family of viruses. Other notable outbreaks have been SARS and MERS.  ""Well, let's say it hasn't been tested on this strain of the coronavirus, but it has been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours,"" Sellman said.  ""Totally eliminate it. Kills it. Deactivates it.""  As Sellman spoke, a message appeared on the bottom of the screen advertising the sale of four, 4-ounce bottles of the silver solution for $80.  So, is there any silver solution that kills any strain of coronavirus?  In a word: No.  On March 9, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning statements to seven companies, including the Jim Bakker Show, informing them to stop selling products they claimed cure the coronavirus. The products cited in the letter were teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver, according to the FDA news release.  This wasn’t the Jim Bakker Show’s first warning. On March 3, New York Attorney General Letitia James’s office sent a cease and desist letter to Bakker for misleading the public about the effectiveness of the silver solution as a cure for the novel disease. We reached out to Sellman to see what actually was in this silver substance, but never got a response. One ingredient, though, is colloidal silver, a liquid that contains silver particles. Often it is peddled as an immune boosting, disease curing dietary supplement, but there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. In fact, colloidal silver can be dangerous to your health. Its side effects include permanently turning your skin a bluish-gray and causing poor absorption of certain drugs and antibiotics, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.  Coronaviruses, known for their crown-like spikes, are a large family of viruses that can be found in many different types of animals including cattle and bats.  Rarely, the coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and create new human coronaviruses that make people sick. There are seven strains of coronavirus that can infect people, and most people get cold-like symptoms. Three strains, including COVID-19, can cause acute respiratory distress and spread rapidly.  While much about the pandemic causing disease is still unknown here’s what scientists do know:  ""COVID-19 spreads between people who have been in close contact or through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes."" ""Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure and include fever, a cough and shortness of breath."" ""Older adults and people who have serious chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease are at a higher risk of getting very sick from this illness."" ""There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19."" Sellman claimed that a Silver Solution used on strains of coronavirus ""totally eliminate it. Kills it. Deactivates it."" No, no, and no.  There are no pills or remedies that cure any strain of human coronavirus including COVID-19. In fact, Sellman’s ""silver solution,"" and colloidal silver, can hurt you, and not just your wallet.  With that, we rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/17/sherill-sellman/no-silver-solution-wont-cure-coronavirus/

Did Matt Gaetz and Ted Cruz oppose paid sick leave but take it for themselves?
","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, both put themselves in quarantine after learning they were in contact with someone who later tested positive for coronavirus. Occupy Democrats, a liberal group, said that both lawmakers are hypocritical, because they have paid leave through their own jobs but took stances in the past against paid sick leave for other workers. ""Hypocritical politicians of the day, March 12, 2020,"" stated the Facebook post, which was deleted from Occupy Democrats’ Facebook page after we asked about it. ""Rep Matt Gaetz was exposed to coronavirus, took 2 weeks paid sick leave off from Congress to self-quarantine. Voted in 2013 to make it illegal for any city in Florida to enact paid sick leave."" The post, which we found posted elsewhere, states that Cruz also took two weeks’ paid sick leave and ""voted in 2015 in the U.S. Senate against paid sick leave."" We found that while the post gets the lawmakers’ votes right, it makes a notable leap when it states that the men took paid sick leave.  As members of Congress, they don’t have to take sick leave but were able to work from home at their own discretion. It’s a privilege that many working people don’t have.  Federal law does not require paid sick leave, but 12 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws to require it, and other cities have similar policies. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Both Gaetz and Cruz self-quarantined in March after they learned that they had come in contact with a person at the Conservative Political Action Conference who later tested positive for the coronavirus. Gaetz announced his self-quarantine on March 9 and said he would complete it March 12. Gaetz said he took a lab test and that it came back negative for COVID-19. Cruz announced his self-quarantine March 8. Cruz said he would continue his self-quarantine until March 17. An initial press release appears to show Cruz wasn’t tested. Both Cruz and Gaetz said they were working remotely while self-quarantined.  ""I’m on calls with my staff, I’m doing a radio interview a little bit later, I think I might be doing a phone interview on television a little bit later, so I’m doing all the things I would normally do, just from my house,"" Gaetz told The Spectator. News releases from Cruz’s office during the past several days showed he continued to work on legislation and urged the administration to take certain steps to track coronavirus cases.  Members of Congress can take time off when they are ill and for other excused absences, and they continue to be paid, said Brad Fitch, CEO of the Congressional Management Foundation. But they can’t vote remotely. Traditionally, members have entered statements in the Congressional Record after they’ve missed votes, stating how they would have voted if present.  So Gaetz and Cruz were working from home, not on paid sick leave. But have they opposed paid sick leave for others?  As a Florida state representative in 2013, Gaetz voted in favor of HB 655, which banned local governments from requiring employers to provide employment benefits, including paid sick time. It passed the Senate 25-13 and passed the House 76-41, and then-Gov. Rick Scott signed it into law. The bill was a response to a petition signed by 50,000 Orange County voters seeking a voter referendum on sick pay. Those against sick leave requirements included the state’s business lobby, Walt Disney World and Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden). Gaetz said recently he opposed the measure because he didn’t want local governments making many different rules.  Cruz voted against sick leave in 2015, when U.S. senators considered an amendment to provide seven days of paid sick leave. Amid efforts to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19, federal lawmakers are again talking about sick leave.  The House passed a bill March 14 that included 14 days’ paid sick leave, but it only covers small and mid-sized companies, and it doesn’t cover workers who are self-employed. The bill is expected to go to the Senate this week. Vicki Shabo, an expert on paid leave at the New America think tank, said that close to 30% of private-sector workers don’t have paid sick leave, and that’s disproportionally in low-wage service and care industries. While workers who have flexibility or are in positions of power can choose to stay home if they want to, most people don’t have job protections or security to be able to do that, Shabo said.  A Facebook post by Occupy Democrats said Gaetz and Cruz took two weeks paid sick leave to self-quarantine. Gaetz ""voted in 2013 to make it illegal for any city in Florida to enact paid sick leave"" and Cruz ""voted in 2015 in the U.S. Senate against paid sick leave."" The post correctly notes that Gaetz and Cruz have voted against paid sick leave. But it goes wrong in saying that the two men are on paid sick leave now. They’re actually working from home, and their positions give them that discretion. However, it’s important to note that they can’t vote remotely on matters before Congress.  The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context.

Biden falsely says Trump administration rejected WHO coronavirus test kits (that were never offered)
","During Sunday night’s debate, while levelling criticism at President Donald Trump’s handling of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden said the Trump administration refused to get coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization.  ""Look, the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own,"" Biden said.  A similar claim on WHO test kits has also been circulating on Facebook.  The Biden campaign referred us to a Politico article that said the WHO shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is technically correct, but it suggests that the United States would have been on the list under any circumstances. The countries WHO helped are ones that lack the virology lab horsepower that exists across the United States. The outreach work by the Pan American Health Organization is a case in point. The group is WHO’s arm in the Americas. It conducted trainings and sent materials to conduct tests to 29 nations. The list included Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and many others. The group said it focused most of its efforts on ""countries with the weakest health systems."" ""No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,"" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. ""This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity."" According to interviews with several infectious disease experts, Biden’s statement leaves out key context regarding how different countries decided on which test they’d use to identify the presence of the coronavirus.  WHO lists seven different approaches — including that of China, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, France and Germany — each one targeting different parts of the COVID-19 genetic profile.  Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, said that when faced with an outbreak, the WHO will usually adopt the best test that a research group brings forward.  The German one became the approach WHO circulated as its preferred model. Aid groups, such as the Pan American Health Organization, took that model and built their training and supplies around it. If the model was like the recipe in a cookbook, the supplies were the ingredients in a home meal kit from Blue Apron. Any country could use whatever recipe it preferred, and even if the United States had picked the WHO’s protocol, it wouldn’t need the WHO to sell it the materials to follow it. Germany released its protocol on Jan. 17, but the U.S. decided to have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention develop its own. That protocol was published Jan. 28.  In this instance, this caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S. The CDC’s test was different and more complicated than the German test. It worked in the CDC lab, but when the materials went out to state labs, some of them got inconsistent results. The CDC had to resend packages with new chemical reagents.  State laboratories started developing their own tests and were ready to use them, but had to wait for emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration. All of this added up to a delay in testing capabilities which resulted in fewer Americans being tested and an overall slower U.S. response compared to other countries.  When asked to respond to Biden’s claim, the Trump campaign pointed to multiple news stories that said it's not uncommon for the U.S. and other countries to develop their own tests during outbreaks, and that the CDC did so during Ebola and Zika outbreaks. The campaign also said the CDC's test had a quick turnaround compared to other diagnostic tests like MERS and Zika that took months to develop. And the issue with the CDC’s protocol was not the test itself, but rather a manufacturing defect, the campaign added.  That’s not how it works  While it might seem odd that the Trump administration shunned the WHO’s coronavirus test protocol, it’s normal for countries with advanced research capabilities to want to develop a measure that they trust.  ""I don’t know if WHO agreed to sell the kits to us, but it should never have been something we needed to do given our technological expertise and the fact we would have ‘taken kits from low- and middle-income countries’ that otherwise could not make or afford them,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, in an email.  It’s also unlikely, Mores said, that the WHO offered to sell kits to the U.S., because that’s not normally what the organization does.  ""In my experience, this is never something that I would have to purchase,"" he said.  Typically, Mores said, American labs have all of the basic ingredients and equipment to run the test — all that would be needed is the viral sequences and an exact test protocol. The only catch at the moment is that supplies of those basic ingredients are stretched thin due to high demand. Biden said, ""The World Health Organization offered, offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them.""  Biden has a point that the U.S. did not attempt to use the WHO test. But the U.S. would never have needed complete kits from WHO. Even if it had adopted the WHO testing approach, it already had access to all the necessary materials.  WHO said there was never any talk of WHO sending testing kits to the United States. Biden’s words leave out other important context and information.  The U.S. chose to use its own test, rather than the one circulated by WHO. Other nations, such as China, Japan and France, also developed their own tests. Multiple public health experts said that is not unusual.  Biden’s emphasis on WHO offering kits is simply wrong.

Did Mike Parson create 40,000 jobs since he took office?
","Missouri Gov. Mike Parson says that his workforce development agenda and initiatives are working and creating more jobs.  At a Feb. 14 speech to the County Commissioners Association of Missouri, he said: ""Right now we have over 40,000 new jobs in a little over 18 months."" It’s a number he’s used in his State of the State address in January and in other places since October.  Parson got the state’s top job on June 1, 2018, following the resignation of Eric Greitens. So he’s been governor for a little more than 20 months.  How close is he to 40,000? Not very. Can he take credit for job increases? That’s another question. Parson has made jobs a vital part of his agenda. He advocated for the Fast Track Workforce Incentive Grant in his 2019 State of the State address. The grant helps people gain workforce skills through certificate or degree programs to go into high-need jobs, according to the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development. (The law went into effect on Aug. 5).  He also created, through executive order on Nov. 12, an Office of Apprenticeship to create opportunities for Missourians to gain needed skills to get into the workforce. We contacted Parson’s administration about his claim. His staff gave us a link to the state Department of Economic Development’s jobs report. The research division of the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development shows Missouri gained 36,800 jobs on the nonfarm payroll from June 2018 (When Parson took office after former governor Eric Greitens’ resignation) to November 2019. Seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is in line with Missouri’s Economic Research Information Center’s numbers.  So, the governor’s number is 8% off — but only if you end the count there. December data released on Jan. 23 showed that Missouri lost 8,500 jobs in that month. That would bring the total job increase from June 2018 to December 2019 to 28,300 — well short of 40,000. (It is worth noting that as of March 4, 2020, Missouri lost even more, 5,800 jobs, which would bring the total to 22,500 since Parson took office. That data was reported after the governor made his claim, though.) Can Parson claim jobs increasing is because of him, his administration and workforce development policies?  As noted above, a few of his workforce development initiatives were just recently enacted.  Even if they had been put in place on Day One of his administration, he cannot be fully credited for the increase.  As we’ve noted in previous PolitiFact fact-checks such as this one on former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a governor can’t really take full credit — or blame — for the rise or fall in jobs.  There are many factors that affect the state of Missouri’s economy such as the U.S. economy or international affairs, which affect goods and services in the state. One person or administration cannot be the sole factor. It is like the quarterback of a football team. While very important to the team and the outcome of a game, he is not to be fully credited or blamed for the team’s efforts. Parson said: ""Right now we have over 40,000 new jobs in a little over 18 months."" Taking into account December data, the number of jobs created since Mike Parson took office only rises to 28,300. His claim may have been close when he made it last fall, but it is not now.  We rate Parson’s tweet as False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/16/mike-parson/did-mike-parson-create-40000-jobs-he-took-office/

Both posts, which have been shared nearly 100,000 times combined, were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s what you need to know about the history of the COVID-19.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses including the common cold and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), according to the World Health Organization. And they’re zoonotic, which means that they are transmitted between animals and humans. Vincent Racaniello, a professor microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, has said that the likely, distant source of COVID-19 is bats, ""but we don’t know who was between bats and people."" It could be a direct infection between bats and humans. COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. It hadn’t previously been identified in humans. As of March 16, 164,837 cases have been confirmed in 146 countries, and 6,470 people have died, according to WHO. In the United States, there are 1,678 confirmed cases. The first COVID-19 case was reported to the World Health Organization from Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019. On March 13, though, the South China Morning Post reported on unpublished Chinese government data indicating that the earliest case was Nov. 17, 2019, according to the Guardian.   Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact that there’s at least evidence that there were four cases in China from earlier in December than the first reported case in Wuhan on Dec. 31. And since it’s a new virus and the early symptoms are similar to the flu, it’s possible cases existed in China even earlier than that, he said.  ""However,"" he said, ""in the U.S., it is very unlikely we had cases in November or December, given what we know about the course of the disease and its later symptoms.

Vox recently reported that an analysis of the coronavirus’ genome by Tanja Stadler, a professor of computational biology at ETH Zurich and a molecular epidemiology expert, found that the virus emerged in humans in China in the first half of November 2019.

These Facebook posts make unsubstantiated claims that many people have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 well before the first cases were documented in the United States and even China.  There’s a lot we still don’t know about the disease.

Clarifying what’s accurate, and not, in claims about quarantines
","As the spread of coronavirus has fed fears of illness, it has also spurred fears of mass quarantines. And looking at other countries that have been hit hard by the virus, including China and Italy, it’s not an idle question. On March 12, a reader sent us a comment from a website called Stop Mandatory Vaccination, run by a group that opposes bills to curb exemptions for vaccinations. (Here’s some background on the anti-vaccine movement.) The website said in part, ""The CDC can detain anyone with a fever — indefinitely. … Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention."" Similar comments on social media soon prompted high-level debunkings. Late on March 15, the National Security Council took to Twitter to knock down rumors about a national quarantine: ""Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus."" Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus Quarantines are real, but there’s a lot of misinformation floating around about the details. Here, we’ll attempt to clarify what’s accurate, and what’s not, about quarantines. (An inquiry to Stop Mandatory Vaccination was not returned.) There are two related terms that address this phenomenon: quarantine and isolation. ""Isolation"" separates people with a confirmed case of a communicable disease from people who are not sick. ""Quarantine"" separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. The last federal quarantine prior to the coronavirus outbreak came in the early 1960s, when officials were concerned about a smallpox outbreak. It’s been a century — back to the 1918-19 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic — since large-scale isolations and quarantines were last enforced. Federal quarantine power stems from Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries and between states.  Federal regulations revised in 2017 allow the CDC ""to detain, medically examine, and release persons arriving into the United States and traveling between states who are suspected of carrying"" certain communicable diseases. (Here’s what a sample quarantine order looks like.) Those powers are carried out with help from other federal agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard. This federal government has exercised this power recently with travelers returning from locations where coronavirus has been spreading, based on presidential proclamations like this one. So far we’ve been referring to federal quarantines. But most quarantine power actually resides with state and local governments, as well as tribal law on tribal lands.  That’s because federal quarantine powers are limited to persons entering the United States from elsewhere. By contrast, states and localities enforce those powers within their own borders ""CDC officials are ‘preparing as if (the new coronavirus) is the next pandemic,’ but in reality, the laboring oar falls to state and local health departments,"" Polly J. Price, a professor of law and global health at Emory University, has written in the Atlantic.  So the assertion we’re checking in this article, by focusing on CDC, misses a lot of where the action is: state and local governments. Historically, forcible quarantines have been rare, and they require a court order. Most of the time, experts said, people who are infected are released on their own recognizance with a promise to self-quarantine. There’s judicial precedent for quarantine powers dating back to the early 1800s, but subsequent case law has required a degree of due process, especially given that a quarantine, unlike an arrest, involves the detention of someone who is not suspected of a crime. Past cases ""suggest that there are important limits on the ability of the U.S. and state and local governments when it comes to some types of public health action,"" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University. The government has to show real harm, as well as that people get due process and a chance to appeal.  Becoming subject to forcible quarantines isn’t just a question of having a particular germ; it also requires a strong likelihood that you will spread it to other people. ""Since most people can take precautions, this typically only happens in the case of person who can’t stay away from other people,"" such as people who have a severe mental illness, said Wendy K. Mariner, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. What if you refuse a mandatory order? Practical consequences for such an action are tricky. While fines and incarceration are allowed, no public health expert today recommends jailing a person unwilling to quarantine, because they would be introducing a contagion into a confined population. ""The likelier answer is hospitals with secure wards,"" Mariner said. Not any fever gets you quarantined, contrary to the assertion we’re checking. The government ""would have to have good evidence that the individual was exposed to COVID-19"" to impose a quarantine, said Lawrence O. Gostin, faculty director of Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. ""‘Fever’ is too broad a definition,"" Mariner agreed. In addition to coronavirus, the CDC is able to quarantine only for the following diseases: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS and pandemic flu. It’s an exaggeration to say quarantine is ""indefinite"" detention by the government, especially given what we know so far about the course of coronavirus disease. First, as we noted, quarantine is usually self-regulated. And for those instances when it’s not, such as when an individual is uncooperative, the person is able to leave quarantine when they are no longer contagious. Vaccination doesn’t get you out of quarantine. Typically, vaccinations aren’t cures; they’re preventive measures. In any case, it’s moot for coronavirus, because there is no vaccine yet. Claims on the internet said ""the CDC can detain anyone with a fever — indefinitely. … Vaccination (is) a way people could get out of detention."" The CDC does have the power to isolate people with certain infectious diseases and quarantine those who had contact with an infected person. But this claim is wrong or misleading about many of the details. Most quarantine decisions will be up to states and localities, rather than the CDC. People can’t be quarantined for just having a fever; they have to be shown to have been exposed to a specific set of diseases. Most quarantines are done voluntarily, not by force of the state. And vaccination is not a ticket out of quarantine. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/16/blog-posting/clarifying-whats-accurate-and-not-claims-about-qua/

‘The Simpsons’ did not predict Tom Hanks’ illness from coronavirus

No, Pelosi wasn’t caught trying to add abortion funding into coronavirus bill
","The U.S. House passed a measure to help mitigate the economic toll of the coronavirus by providing financial assistance to people affected by the pandemic. The legislation passed overwhelmingly (363-40 on March 14) and provides billions of dollars so Americans can get free tests and, in some cases, receive two weeks of paid leave.  As debate about the bill began, we noticed claims going around that said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got ""caught"" trying to sneak abortion funding into the package.  This is false. There’s no evidence that Pelosi was sneaking any funding toward abortion services in the bill. Knowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.

When we reached out to Pelosi’s staff, they declined comment.  The Hyde Amendment, which was enacted in 1997, is a budgetary rider that prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions except in very rare cases. The issue was that the bill’s original draft didn’t explicitly include Hyde Amendment language that would make sure that reimbursement of laboratory claims couldn’t apply to abortion services. The concern raised in the Daily Caller story was that the lack of language would create a loophole that abortion service providers could try to use in the future to get reimbursed with federal funds.  That’s certainly more hypothetical than the matter-of-fact headline, ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi Caught Trying to Include Abortion Funding in Bill to Combat Coronavirus."" House Democrats submitted a ""manager’s amendment"" on March 12 that says reimbursement funds could only be used for COVID-19 related costs.

Joe Biden gets Bernie Sanders’ votes wrong on auto bailout
","As the United States faces economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders argued about their past records on bailouts following the 2008 financial collapse. Sanders said that he voted against the 2008 bailout while Biden supported it. Biden then countered: ""Part of that was bailing out the automobile industry — saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. (Sanders) voted against that as well."" Sanders interjected: ""No, I did not vote against that. That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry."" We found that both Biden and Sanders are only telling part of the story about Sanders’ votes. RELATED: Bernie Sanders overstates recession aid to Wall Street banks In October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry. That December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry. But the measure failed in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to allocate some of the TARP funds to General Motors and Chrysler. Just days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the funds went out to the banks and motor companies. So Sanders had two opportunities to show support on the auto bailout: in December 2008, when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout, and again in January 2009, when members considered blocking TARP funds. Sanders voted in favor of the December separate auto bailout and against the January measure. After the favorable December vote, Sanders spoke in an interview about the value of automobile industry jobs, which he described historically as the ""gold standard for manufacturing workers"" due to the good wages, benefits and strong union. Sanders told Vermont Public Radio that he supported the measure because ""I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls."" However, Sanders voted to block the release of the second half of the TARP funding, including the auto bailout funds. (Sanders opposed the initial TARP bill in October.) Sanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed. ""I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law,"" he said in a statement. ""I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression."" Auto companies ended up receiving about $85 billion in TARP funds, according to the New York Times. Biden said that Sanders voted against the auto bailout. Sanders did vote against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout — though the funds’ primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed. But Biden left listeners with the impression that Sanders’ opposed bailing out the auto industry. Sanders voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed.

Ad Watch: Biden video twists Trump’s words on coronavirus
","In a video tweeted March 3, Joe Biden’s campaign made it look like President Donald Trump called the 2019 coronavirus outbreak a ""hoax."" ""I’ll be damned if I’m going to lose my country to this man at all,"" Biden says at the start of the ad, which has been viewed more than 336,000 times. The video cycles through a slew of soundbites from Trump. One clip shows the president’s Feb. 28 rally in North Charleston, S.C. ""Coronavirus — this is their new hoax,"" Trump is pictured saying. The video makes it seem like Trump is calling the disease itself a hoax, which he hasn’t done. The words are Trump’s, but the editing is Biden’s. During the North Charleston rally, there was nearly a minute between when Trump said ""coronavirus"" and ""hoax."" Here is the full context of his remarks: ""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. They can’t even count their votes in Iowa. They can’t even count. No, they can’t. They can’t count their votes. ""One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.’ That didn’t work out too well.

""I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing,"" he said, referring to Democrats. ""That's the hoax."" Trump’s comments feed into a conspiracy theory that claims Democrats and the media are fabricating the threat of COVID-19 to hurt the economy and, by extension, the president’s re-election chances. And the president appeared to downplay the threat of the virus at several points in recent weeks. But the Biden campaign’s ad is misleading.

Fact-checking Trump’s attacks on Obama-Biden swine flu response
","President Donald Trump went on Twitter to applaud his administration’s response to the coronavirus and shift attention to another pandemic that happened when Joe Biden was vice president. The first U.S. case of a new H1N1 influenza virus (also called swine flu) was detected in April 2009, three months after the Obama administration began. The pandemic took a toll on Americans, with an estimated 60.8 million H1N1 cases and 12,469 deaths from April 2009 to April 2010. Worldwide, it’s estimated the virus killed between 151,700 to 575,400 people during its first year. (By August 2010, the World Health Organization said the virus had largely run its course.) Trump said Biden, a top Democratic presidential candidate, led an ineffective effort to combat the outbreak. ""Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!"" Trump tweeted March 12.

Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest! Trump previously falsely claimed the Obama administration ""didn't do anything about"" swine flu. How does his recent tweet line up with the facts? He’s wrong about Biden’s role and omitted important context about his polling. ""Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people."" Biden was the vice president, but he was not in charge of the Obama administration’s handling of the H1N1 pandemic. That responsibility mainly fell on the leaders of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Trump enlisted Vice President Mike Pence to helm the country’s response to COVID-19.) Health policy experts told PolitiFact they did not recall Biden having a prominent leadership role. PolitiFact also reviewed archives of Obama’s public statements on H1N1 and found that Obama generally mentioned the leadership of department heads and of his homeland security adviser, not Biden. RELATED FACT-CHECK: Trump wrongly blames Obama for limits on coronavirus testing At the same time, Biden’s website mentions the Obama administration's record to make the argument to voters that he could manage the current response better. Biden’s coronavirus response plan says he ""helped lead"" the Obama administration’s response to H1N1 in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. It does not offer further detail. The H1N1 response ""was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!"" Neither the White House nor Trump’s campaign responded to our requests for information backing Trump’s claim. If Trump was talking about public confidence in the federal government’s ability to handle outbreaks, he might have been referring to a Gallup poll taken Feb. 3-16. But he isn’t correct about its findings and ignores key context. A lot has happened since Gallup asked a random sample of 1,028 adults how confident they were that the federal government would be able to handle a coronavirus outbreak. Trump’s ""78% approval rating"" could be alluding to the combined 77% who were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%). The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. Gallup in February said that the 77% figure showed a higher level of confidence than Gallup had found for previous health scares during other administrations. But confidence in the 2009 H1N1 response was the second highest, not ""one of the worst on record."" The averages of two polls in 2009 showed that 67% of respondents were very confident or somewhat confident in the federal government’s ability to handle the H1N1 outbreak. Those two polls were released in May and August of that year, about a month and four months into the outbreak. Public confidence in the federal government’s handling of the Zika virus, Ebola virus, and bird flu were lower than for H1N1. Gallup’s February poll began days after the Trump administration announced restrictions on travelers who had been in China in the prior two weeks, and at that time, no one had died within the United States from the disease caused by the new coronavirus. ""This high level of confidence may be related to the fact that all deaths from COVID-19 have occurred abroad, rather than on U.S. soil,"" Gallup said in February. By the time of Trump’s March 12 tweet, there were more than 1,600 coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 41 deaths. Polling done after Gallup’s shows a drop in confidence in the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus. A Feb. 28-March 1 Morning Consult survey showed that 49% of voters approved of Trump’s response to the outbreak, down from 56% in a Feb. 24-26 survey — a decline fueled by drops among independents and Democrats. The poll surveyed 1,997 registered voters and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points. Trump said, ""Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!

How the Utah Jazz got 58 coronavirus tests when US testing is sluggish
","The novel coronavirus reached the NBA this week, with Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert testing positive in Oklahoma City moments before the Jazz were set to tip off against the Thunder. The development led the NBA to suspend its season. The Jazz said in a statement that after diagnostic tests were administered to team players, staff and traveling beat reporters, only one of the reported 58 people tested in connection with Gobert — guard Donovan Mitchell, who confirmed his positive test on Instagram — was found to be carrying COVID-19. The Jazz’s quick access to 58 coronavirus tests seemed at odds with the fact that the United States has lagged behind other countries where testing has been more widespread.  ""Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58?"" said Michael Dougherty, a senior writer for the National Review, in a March 12 tweet.  Some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58? If tests are going to remain scarce, how they're distributed will be a subject not just of controversy, but of fury and reprisal. https://t.co/Eip3nNOOXR We wondered how the Jazz team personnel got their hands on COVID-19 tests in a matter of hours, and what kind of access states have had to testing by comparison. We found that Dougherty’s claim lined up with the information that’s available, despite some murkiness around the number of tests that have been conducted across the country. After a sprinting medical staffer alerted referees to Gobert’s confirmed infection minutes before the game was supposed to start, the state of Oklahoma quickly completed tests for 58 people close to the organization who had come in contact with Gobert.   The results for those 58 people came back within nine to 10 hours, said Andy Larsen, a Jazz beat writer for the Salt Lake Tribune who was tested for having been in recent contact with Gobert. The process was fast, with medical professionals taking throat and sinus swabs from the team personnel at the arena, Larsen said. ""It really only does take like two minutes,"" he said. The specimens were then shipped to Oklahoma’s public health lab, where they were tested overnight using test kits provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Jaime Dukes, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Dukes told us the Oklahoma lab has been running tests since March 6, and that the lab has completed roughly 150 tests since then, including the tests on the Jazz personnel.  That means many of the tests in Oklahoma were completed in one night. Dukes said that’s because Oklahoma has been following the CDC’s case-definition requirements, which currently say that clinicians should use judgment to decide if a symptomatic patient should be tested. Clinicians are supposed to prioritize people with serious symptoms, people who are older or have underlying medical conditions, and people who had close contact with a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient or recently traveled to an affected area, according to the CDC. ""That honestly was the first incident we’ve had where 58 people at one time needed to be tested,"" Dukes said. ""We’ve been meeting the demand, but we are being very clear about our criteria for testing."" NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Oklahoma health officials directed the Jazz testing without intervention from the NBA, and that there was ""nothing we did to accelerate it."" But state epidemiologist Laurence Burnsed, speaking at a March 12 press conference, said the NBA has ""policies in place"" that helped Gobert get tested quickly. NBA team trainers regularly monitor players for illness and work with local physicians when needed, Burnsed said. According to the Associated Press, a number of other NBA franchises are having employees self-quarantine or get tested after coming into contact with Gobert and Mitchell in recent weeks.  It’s hard to precisely say how many tests the U.S. has administered, in part because the CDC has outsourced some responsibility to states as well as private, academic and commercial labs. There’s no centralized database tracking everything. Testing in the U.S. was slowed from the get-go by flaws with the government’s early test kits and barriers that have been relaxed but still limit who can get tested.  Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said March 7 that public health labs have the ability to test a total of 75,000 people.  He also said 1.1 million tests had been shipped to private labs, with another roughly 1 million on the way and still more to come from other academic and commercial labs. The U.S. took another step toward increasing its capabilities on March 13 when it gave over $1 million to two companies to develop new, one-hour tests. It’s not clear that those capabilities are being met, however.  According to a tracker from the American Enterprise Institute, the different labs running tests throughout the U.S. should have been capable of cumulatively testing more than 25,000 per day, at least as of March 13.

Updated to reflect #coronavirus testing lab capacity at Assurance Scientific Labs and increased capacity in CA public health labs, Stanford, and NorthShore University HealthSystems pic.twitter.com/mEZgrkHbUF Plus, the number of tests isn’t the same as the number of people who have been tested. Not everyone seeking a coronavirus test can get one. Even sick people have been denied. As of March 12, the CDC’s website said it had tested roughly 3,903 specimens in CDC labs, plus about 9,721 in public health labs across the U.S.’s various states.  Those numbers, while incomplete, pale in comparison with countries like South Korea, which ramped up testing weeks ago by setting up drive-thru screening clinics. ""Widespread testing was a key component of China and South Korea's response strategy,"" said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Both countries have made significant progress in controlling their outbreaks."" The U.S. pace has been more sluggish. Dougherty told us his claim could be traced to early March reports from the Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, which said public health labs in states such as Hawaii and Arkansas were capable at the time of running fewer than 50 tests per day. Dougherty also cited a recent report from Yahoo News, which relied on state and federal data from the COVID Tracking Project, a project of the Atlantic run by reporters and data scientists.  The project tracks the numbers presented on state government websites to provide a more accurate overall testing count. (While the CDC website highlights the number of specimens tested, the COVID Tracking Project tracks the number of people.) The Yahoo News article noted that the COVID Tracking Project counted 2,728 people tested by states and the District of Columbia on March 10, for an average of less than 55 per state. Some states tested fewer than 50 that day, according to the project’s tally. The project reported that 2,219 people were tested by states on March 11, or roughly 43 people per state.  Our daily 4pm ET update is out. The topline number is not good: ~10000 people tested, according to our state-level data, which cannot track all negative tests. That's a smaller day-over-day increase than yesterday.The ramp is not happening fast enough. https://t.co/Zc39AZVRge pic.twitter.com/2UfGBYOifc Dougherty said ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day, and the Utah Jazz got 58."" Oklahoma public health officials quickly completed tests on 58 people who had had recent contact with Gobert, the Jazz’s center, after he tested positive for COVID-19.  It’s not clear how many tests each state is running per day. But Dougherty’s claim that ""some states are only getting 50 tests per day"" lines up with what had been reported at the time the claim was made.

Are 80 percent of coronavirus cases ""mild?""
","Amid the spread of the novel coronavirus, many people are wondering how likely they are to get it. Often, their second question is: If I get coronavirus, how likely am I to survive it? One chart, created by the website Information is Beautiful, says that 80% of coronavirus cases are ""mild."" So is that true? The chart is a tad misleading. It makes a blanket statement about the virus while basing its claim on a study by China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and a website called Statistica. The post doesn’t include links to the reports. An important note: The percentage of mild cases shouldn’t be confused with your likelihood of surviving a stint of the virus, also known as COVID-19. Mortality rates differ depending on a person’s age and health. The virus is relatively new. So there’s a lot researchers have yet to nail down. That said, the post is mostly consistent with available data. In February, CNN reported on the release of the study conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology. The study itself said that in confirmed coronavirus cases, 70% were ""normal,"" 25.5% were ""severe"" and 4.5% were ""light."" But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of World Health Organization, said during a press conference on Feb. 17 that more than 80% of patients ""have mild disease and will recover."" Meanwhile, 13.8% of cases suffer severe symptoms and 6.1% are critical. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website on March 13 said a ""complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully known."" However, the CDC said ""most cases"" are mild, citing a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. That study looked at medical records for coronavirus patients documented by the National Health Commission between Dec. 11 and Jan. 29. ""On admission, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized as nonsevere in 926 patients and severe in 173 patients,"" the study reads. That means 84 percent were considered non-severe. Age and baseline health were factors in whether a patient’s illness became severe, the study said.  ""Patients with severe disease were older than those with nonsevere disease by a median of seven years. Moreover, the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease,"" it said. The chart says 80.9% of cases are mild. It’s important to note that different age groups have had different levels of severity. However, generally speaking, the chart is on track. We found that mild cases account for roughly 75-to-80% of cases, according to studies published by the WHO and CDC. The statement is mostly accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/13/viral-image/are-80-percent-coronavirus-cases-mild/

No, ICE didn’t arrest the mayor of Los Angeles
","You might expect a website called Dachshund Daily to have, we don’t know, puppy photos, or live coverage of the wiener dog races that happen every year in Buda, Texas. Lovers of this long-bodied breed will find no such reporting here.  Instead, there’s a fake story about ICE arresting the mayor of Los Angeles and a bunch of links that lead to ads.  ""Joseph Barron, the praised chairman of Los Angeles County, was driven away from his office in binds today by ICE specialists and accused of harboring outlaws from the law with his choice to give undocumented settlers shelter under his ‘Asylum City’ assignment,"" says the story, which sounds very much like it was treated to a few spins through Google Translate. ""Barron appeared to see his problem as interesting, as he grinned and yelled ‘ATTICA! ATTICA!’ while being directed to a holding up vehicle."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The mayor of Los Angeles is, of course, not ""Joseph Barron."" It’s Eric Garcetti, and he wasn’t arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  It seems this story originated on a self-described satire website, though that version described the arrest of Josiah Barron, ""the celebrated mayor of Los Angeles County.""

Fact-checking Trump campaign claim on Biden’s 2009 swine flu comments
","President Donald Trump’s answer to criticism of the U.S. coronavirus response is partly that Joe Biden wouldn’t do any better. Trump points, sometimes wrongly, to Obama-era history, when Joe Biden was the new vice president and the country was dealing with swine flu.  On Twitter, an account managed by Trump’s campaign went on the defensive with an attack on Biden’s handling of the H1N1 virus, just hours before Biden announced what he thought the Trump administration should be doing. That March 12 tweet from @TrumpWarRoom says: ""Joe Biden will again politicize coronavirus today. But his record on pandemics is one of incompetence. During the 2009 swine flu outbreak, Biden made reckless comments unsupported by science & the experts. The Obama Admin had to clean up his mess & apologize for his ineptitude."" Biden’s statement had to do with the way germs travel through an aircraft. We fact-checked his statement and rated it Pants on Fire back in 2009.  We decided to take a fresh look at the Trump team’s tweet in 2020. Joe Biden will again politicize coronavirus today. But his record on pandemics is one of incompetence.During the 2009 swine flu outbreak, Biden made reckless comments unsupported by science & the experts.The Obama Admin had to clean up his mess & apologize for his ineptitude. pic.twitter.com/5TCKZeShkz The swine flu epidemic, or H1N1, was detected in the U.S. in April 2009. The first cases were found in Mexico before rapidly spreading around the world. The U.S. declared a public health emergency on April 26, and President Barack Obama upped that to a national emergency in late October.  Biden went on the Today Show on April 30, 2009, to talk about the outbreak. Then-host Matt Lauer asked Biden, ""If a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?"" Biden said he would tell them not to be in a confined place, and he gave his reason. ""It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft,"" Biden said. ""When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft."" He said he would not suggest taking the subway, either. ""If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing."" Biden’s comment drew criticism over fear-mongering, particularly from the travel industry, and experts told us Biden got it wrong. In our 2009 fact-check, we consulted Dr. Tony Overfelt from Auburn University’s National Air Transportation Center, which specializes in studying aircraft environment. At the time, Overfelt said that the air in a commercial jet flows from vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze ""might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,"" Overfelt said. ""They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.""  The tweet said the Obama administration had to ""clean up"" Biden’s mess and ""apologize for his ineptitude."" There was cleanup, including a half-hearted apology if anyone was ""unduly alarmed."" A spokesperson for Biden’s office released a statement hours later to clarify what he said. They said Biden’s advice lined up with the administration’s: that people should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico.  ""If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways,"" the statement said. ""This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week."" Biden’s presidential campaign declined to comment. As shown in the Trump Warm Room tweet, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs responded to Biden’s remark in the White House briefing. ""I think what the vice president meant to say was the same thing that, again, many members have said in the last few days, and that is, if you feel sick, if you are exhibiting symptoms, flu-like symptoms — coughing, sneezing, runny nose — that you should take precautions, that you should limit your travel,"" Gibbs said on April 30. A reporter then says that wasn’t ""remotely close"" to what Biden said, to which Gibbs responded:  ""I understand what he said and I'm telling you what he meant to say ... Obviously if anybody was unduly alarmed for whatever reason, we would apologize for that and I hope that my remarks and remarks of the people of the CDC and Secretary Napolitano have appropriately cleared up what he meant to say."" A Twitter account run by the Trump campaign tweeted that, during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, Biden made ""reckless comments"" unsupported by science and the Obama Administration had to clean up the mess and apologize for it.  During a television interview, Biden said he would advise his family not to travel in confined places, and claimed that when one person sneezes ""it goes all the way through an aircraft."" His comments were met with backlash for inducing fear, and his spokesperson issued a statement to clarify his words. Experts said the statement on how germs travel was inaccurate. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/13/donald-trump/fact-checking-trump-campaign-claim-bidens-2009-swi/
