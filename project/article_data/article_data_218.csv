Donald Trump claims Obama spent $2 million in legal fees defending birth certificate lawsuits
","Among those who challenge President Barack Obama's citizenship, one claim is often raised: Why would Obama spend millions of dollars defending against the lawsuits instead of simply producing his original birth certificate?

That argument took on renewed life recently when it was cited by potential GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.

And the argument is almost always attached to a specific figure: $2 million.

In an interview on NBC's Today show, for example, Trump said Obama ""spent $2 million in legal fees trying to get away from this issue."" He repeated the figure in a CNN interview on April 10, 2011. ""I just say very simply why doesn't he show his birth certificate?"" Trump asked. ""Why has he spent over $2 million in legal fees to keep this quiet and to keep this silent?""

(For some background on the underpinnings of the dispute over Obama birth certificate, start here).

In a Fox News appearance on April 10, 2011, Palin echoed the figure while praising Trump's efforts. Trump is ""paying for researchers to find out why President Obama would have to spend $2 million to not show his birth certificate,"" Palin said. ""So more power to him.""

It's certainly true that the Obama campaign has spent some amount of money opposing an array of lawsuits brought by people who claim that Obama has failed to produce a legitimate birth certificate and is therefore ineligible to serve as president. But has the president spent $2 million?

We contacted Trump's office to find out where he got the number, but we did not receive a response. Others who have used the number have cited a story from WorldNetDaily, a conservative news website that has served as a venue for news and commentary about the birth certificate controversy.

In an Oct. 27, 2009, article, WND reported that, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the Obama campaign had paid approximately $1.7 million to the campaign's law firm, Perkins Coie, since Obama was elected.

So that's where we started our research. We did our own tally of payments made to Perkins Coie, all of which were reported, as required by law, in quarterly disbursement reports filed to the FEC by his campaign organization, Obama for America. We found that in the last quarter of 2008 -- which is roughly the period after Obama was elected in early November -- and the first three quarters of 2009, which is when WND wrote its story, Obama for America did, in fact, pay Perkins Coie $1.7 million. If you add in the payments made in subsequent months, the fees paid to Perkins Coie between October 2008 and December 2010 rises to $2.6 million.

But what does that $2.6 million number mean? Not what Trump and others have assumed.

Specifically, the payments by Obama for America to Perkins Coie covered all sorts of legal expenses -- not just expenses related to birth certificate issues.

The FEC forms do not specify what each payment specifically went for, since that degree of detail is not required by law. We also couldn't get additional details from Perkins Coie or the Democratic National Committee about how the legal fees were spent.

However, DNC National Press Secretary Hari Sevugan told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in a March 31, 2011, story that ""the campaign has incurred ordinary legal expenses related to the wind-down of its operations and other legal services, which all campaigns incur, and which are proportional to the unprecedented size of this campaign."" (The Obama campaign raised upwards of $750 million -- a record.)

For the sake of comparison, the Roll Call story noted that the campaign for Obama's 2008 Republican opponent John McCain -- which was a smaller operation -- had spent more than $1.3 million on lawyers since the election.

In the interview with Roll Call, Sevugan confirmed that some of the legal fees were needed to defend the campaign against what he called ""unmeritorious"" lawsuits, including one that challenged Obama’s citizenship. And WND reported that Perkins Coie attorney Robert Bauer wrote at least one letter to challenge a plaintiff, retired military officer Gregory S. Hollister, who had filed a suit raising questions about the legitimacy of Obama's right to hold the office of president. WND reported that Bauer -- who later left Perkins Coie to serve as White House counsel -- wrote to Hollister's attorney that ""the suit is frivolous and should not be pursued. Should you decline to withdraw this frivolous appeal, please be informed that we intend to pursue sanctions, including costs, expenses and attorneys' fees...."" Still, there are clearly lots of other expenses incurred by the Obama campaign's legal team that have nothing to do with the citizenship question. For instance, the Republican National Committee filed a complaint with the FEC claiming that the Obama campaign had accepted donations from foreign nationals, among other alleged campaign finance infractions. All told, Roll Call reported that ""the FEC has written 26 letters — totaling more than 1,500 pages — to the Obama campaign questioning its reports and outlining a flurry of compliance concerns.""

After we looked through court records and spoke to experts in the field, we found insufficient evidence to support the claim that Obama for America spent $2 million solely on birth-certificate-related work.

Four campaign-finance experts we interviewed all agreed that after the campaign was over, a law firm in Perkins Coie’s situation would have a full plate of legal work to do that had nothing to do with birth certificate questions. Two of the experts who took this position have represented Republicans -- Trevor Potter, a campaign finance lawyer who worked for the 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns of John McCain and the 1988 campaign of George H.W. Bush, and Robert Kelner, who has represented the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. A third attorney who agreed, Allison R. Hayward, is the vice president of policy for the Center for Competitive Politics, which filed an amicus brief opposing the Obama administration’s position in the landmark Citizens United Supreme Court case, which ended a broad swath of campaign finance restrictions.

""FEC audits and/or enforcement matters can take several years -- most are still open from the 2008 election,"" said Potter, general counsel to the Campaign Legal Center. ""Various criminal investigations of donors may require campaign responses. Lawsuits against the campaign, campaign staff, and/or the candidate take time to defend. Vendor disputes may exist and require settlement.""

""Law firms representing presidential campaigns typically are very busy in the one to two years following the campaign,"" said Brett Kappel, a lawyer with the firm Arent Fox LLP who specializes in campaign finance law. ""First, there are all the legal issues involved in closing down the campaign –- resolving disputes with vendors, preparation for the FEC audit and so on. Second, the one to two years after the campaign is over are typically when all the FEC complaints that were filed against the campaign are resolved, and that’s certainly been the case with the 2008 Obama campaign.""

We should note that, since Obama was elected, a number of federal cases related to the birth certificate issue -- including several filed by or with the assistance of California attorney Orly Taitz, a leader among Obama birth certificate questioners -- have been handled by federal attorneys, including those with the U.S. Department of Justice. Several of these cases were dismissed almost immediately. Others were active for up to a year but were ultimately dismissed and then, in some cases, appealed. The case in which Bauer wrote the letter to the plaintiff was dismissed twice by the Supreme Court.

We interpret the quotations by Trump and Palin to mean payments made by Obama in a personal capacity, not in cases where he's represented in an official capacity by government lawyers. For one thing, both Trump and Palin used the term ""legal fees,"" which would be irrelevant in a case defended by government lawyers. Federal attorneys are paid a salary by the taxpayers, and they do not charge their ""client"" -- in this case, the president -- fees for representation. If these attorneys weren't working on birth certificate cases, they'd be working on some other case for the same salary.

So that leaves the funds paid to Perkins Coie. Trump's and Palin's claims assume that the vast majority of the money paid to Perkins Coie since the election was used to defend against lawsuits challenging Obama's citizenship. We agree that some amount of money was spent in legal fees related to those lawsuits -- the letter from Bauer to the plaintiff is an example of that. But, while we don't know exactly how much the Obama camp spent on their private lawyers, there were many, many non-birth-certificate duties that a law firm typically handles in the wake of a presidential campaign, which suggests that any birth certificate work was a small percentage of the overall fees paid to Perkins Coie.

When fact-checking, we think the onus is on the person making the claim to back up his statement. And the only backing we've seen in this case is that the Obama campaign's legal team spent more than $2 million on legal fees since the election ended. It's clear to us that the WND story has been twisted to wrongly assume that every dollar the Obama campaign spent on legal fees went to fight the release of Obama's birth certificate. The evidence shows that's simply not true. It's a huge, unsubstantiated leap to assume that all, or most, of that was related to lawsuits about Obama's citizenship. We rule Trump's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74d49c90-3e18-4dfd-9bd9-2fbde85d90cd",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B35540>],/factchecks/2011/apr/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-obama-has-spent-2-million-lega/

Robert Hurt says cap and trade would cost 50,000 Virginia jobs
","
U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt, R-Va., took time out from the budget showdown March 25 to express his contempt for cap-and-trade legislation aimed at regulating and lowering greenhouse emissions.

In a newsletter to his 5th District constituents, Hurt detailed his efforts to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. The freshman congressman wrote he is ""a co-sponsor of H.R. 153, which would prohibit any funds at the EPA from being used to implement a cap-and-trade system that would harm our agriculture and manufacturing sectors, destroy over 50,000 jobs in Virginia, and amount to a job-crushing national energy tax when we can least afford it.""

A cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey passed the House during the prior Congress, only to die in the Senate. With the GOP now holding a majority in the House, the bill is generally considered dead. But Hurt’s claim that the legislation would cause more than 50,000 people to lose their jobs caught our eye.

First, a word on how cap-and-trade would work. Each company with major greenhouse gas emissions would be subject to a cap on its emissions. Companies producing fewer emissions than their limit could trade or sell their extra emissions credits to companies exceeding the cap.

The trading system would create a market for greenhouse gas emissions and give companies incentives to lower their emissions levels, since a cut in emissions could be turned into profits from the sale of extra credits. Each credit would cover one metric ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas and carry a price between $48 and $61 around 2020.

The Waxman-Markey bill would have gradually lowered emission limits for companies. By 2020, U.S. emissions would be capped 17 percent below 2005 levels. In 2030, the level would be 42 percent below 2005 levels and 83 percent lower by 2050.

Hurt drew his job-loss estimate from the National Association of Manufacturers, a business group opposed to the bill. NAM estimated that by 2030 Virginia could lose between 41,400 and 56,400 jobs because of the legislation, including lost mining jobs and positions lost if higher electricity prices cut back on manufacturing output. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has also cited the report in making almost identical claims as Hurt.

NAM’s analysis projects Virginia would see higher energy prices under the bill, since the state’s electric utilities rely heavily on coal-fired power plants. The plants produce high levels of greenhouse gasses and might need to be retooled or replaced with non-emitting power sources -- such as nuclear plants or wind turbines -- to help Dominion Virginia Power or other utilities comply with the proposed law.

If the utility companies continued to use coal plants, they might need to purchase extra carbon permits, again leading to an additional cost that could raise prices. These higher electricity prices, in turn, could force job cuts in the coal mining and manufacturing sectors, the report says.  

But independent experts and the federal Energy Information Agency say it is extremely difficult to calculate the bill’s long-term impact on employment. An EIA report notes the difficulty of predicting the price and availability of renewable energy sources in 2030. If cheaper wind and solar power became available, higher electricity prices may not be a major issue under the bill.

Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, said it is ""not unreasonable to expect job losses in several sectors ... especially coal, unless we come up with some genuine clean coal technology.""

But Frankel said the NAM report cannot really make an accurate jobs forecast for 2030 when economists often struggle to make employment predictions more than 6 or 12 months in advance. The economist also said the NAM analysis ignores the jobs that would be created due to a growth in new, non-emission technologies.

""My feeling, as I think most economists would agree, is that the jobs created would approximately equal the jobs lost,"" he said.

Charles Kolstad, a professor of environmental economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, added that ""long range forecasts of unemployment are highly suspect. Sectors change, people change jobs. Unemployment is by its nature transitory.""

The Congressional Budget Office, the independent research and analysis arm of Congress, notes in a report that cap-and-trade could shift demand away from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. The CBO said jobs in coal mining and at coal-fired power plants could decrease  unless new technology is able to capture emissions.

But the CBO also expects employment to increase in sectors that require fewer emissions, such as nuclear, solar and wind power. Its report says the Waxman-Markey system, where carbon caps tighten over several decades, ""would probably have only a small effect on total employment.""

As the CBO and Kolstad noted, the U.S. economy is adept at retooling to meet new challenges. Manufacturing employment fell by about 3.5 million jobs from 2000 through 2007, but employment in other sectors increased by 8.2 million jobs in that period, continuing the 40-year shift in America’s economy from manufacturing jobs to service jobs. Though workers who lose coal mining or other fossil fuel-related jobs may need retraining before finding a new position, the CBO predicts that ""most laid-off workers would find employment in other industries whose products are less emission-intensive.""

One potential problem, however, is the risk that job losses would be concentrated in small communities, such as those scattered across Virginia’s coal belt, where other job opportunities are limited. This could force workers to relocate to find new work. The National Mining Association reports Virginia had about 4,650 coal miners in 2009, compared with 21,665 in West Virginia and more than 18,000 in Kentucky.

The Virginia Employment Commission reported the state had an average of 8,748 coal-mining and natural-gas jobs in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent period for which data are available. The VEC also says Virginia had about 230,700 manufacturing jobs as of February, and the NAM believes some of those could be threatened by higher energy prices.

The mining jobs are concentrated in the Southwest Virginia district represented by Republican H. Morgan Griffith. Hurt’s district contains manufacturing jobs as well as three power plants, according to EIA records.

Let’s review our findings.

Hurt, citing solely from a short report by the National Association of Manufacturers, says a cap-and-trade bill would cost Virginia 50,000 jobs. The NAM is an opponent of the legislation.

The non-partisan CBO acknowledges there would likely be job losses in certain mining and manufacturing sectors under a cap-and-trade bill. But unlike the NAM, the CBO accounts for jobs that would be gained in new sectors.

Independent analysts also predict cap-and-trade would have a far smaller impact on Virginia employment than projected by NAM. They also note long-range employment projections can be dicey.

A thorough economic analysis should consider both gains and losses from a policy. The NAM report fails to do that.

Hurt’s statement, based on the study, omits critical facts. We rate it Barely True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973FA400>],/factchecks/2011/apr/12/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-cap-and-trade-would-cost-50000-vi/
"['National', 'State Budget', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Tim Pawlenty said in 2009, ""we cut state spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years""
","
As part of his push for the presidency in 2012, Tim Pawlenty makes the case in his book Courage to Stand that he is a tested fiscal conservative. 
""Contrary to liberal rhetoric, spending cuts are not impossible. Take Minnesota, for example"" he writes in his book’s conclusion. ""I lowered the average growth of annual spending during my time as Governor to just under 2 percent and balanced the budget without raising taxes. In 2009, we cut spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years.""

Pawlenty was governor of Minnesota from 2003 to 2011, serving two terms. Here, we’re checking Pawlenty’s statement that he ""cut spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years.""

Minnesota celebrated its 150th anniversary of statehood in 2008, but we should note it’s not possible to look at 150 years of state fiscal data. Minnesota Management and Budget, the state’s fiscal information agency, keeps stats only back to 1960. We asked the Pawlenty campaign whether they had more historical data, but we didn't hear back.

Looking at those stats, we can see that the 2010-2011 budget cycle -- a two-year budget referred to as a biennium -- marked the first drop in state spending since 1960, when state spending declined 10.9 percent.

Budget figures are available on an annual basis as well. By those numbers, the 2010 general fund budget year (which starts July 1, 2009), was not the first year spending dropped. Spending also dropped in 2009, 2004, 1986 and 1983, although it was up for the two-year cycles that included those years.

Finally, we should note that the 2010-2011 budget biennium was helped by a few factors.

Minnesota Management and Budget  said the state had used several mechanisms to put off state spending. That included $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate postponements in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion. Those fixes went away the next budget cycle, and the budget agency projects a significant spending increase of 29.3 percent for the biennium.

In rating this statement, we find that Pawlenty did reduce spending for the two-year budget cycle for the first time since 1960. But there were several single-year decreases, two during Pawlenty’s tenure as governor (2009 and 2004), but also two before he was governor (1986 and 1983). The major reduction in the 2010-2011 budget cycle was achieved with a one-time infusion of federal dollars and measures that delayed state spending rather then permanently reducing it. Finally, we don't have 150 years of budget data to check. We only found data back to 1960, and Pawlenty's campaign provided no data to back up the claim covering the 100 years previous when we asked for it. If data emerges, we're willing to review the claim. But given the evidence at hand, we rate Pawlenty’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BEF8C0>],/factchecks/2011/apr/12/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-2009-we-cut-state-spending-real-/
"['Jobs', 'Florida', 'Pink Slip Rick']","
Pink Slip Rick group says 'jobs governor' lost 331,247 jobs
","
As the grand marshal of a Tallahassee parade, Florida Gov. Rick Scott smiled and waved to crowds lined up along the route for ""Springtime Tallahassee,"" an annual Capital City celebration on April 2, 2011. Some people in the crowd, though, weren’t exactly waving back -- at least, not with their hands. 
Hundreds wielded ""Pink Slip Rick"" picket signs and booed. Their posters were hard to ignore, and not just for an eye-catching splash of hot pink. The signs accuse Scott of losing 331,247 jobs. 
This number stirred our curiosity for a few reasons. One, it's oddly precise. Also, it’s huge! How could Scott, the self-proclaimed ""Jobs Governor"" who swore to bring 700,000 jobs to the Sunshine State in seven years, eliminate hundreds of thousands of positions so quickly? 
We thought we'd begin by checking Florida's most recent unemployment statistics. The state's unemployment rate fell by 0.4 percent from January 2011, when Scott was inaugurated, to February 2011, hitting 11.5 percent. Interestingly, the number of non-agricultural jobs increased by 22,700 in that span. 
We took a closer look. 
The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, an upstart progressive group that also had a hand in the Dirty Hari website targeting Mike Haridopolos, Florida Senate president and U.S. Senate candidate. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife to Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. (Remember the ""Taliban Dan"" ad?)

PinkSlipRick.com offers a ""Get The Facts"" page, breaking down how it reaches 331,247 lost jobs, with linked sources copied here:

• 135,000 jobs from moving Medicaid to a state-run program

• 113,065 construction jobs from Scott stalling SunRail contract

• 1,849 in layoffs from Department of Children and Families, as outlined in Scott’s proposed budget

• 20,000 teacher layoffs, per Scott’s budget proposal

• 49,900 job losses for rejecting high-speed rail

• 1,690 jobs cut from state prison system 
We have an immediate problem, as those figures fall short of Pink Slip Rick's count by about 9,700 jobs. Randolph sent us a spreadsheet accounting for more ""lost jobs,"" and we’ll get into those in a second. 
Medicaid: Scott wants to turn over more control of the state-administered Medicaid system to managed-care companies, namely HMOs, to save state money. But the federal government, which pays for more than half of the program, needs to sign off on major changes such as these, and getting a waiver isn't so easy. 
The Florida Senate has proposed withdrawing from the Medicaid program if the federal government doesn't approve of its new bill to expand managed care. The House, which also wants more HMO involvement, has made no such proposal to withdraw from federal oversight of Medicaid. The governor's team has discussed the merits of withdrawing, but the governor has made no such proposal and hasn't spoken in favor of it. 
His health and human services transition team recommended expanding a current Medicaid waiver for a small pilot program to statewide, but Scott said at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27 that he would prefer a block grant of federal money for Medicaid. ""You give me a block grant, let me do whatever I want, and I will cover the right people,"" he said. 
Pink Slip Rick attributes the loss of 135,000 jobs to a January 2011 report from the Florida Center for Economic and Fiscal Policy, a Tallahassee think-tank focused on low- and moderate-income families and small businesses. According to the report, the state would lose $11.7 billion in federal matching funds and 135,000 jobs representing $5.6 billion in wages next year if it received a complete federal waiver (which is not what Scott proposed). 
The exact number of eliminated jobs -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc. -- would depend on several political variables and business-related decisions, said the report's author, the center's House policy analyst Greg Mellowe. He's also the policy director of Florida CHAIN, a liberal health advocacy group. The prospects of receiving a federal waiver this year are next to impossible, he said, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services won't make a decision on a waiver until June. That's too late for the legislative session, which ends May 6. 
Given the improbability of obtaining a waiver for expansion, and that Mellowe's estimate of lost jobs would only happen with a total federal waiver (which isn't on the table), Mellowe said it isn't fair to include his estimate of 135,000 into Pink Slip Rick's tally. ""No one thinks this is really a reality-based scenario,"" Mellowe said. 
SunRail: Scott froze this contract as part of his review of hundreds of contracts exceeding $1 million since his inauguration. Pink Slip Rick cites a one-page summary report from the City of Orlando, which says creation of the Orlando commuter train will bring 113,065 construction jobs for transit-oriented development. We traced that figure to an executive summary of the SunRail project by the Florida Department of Transportation. The report elaborates on that estimate of construction jobs, which would be created within a half-mile of the commuter train line over 20 years. Development doesn't happen overnight. 
The estimate by Pink Slip Rick seems arbitrary, as it doesn't differentiate among direct construction jobs for the train, train operations and maintenance jobs, and indirect and direct jobs created as a result of development over time. Either way, the number of ""jobs lost"" here is unclear because the fate of SunRail is under review. Still, Pink Slip Rick counts them as lost jobs. 
Teachers and high-speed rail: PolitiFact Florida has been down these two roads before, and Pink Slip Rick.com even links to our Truth-O-Meter rulings to corroborate its count. But we find that misleading. Our stories on teacher layoffs and high-speed rail do not endorse these figures. 
We gave Florida Democratic Party chairman Rod Smith a Half True when he said Scott’s budget would lay off 20,000 teachers. One of the problems we found is that Scott's budget proposal cuts education by an amount that equals 20,000 teacher salaries -- but it doesn't specifically eliminate teacher positions. That would be up to local school districts how they handle the cuts. We also cited the constitutional classroom-size requirement as a factor that could force districts to avoid widespread layoffs, and the fact that districts will see some cost savings from teachers contributing a percentage of their salaries to their pensions. 
We also checked exaggerated job projections by U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown in the $2.4 billion high-speed rail money that Scott rejected. We found that the Florida Department of Transportation estimated that the project would have created 49,900 ""job-years"" in Florida, but a job-year is not the same as a job. Basically, it refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year. The proposed line connecting Tampa and Orlando would have created construction and construction-spinoff jobs for parts of four years, peaking at a total of 21,600 jobs in the second year of construction. Randolph's site mislabels job-years as jobs, an important distinction.

DCF and prisons: Pink Slip Rick got the number of proposed layoffs in the departments of Corrections and Children and Families right, but that doesn't mean those jobs should count as eliminated positions. Scott's budget is really a recommendation for the Legislature, which members can use, adjust or ignore as they craft the state's actual budget. 
Here's why the Pink Slip Rick figures don't add up on the web: In addition to the cuts in prisons and DCF staff, the web site counts all of Scott's proposed cuts to state government workers for the next two years. That's a total of 13,282 jobs, and it's not clear those are included because they aren't listed in the breakdown of jobs on the site. But those jobs also aren't ""lost"" either; they are in Scott's proposed budget, but that's not a fact yet. So just because we can see how Randolph got her grand total doesn't mean it reflects an accurate number of lost jobs. 
Randolph, reached by phone, says she isn’t just counting jobs already cut by Scott, as the signs claim, but jobs lost or stalled by his refusal of federal money and review of contracts, she said. 
""From where we sit, he’s turning jobs away,"" Randolph said. ""This is specifically to call him out on ‘what jobs are you creating?' "" 
But that’s not what Pink Slip Rick advertised on picket signs and online. The signs read ""Jobs Lost Under Pink Slip Rick -- 331,247."" We find this tally deceptive for its mixture of proposed layoffs and job projections. The Medicaid jobs total is based on a change that Scott isn't proposing. The SunRail jobs are still up in the air, awaiting a decision from Scott. Teachers may well be affected by the budget, but we've already ruled that 20,000 is not likely. Prison and DCF jobs depend on what the Legislature does, and that's still an unknown. As for high-speed rail, yes, we've ruled that those jobs won't be coming -- but there were only 21,600 of them at the peak of construction. 
So Pink Slip Rick has pulled together a bunch of numbers but is misrepresenting what they mean. You can't just lump the governor's cost-saving proposals, which need legislative approval and will undergo tinkering by lawmakers, and vague estimates stemming from rumored policy decisions into one sum and label it ""Jobs Lost."" We rate Pink Slip Rick's claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979EFB40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/12/pink-slip-rick/pink-slip-rick-group-says-jobs-governor-lost-33124/
"['Wisconsin', 'Candidate Biography', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Sean Duffy']","
U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy says Wisconsin state employees get far better benefits than members of Congress
","
Pressed by an underemployed constituent to defend his $174,000 salary, newly elected U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) surprised a town-hall meeting audience with a tale of personal financial woe.

The father of six said a pile of mortgage and student loan debt, the lack of a paycheck when he left his job to campaign full time and the cost of his new government-provided pension and health benefits were causing him to ""struggle to meet my bills.""

With a few more congressional paychecks under his belt, would his financial crunch ease?

""Maybe,"" Duffy told the group Feb. 23, 2011 at an Amery senior center, ""but at this point I’m not living high on the hog.""

Duffy’s comments, after getting an 86 percent pay raise from his state job as an elected district attorney in Ashland County, earned him denunciations from state and national Democrats as out of touch with his northern Wisconsin district. A video of Duffy’s comments surfaced only recently.

Duffy later said his words were ""poorly chosen,"" and his staff says he was just expressing his feelings on the transition from state to federal employee -- not complaining about his pay.

Fair enough. Duffy may indeed by having trouble making ends meet, but that’s not readily checkable.  And we’re not interested in how many miles he’s put on the used minivan he said he drives.

But one comment caught our attention:

""The benefits that were offered to me as a congressman don’t even compare to the benefits that you get as a state employee,"" said Duffy. ""I just experienced that myself. They’re not nearly as good.""

He termed the state benefits ""gold plated.""

Let’s see if Duffy is right about state vs. federal benefits.

Our first stop was Duffy. After all, he’s in the best position to explain his benefits and his finances.

In his town hall remarks, Duffy said he was now paying $600 a month -- 10 times more than the $60 a month he said he paid for his old state health plan. He also talked about retirement income. He said at the town hall session that Wisconsin paid 100 percent of his pension.

Duffy, who left a $93,662-a-year job for the state in mid-2010 to campaign for Congress, declined to tell us which of the various federal health insurance plans he had selected. He also declined to discuss specifics of his other benefits choices.

So we’ll look at the cost of the range of benefits offered to the average state employee with the average federal employee -- as well those offered to elected officials.

The two main areas, of course, are health care and retirement benefits.

Health insurance

Under Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s controversial changes, state employees would start paying more toward their health care. But Duffy left state employment last summer, so we’ll compare the state’s insurance at that point with what federal employees were offered this year.

Looking at it a couple ways, Duffy’s state health insurance was considerably cheaper.

For non-union worker, the monthly premium contribution in 2010 was at one of three levels -- $85, $188 or $448 -- depending on which plan was selected. But the vast majority of non-union state employees were in the $85 tier -- paying about 5 percent of the total premium cost. Duffy said he paid $60 a month; it’s not clear what he was referring to.

At the federal level for 2011, the most popular family plan is $431.60 a month -- which is about one-third of the total cost.

An $85 monthly payment or $431 -- that’s a big difference. And for the employee, less means more in their pocket.

But the range of employee premiums at the federal level is $170 to $693. So there are plans that are much closer to the state prices than the $600-a-month plan Duffy says he selected.

Retirement earnings

Members of Congress kick in 1.3 percent of their pay and the government puts in a bigger amount to help fund their pensions. Regular federal employees contribute 0.8 percent of pay.

So most federal employees are kicking in less than 1 percent.

By contrast, most Wisconsin state workers during Duffy’s state tenure paid 0 percent -- the state picked up the whole contribution.

So that’s a difference, though not a dramatic one.

Looking past the employee’s out of pocket costs, the state kicked in 11.6 percent of a general worker’s pay toward pensions -- almost exactly the same as general federal employees now get.

Duffy’s getting a bigger employer contribution in Congress, though, than he did from the state. It was 13.3 percent at the state and in Congress it’s 17.9 percent, based on the funding needs of their pension plans.

Finally, federal workers get an second bite of the pie: In addition to their traditional pension, they can join the Thrift Savings Plan, a retirement benefit similar to the 401(k) plans available in the private sector.

Under the plan, the federal government makes a contribution to the account equal to 1 percent of the employee’s salary even if workers contribute nothing themselves. Above that, the employee contributions are matched up to 5 percent.

So, with Duffy’s salary of $174,000, his retirement fund would get $1,740 a year even if he chooses not to set aside any funds.

The state of Wisconsin offers no such ""defined contribution"" plan to employees.

So that’s a plus for federal employees.

Let’s get to the bottom line.

New to office, Duffy was under questioning at the town hall meeting from a builder who now drives a bus for a second job. The man said his wife is a Wisconsin teacher facing benefit cuts.

Duffy said he was struggling financially due to several things, including the cost of federal fringe benefits compared with those offered by his old employer, the State of Wisconsin. He said the federal benefits ""don’t even compare"" and aren't ""nearly as good.""

Duffy apparently selected one of the higher-priced health plans, but won’t say which one, so we can’t do an exact comparison. But looking at the plans offered, we found potentially much higher health insurance costs for federal workers, depending on which plan and what level of coverage an employee wants. But we found a far less significant gap -- and some federal advantages -- on retirement benefits.

So, Duffy’s statement is generally accurate but leaves out important details. That puts his statement at Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1A9340>],/factchecks/2011/apr/12/sean-duffy/us-rep-sean-duffy-says-wisconsin-state-employees-g/

Va. Senator says fewer workers supporting more Social Security retirees
","
(Editor’s Note: This week – all week – PolitiFact Georgia is taking a look at the federal debt. You can comment on our Truth-O-Meter findings by joining our Facebook page. Hit the ""like"" button and you’re ready to comment.) 
  
A bipartisan barnstorm on the national debt swept through Atlanta on Monday, bringing unsettling news on just how far into the red the U.S. government has sunk.  

Georgia’s own U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, and U.S. Sen Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s editorial board and attendees at a Rotary Club luncheon that we need to address the national debt now.

One of the reasons is Social Security. Fewer workers are supporting a growing number of retirees. The simple math points to a disaster just down the road.

""There used to be 16 workers for every one person on Social Security. ... Now it’s three. That’s not anybody’s fault; it’s just demographics,"" Warner told the AJC’s editorial board.

Sounds bad. But is Warner right?

First, a little background. For years, no officeholder dared talk about cuts to Social Security, which was often referred to as the highly charged ""third rail"" of U.S. politics. The warning was clear: touch it and risk political death.

But the soaring federal debt has allowed politicians of all stripes to begin talking about reining in Social Security expenses. Proposals range from increasing the Social Security tax to raising the retirement age.

The problem is an aging population -- too few workers supporting too many retirees -- and a government that has borrowed heavily from the Social Security Trust Fund.

A nonpartisan General Accounting Office report recently warned: ""In the next two decades America’s population will age dramatically, and relatively fewer workers will be asked to support ever-larger costs for retirees.""

Warner warned that unless something is done, Social Security beneficiaries could see a 22 percent cut in benefits by 2037. Chambliss said the government is now writing checks out of the general fund to pay beneficiaries. About 40 cents of every dollar of that money is borrowed, he said, and the country is paying interest on that money. That inflates the federal debt.

U.S. News and World Report recently reported that last year Social Security ran its first cash deficit in more than 25 years.

""This is troubling because the federal government for years has been borrowing the system's surpluses, and now there's nothing left to borrow,"" the magazine reported. ""Worse, the government is going to have to borrow just to pay back what it owes Social Security.""

Chambliss and Warner are part of what’s informally known as the ""Gang of Six,"" a clutch of senators who are trying to garner support for cutting the debt by curbing federal expenditures and raising additional revenue.

The group also includes Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill.; Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. It has been meeting since the December release of a report by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.

That commission, convened by President Barack Obama, suggested a series of ambitious deficit-cutting reforms.

The Gang of Six is trying to garner support for its cause. It has a difficult mission. Straightening out the national debt means reforming cherished entitlement programs, including Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare health benefits for the elderly.

We interviewed experts from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute to check out Warner’s claim. They agreed with Warner’s general contention.

They said the best data come from the Social Security Administration, which says that in 1950 there were 16.5 workers for each Social Security recipient. In 2011, the ratio is 2.9 workers for each recipient.

This year, about 157 million U.S. workers support some 55 million Social Security recipients, according to the SSA’s data. In 1950, 48 million workers supported 2 million recipients.

That’s very close.

"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich says there was an informal agreement to build psychiatric hospital in Cleveland
","
Gov. John Kasich announced in his State of the State address his decision to not build a psychiatric hospital on Euclid Avenue in the Midtown area of Cleveland.

The Ohio Department of Mental Health, he said, would scrap ""some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland,"" and instead would renovate Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare's ""dilapidated"" facility in Northfield.

Kasich said he broke the news to Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson in a phone call and that Jackson responded that he understood. The result, Kasich said, will be reduced operating expenses, money saved on capital improvements and better care for the mentally ill.

Jackson subsequently said he did not acquiesce as Kasich implied. Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman, said Jackson told Kasich he understood the rationale but that he didn’t agree with the decision.

Other local officials argue that the project was not intended as a building development for Cleveland but as a service for patients and their families, most of whom are from Cuyahoga County.

PolitiFact Ohio is not weighing the merits of the two sites and plans. This item will just consider Kasich's statement about ""some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland.""

We asked the governor's office for supporting details, and got them from Trudy Sharp, communications director for the Department of Mental Health. The mayor's office connected us with Chris Warren, Jackson's chief of regional development.

Both sides -- if they can be called sides -- gave essentially the same accounting of events:

As far back as 2003, the state began looking to replace Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare's facility on West 25th Street in Cleveland. By 2007, the plan expanded to include replacement of the Northfield facility on a single site in Cuyahoga County.

In 2008, without designating a site, the General Assembly budgeted $83.7 million ""to replace the Cleveland facility, with consideration for expansion that will allow for the merger of the Cleveland and Northfield facilities.""

After considering at least 10 sites, the city and state signed a letter of intent in June 2009 to use property on Cleveland’s Euclid Avenue in the Midtown Corridor, with various conditions. Both had the right to end the agreement without penalty.

To meet conditions, Warren said, the city spent $4 million assembling and preparing the 14-acre site. The state would have paid the city $2.1 million for it.

Sharp said the letter expired at the end of 2009, and the city did not extend it. Warren said the letter did not expire but would have had to be actively terminated. He noted that correspondence and meetings between the city and state continued through 2010, and that the city's work on the hospital site continued.

Warren and Taylor said the city learned of Kasich's decision to instead renovate the Northfield facility, without a chance for discussion, 48 hours before it was announced.

""Legally they're within their rights,"" Warren said. He said the city had accepted a risk in acquiring and preparing the property, which now is ""very marketable.""

But developing the property ""is not what it (the agreement) was to do,"" he said. ""It was to provide mental health services, to keep services in Cleveland. That was the intent of the appropriation.""

Of the $83.7 million allocated for construction, $60 million will go to renovation in Northfield, Sharp said. The rest will go to other facilities around the state. She said the department would save money because the projected cost of a new facility in Cleveland had climbed to $100 million.

Where does that leave us?

It is true that a letter of intent is not a binding, irrevocable agreement. But the letter of intent is also more than just a wink and a nod. A letter of intent is an understanding that often is preliminary to a formal contract.

A story March 19 in The Plain Dealer bought into Kasich’s terminology, describing site work Cleveland did as ""part of an informal agreement with the state.""

But is that what an average person would think knowing all the details?

Characterizing the arrangement as ""some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland"" suggests vagueness about the plans. That’s not the case. People in Cleveland and Columbus worked for years on this project.

We think a listener hearing Kasich's description would be surprised by these details: 

Given those details, we think characterizing the effort as some sort of an informal commitment is not just misleading, but also inaccurate.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097209080>],/factchecks/2011/apr/12/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-there-was-informal-agreement-/

Gov. Rick Scott takes credit for helping avert federal shutdown
","
Here's one you probably didn't catch on CNN -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott helped avoid the federal government shutdown.

According to Scott, anyway.

Scott's office penned a press release on April 11, 2011, titled ""Governor Rick Scott Helps Avoid Government Shutdown and Save Federal Taxpayers $1.5 billion.""

The release linked to a Huffington Post article, which reported that as part of a budget agreement, $1.5 billion will be cut from high-speed rail projects. Here is the release in full:

This weekend as Washington, D.C., insiders struggled to find billions to prevent a government shutdown, they found $1.5 billion worth of taxpayer money exactly where Governor Rick Scott left it: in the boondoggle high speed rail proposal.

""I am proud to have brought this waste to the attention of those in Washington,"" Governor Rick Scott stated in response to the news. ""These funds should either be returned to taxpayers as tax cuts or applied to reducing the burden that our national debt is passing to future generations.""

According to media reports, the final continuing resolution from Congress will include a $1.5 billion reduction in funds for high speed rail. Governor Scott rejected $2.4 billion for the project in Florida.

The idea that Scott wants Florida's high-speed rail money to be used for tax cuts or to reduce the national debt stuck out to us because we remembered him saying something different when he initially announced he was rejecting the federal money.

So we wanted to check Scott's statements using our Flip-O-Meter.

Back on Feb. 16, Scott wrote to U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to announce his decision to reject approximately $2.4 billion in federal money for a high-speed line between Tampa and Orlando.

But back then, Scott said he didn't want the money to leave the state entirely.

""As you know, my focus has been to ensure that transportation investments in our State reflect the diversity of needs we face -- from port facilities and highways and rail connections that drive domestic commerce and international trade, to investments in aviation and transit,"" Scott wrote LaHood.

""I believe that the dollars being made available for proposed high-speed rail are better invested in higher yield projects, like those we have discussed in the past few weeks.""

Scott then included a list of projects, including dredging improvements at the ports in Miami and Jacksonville, the widening of Interstate 4 in Orange County, the widening of I-95 in Martin, St. Lucie, Brevard and Volusia counties, and the widening of Interstate 275 in Hillsborough County.

""The long-term job creation opportunities from these projects are greater, the private investment stronger and the economic yield more permanent,"" Scott concluded. ""Given the limited dollars available, federal investments, rather than generating temporal job creation, must be directed toward those projects offering real long-term growth potential and a broader return on investment for our economy and our citizens.""

Pretty different tone, huh?

The St. Petersburg Times also noted that the money being trimmed from the budget also is not part of the $2.4 billion that Scott rejected earlier this year. The cut is to additional budgeted appropriations. Furthermore, the Department of Transportation is planning to award the $2.4 billion Florida rejected to other states. On April 6, the department announced that it has received more than 90 applications for the money from 24 states, the District of Columbia and Amtrak. 
Scott said when he rejected the money for high-speed rail that the funds should go to port and highway projects in Florida. Now, as part of trying to take credit for averting a government shutdown, he says the money should pay off the debt or go back to taxpayers. There is nothing consistent about those two positions, so we rate it a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C168240>],/factchecks/2011/apr/11/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-takes-credit-helping-avert-federal-/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Mark Hass']","
Sen. Hass says taxpayers could be getting three teachers for the price of one superintendent
","
Sen. Mark Hass has his sights set on Oregon’s 20 education service districts.

For the uninitiated, these districts allow smaller school districts to buy services collectively. As our colleague Kim Melton put it in a recent piece: they use ""the buying power of several local districts to get better deals on high-cost services.""

Hass, however, likes to call them ""obscure"" and ""wasteful"" and ""administratively bloated."" Ouch, ouch and ouch.

Hass is championing a bill that would give local school districts the option of taking their share of money out of the regional program. ""Most notably,"" Melton reported, ""this bill would reduce the amount of money education service districts get by half over two years, potentially sending an additional $100 million directly to local schools.""

To help make his case that this legislation is sound, Hass has taken to using a particular (and compelling) statistic:

""For every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, or three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers.""

That comes straight from a press release sent out by Senate Democrats on March 30, 2011, after the legislation was passed out of the Senate’s finance committee.

That’s not the only time he’s said it, though. Here’s what he told Melton: ""For every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, three classroom teachers.""

Repetition generally gets our attention.

We went to the senator’s office to see if they had any information to back the claim up. Andy Smith, one of Hass’s legislative aides, sent us a few pieces of information.

To start, he gave us the annual salary and annual fringe benefits for the current superintendent of the Northwest Regional Educational Service District -- the district that serves 20 school districts, including Hass’s constituents. Taking into account perks like health insurance, a tax sheltered annuity and a mileage allowance, the superintendent makes roughly $220,000.

Then Smith gave us some figures about teachers working in the individual David Douglas School District. According to the district, teachers can make somewhere between $40,000 and $75,000. The monthly fringe benefit for a teacher in that district is $1,425 (for family coverage), which shifts the range to somewhere between $57,000 and $92,000.

Using those totals, it does appear that you could cash in the superintendent for just under four teachers at the very low end of the pay scale or 2.5 teachers at the high end.

But that doesn’t exactly tell the whole story here. For one, the superintendent of the Northwest Regional cooperative is the highest paid superintendent in the state. Hass isn’t talking about just this district -- he says, very clearly, ""every one ESD."" Words matter. We needed something a bit more middle-of-the-road.

With that in mind, we started collecting data, trying to get an idea of what the average teacher in Oregon makes and what the average ESD superintendent makes. Sounded simple. It was anything but.

We started with the Oregon Department of Education. Crystal Greene, the public affairs manager there, pointed us to a chart in the 2009-2010 Statewide Report Card. According to the document, for the 2009-2010 school year, on average, teachers made $55,000 and superintendents made $113,000. The department, however, doesn’t keep track of fringe benefits and they didn’t do an analysis of ESD superintendents specifically.

So, we asked Greene for a list of the base salaries of all ESD superintendents. There are currently 20 superintendents for 20 ESDs. That said, not all of those superintendents are full time; there are just 16 full-time equivalents. We calculated the average base salary for one full-time ESD superintendent to be about $113,000.

The next step was to find what their average annual fringe benefits (health care, mileage and tax sheltered annuities) came out to. If you look at the example Hass used, it’s about $54,000 -- or 33 percent of the annual salary. We spot-checked six of the highest-paid ESDs. The range was pretty wide -- one made about $18,000 extra (he doesn’t have a travel allowance, but he can use a car if necessary) while another made $46,000. If you take the average of the three highest fringe allowances, you get roughly $46,000. Add that to the annual salary figure and you have a price tag of something like $160,000 for your ""average"" ESD superintendent.

Now for a teacher. This one is even trickier. Some teachers get pension contributions; some don’t. Depending on the district, benefits might be higher for some than others. Then there are all sorts of differences depending on education level and tenure. The list goes on.

We asked Lisa Freiley with the Oregon School Boards Association to walk us through a quick calculation. (The OSBA, it should be noted, does not support the bill. Freiley, however, helped us without our saying why we were asking.) When we were done, we had an estimated price tag of about $76,000 for an average Oregon teacher. That average ignored any possible PERS contribution by the district on the teacher’s behalf.

The math, however, was a bit more back-of-the-envelope than we like, so we called up the Oregon Education Association. Spokeswoman Becca Uherbelau told us that they generally use $93,000 as their ""average"" estimate. That includes salary, pension contributions and health insurance. Again, she didn’t know why we were asking and had no reason to inflate the figure.

The association doesn’t keep a similar figure for speech pathologists or special education teachers. That said, generally speaking, special education teachers are not paid any differently from other teachers. Speech pathologists might come out a little better compensated than the average teacher given they’re likely coming to the jobs with more advanced degrees per position.

Now, if you use Uherbelau’s number, you can’t even buy two teachers for the price of one ESD superintendent. If you use our lower estimate of $74,000, you could buy two teachers and a little change -- but not the three Hass claims.

Throughout this process, we kept in touch with the senator’s office. It probably goes without saying, but Hass and his staff don’t much like our math. They argued that the senator was talking only about his district and the ESD that serves his district. But that’s clearly not what he said. Then they pointed out another pitfall: Superintendents come with an entourage. They mentioned assistant superintendents, assistants to the assistant superintendents and other office staff, some of whom make six-figure annual salaries themselves.

""It is not just the salary,"" Hass told us over the phone. ""It is the infrastructure that comes with the office. … It's all of the perks that come with the office.""

It’s probably true that if you figured all of that into the equation, it would change things considerably. But then, that’s not what Hass said. What’s more, parsing can be done for both sides. Milt Dennison, the superintendent of the Clackamas Education Service District, pointed out that he gets paid for 240 contracted days of work. The average speech pathologist is contracted for 190 days. That’s a pattern that seems to hold true, to one degree or another, for the other ESDs as well.

In any case, it’s important for us to stick to the original claim that ""for every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, or three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers.""

It may be true that education service districts are ""obscure"" and ""wasteful"" and ""administratively bloated."" But we’re not here to judge that. We’re here to judge Hass’s claim and we find it False.

"['National', 'China', 'Energy', 'Foreign Policy', 'Donald Trump']","
Libya sells most of its oil to Europe, not China
","
Donald Trump has said he’s thinking about running for president, and while he’s gotten a lot of attention for questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate, he’s also made several provocative statements about foreign policy.

In an interview on Fox News, Trump discussed the Middle East, starting out with the war in Iraq, then moving on to U.S. air strikes in Libya.

""You know in the old days, when you won a war, to the victor belongs the spoils. You kept it,"" Trump said. ""We win a war, and we hand it over to some people we don't know and we leave.""

""And we lose the contracts to China,"" interjected one of the Fox anchors.

""Yes, China will be another one,"" Trump agreed. ""By the way, Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya. What are we doing?""

We thought Trump’s statement about Libya and China was interesting, so we decided to look into it. We asked a Trump spokesman for comment, but we didn't hear back.

So we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that collects data on energy. We’ll take Trump’s statement in two parts.

 • Libya supplies the oil for China. Libya does supply some oil to China, but it’s not as large as Trump’s statement implies.

The EIA showed that Libya’s No. 1 customer is Italy, which bought 28 percent of Libya’s exports in 2010. Italy was followed by France, at 15 percent, then China, at 11 percent. After that, Libya sold to Germany, 10 percent; Spain, 10 percent; Greece, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 4 percent, and United States, 3 percent. (More on that 3 percent in a bit.) Other countries combined to buy 14 percent of Libya’s exports.

We also wanted to know what share of China's imported oil comes from Libya. We found that in 2009, China bought most of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, which supplied 21 percent. That was followed by Angola, 16 percent; Iran, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; Sudan, 6 percent; Oman, 6 percent; Iraq, 3.5 percent; Kuwait, 3.5 percent and then Libya at 3.1 percent. Libya is followed by Kazakhstan at 2.9 percent and Venezuela at 2.6 percent. Other countries combined supplied 17.4 percent of China’s imports.

So China is a big customer of Libyan oil, but not the biggest, and there are many other customers. And Libya is far from being China’s chief supplier. It ranks ninth. 
 • We get no oil from Libya. The United States doesn’t get much oil from Libya.

In 2010, the U.S. imported 25.7 million barrels of oil from Libya, down from a recent high of 42.8 million barrels in 2007. The U.S. didn’t import any oil from Libya between 1982 and 2004, due to an oil embargo first imposed by President Ronald Reagan.

Libya is such a small source that it doesn’t make it into the list of the top 15 countries from which the United States imports oil.

U.S companies are working to develop Libya’s oil sector, however. In 2009, a deputy assistant secretary of state told Congress that U.S. companies are ""probably the most active and the most successful"" in helping Libya revitalize its oil sector.

""They're seeking our technology because it's the best in the world and we're doing quite well,"" said the U.S. State Department’s William Hudson. ""The Chinese are also active, but our companies have really taken the lion's share so far of bidding on plots for oil production.""

Trump said, ""Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya."" His point in the first sentence was clearly that Libya was a major supplier of oil for China. But the data do not support his claim. Libya is far from being China’s chief supplier. It ranks ninth. 
The second part of his statement is false -- the U.S. does get oil from Libya and the percentage is likely to increase.. 
On the whole, we rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E98200>],/factchecks/2011/apr/11/donald-trump/libya-sells-most-its-oil-europe-not-china/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Elections', 'Redistricting', 'Florida', 'Scott Randolph']","
On 'The Rachel Maddow Show,' Democratic Rep. Scott Randolph claims future speaker has had only one election
","
State Rep. Scott Randolph has taken the talk about his wife's uterus all the way to Rachel Maddow's national cable television show on MSNBC.

If you haven't heard by now, Randolph, D-Orlando, said the word ""uterus"" during a March 25, 2011, floor debate about union dues collections. Republicans, Democrats say, told Randolph he couldn't say that word.

The back-and-forth went viral and helped launched Randolph into a new stratosphere of popularity among progressives and liberals. That included a coveted chat with the high-priestess of liberal thinking, Maddow.

Maddow and Randolph discussed how the Republican-dominated Legislature has 18 anti-abortion bills pending, yet some Republicans were upset with Randolph using the word ""uterus."" That spun into Randolph talking about redistricting, and how Republicans have been able to reach veto-proof majorities in both the House and Senate despite being outnumbered by registered Democrats in the state.

""In terms of the last election and how the state Legislature in Florida ended up so very Republican right now, do you think that Floridians knew they were getting the kind of Legislature that would pursue 18 anti-abortion bills all at once? I mean, was the last election all about stuff like abortion rights?"" Maddow asked during her April 4, 2011, show.

""Well ... it was muddled,"" Randolph said. ""We had a moderate Republican, Gov. Charlie Crist, who vetoed the last (abortion) bill that made it through the last Legislature. I think it lulled a couple of... some people to sleep. And, then, of course, now, we have a much (more) far right governor in Gov. Rick Scott.

""And at the legislative level, you know, so many of these guys don't get challenged because the districts are so gerrymandered that quite frankly, probably, two-thirds of the Legislature was certified on the day that qualifying ended and their names never ended up on the ballot even. In fact, we have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years, and his name has been on the ballot one time.""

""Wow,"" Maddow responded.

Randolph's claim about a future House speaker surprised Maddow, which means it's something we wanted to check.

The man in line to be speaker four years from now is Rep. Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary. But when we reached Randolph's office, he said he was talking about Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, who will be speaker for the 2013 and 2014 legislative sessions.

To make sure Randolph wasn't moving the goal posts on us, we decided to check both.

Dorworth represents District 34, which includes parts of Orange and Seminole counties. As of 2000, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the district by about 14 percentage points. Dorworth was first elected to the seat in 2007 during a special election to replace David Mealor. He was re-elected in 2008 and 2010.

According to Department of State election records, Dorworth won a close primary in 2007 against Allen Roosa, winning by 68 votes. Dorworth then won the 2007 general election against a Democrat and two no-party candidates, receiving 54.5 percent of the vote. In 2008, Dorworth easily dispatched a primary challenger and did not have an opponent in the general election, meaning he was re-elected after the primary.

In 2010, Dorworth did not have a primary, but he did beat Democrat Steve Barnes and John DeVries, a tea party candidate.

That's two general elections out of a possible three, and two primaries out of three, where his name appeared on the ballot.

As for Weatherford, the person Randolph says he was talking about, things get a little more complicated.

A one-time aide to former Speaker Alan Bense who married Bense's daughter, Weatherford was first elected in District 61 in 2006. The district covers Pasco and Hillsborough counties, and as of 2000, registered voters in the district were 41 percent Republican and 40 percent Democrat.

In 2006, Weatherford's name didn't appear on the ballot.

That year, Republican Party officials selected Weatherford to replace incumbent Rep. Ken Littlefield on the general election ballot after Littlefield decided to take a position on the Public Service Commission. But the change happened too close to the election, and Littlefield's name remained in place. So votes for Littlefield actually went to Weatherford. Littlefield/Weatherford defeated Democrat Donovan Brown, receiving 60 percent of the vote.

Weatherford was then re-elected without any opposition in 2008 -- not a primary or a general election.

In 2010, he handily defeated newcomer Kevin Wright in a primary, and his name appeared on the November ballot where he bested Democrat Elena McCullough and received almost 66 percent of the vote.

Weatherford's story is a bit trickier to judge in the context of Randolph's claim. Weatherford has run in two general elections -- though only once was his name on the ballot. He also had a primary in 2010, though Randolph's comments pertained to the larger point about redistricting and the split between Republicans and Democrats. That would put greater weight on general elections.

Where does this all leave us?

Randolph said: ""We have a guy who is going to be speaker of the House in four years and his name has been on the ballot one time."" A basic reading of Randolph's comments would lead you to believe he's talking about Dorworth, who is scheduled to be speaker in 2015 -- four years from now. Dorworth has had two general elections out of a possible three, plus two primaries.

But Randolph said he was talking about Weatherford, who is set to replace Rep. Dean Cannon as speaker for 2013 and 2014. Weatherford's name has only appeared on the general election ballot once -- but even granting Randolph wide latitude, he's still reshaping history. Weatherford was appointed to replace Littlefield on the 2006 ballot for District 61, and even though Weatherford's name wasn't on the ballot, he still spent about six weeks campaigning for the seat.

If he had gotten the years right, Randolph might have had a better case. But because of the misstatement, coupled with the fact that Weatherford's story is not as clear-cut as Randolph described it, we find this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097207D00>],/factchecks/2011/apr/11/scott-randolph/rachel-maddow-show-democratic-rep-scott-randolph-c/

MoveOn.org says proposed House Republican budget abolishes Medicare in 10 years
","
Denunciation of the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was swift and spirited.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the plan, called ""The Path to Prosperity,"" as a ""path to poverty."" Another House Democrat, Chris Van Hollen, bashed it as a ""rigid ideological agenda on steroids.""

Ryan’s 10-year plan has plenty to get worked up about. It would slash spending and deficits by the trillions, repeal the health care reform law enacted under President Barack Obama, and take aim at two mainstays Ryan and others say are headed for bankruptcy: Medicaid and Medicare.

Seeking to mobilize opposition to the proposal, MoveOn.org seized on the plan’s changes to Medicare, the government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities.

On April 6, 2011, the day after Ryan’s plan was released, the left-leaning political advocacy group sent an e-mail to its members. The e-mail began with this assertion:

""Here's the most important thing you need to know about the Republicans' new budget plan: It abolishes Medicare within 10 years.""

We wondered: Would Medicare, a 46-year-old program that just seven years ago was expanded under Republican President George W. Bush, really disappear?

As backup for its claim, MoveOn.org cited in the email a New York Times article that said the Republican budget plan would eventually privatize Medicare.

But the article said nothing about abolishing Medicare, so we asked MoveOn.org if it had any other evidence.

The group cited this sentence from the GOP plan:

""Starting in 2022, new Medicare beneficiaries will be enrolled in the same kind of health care program that members of Congress enjoy.""

That sentence speaks of how new Medicare beneficiaries in 2022 will be treated, so it doesn’t support the MoveOn.org claim that Medicare will be abolished.

But let’s dig in a little to get an understanding of what the House Republicans propose for Medicare.

As it exists now, Medicare helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs.

Under the GOP plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

People who turn 65 after 2022, the CBO analysis said, would get a ""premium support payment"" from Medicare. They would use that money toward the cost of buying private health insurance.

One result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients ""would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.""

Bottom line: Medicare would stay the same for people who turn 65 before 2022, but change -- significantly -- after that.

We checked with a variety of experts on the question of Medicare being abolished in 10 years.

They included two academics -- University of Minnesota health care finance professor Stephen Parente and health care economics professor Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University; two liberal organizations -- the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Families USA, which says it advocates for ""high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans""; and two think tanks, the conservative Heritage Foundation and the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute.

None of the six argued the House Republican plan ""abolishes"" Medicare. Families USA framed it more cautiously, saying the proposal would ""end Medicare as we know it by 2022.""

What does the Truth-O-Meter say?

MoveOn.org claimed that Ryan’s budget plan ""abolishes Medicare within 10 years."" The group provided no evidence that backs the claim. To be sure, the plan would change Medicare, significantly, starting in 2022. But for those who turn 65 before then, there would be no changes at all, even after 2022. And for the others, Medicare would change -- dramatically -- but it would still exist.

MoveOn.org went too far with its claim. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097209100>],/factchecks/2011/apr/11/moveon/moveonorg-says-proposed-house-republican-budget-ab/

Rep. Jim Moran says top five oil U.S. companies raked in $1 trillion profit
","
Amid the partisan showdown on Capitol Hill over how to slice the deficit, Democrats want to get rid of some tax breaks for oil companies.

U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, a Northern Virginia Democrat, used an eye-catching statistic to justify doing just that.

""Over the past decade, the big five oil companies -- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell -- made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion,"" Moran said in a Feb. 10 news release.

No doubt, oil companies have made big profits. But we wondered if the decade-long profit tally really did approach $1 trillion.

Anne Hughes, Moran’s spokeswoman, said the figure came from a report earlier this year by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

The report says the five oil companies made $951 billion, not adjusting for inflation, from 2001 through 2010. Daniel Weiss, the author of the report, said he got the profit data from Google Finance and from the companies themselves.

But Weiss acknowledged he made a mistake while adding up the annual profit tallies.

Weiss sent us updated figures for the 10-year period. Those numbers, which were adjusted for inflation to reflect 2011 dollars, showed the five companies had a total profit of $901.6 billion for the 10-year-period.

We dug around ourselves to see if Weiss’ latest figure was correct, examining profit figures each of the companies listed in their annual reports from 2001 through 2010.

We found that British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhilips  had a total decade-long profit of roughly $801.7 billion in raw dollars.

The total profit for the five companies peaked at $123.4 billion in 2007. Last year it was $77.5 billion.

When we adjusted our annual figures for inflation, the five companies’ 10-year total profit was about $884.3 billion.

That’s close to the Weiss’ updated number. Still, both his figure and ours are about $100 billion away from $1 trillion. So it’s a stretch to say that the 10-year profit was ""nearly $1 trillion.""

Adam Sieminski, chief energy industry economist at Deutsche Bank, didn’t see much use in putting too much stock in an overall profit number for those oil giants.

The profits should be expected to be large because the of the size of the companies, he said.

""These are big companies,"" Sieminksi said. ""You would think the real question would be how does it compare to other industries, what are the profit margins in the oil industry relative to profit margins in health care and banking and construction and so on, and the answer is they’re not that much different.""

We compared the profit margins of oil companies to those of three major Virginia companies: Dominion Virginia Power, Altria and Norfolk Southern.

Between 2007 and 2009, profit margins at ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell ranged from a high of 10.0 percent to a low of 4.4 percent. Dominion, a regulated utility company, had an 11.5 percent profit margin in 2008 and an 8.7 percent margin in 2009. Norfolk Southern, one of the nation’s largest railroads, had a profit margin between 13 percent and 16.1 percent each of the three years.

Altria, the nation’s largest tobacco company had a profit margin of 52.4 percent in 2007. It’s margin was 25.5 percent in 2008 and 13.6 percent in 2009.

So these three companies, each in different industries, consistently out-performed the major oil companies. But because the oil giants all had much higher revenues -- between $285 billion and $470 billion compared to revenues around $10 billion for Norfolk Southern, $15 billion for Dominion and $20 billion for Altria -- the oil profits seem look more grandiose.

Let’s review:

Moran said BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell took in nearly $1 trillion in profit over the past decade.  

That statement was based on a report from the Center for American Progress, which initially said profits totaled $951 billion, but then corrected its figure to $901.6 billion.

Our math put the inflation-adjusted profits at $884.3 billion. That’s still more than $100 billion away from the $1 trillion figure Moran cited.

So to say that the total profits was nearly $1 trillion is a stretch.

The overall tally is still sizable though, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096735D80>],/factchecks/2011/apr/11/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-top-five-oil-us-companies-raked/

Charlie Crist says he cut 'property taxes for seniors and our middle class'
","After months of campaign ads from Gov. Rick Scott, Charlie Crist began rolling out his own commercials in this year’s gubernatorial race. In the first, entitled ""Sunshine,"" Crist hearkened back to his single term as governor, from 2007 to 2011. ""We saved the jobs of 20,000 teachers,"" he said. ""We cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class."" We’ve dealt with Crist’s track record with teachers' jobs before, but what about his history on property taxes? PolitiFact Florida decided to send you a notice a few months before your bill is due in November. Break for seniors Crist’s campaign pointed us to two events that happened during his term to prove its point. One was the 2007 legislation HB 333, a bill the Legislature passed that increased the homestead exemption for low-income seniors. It was the law that implemented Amendment 6, which voters had approved in 2006. HB 333 increased the maximum homestead exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 for seniors whose income was less than $23,414, if local governments allowed it. Crist signed the bill during his first legislative session in April 2007. While running for governor, he had broadly campaigned on lowering the property tax burden on senior citizens, saying the state’s booming economy would make up the difference. The exemption applied to cities and counties, not to school districts or special districts. By the time Crist approved the law, 53 counties and 158 cities had already approved an increased exemption, but the law allowed them to increase it up to $50,000 for 2007. Break for middle class The second item was the 2008 passage of Amendment 1, a constitutional change aimed at giving longtime Florida residents a break on ever-escalating property taxes. We should note that Crist says the break was for ""our middle class,"" but doesn’t define the term. Most homeowners saw some benefit, no matter what their income level. The amendment increased the homestead exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits to a new residence (including benefits from the 1992 Save Our Homes tax provisions). The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually. Crist was a very vocal supporter of the measure, campaigning on the plan during the 2006 election. He frequently said taxes would ""drop like a rock"" under Amendment 1. Opposition came from newer residents who wouldn’t enjoy the benefits in the same way as long-term owners. Florida TaxWatch said it was potentially unconstitutional, and even state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink worried about state fire-fighting agencies, among other departments, losing funding. Despite this opposition, the amendment passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote. The 2008 Legislature fully implemented it with SB 1588, which Crist signed on June 17. We should note critics had reason to be wary of the change, especially because of the timing. The amendment made beneficiaries happy but wreaked havoc on state tax revenues, combined with the Great Recession’s crashing real estate market, which wiped out billions in taxable home values. Drastic budget cuts resulted in reduced services statewide. The bill was originally projected to save homeowners $1.3 billion the first year, but it’s unlikely the tax benefits amounted to that much because of property values declining in 2008 and later years. Experts told us an analysis to find out how much less would have to go parcel by parcel, taking into account taxable values and changes in local millage rates. The Republican Party of Florida has been saying that Crist actually raised taxes on the middle class $2.2 billion while in office. That actually came a year later, when he and the Republican-led Legislature raised taxes and fees, like $1 a pack tax on cigarettes, to close a budget hole in 2009. Other fees were increased on auto tags and fishing licenses. Were the property tax cuts outweighed by the later tax increases of 2009? It’s nearly impossible to quantify the impact on an average taxpayer, because it would depend on if an individual owned property, smoked cigarettes, owned a car or fished. Our ruling Crist said, ""we cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class."" Crist supported increased homestead exemptions for seniors, although only those considered low income. He also supported tax cuts for property owning residents, but not just an undefined middle class. Voters decided on both issues with constitutional amendments, and the state Legislature did its part by passing bills that Crist signed. Crist’s claim doesn’t specify the nuances, but property tax cuts for groups falling under those umbrellas did happen during his term. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4AE80>],/factchecks/2014/jul/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-cut-property-taxes-seniors-a/

Sen. Jeff Flake says 90 percent of immigrants given court dates fail to show up
","The surge of unaccompanied children at the U.S. border, primarily coming from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, has overwhelmed the ability of the United States to handle their legal cases. A law passed under President George W. Bush and aimed at curbing human trafficking requires that minors from Central America who reach the border must have their cases heard in court before they can be deported. Currently, children wait an average of 578 days before a hearing -- delays that are sure to lengthen if the flow of children continues unabated. A substantial chunk of the $3.7 billion President Barack Obama is requesting in a supplemental spending bill for the border would be for increasing the courts’ ability to handle the caseload of newly arrived children. In this context, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., offered a notable statistic about the judicial treatment of people who arrive at the U.S. border. In a July 8, 2014, interview on the PBS News Hour, Flake outlined the risks of having large numbers of people released in the United States awaiting a hearing -- particularly the risk that they will fail to show up and boost the number of undocumented immigrants in the country. ""When these kids are handed off from the Border Patrol, (the government’s) role is to actually place those children in the care of a guardian or a family member,"" Flake said. ""And then what the record shows is that they’re told to appear later in court, where their case will be adjudicated. But 90 percent of them, 90 percent, do not then show up in court later."" A reader called our attention to this, citing sharply conflicting data, so we decided to take a look. The reader pointed us to a report from the Bipartisan Policy Center -- a think tank founded by former congressional leaders of both parties -- that cited figures far smaller than 90 percent. The report used figures from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is tasked by the Justice Department with handling immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews and administrative hearings. Between 2003 and 2012, the percentage of all immigrants who failed to appear in court after being released has bounced between 20 percent and 40 percent, settling in at about 30 percent at the end of that time span. (No data for children specifically is available from this long-running data set.) That’s substantially lower than the 90 percent figure Flake cited. Meanwhile, in a July 10 hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee -- which was held two days after Flake’s remarks on PBS -- Juan P. Osuna, the director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, told the panel that his department estimates that 46 percent of children currently fail to show up for their date in court. He told lawmakers that any other numbers are ""incorrect."" We checked with immigration policy experts to see whether the federal statistics or Flake’s estimate seemed more accurate, and they agreed that the federal statistics jibed with their long-term understanding of the issue. ""I’m not aware of data that shows a 90 percent no-show rate,"" said Marc R. Rosenblum, deputy director of the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program. He added that the long-term range of 20 percent to 40 percent matches what the VERA Institute found between 1997 and 2000 when it studied the issue on a federal contract to track individual immigration cases. The Bipartisan Policy Center also expressed skepticism about the 90 percent figure. ""Based on the federal data we’ve seen, we know that between 2008 and 2012, about 70 to 80 percent of all immigrants showed up for their court appearance,"" said Rosemarie Calabro Tully, a spokeswoman for the group. She later passed us the estimate Osuna gave to the Senate committee. When we contacted Flake’s office, they said the senator’s source for the statistic was a comment by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., at a media breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on June 26. The Monitor didn’t print a direct quote, but here’s an excerpt from the article: ""Right now, (Goodlatte) said, the law does not allow minors to be held in a facility, so they are released to relatives or foster care, and then given a court date to reappear. More than 90 percent do not return, he said."" So we contacted Goodlatte’s office. Goodlatte’s office said that while visiting the McAllen Border Patrol Station in the Rio Grande Valley in July, Goodlatte heard from Border Patrol agents that only 26 percent of those who were detained failed to show up for removal proceedings. They said officials didn’t give a percentage for those who had been released and failed to appear. They cited an article in Newsmax, a conservative online publication, that cited an anonymous ""senior Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective who routinely deals with illegal immigrants"" who said a ""massive number — 80 to 90 percent"" do not show up for deportation hearings. However, Goodlatte’s office acknowledged this was anecdotal evidence. Goodlatte's office also noted that there is already significant pool of immigrants whose final deportation has been ordered but not carried out. At least 858,779 non-detained aliens are deportable but haven’t been deported, many of whom are now off the radar of the authorities, according to calculations by the Center for Immigration Studies based on federal data. This is a related and notable issue, but somewhat different from what Flake or Goodlatte said. Experts we checked with did note a caveat: There’s no way of knowing if the current group of new arrivals will behave differently in regard to court appearances than their predecessors have. Indeed, due the backlog, it is unlikely that many of the minors apprehended in 2013 or 2014 have had their court date come up yet, and until their court appearance is complete, the government won’t know how many end up coming and how many fail to appear.   Our ruling Flake said that when undocumented children are picked up at the border and ""told to appear later in court ... 90 percent do not then show up."" Historically, the rate has ranged between 20 percent to 40 percent, settling in at about 30 percent in 2012, the most recent full year for which data is available. A more recent estimate for children specifically, made by the director of the office responsible for handling such cases, is that the current no-show rate for children is 46 percent. That’s still quite high, but it’s only half what Flake said. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809731E080>],/factchecks/2014/jul/10/jeff-flake/sen-jeff-flake-says-90-percent-immigrants-given-co/

Texas congressman says immigrant minors from countries that don't border the U.S. can stay
","Why are so many children pouring across the southwest U.S. border? The answer is partly U.S. law, said a Texas congressman on CNN’s State of the Union on July 6, 2014. Candy Crowley, CNN’s host, asked Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, ""Why are they coming in such numbers? What do you think prompts these numbers right now?"" Cuellar answered, ""If you're a Mexican, you get sent back. Mother, kids, adults, you're sent back, but if you're from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries, then the law says that you are going to be held, (and) Health and Human Services, they're going to place you. That’s the law that we need to change right now."" We looked into the claim and found that Cuellar wasn’t crossing any lines. With an influx of about 52,000 child immigrants at the border since October, the conversation has shifted to explanations. Which brings us to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. Some have cited it as the catalyst for the increase in illegal immigration. President George W. Bush signed the law on Dec. 23, 2008; it received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide. The law was never intended to encourage mass immigration from noncontiguous countries. But the law’s Section 235 did change the policies and procedures for handling unaccompanied alien children. Section 235, entitled ""Enhancing Efforts to Combat the Trafficking of Children,"" requires humane treatment of minors crossing the border from foreign nations. It also mandates ""safe and secure placements,"" calling for careful consideration when placing unaccompanied minors in residences within the United States. The law lays out one procedure for child immigrants from contiguous countries, like Mexico and Canada, and another for children from noncontiguous countries, like El Salvador or Honduras. Child immigrants from contiguous countries are processed for immediate return to their home country. In all other cases, the children are placed under the responsibility of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These children are placed with family or in other residences while they await their immigration court date. Long story short, they get to stay in the United States. The law seems to assume that alien children from noncontiguous countries were likely to be the victims of human trafficking, and it guarantees these minors access to legal counsel and child advocates. Experts said Cuellar was right, and the law was never intended to allow immigrant children from Central America to remain in the United States. ""Representative Cuellar's characterization is mostly right,"" said Dan Cadman, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies. The law ""has actually fueled an industry in the smuggling of minors. Contrary to intent, it has proven to be an inducement to wholesale smuggling of minors from noncontiguous countries."" The House GOP task force, assembled by speaker John Boehner to address the immigration crisis, issued a statement this week calling for changes to the law. ""We agree with the president that (these children) must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act."" On July 9, 2014, Cuellar said that he is introducing legislation to make the repatriation of minors from noncontiguous countries easier and faster by revising the law. Our ruling Cuellar said that unaccompanied alien children from contiguous countries are ""sent back"" no matter what, but the law calls for the placement of minors from ""a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries"" in a residential setting. Cuellar correctly characterizes the law. The law was passed as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide. As a result, certain parts of the legislation allow unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries to stay in the United States. Lawmakers are now contemplating changing the law.

Did Mitch McConnell vote to raise a senior's Medicare costs by $6,000?
","It’s not officially election season until candidates start claiming one side is trying to snatch grandpa’s benefits. Welcome to the 2014 election season. In a folksy new ad in the Kentucky Senate race, Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes shares the screen with Don Disney, a retired Kentucky coalminer, who has a question for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Grimes’ Republican opponent. ""I want to know how you could have voted to raise my Medicare costs by $6,000,"" says Don Disney. ""How are my wife and I supposed to afford that?"" A long silence ensues as Grimes and Disney stare at the camera. ""I don’t think he’s going to answer that,"" Grimes offers. ""I approve this message because I’ll work to strengthen Medicare, not bankrupt seniors like Don."" Medicare became a contentious talking point in 2011, when Rep. Paul Ryan unveiled a budget proposal that Democrats said would ""end Medicare."" We named that our Lie of the Year. Does Grimes’ claim fair any better? We decided to hop in the wayback machine to find out. Where does the $6,000 figure come from? According to the Grimes campaign, the $6,000 number comes from several studies on the effect of the Ryan budget on retirees. The Ryan budget has had several incarnations over the years. This ad focuses on his 2011 proposal, according to supporting material we got from the Grimes campaign. Under the 2011 Ryan plan, Medicare would have undergone a drastic change for future retirees. Instead of the government paying doctors and hospitals for services they provide for seniors, beneficiaries would be given a voucher they could use to purchase private health insurance to cover their care. Here’s our first hurdle: Did McConnell vote for the Ryan budget? Yes, but there are two important points. First, McConnell voted for a motion to proceed on the Ryan budget, which would have allowed it to the floor for further debate and amendments. It was not a vote on final passage. It was a preliminary vote that even the Washington Post wrote was ""mostly symbolic"" because it had no chance of succeeding in the Democratic Senate. (The plan passed in the Republican-controlled House.) The motion ultimately failed 40 to 57. Second, budget resolutions are not legally binding. Presidents do not sign them. It is a general outline of spending priorities that, when agreed upon, is a helpful guide. But it would require subsequent legislation to actually change Medicare programs to accomplish Ryan’s goals. Still, it’s probably fair to say McConnell was on the record supporting the Ryan budget, at least enough to get it to the Senate floor. But did it actually increase Disney’s Medicare costs by $6,000? The Congressional Budget Office, the top fiscal scorekeeper for lawmakers, said implementing the 2011 Ryan plan would lead to an increase in out-of-pocket costs for seniors. How much? Instead of paying 27 percent of all their health care costs, seniors would be paying about 61 percent. (Worth noting: Ryan subsequently changed his plan to try to reduce the cost-sharing burden on seniors in later versions of his budget.) In real dollars, the Kaiser Family Foundation said the average senior would pay about $6,800 a year more in health care costs. The Grimes campaign also pointed us to 2011 studies by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, that put the figure at about $6,350. But here’s the catch: these figures looked at what a 65-year-old would pay in 2022. That’s because under the Ryan plan, wholesale changes to the Medicare program would not directly affect anyone 55 or older. We learned from the Grimes campaign that Disney, the retiree in her ad, is 75 years old. So under no version of the Ryan plan would Disney be liable for the $6,000-plus in additional out-of-pocket costs that future beneficiaries would have faced if the proposal had passed. The Grimes campaign responded that in addition to changing Medicare for future beneficiaries, the Ryan budget also repealed the Affordable Care Act. That would affect current seniors in at least one way: prescription drug costs. How? Before the Affordable Care Act, seniors were required to pay 100 percent of prescription costs after the first $2,850 until they surpassed $4,550, at which point they would qualify for catastrophic coverage. By 2020, the Affordable Care Act eliminates that gap. If Obamacare was repealed, this benefit would disappear for seniors, including those currently 65 or older. So some seniors would pay more in prescription drug costs, though we don’t know how much on average. Ryan’s budget also would have cut federal spending for Medicaid, the joint federal-state program for low-income individuals, and converted the program into block grants that states could decide how to spend, Grimes’ campaign added. While we don’t know how states would have used the money, it’s possible changes to Medicaid could have impacted low-income seniors who receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Again, that figure is not concrete. These are both relevant talking points and worthy of consideration in the grand debate on Ryan’s proposal. However, they have little to do with the $6,000 figure used in the ad. Our ruling In the Grimes campaign ad, a Kentucky resident claims that McConnell ""voted to raise my medicare costs by $6,000."" The $6,000 figure cited in multiple studies measures a specific amount: The average out-of-pocket costs a new senior would pay in 2022 if Medicare changed to a more privatized system. People who turned 65 prior to 2022, like the retiree in Grimes’ ad, would remain in the current Medicare system and would not incur those costs. The counterpoint from the Grimes campaign is existing seniors will have to pay some costs if the Ryan plan passes. That may be true, but the $6,000 figure is completely unrelated to that discussion, and using a statistic about future retirees to make a broader point about current retirees makes for a misleading ad. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F6A540>],/factchecks/2014/jul/10/alison-lundergan-grimes/did-mitch-mcconnell-vote-raise-seniors-medicare-co/

Back in 2012, we checked the claim that the health care law cuts $700 billion from Medicare more times than we can count. (For a sample, look here, here and here.) It’s popped up again in this year’s Senate race in Kentucky. Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes recently accused incumbent Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of supporting a $6,000 per year increase in Medicare costs for beneficiaries -- another once-popular claim resurfacing. We’ve rated that False. The McConnell campaign swiftly retaliated with an ad of its own the next day. ""The truth? Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors’ Medicare. That’s how Obama and Grimes will pay for Obamacare,"" the ad says. For old times’ sake, we decided to look into the claim once again. The $700 billion 'cuts' The Affordable Care Act is projected to reduce federal spending on Medicare by about $716 billion between 2013 and 2022, but it does not literally cut funding from the program or reduce its overall budget. In fact, spending will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The Affordable Care Act just slows its growth, instituting a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not seniors. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. The program, started under President George W. Bush, has cost more than expected -- and more than traditional Medicare. Hospitals will also be paid less if they have too many readmissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Also, the $716 billion in reductions is not really being used to ""pay for"" the law, as McConnell said. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to federal budget deficits. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending over a period of about 10 years. Some of the new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. Does Grimes support the Affordable Care Act? When the law was enacted in 2010, Grimes was working as an attorney in Lexington, Ky., and played no role in the Affordable Care Act debate. But she hasn’t been able to avoid questions about her stance on the law this election cycle. Since the start of her campaign, Grimes has said she is troubled by certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. She has also said the solution is to improve on the law, rather than to throw it out completely. She’s spoken positively of 640,000 Kentuckians who were previously uninsured and will now be able to get insurance. It’s a bit harder to pin down her position on the Medicare spending reductions specifically. At the 2013 Kentucky State Fair, a reporter from the Louisville television station WHAS 11 asked Grimes if she agreed with Republicans that the Affordable Care Act would hurt senior citizens. ""I’m troubled with certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act,"" she said. ""But we're here at the State Fair, and if there's three reasons why Kentuckians, especially our seniors, need access to affordable health care coverage, you just have to look over to the right where you see the donut burger, the chili cheese steak and the covered French fries."" We should note that the 2012 Republican budget championed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also trimmed future Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount as the health care law. (And McConnell voted to consider Ryan’s plan that May.) Our ruling An ad out of the McConnell campaign said, ""Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors’ Medicare."" Grimes has been cautiously supportive of the Affordable Care Act, and she certainly does not oppose it as strongly as McConnell does. The law is projected to reduce spending on Medicare by about $700 billion over 10 years, but those reductions in spending are more of a slowed growth rate rather than a budget cut. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096ECE900>],/factchecks/2014/jul/10/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-opponent-alison-lundergan-grimes-support/
"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'Sports', 'PunditFact', 'Peter Beinart']","
Is soccer a 'blue state' game?
","Peter Beinart is the anti-Ann Coulter. Responding to the conservative pundit’s assertion that America’s growing interest in soccer is ""a sign of the nation’s moral decay,"" the City University of New York professor argued on the July 6 CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS that World Cup fever actually demonstrates a shift away from America’s sense of superiority. ""Ann Coulter may see that as pessimism and defeatism and declinism,"" Beinart said. ""But I actually think what it reflects is a more cosmopolitan temperament, a recognition that America has things to learn from the rest of the world."" Beinart pinpoints this shift in three major demographics: immigrants from ""soccer-mad nations"" in South America, young people and political liberals. Or, as Beinart calls it, the ""Obama coalition."" ""If you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they’re overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states,"" Beinart said. ""The only difference between the soccer coalition and the Obama coalition is that African-Americans right now are not such big soccer fans."" With the World Cup final around the corner, we wondered: Does soccer interest really split along party lines? In Beinart’s original response to Coulter -- a June 30 article in The Atlantic -- he cites an article by Estately, a real estate search site, that aggregates seven different measures of soccer’s popularity in each of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., including Facebook and Google interest, the number of professional teams and youth soccer clubs per capita. The top-seven ""soccer-enthused"" states, according to Estately, were all states President Barack Obama carried in 2012, including Maryland, New York, Washington and Massachusetts. Texas -- a particularly Hispanic state full of large urban centers -- and Utah -- America’s youngest population -- were the only states Mitt Romney carried in 2012 to crack the top 13, ranking eighth and 10th, respectively. Regardless where you place the cutoff for ""the states where soccer is most popular,"" seven out of the top seven and 11 out of the top 13 voting Democrat gets close to Beinart’s assertion that the most soccer-mad states are ""overwhelmingly blue states."" Similarly, out of the 10 states Estately ranked least enthusiastic, only Maine went to Obama in 2012; Alabama, Idaho, Arkansas, and Wyoming rank among both the most conservative and least soccer-enthused. There’s no perfect index, though, when it comes to measuring popularity. Ryan Nickum, who wrote the Estately article, agreed with Beinart that, for the most part, soccer-mad states are blue, and soccer-indifferent states are red, but Nickum attributed this largely to the urban/rural divide. ""A good portion of the criteria in our data related to professional soccer teams,"" Nickum said. And professional soccer teams ""are located in large cities, so more rural states will naturally score lower,"" Nickum said. ""Even so, (Beinart’s) argument that soccer fans are made up of liberals, young people, and immigrants is probably accurate. These are also the people who inhabit cities in greater numbers."" That’s one of the reasons why Texas and Utah rank high in Estately’s rankings; Utah has a Major League Soccer team, and Texas has two. Only one state without an MLS or National Women’s Soccer League franchise cracks Estately’s top 18. Florida, where two MLS teams folded in 2002 for financial reasons, is the outlier. Although many states that have professional teams also rank highly in several other of Estately’s indexes, it’s a subjective question whether the presence of a professional team indicates popularity. Andrei Markovits -- co-author of 2001’s Offside: Soccer and American Exceptionalism -- was skeptical of Beinart’s conflation of the public opinion on soccer and America’s sense of superiority, but he corroborated the claim we’re checking here. ""I in fact know that soccer has been much more popular in blue states -- meaning on the two coasts and in the affluent but liberal suburbs of metropolises like New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles -- than in red states,"" Markovits said. He added that ""this has -- tellingly -- changed during this World Cup where the watching of games has been huge across the land, pretty evenly distributed across red and blue states."" ""But the World Cup and soccer are two different things,"" said Markovits. ""The World Cup has become Olympianized in the United States, meaning that soccer becomes huge every four years."" The World Cup’s increase in popularity may be evenly spread between blue and red states, but, four years ago, overall viewership numbers weren’t. According to the Wall Street Journal, 11 percent of self-described liberals said they watched the 2010 World Cup, compared to 6 percent for conservatives. And even putting aside the World Cup and the presence of professional teams, the percentage of youth playing in soccer leagues is much higher in blue states than red. Seventeen of the 20 states with the highest percentage of youth soccer participation voted for Obama in 2010, and 16 of the 20 states with the lowest percentage of youth soccer participation voted for Romney, the Wall Street Journal found, citing private research by Experian Marketing Services. Our ruling On CNN, Beinart said, ""if you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they’re overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states."" Beinart seems to have had in mind a study by real estate website Estately. A variety of their metrics -- youth soccer participation, the presence of professional teams, and online interest -- strongly suggest that states where soccer is more popular were more likely to vote for Obama than Romney in 2012, and visa versa. Estately’s metrics, though, do skew toward larger urban centers that can support MLS franchises, and it’s a legitimate question how best to measure popularity. Experts may disagree on the reasons why liberal states tend to be more soccer-mad than conservative states, but Beinart’s claim accurately represents his source material. With the caveat in mind that measuring popularity is difficult, we rate Beinart’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AD6300>],/factchecks/2014/jul/10/peter-beinart/soccer-blue-state-game/

Scott Walker ad says Mary Burke helped firm with ""no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin""
","In his latest TV ad, Gov. Scott Walker rips challenger Mary Burke’s attempt to attract a giant Illinois-based company to add thousands of jobs in Wisconsin when Burke ran the state Commerce Department under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. ""As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin,"" the ad says. ""In fact, the same company had already laid off over 800 workers when Burke closed the deal."" The ad’s kicker: ""Mary Burke says she’ll work to create jobs and spend our tax money wisely. But her record as Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary tells a different story."" Is Walker right about his likely Democratic opponent in the November 2014 election? Did Burke really authorize an aid package for a company that ""said it had no plans to create jobs"" here -- after massive layoffs at the firm? The Burke campaign reacted to the ad by saying: ""Everyone from local officials to the local chamber of commerce to Walker's own administration agrees that this was and is a good deal from an economic development standpoint. The grant contained strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met or infrastructure was not developed for economic development."" Let’s dig into what happened. The ad focuses on a major move by Doyle and Burke in the spring of the 2006 election year. In March 2006, they announced a $12.5 million forgivable loan funded through federal community block grant funds, the largest such award in Commerce Department history. It was to support development of 500 acres acquired in Kenosha County by global pharmaceutical maker Abbott Laboratories Inc. Abbott, a major employer of Wisconsin residents based just 15 miles south of Kenosha County, had purchased parcels of land on the Wisconsin side since June 2005 for possible expansion. Doyle and Burke sought to augment that purchase with another 40 acres paid for with the $12.5 million state award. They and local officials wanted to get the land in order to block plans for a truck stop they thought could impede development in the area. Judging by the comments of Doyle and Burke at the time -- she had ""full confidence"" 2,400 jobs would result; he welcomed the company to Wisconsin -- you’d have thought Abbott had already announced its expansion in early 2006. But the Journal Sentinel reported Wednesday that not only did no jobs materialize, federal officials in 2013 demanded the money back. Eight years after the 2006 deal, Abbott has not developed the Kenosha County land. Abbott showed interest Did it have ""no plans"" to create jobs, as the Walker ad claims? In one sense, Abbott clearly had shown an interest in possible expansion in Wisconsin, as evidenced by the land purchases made with its own funds. The possibility was real enough for local officials in Kenosha County to actively work on working on paving the way for the firm. The company paid out $35 million for those parcels. But that solid interest fell short of an actual plan to build and start hiring. (The company, we should note, also signed a development agreement with the Village of Pleasant Prairie to develop that land. But that was a year after Burke’s agency made the award). The company didn’t stand alongside state officials when Doyle announced the loan in 2006. And officials said precious little about their intentions at that time.  Here’s a look back: Chicago Tribune story, Feb. 14, 2006:  ""Abbott has acquired approximately 500 acres of land in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., in anticipation of future growth and expansion,"" a company spokesman said. ""No specific plans are in place at this time for development of the property."" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, March 3, 2006:  Abbott spokesman Jonathan Hamilton said the Wisconsin site is for future growth, without any specific plans at this time. Commerce Department newsletter, April 2006: ""Abbott has purchased this land in Wisconsin in anticipation of future growth and expansion,"" said Dale Johnson, the company’s divisional vice president for State Government Affairs. ""We are pleased to have worked with the Governor, his staff, the Village of Pleasant Prairie and the Kenosha Area Business Alliance."" Those comments made clear the company was preparing for possible expansion in Wisconsin, but had no specific plan at the moment. Feds object One media story, in the Chicago Tribune in February 2006, speculated that Abbott’s Wisconsin land buys might be leverage for the company on various issues it had before Illinois lawmakers. With the uncertain timetable in mind, the Commerce Department’s aid deal was long term. If in 10 years, at least 2,400 jobs were created by Abbott in Wisconsin, the loan -- actually made to the village of Pleasant Prairie, which passed the funds to Abbott -- would not have to be repaid. In theory, that means there is still time to make the expansion happen with help from the loan. But the US Housing and Urban Development office in Milwaukee demanded the $12.3 million back in 2013 saying the development project was ineligible for the block grant dollars the state had used. The reasons the federal agency cited in its decision are relevant to judging whether Abbott stated any plans to create jobs in Wisconsin. A letter from HUD to the state in August 2013 concluded that the Commerce Department had no written commitment from Abbott to develop the property or create jobs. State officials agreed to that deal at the time. The federal agency declared that ""Commerce participated in a speculative land banking venture"" without ensuring that the funded activity would be eligible. Even years later, ""the specific proposed use of the acquired land has not yet been identified,"" HUD’s Sernorma Mitchell wrote to state Department of Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. Those comments from HUD help Walker’s case. Finally, the Walker ad also mentions layoffs, citing Chicago newspaper stories. Media in Illinois reported that Abbott cut at least that many jobs in Illinois in 2005 and early 2006. Our rating Walker’s ad said: ""As Jim Doyle’s Commerce secretary, Mary Burke spent $12.5 million dollars to buy a vacant lot for a company that said it had no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin"" and had laid off 800 workers. There’s a hint of mischief in the ad’s language in that it can be heard to mean that Burke was so incompetent she gave money to a firm with zero interest in a Wisconsin operation. That idea is off base. But as we say at PolitiFact, words matter, and the ad’s claim closely mirrors what company officials said at the time of the award. And HUD officials found that even seven years later, no specific use for the land was proposed. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097434D80>],/factchecks/2014/jul/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-ad-says-mary-burke-helped-firm-no-pla/

Did John Roberts issue an arrest warrant for Barack Obama over charges of treason?
","In some corners, impeachment talk is running high these days. Sarah Palin, the former Republican nominee for vice president, wrote on her Facebook page on July 8, 2014, that ""it’s time"" to impeach President Barack Obama. But a claim that’s been making the rounds in the conservative blogosphere over the past few months is even more startling. It says that John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, has ordered Obama’s arrest for treason. The claim appeared on numerous conservative websites in April and May, including here, here, here, here and here. In this item, we’ll check the version of the claim that appeared on May 1, 2014, in theuspatriot.com, a conservative website. (The website did not respond to a query from PolitiFact.) The headline of the post says, ""BREAKING: Report Circulating That Justice John Roberts Signed Off On Obama’s Arrest For Treason."" The rest of the post is not exactly transparently sourced, citing ""serious speculation"" and an unlinked-to ""leaked document."" ""There is some serious speculation that Chief Justice John Roberts has signed off on Interpol, which would mean that Obama is one step closer to being removed from office for multiple counts of treason,"" the post says. ""Charges include infringements of the Second Amendment, and declaring war without consent of Congress, and some other serious violations of Obama’s Oath."" It goes on to cite a litany of alleged infractions by Obama, which we’ve archived here. The post on this site alone had received more than 237,000 Facebook likes at the time we looked into it. Is there anything to this post? No, say legal experts, it’s entirely bunk. (The Supreme Court did not comment for this story, as is its general policy.) For starters, the phrase ""Chief Justice John Roberts has signed off on Interpol"" is not even ""coherent English, let alone a statement that makes any constitutional sense,"" said Stephen Wermiel, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law. Moreover, the powers of the chief justice are far more limited than this blog post imagines, Wermiel and other legal experts said. The chief justice ""has no authority to sign off on a warrant of any kind,"" said Paul Finkelman, a law professor at Albany Law School. About the only type of arrest the chief justice could set into motion would be to ""direct the sergeant at arms to remove a disruptive member of the audience"" at an oral argument in the Supreme Court building, said Kurt T. Lash, director of the program on constitutional theory, history and law at the University of Illinois. ""It would be a serious violation of separation of powers for the court as a whole to involve itself"" in allegations of treason by the president, Lash said. ""In cases where the president might refuse to follow a lawful directive of the court -- say, a failure to turn over Oval Office tapes -- the court would simply report the matter to Congress for their consideration of impeachment. The court itself would take no action against the president."" If the House did proceed to impeach the president, the Senate would hold a trial -- and at that point, the chief justice would enter the picture, as the presiding officer over the trial in the Senate chamber. But that’s quite different than the scenario the blog post lays out, since the chief justice would be entering the fray at the final stage of a president’s possible removal, not as the official initiating it. ""Given his longtime participation as an advocate before the Supreme Court before joining the bench, John Roberts would know this, as does pretty much everyone else,"" Lash said. The likelihood that this rumor is false, Lash said, ""is 100 percent."" Our ruling Bloggers said Roberts ""signed off on Obama’s arrest for treason."" But even if he wanted to, the Constitution wouldn’t allow it.

Rep. Tom Cotton defends his voting record on disaster relief in Arkansas Senate race
","Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. -- engaged in a tough and high-profile Senate race against incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor -- is fighting back against Democratic efforts to paint him as unsupportive of disaster relief funding, which is a potentially damaging issue for a state located in Tornado Alley. Last week, we looked at a Senate Majority PAC ad that claimed that Cotton ""is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times."" We rated that claim Half True, noting that Cotton had indeed voted against disaster relief spending five times, but that he had also voted for disaster relief funding as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. Pryor has continued to highlight that aspect of Cotton’s record, but Cotton is fighting back in a new ad that features Faulkner County Sheriff Andy Shock walking around a storm-ravaged area. ""Despite what you’ve been told, Tom Cotton stood with us every step of the way,"" Shock says in the ad. ""Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA. Sen. Pryor, start focusing on the real issues. Leave our community and our tragedy out of your campaign."" A tornado hit Faulkner County this past April, killing 16. It was the last time the federal government declared a disaster in Arkansas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent about $5 million on disaster relief there, without having to seek congressional approval. Cotton’s ad mentions three occasions when he voted for disaster-relief funding -- votes that we missed in our first report. (Cotton’s campaign did not respond to our questions for the previous fact-check, nor for this one.) Here are the votes: • H.R. 2217, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations, vote #211, June 2013. This bill would have appropriated annual funding for the Department of Homeland Security, where FEMA gets its funding. It passed the House, 245-182, but died in the Senate. • H.J. Res. 85: 2014 FEMA Continuing Appropriations, vote #522, October 2013. The bill would have appropriated funding for FEMA. It passed the House, 247-164, but died in the Senate. • H.R. 2775 Continuing Appropriations, vote #550, October 2013. The bill continued appropriations through January 2014, ending the government shutdown. It passed the House and Senate and became law. We confirmed that Cotton did vote ""yes"" on all three of these bills, so these provide a measure of support for his claim. But it’s important to add some more context. For starters, we should note that all three votes happened before the April tornadoes, and they were not direct funding to Arkansas disaster relief. In addition, second and third bills above came during the government shutdown in October 2013, when Cotton sided with other tea party lawmakers in refusing to pass a broad spending bill unless Democrats agreed to repeal, defund or delay the Affordable Care Act. President Barack Obama refused to sign any bill with such a provision. FEMA became something of a political football during the shutdown, with Obama using the agency’s headquarters as a backdrop when making a plea for lawmakers to end their budget standoff. At the time, Hurricane Karen was heading toward Florida’s Gulf Coast, and many members of the FEMA staff were furloughed or had to work without pay. The second bill above -- the FEMA appropriations bill -- was one of numerous measures that would have funded individual (and popular) parts of the government temporarily, rather than the broad spending bill Obama was seeking. Obama made clear that the mini-spending bill gambit was dead on arrival, so observers never considered it a serious legislative effort. Even if Cotton can cite at least two and possibly three examples in which he ""voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA,"" the ad ignores the five votes cited in our previous report in which Cotton voted against providing emergency relief funding. Our ruling A Cotton for Senate ad said, ""Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA."" At least two of the votes Cotton’s ad cites, and possibly all three, show support for providing funding for disaster relief. However, the ad leaves out that Cotton supported the government shutdown that temporarily left FEMA shorthanded, and that he cast at least five votes against disaster funding.

By not expanding Medicaid, Florida is missing out on 63,800 jobs, Charlie Crist says
","The White House has new ammunition for those fighting for Medicaid expansion: It would create jobs. The study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers — titled ""Missed Opportunities"" — provides a state-by-state analysis of how many jobs would be created by expanding Medicaid. The number for Florida: 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. The study is part of the Obama administration’s promotion of the Affordable Care Act, which includes the federal government picking up the initial tab for Medicaid expansion. Democrats including former Gov. Charlie Crist are using the study to attack Scott for Florida’s decision not to expand Medicaid. Crist is expected to win his primary and face Scott in November. ""Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs -- but Rick Scott still won’t do it,"" Crist said on Twitter July 2. Florida’s Republican-led Legislature opposes expanding Medicaid. Scott once opposed it, too, but switched positions in 2013 and now supports it. Supporters of the expansion say Scott hasn’t done enough to turn the Legislature around. Here, though, we wanted to focus on jobs. Would expanding Medicaid create 63,000 jobs? White House study Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility and agreed to pay 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The expansion would have covered an additional 848,000 Floridians. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven’t in the past. Extra revenue will allow health care facilities to hire new workers. The new study relies on previous studies, including one about the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which some residents got Medicaid through a lottery. Research showed people in Medicaid got preventative tests such as mammograms, cholesterol screening and pap smears compared to the control group. The White House predicts that Medicaid expansion would allow tens of thousands of Floridians to get those preventative tests. If Florida expanded Medicaid, it would get $15 billion from the federal government between 2014 and 2016. That would lead to 63,800 cumulative ""job years"" between 2014-17. It defines a ""job year"" as one person employed for one year. The study focuses on short-term job growth -- not what would happen to jobs over the long-term. The report briefly touches on the possibility that access to Medicaid could cause some people to work less or not at all -- while healthier, less financially stressed people might work more. It cites one study that found Medicaid enrollment had a statistically insignificant impact on labor supply, while other research found reductions in labor supply. Other studies on expanding Medicaid in Florida have arrived at different numbers. The Florida Hospital Association’s most recent analysis in 2013 predicts 120,000 jobs each year over about a decade -- the association supports expansion. Moody’s, a financial analysis firm that doesn’t have a position on the health care law, last year predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs in Florida. Kaiser Family Foundation summarized 32 studies Medicaid expansion in various states including Florida and predicted that it will have a positive effect on jobs over the next decade. Experts offer caveats or criticisms of report Many experts we interviewed generally agreed that the federal government pumping more money into the state to expand Medicaid would lead to new jobs, though they cautioned it’s difficult to pinpoint a number. ""It is next to impossible to know exactly how many jobs (or which jobs) are created by a policy like this, given the many other changes in the landscape,"" said Harvard professor of health economics Katherine Baicker. While the federal government picks up the initial expansion costs, in later years the states will have to contribute. That will ""wreak havoc"" on long-term state budgets because state spending on Medicaid is forecasted to outpace state tax revenues, said Dan White, who authored the Moody’s report. Ultimately it’s a judgment call by elected officials if the cost of expansion 10 years down the line is worth the number of jobs it will provide, he said. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, says the report ignores one side of the equation. ""What about tax money Floridians have to pay into the system because we are spending more money on Medicaid? What about jobs lost because of that?"" We asked Scott’s campaign for his opinion about the jobs’ report and got back a statement that didn’t address our question. Our ruling Crist said, ""Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs."" A study released by the White House said federal dollars that Florida would have gotten to expand Medicaid would create 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. Most of the health care experts we interviewed agreed that injecting billions of federal dollars into Florida for Medicaid would spark some job growth, but it’s difficult to pinpoint a number, particularly as there are other changes in the health care landscape. Other studies have found numbers as high as 120,000 and as low as 10,000.

On CNN’s State of the Union July 6, 2014, the debate bore out along expected lines. After liberal radio host Stephanie Miller claimed, ""President Bush had way more executive orders than President Obama"" (a topic we have tackled in previous fact-checks), Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said Obama’s actions are ""fundamentally different than has ever happened before."" Proof? How about his recent record with the Supreme Court. ""In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders,"" Spicer said. This was a bit of deja vu for us. Just one week earlier on another Sunday political show, Fox News Sunday, we heard a very similar claim from Rep. Bob Goodlatte. We rated it False. Goodlatte claimed that the Supreme Court decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning was ""the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority."" Spicer’s statement relies on the same incorrect premise as Goodlatte’s comment, and in fact takes it a step further. (In an email to PolitiFact, he also admitted that he ""misspoke in using the statistic."") Let's explain why. Goodlatte provided us a list of the cases he was referring to. We reviewed them, and enlisted the help of constitutional law experts to take a look as well. We had several issues with the list. For starters, nine of the 13 cases actually originated when President George W. Bush was in office. Bush’s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most of those instances. Obama’s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that’s commonplace, experts we spoke with said. Only one of the 13 cases actually had to do directly with Obama’s overreach: National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning. In that case, decided in June, the Supreme Court said unanimously that Obama went too far when he appointed members to the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate wasn’t technically in session. But even that case had nothing to do with what Spicer said last weekend on CNN. Spicer claimed that the court has unanimously rejected ""the president's executive orders"" 13 times in three years. Executive orders are a lot different, and a lot more specific, than ""constitutional authority,"" which is what Goodlatte said. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. It does not appear that any of these cases actually have to do with executive orders issued by Obama. In the case concerning the National Labor Relations Board, for example, the issue was the president’s power to make appointments. There was no executive order issued that named individuals to positions to the board. In United States vs. Arizona, another case on the list, Obama’s justice department took Arizona to court over the state’s tough immigration laws. But it wasn’t the result of an executive order from Obama. In one of the cases, McCullen vs. Coakley, the Obama administration was not even a plaintiff or a defendant in the case. The case was a challenge to a Massachusetts law that put no-protest zones around abortion clinics. While the Obama administration filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts law, no executive order was filed or challenged. And again, most of these cases were started under Bush, so any executive action was likely coming from the previous administration, not Obama. Our ruling Spicer said, ""In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders."" Most of the litigation actually came in response to actions under the Bush administration. In the few cases initiated during Obama’s two terms, the court wasn't even ruling on challenges to Obama’s executive orders. Spicer took an already debunked argument and made another mistake in repeating it, so it was even more incorrect. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097820080>],/factchecks/2014/jul/09/sean-spicer/gop-spokesman-says-supreme-court-unanimously-ruled/

U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received zero complaints about Washington Redskins, bloggers say
","There’s new hysteria surrounding the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark registration, and it goes like this: The government’s decision was much ado about nothing. After reading our fact-check about the Obama administration’s (lack of) direct involvement in the decision, a reader asked us to look into a claim from a conservative blog that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team’s trademark without public outcry to do so. One would think that the public outcry against such an ""offensive, inflammatory"" name must’ve been huge to gain the attention of a senator. People must have been writing tons of letters complaining about how racist the name was in order to get President Obama to weigh in on the issue. The number of complaints the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received about the Redskins name was astounding, but not because there were so many. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The agency received zero complaints about the team’s name. Zero. The post by the Conservative Tribune deems this evidence of a left-wing scheme to win voters and open ""the door for repealing the First Amendment."" We checked it out and did not exactly find a scandal. Most notably, the post fails to mention why the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office considered canceling the trademarks in the first place: People complained about it. The Conservative Tribune blog post links to a story at Weasel Zippers, which links back to a story that first appeared in the conservative Washington Times newspaper. On June 18, 2014, a panel of three administrative law judges known as the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board canceled the team’s trademark registrations on the grounds that it disparages American Indians. As expected, the team is appealing the decision, just as it did when it challenged the same panel’s decision in 1999 in a related complaint and won. (The football team can keep the rights to its trademark as it goes through the appeals process.) Two weeks after the decision, the Washington Times ran a story about how the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could not produce any records that showed members of the public wrote in to express their opinions about the team’s name before the most recent ruling. The newspaper’s public records request for correspondence about the logo turned up 13 pages of records, half of which came from a Texas man who wrote a ""meandering"" letter by hand after the ruling. The other pages came from a person congratulating the appeals board and from staffers seeking background information about the case for Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting member of Congress from Washington, D.C. (and an opponent of the team’s name). Is it the ""bombshell"" as described by the Conservative Tribune website? Not really. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not solicit public comment like other government agencies as they consider new rules and regulations. It’s not built that way. Its process prescribed by the U.S. Code works similar to a legal trial, in which only the parties involved can submit evidence. There could be one letter or 1,000, but it’s not going to make a difference in whether a trademark is granted or canceled. Put another way, it’s not part of the process in the way that the Environmental Protection Agency or Federal Trade Commission reviews public input before considering a new rule or regulation. In this case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office acts more like the Supreme Court, in that the court wouldn’t solicit or consider your opinion of the health care law before it issued a ruling. ""The presence or absence of letters of complaint in a case like this really does not have any bearing on whether or not a trademark is going to be canceled,"" said Elizabeth Rowe, University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. ""If you want a trademark to be canceled, you have to do what the plaintiffs did here."" The Redskins case deals with existing trademark registrations, which require investment on the part of people who seek to have the trademark canceled under federal code. In this case, five young people with American Indian heritage petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office in 2006 to cancel the registrations, arguing that it is disparaging. There is a brief period to allow for opposition to pending trademark applications, but a simple letter of complaint would not do much there either, Rowe said. That window is usually used by rival companies to assert whether a logo is too close to their own and confusing for consumers, and objections involve filing an objection, evidence to support it and having a hearing. ""It’s really neither here nor there to say that they were letters of complaint or how many were there,"" Rowe said. The Washington Times article that called the missing public comment into question even echoes these points, quoting the plaintiffs’ attorney and a Georgetown University professor as saying public correspondence isn’t built into the process for hearing individual cases. For what it's worth, there are petitions at websites like Change.org and MoveOn.org in favor of changing the name or ditching it, and some have thousands of signatures. But the aim is to rally people about the issue and exert pressure on team ownership, not to influence the decisions of administrative law judges. Our ruling Conservative blog posts smell a scandal in the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark, pointing out that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ""received zero complaints"" about it before an administrative law court ruled in June. The case was opened because someone complained -- so that assertion is wrong on its face. But even that aside, the post is misleading in suggesting that public comments are part of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office process when they are not. When people have a problem with patents and trademarks and want them removed, they file formal complaints, prove their standing in the case, pay a fee, and provide evidence to support their case. In other words, they do exactly what the five plaintiffs in this case did here. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C212C40>],/factchecks/2014/jul/09/blog-posting/us-patent-and-trademark-office-received-zero-compl/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says job growth better than under Jim Doyle
","Gov. Scott Walker is unintimidated when it comes to sizing up his job growth numbers next to his predecessor’s. But did he create more jobs in his first three years than former Gov. Jim Doyle did over two full terms? Walker made that claim during a June 19, 2014 news conference at Milwaukee’s annual Water Summit. ""We, in this state, saw more job creation in the last three years since I’ve been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor,"" Walker said. ""So I think if people look, are we at where we want to be in terms of our goals? Going forward, voters will see the difference. The last thing we want to go back to is a much lower job creation number, even before the recession."" Walker has focused a lot on Doyle’s record as he’s come under criticism from Mary Burke, the leading Democrat in the 2014 governor’s race, for lagging on his promise to help create 250,000 new private-sector jobs in his first four-year term. (We have rated that promise Stalled). Let’s see if Walker’s latest comparison holds up. Wisconsin private sector job growth When we asked Walker’s press secretary, Laurel Patrick, for data to back up this comparison, she cited the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a set of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is considered the gold standard when it comes to jobs data, as it is based on a survey of nearly all state businesses. It is released about seven months after every quarter ends. The scorecard as of June 19, 2014 shows the state lost 47,413 private-sector jobs by the end of Doyle’s eight-year tenure. Under Walker, the state gained 91,813 private sector jobs from 2011 through 2013. In Doyle’s first full term from 2003 through 2006, the state gained 86,530 jobs, which was still slower than the national average. It was 5,283 fewer jobs than were added during Walker’s first three years. Wisconsin has experienced slow-moving growth for the past decade, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a private fiscal research group. ""That’s simply the nature of our economy,"" Knapp said. ""(Wisconsin) tends to go with the (national) economy but at a slower pace."" State job creation has grown at this slow pace since at least 2000, a  September 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance study showed.The study tracked the state economy from 2000 to 2012 and found that job creation has declined as has population growth. It’s hard to create jobs if there aren’t workers to fill them.    Digging deeper A more nuanced picture emerges when you look more closely at Doyle’s full time in office. In Doyle’s first term, from 2003 through 2006, the state gained 86,530 jobs, which was still slower than the national average. It was 5,283 fewer jobs than were added during Walker’s first three years. In December 2007, the Great Recession began -- about one year into Doyle’s second term. When the recession took its toll, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent in Wisconsin and the state lost 133,943 jobs during Doyle’s second term. That created the net loss of 47,413 jobs by the end of 2010. By official measures, the recovery from the recession started in June 2009. Wisconsin saw a jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, when 33,658 jobs were added. That’s significant because it was the last time Wisconsin outpaced the national average in job growth. In 2011, when Walker took office, job growth did not keep up with the national or regional pace, according to a September 2012 study from the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a non-profit think tank. The study shows Wisconsin lost 21,900 jobs between January 2011 and May 2012. That put its rate of job growth at 0.73 percent, slowest in the midwest and 42nd in the nation. Job growth has been slow yet steadily positive since 2011 but no evidence shows the pace is changing, according to Laura Dresser, Associate Director at the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. ""Wisconsin is on the weak side of an already weak recovery,"" Dresser said. In the middle of a gubernatorial race, Walker has worked to frame the jobs issue to his advantage. So has Burke, who was secretary of commerce under Doyle from 2005 to 2007. Here are the year-by-year private sector figures going back to Doyle’s first year: Year Job growth percent Number of jobs gained or lost Doyle: 2003 +0.236% 5,479 Doyle: 2004 +1.69% 39,374 Doyle: 2005 +0.835% 19,741 Doyle: 2006 +0.928% 21,936 Doyle: 2007 +0.33% 7,970 Doyle: 2008 -2.34% -56,463 Doyle: 2009 -5.05% -119,108 Doyle: 2010 +1.5% 33,658 Walker: 2011 +1.322% 29,800 Walker: 2012 +1.47% 33,872 Walker: 2013 +1.21% 28,141 Last year, Wisconsin added 28,141 jobs at a rate of 1.2 percent that ranks 37th in the nation based on figures released June 19, 2014 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our rating Walker said, ""We in this state, saw more job creation in the last three years since I've been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor."" Walker is right on the numbers that show Wisconsin did gain more jobs in his first three years as governor than Doyle did in his eight years. But there’s an indirect element of blame in his claim. On that score, it’s worth noting Wisconsin consistently trailed the nation in job growth before the Great Recession triggered the second-term losses that dragged down Doyle’s tally. Walker skates past that fact as he chooses a comparison most favorable to himself. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB9680>],/factchecks/2014/jul/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-job-growth-better-under-jim-doyl/

Does Mayor Allan Fung's budget for Cranston cover all retirement costs?
","It wasn't that long ago that Cranston was facing an overwhelming bill for retirees and potential retirees, a crisis that prompted Mayor Allan Fung to seek concessions from the city's police and fire unions. The city was in trouble because, for years, its elected officials failed to invest enough money to cover the retirement benefits they were promising. So it caught our attention when Fung, who is running for governor as a Republican, sent out a letter with the city's new tax bills reporting that ""Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefits costs."" So is Cranston's pension problem fixed and up to speed? We decided to look at the numbers. Cranston actually has several pension plans. Police and fire workers hired over the past two decades, along with municipal employees, are covered by the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System. The state sets a percentage of payroll that municipalities in the MERS system must contribute to cover their costs. If the municipalities don’t pay up, the state withholds aid to make up the shortfall. For the current fiscal year, Cranston’s minimum was 13.69 percent of payroll; the city’s budget includes that amount -- about $4.8 million on the non-school side of the ledger. In other words, it’s paying 100 percent of the state-mandated MERS requirement. Then there’s the funding level, the percentage of what the plans need to meet their pension obligations. The city’s MERS plans are not funded exactly at 100 percent, but they're fairly close. According to the latest actuarial report, the city has 95.9 percent of the projected police retiree costs, 107.1 percent of the projected firefighter retiree costs, and 95.1 percent of all other municipal retiree costs. Any plan with a funded ratio below 80 percent is considered to be in trouble. However, the old police and fire pension programs, administered by the city, are a different story because, over the years, Cranston's elected officials neglected to put enough money into those programs to cover future retiree costs. Although they have been closed since 1995, the city would need an additional $231 million to fully fund them. (To put that amount in perspective, the city's entire budget for the current fiscal year is $262 million.) The old police pension is only 18.3 percent funded and the old fire pension program is just 24.1 percent funded, according to information from the city's latest actuarial report. They’re far from 100-percent funded. However, the city is now on a payment plan designed to wipe out that shortfall by 2042. (The date has been 2037, but a recent court settlement with the unions forced the date to be pushed back by five years.) Under that plan, the city should be paying $22,353,591 this year, according to the city's actuarial firm, Buck Consultants. Fung, in an email to PolitiFact Rhode Island, showed where the city's appropriation for this year will actually be $22,518 more than the recommended amount. To cover other benefits, primarily retiree health insurance, Buck recommended that the city budget $5.1 million. The city has set aside $4.6 million and plans to cover the remaining $500,000 by using about a third of its $1.6 million hospital stabilization account, which is savings accumulated because the city self-insures its workers. Fung, in an interview, said he didn't intend to leave the impression in his letter to taxpayers that the city had covered 100 percent of all its pension obligations. ""If I had meant that, I would have said it was 100 percent fully funded, which is not true."" Instead, he said his point was that, unlike in past years, the city is paying for 100 percent of its annual required contribution to solve its pension problems. We should note that Fung has not been shy about talking about the unfunded liability of the city's old pension systems, mentioning it in interviews and on other occasions. Our ruling Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said, ""Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs."" The city is making the minimum required payments for retirement benefits through the state-run MERS system and to pay down this year's share of the bill for the huge long-term liability incurred by the city's older police and fire pension systems. But his statement could lead a reader to conclude that 100 percent of the city’s $231 million debt for the old plans is covered by this year's budget when, in fact, the only thing the city is paying in full is this year's installment on a plan that won't retire that debt for another 28 years. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Rep. Labrador: Administration predicts 150-200,000 children at the border in 2015
","As the number of children stopped at the southern border passed the 50,000 mark so far this year -- and as public concern and media attention surged -- the Obama administration asked Congress for an additional $3.7 billion to turn the numbers around and avert a humanitarian and political crisis. The tensions between treating children as children and fending off partisan sniping over immigration policy were evident when Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared this Sunday on Meet the Press. Johnson repeatedly refused to say whether most of these unaccompanied minors would be be deported. Johnson’s go-to phrase was that the goal ""is to stem the tide."" This led U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, to accuse Johnson of ""making things up."" ""He's saying that he's going to be able to stem it, and it's not going to reach 90,000 or between 60,000 and 90,000 children,"" Labrador said. ""That's not going to happen. The own administration estimates are that it's going to be about 60,000 to 90,000 this year, that it's going to increase to 150,000 to 200,000 next year. These are their own estimates."" Labrador’s comment drew a lot of attention and we wanted to check whether the administration predicts that 150,000 to 200,000 children will come to the United States, illegally at the southern border. (We can’t know, of course, what the number will ultimately be; here, we’re simply checking whether the administration offered those numbers.) There are estimates and there are estimates Labrador’s spokesman, Todd Winer, said the source was a May 2014 internal memo from Deputy Border Patrol Chief Ronald Vitiello. According to news reports, the memo said that ""90,000 minors would be apprehended this year and 142,000 next year."" Both the Washington Times and the Washington Post carried that story. Winer argued that since about 16 percent of people crossing the border evade detection, the actual figure would be higher. We did the math. If 142,000 children were stopped at the border in 2015, then the total who made the attempt would be nearly 170,000. However, the 170,000 figure does not come from the administration -- it is Labrador’s extrapolation from an internal memo. So Labrador's low-end figure is higher than the number in the memo. To add another wrinkle, the agency in charge of the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told PolitiFact that it has no estimate for 2015. ""How many will be coming, we don’t know,"" a spokesperson said. ""It’s a fluid situation, and we just don’t have a number right now."" When the internal memo became public in June, an agency official said it was ""an internal, incomplete working document, neither signed nor made official."" Still, if the administration lacks an official estimate, this is nonetheless an unofficial estimate within the administration and it is using current trends to build a budget for next year. In May, the Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee to put them on notice that the money requested for 2015 would be $2.28 billion, about two and a half times more than previously expected. The letter said these numbers were uncertain and ""given the fluidity on the ground, could increase or decrease over time."" That projection was based on the ""assumption that the month-over-month rate of increase in arrivals that we have been experiencing over the past year will continue."" Based on Customs and Border Protection data, the number of children at the border doubled between fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014. (Fiscal year 2014 has not ended, so they used the same months from both years.) If the flow stays the same through the rest of the year, we might see about 72,000 children at the border for all of fiscal year 2014. If the rate continued to rise between 2014 and 2015 as it did in the previous year, the total could would double again, or reach about 144,000. That suggests where the Border Patrol chief might have derived the estimate in that internal memo and why the White House suggested it might need twice as much money. A fluid situation Jeanne Atkinson is executive director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network and was part of a delegation from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that visited Central America last fall. She said there is a great deal of speculation about where the numbers will go. ""I have heard numbers over 100,000,"" Atkinson said. ""I’ve not heard the 200,000 number, and given all the changes the administration is talking about, the goal is to reduce the number."" The government is talking about processing these children more quickly, warning parents in the key Central American nations these children are fleeing from (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) and taking other steps to reduce the flow. We checked with several law professors who focus on immigration and none of them had heard of the estimate Labrador cited. Kevin Johnson, a law school dean and professor of immigration and refugee law at the University of California-Davis said, ""I am not aware of any careful statistical analysis of past and current migration trends that support any reasonable estimates of future flows of migrants from Central America, much less any reliable statistical analysis at all suggesting that we would see 150,000-200,000 migrant children coming from Central America next year,"" Johnson said. David Martin, who teaches at the University of Virginia School of Law, also expressed skepticism. ""I’d guess this is just a straight-line projection applying the growth rate we’ve seen this year,"" Martin said. ""But the administration is trying hard to break and reverse that trend."" Our ruling Labrador said the administration’s own estimates predicted that 150,000 to 200,000 unaccompanied children would show up at the southern border. Labrador’s spokesman pointed to an internal memo that suggested 142,000 children might arrive in 2015. But that’s a smaller amount than 150,000 and much smaller than 200,000, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection says that memo was a working document and not an official estimate. A preliminary budget request was based on the assumption that past increases would continue, but it did not state a particular figure for the number of children and noted that the money needed would change depending on the shifting situation on the ground. Labrador’s numerical range could be right if you add the percentage of people who cross the border without getting caught. But even if you do, that is not the administration’s ""own estimate."" And experts we interviewed cast doubt on Labrador’s figure. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809723DB00>],/factchecks/2014/jul/08/raul-labrador/rep-labrador-administration-predicts-150-200000-ch/

RNC chair Reince Priebus 'thanks' Barack Obama for five-hour E.R. wait times in California
","Republican criticism of Obamacare may have been overtaken by other talking points -- from the influx of unaccompanied minors at the border to the Internal Revenue Service’s handling of tax-exempt organizations -- but it hasn’t disappeared entirely. On July 7, 2014, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus sent the following tweet: ""Thanks to #ObamaCare, average E.R. wait in California is 5 hours: http://gop.cm/6015YqKd And 'it’s only going to get worse.' "" The tweet is based on, and links to, a July 4 report aired on the Fresno, Calif.-based TV station KMPH, a Fox affiliate. ""If you have to go to an emergency room get ready to wait more than five hours,"" says the Web version of the KMPH report. ""Right now, that is the average wait in the state of California. Health experts say you can blame Obamacare and Covered California for that long wait and they say it's only going to get worse. One of the promised benefits of the Affordable Care Act was to reduce the pressure on emergency rooms by expanding Medicaid and giving the poor better access to primary care. But instead, a survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians suggests something else. The organization says President Obama's health care reform actually has had a destructive effect on the nation's emergency rooms."" (The version that aired is archived here.) But when we took a closer look, we found several problems -- including that the alleged 5-hour wait time was measured before the health care law took effect. What does 'average E.R. wait' mean? Actually, there isn’t just one definition. A study published in October 2013 by the California HealthCare Foundation offered three different measurements. The one Priebus references is ""patient arrival to being admitted to hospital as inpatient."" For California, this wait was five hours and 26 minutes -- longer than the national average of four hours and 34 minutes. But this is by far the longest of the three measures. The second longest is ""patient arrival to emergency room departure for discharged patients"" -- basically, the entire length of the visit for someone who isn’t actually admitted as an inpatient after being seen by the E.R. For Californians, this wait time was two hours and 49 minutes, once again a bit higher than the national average of two hours and 19 minutes. The third measurement is by far the shortest -- ""patient arrival to being seen by health care professional."" In California, this was 31 minutes, slightly more than the national average of 29 minutes. One might take away from Priebus’ tweet that someone going to a California E.R. can expect a wait of more than five hours just to get in to see a doctor or a nurse. In reality, they’re seeing a health professional in about a half an hour -- and if their injury or illness isn’t serious enough to keep them in the hospital overnight, then they’re on their way home in under three hours. For those patients, their entire visit is much shorter than the five hours Priebus indicates. Steven Birenbaum, a spokesman for the California HealthCare Foundation, said the wait time to see a health professional -- the shortest of the three measures -- is actually the most useful statistic in this context, because the longer figure ""mainly reflects the inpatient service and how full the hospitals is."" Julie Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said there’s no ""definitive answer"" on which measurement is better. Her group focuses more on the wait time to admission or discharge, but she said hospitals market themselves based on wait time to see a doctor. The wait time to see a doctor is likely more familiar to ordinary Americans. Are long E.R. waits really due to Obamacare? At this point, any link between the Affordable Care Act and longer E.R. waiting times is speculative at best, because post-ACA data on wait times do not yet exist. The data from the California HealthCare Foundation is from 2012 -- in other words, long before provisions of the law began taking effect on Jan. 1, 2014. ""It is too early to confirm that wait times are increasing under the ACA, due to the delay in data being released,"" Birenbaum said. Indeed, E.R. wait times ""have been a serious problem for many years,"" said Lloyd of the emergency physicians’ group. ""This is not anything new. It is often incorrectly blamed on nonurgent patients, who only comprise 7 percent to 8 percent of all E.R. patients."" The real reasons for long wait times, Lloyd said, include ""increasingly complex workups for patients, particularly older patients with multiple health problems, and the hospital practice of ‘boarding.’ ‘Boarding’ occurs when a patient admitted to the hospital from the E.R. is held in the E.R. while waiting for an inpatient bed. That ties up a bed and physicians’ attention, preventing them from getting to the next patients in line. Some patients are boarded for many, many hours."" This doesn’t mean there’s no support at all for the notion that the ACA has complicated matters for emergency rooms. An online survey of 1,845 emergency physicians, conducted in April 2014 by the American College of Emergency Physicians, found evidence that caseloads had increased since the start of Obamacare -- though even here, the results were mixed. The TV report that Priebus linked to cited this recent survey. When asked whether the volume of emergency patients in their own E.R. had changed since Jan. 1, 2014, 9 percent said it had increased greatly and 37 percent said it had increased slightly. However, a larger percentage said it had remained the same (27 percent), decreased slightly (20 percent) or decreased greatly (3 percent). And while 86 percent of emergency physicians said they expected to see an increase in emergency visits over the next three years, it’s not clear that the ACA will be the dominant -- or even a significant -- reason for this. When asked what type of long-term impact the Affordable Care Act will have on access to emergency care, ""positive"" (34 percent) outweighed ""negative"" (29 percent), with another 29 percent saying it would have no impact. It’s also worth noting that the survey data -- the only post-ACA data we have -- speaks to patient volume in emergency rooms. It doesn’t speak to wait times, which was the focus of both the KMPH report and Priebus’ tweet. Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, stood by the KMPH story the tweet cited. ""If you have to go to an emergency room, get ready to wait more than five hours,"" she said. ""Right now, that is the average wait in the state of California. Health experts say you can blame Obamacare and Covered California for that long wait and they say it's only going to get worse."" KMPH did not return an inquiry for this article. But Birenbaum of the California HealthCare Foundation added a footnote: The San Joaquin Valley, where the TV segment was reported, ""has one of the lowest rates of primary care physicians to population. It would make sense that patients often end up"" in the E.R. Our ruling In a tweet, Priebus said, ""Thanks to #ObamaCare, average E.R. wait in California is 5 hours."" The statistic was based on data from 2012 -- two years before the provisions of the ACA could have had any impact. Meanwhile, the five-hour figure is just one of three measurements of E.R. wait times -- and not even necessarily the best one. If you count from the time of a patient's arrival to being seen by a health care professional, the wait time was 31 minutes in California. Even the strongest support for the claim is far from solid: A survey of emergency physicians found signs that E.R. traffic had increased since the ACA took effect in January, but the results were mixed, and this documents patient volume, not wait times. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CD680>],/factchecks/2014/jul/08/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-thanks-barack-obama-five-/
