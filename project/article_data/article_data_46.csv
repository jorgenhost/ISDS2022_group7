House Minority Leader Brian Newberry says congressional candidates don't have to live in the district where they're running
","
Want to run for Congress? Are you facing a bruising election battle in the district where you vote? Here's a solution: run in another district. And don’t worry, you don’t even need to move to the new district.

Brian Newberry, a Republican and the minority leader in Rhode Island's House, raised the concept during an interview on WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers"" broadcast Oct. 2, 2011.

He was talking about the campaign for the Congressional District 1 seat now held by Democrat David Cicilline. In 2010, Republican John J. Loughlin II, a former Tiverton state representative, almost beat Cicilline, getting 44.6 percent of the vote. Loughlin is itching for a rematch.

But former state police Supt. Brendan Doherty also is running for the seat as a Republican. Newberry is afraid a GOP primary between Loughlin and Doherty would be divisive and help Cicilline win reelection in 2012.

So Newberry has suggested that, instead, Doherty run in Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District against incumbent Democrat James Langevin.

But Doherty, whose residence is in Cumberland, doesn't live in that district.

""Legally it doesn't make any difference,"" Newberry said.

That may come as a shock to some people. Voting outside your district is a felony, and people are periodically arrested for the crime. Even if you own a business in a community, which gives you a big stake in local politics, you can't vote there unless your actual residence is there.

And it's illegal to run for any state or local office unless your primary residence is in the district.

But it's OK to run for Congress outside your district?

It is, as long as the district is in your state.

""The U.S. Constitution does not require candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives to live in the district they wish to represent,"" said Chris Barnett, spokesman for Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis. It sets three requirements. ""You must be at least 25 years old, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least the past seven years, and must live in the state you want to represent.""

Article I Section 2 of the founding document says nothing about being an ""inhabitant"" (to use the original wording) of the specific district where you are running. In addition, you don't even have to move into the state until the day before election day.

And because states cannot pass laws that supersede the U.S. Constitution, no further restrictions would be permitted without a constitutional amendment.

(The last time this issue came up in Rhode Island was in 1995 when then-Lt. Gov. Robert Weygand decided to run for Congress in the 2nd District while he was living in East Providence, in the 1st District. While there was no legal requirement that he move to the 2nd District, he ultimately did so, closing a deal on a home in North Kingstown on the same day he officially declared his candidacy.)

State and local elections are different. Because the U.S. Constitution is silent on such matters, the states are free to require that people running for office actually live among the people they are seeking to represent.

So running for either of Rhode Island's two House seats can be done by any Rhode Island resident. Where you live in the state doesn't make a difference, as Newberry said.

We rate his statement True.

Former APS head Beverly Hall says national test proves real gains
","
Ever since Atlanta Public Schools’ cheating scandal began, then-Superintendent Beverly Hall has repeatedly pointed to a national test as proof that the changes she made produced real results: the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

The NAEP is a top measure of student achievement, and APS’ NAEP scores improved under Hall’s term, Hall has said. One of her backers mentioned these scores in a New York Times article last month. Hall, herself, raised them Aug. 10 in a commentary published by the national trade publication Education Week.  

""The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained. That improvement has also been confirmed by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is independently administered,"" Hall wrote.

""Dramatic"" improvement in scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests has been ""confirmed"" by the NAEP?  We decided to take a look.

First, a brief aside. We checked Hall’s claim that CRCT tests scores for 2010 and 2011 ""have not been questioned"" and gave her a Pants on Fire. State investigators, the Governor’s Office for Student Achievement and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the validity of both years’ results.  

We asked Hall’s attorney for evidence backing her claim about the national test but received no response. After our inquiry, Council of Great City Schools Executive Director
Michael Casserly repeated a similar claim Sept. 7 in The New York Times, but the story included no supporting evidence. Hall previously served on the board of Casserly’s organization.

Now, the NAEP is different from your typical standardized test. Like the CRCT, it tests core subjects such as reading and mathematics, but many students don’t take it. Those who do don’t take all of it. They don’t even get their results.  

Instead, the NAEP randomly selects a representative sample of students to take the test.  They take slices of the exam over a single day.  

Historically, the NAEP has been used to track student achievement at the state and national level. During the past decade, however, about a dozen large urban districts were recruited for a special trial to see how well the test evaluates district performance. APS joined the trial in 2002.

The test was not the focus of the state’s CRCT investigation, and a federal review found no evidence of NAEP cheating, said Arnold Goldstein, who is program director for the assessment division of the National Center for Education Statistics, the division of the U.S. Department of Education that oversees the NAEP.

The federal review’s findings were not published in a report, so PolitiFact Georgia could not examine its work.

Experts agree that it’s much more difficult to cheat on the NAEP than the CRCTs, and they give the following reasons:

-- NAEP test administrators are federal contract workers, not APS employees, so they have little incentive to cheat. Some are retired APS teachers, but a federal testing official told PolitiFact that they all worked as part of three-member teams with colleagues who had no ties to APS.

-- NAEP test materials are not kept in schools overnight or during the weekend. That’s when much of the CRCT cheating took place, according to the state investigation.  

-- Students are tested on multiple subjects during the same NAEP test session. While one is working on a reading exam, another might be doing mathematics, so they can’t copy each others’ answers.

But cheating is not out of the question. Sonny Perdue, who as governor launched the state investigation into the CRCT scores, is a member of the board that oversees the NAEP.  He suggested at an August board meeting that there may be weaknesses in the system but did not give details. He declined through a spokesman to comment for this story.

APS critics say the district might have tipped scores in its favor by withholding names of low-performing students from the roster the NAEP uses to select its test-takers.

The NAEP doesn’t check student rosters by name. The procedure is to see whether the list it receives from a school matches up with the school’s overall characteristics, Goldstein said.

The NAEP review found no problems, Goldstein said.

But the federal review focused on whether APS followed standard procedures -- not whether the rosters were accurate. To comply with privacy policies, NAEP administrators routinely destroy the rosters schools send them, Goldstein said. Therefore, we think it may be impossible to check whether APS sent accurate lists.

Now, let’s take a closer look at the NAEP results starting in 2002, which is when APS began participating in the urban district program.  

We found that even if you ignore the possibility of cheating, it’s not clear the gains are dramatic.

APS previously trumpeted that since 2002, its students demonstrated the largest gains of other large urban school districts on the NAEP reading tests. This is correct, but since that time, APS’ demographics have shifted toward whites and Hispanics -- groups that generally score higher on the NAEP, experts noted.

For instance, in 2002, 6 percent of APS fourth-graders were white and 3 percent were Hispanic. By 2009, the percentage of white students more than doubled to 13 percent. Hispanics increased to 5 percent.

""I think that demographic changes in the fourth grade account for 40 percent or so of the progress, but that’s not something anybody wanted to talk about or even to point out,"" said Mark Musick, an East Tennessee State University professor who once was chairman of the board that directs the NAEP.

Also, APS’ NAEP marks aren’t all improvements. The score gap between whites and blacks remains the second-largest in the nation among large districts. In addition, children in poverty now lag even further behind their peers in reading.

Furthermore, Atlanta still trails well behind other large urban districts in crucial areas. For instance, Atlanta’s eighth grade 2009 mathematics scores were lower than all others but Cleveland, the District of Columbia and Los Angeles.

And at current rates, it will take Atlanta 50 to 110 years for all its students to become proficient, said Binghamton University education professor Lawrence Stedman, who thinks that the cheating scandal is proof that the U.S. needs to scrap its approach to high-stakes testing. What gains APS made slowed in recent years, he said in a recent analysis of the district’s NAEP scores.

Even if we take the NAEP gains at face value, it’s not accurate to say they support CRCT gains. Though student achievement rose according to both measures, NAEP gains don’t quite match up to CRCT increases, and demographic shifts might account for a portion of the increase.

That said, it’s not clear we can take the NAEP scores at face value. While a federal review of APS procedures found no red flags, the bulk of the district’s cheating on the state CRCT exam only became public knowledge after a rigorous investigation that looked beyond procedures.

Such an inquiry has not taken place on the NAEP. And even if it did, it may not ever be possible to ensure that APS sent accurate rosters to NAEP administrators. The NAEP destroyed its copies.

Both the CRCT and NAEP registered some gains, but the causes are unclear, the results are mixed and the district’s integrity remains in question. So many questions remain unanswered that it makes little sense to conclude that NAEP scores confirm ""dramatic"" gains on the CRCT.

Hall therefore earns a False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B703C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/07/beverly-hall/former-aps-head-beverly-hall-says-national-test-pr/

We Are Ohio says politicians ""exploited a loophole exempting themselves"" from collective bargaining law
","
A statewide TV commercial urging rejection of Issue 2 tells viewers that rank-and-file public workers are willing to make sacrifices in order to reduce the cost of government while powerful politicians who make the rules are finding ways to avoid the pain.

Issue 2 is the voter referendum on Senate Bill 5, a new law that reduces collective bargaining power for public workers and makes several other changes to Ohio’s collective bargaining law. If voters reject Issue 2 on Nov. 8, SB 5 will be repealed.

We Are Ohio, backed by labor groups and Democrats, produced the commercial, which has been in heavy rotation lately. The commercial flashes an image of Republican Gov. John Kasich, an Issue 2 supporter, while a narrator describes the sacrifices politicians have demanded of public workers to help balance the state budget.

""But those same politicians exploited a loophole exempting themselves from Senate Bill 5,"" the narrator says.

The SB 5 referendum will be among the most watched elections this fall, so PolitiFact Ohio is committed to helping voters parse through the onslaught of campaign messages before election day.

On its face, the statement is this commercial appeared flawed. For one, elected officials already were exempt from the state’s old collective bargaining law, which was passed in 1983 and replaced by SB 5. Secondly, lawmakers cannot raise or cut their own pay if they wanted to. They can only adjust the pay of future state representatives and senators.

We asked the organization that produced the commercial, We Are Ohio, to explain how the politicians who passed SB 5 exempted themselves from the law.

Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, said the exemption can be traced to page 32 of the 304-page bill. A citation also appears on the screen during the ad narrator’s claim, along with a written message that says, ""Senate Bill 5 payment provisions: Do Not Apply to Politicians.""

Language on that page of the bill relates only to payment provisions within SB 5. The exemption -- for elected officials and certain other workers -- is from sections 124.14, 124.15 and 124.152 of Ohio Revised Code, all of which deal with a job classification plan the Ohio Department of Administrative Services sets for state workers.

The plan, which lists various job titles and responsibilities, is tied to a salary schedule in Ohio law that gives automatic pay increases to workers based on seniority. SB 5 eliminates those increases and awards pay increases based on performance.

But keep in mind, elected legislators already were exempted from that pay schedule.

The other half of the claim, that ""politicians exploited a loophole,"" underscores the commercial’s overall message, that state lawmakers used trickery to avoid playing by the same rules they’re forcing public workers to play by.

But the exemption is hardly a loophole. Lawmakers already were exempt from existing laws relating to the job classification plan and collective bargaining. SB 5 alters those laws while keeping the exemptions for elected officials and others intact.

Legislators’ salaries are set in state law. The Ohio Constitution prohibits lawmakers from in-term pay raises or decreases.

Their current pay — a base salary of $60,584 with significant additional pay for leadership positions and certain committee assignments — was last adjusted in 2008, the final year in a series of increases that was part of a bill passed in 2000.

As for benefits, state lawmakers already pay health insurance costs and contribute toward their pension in line with SB 5’s provisions. Medical coverage rates and required pension fund contributions for lawmakers mirror those of unionized state workers. Therefore, they typically pay at least 15 percent of their medical insurance premiums and, if enrolled, must contribute 10 percent of their salary to the retirement system.

The claim in the ad does contain an element of truth -- legislators are exempted from several provisions of SB 5.

But the portion of the claim that they’ve exploited a loophole leaves out important details that would give a different impression. Those details include that lawmakers have long been exempt from Ohio’s collective bargaining law, that they already pay the same percentages for medical and pension benefits as SB 5 would require and that their wage is set by statute.

On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression rates one way: Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CDB4C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/07/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-says-politicians-who-approved-collecti/

Truth about fluoride doesn't include Nazi myth
","
Here's a reason to support a Florida county's decision to cut fluoride out of its drinking water: The idea came from the Nazis.

The Nazis put fluoride in water to pacify Jews during World War II, a local resident told members of the Pinellas County Commission on Oct. 4, 2011, before the commission voted 4-3 vote to stop fluoridating water for about 700,000 residents. 
""History shows, actually, that in Nazi Germany, one of the first things that they did was add fluoride to the water in the ghettos where the Jews stayed,"" Matt Leffler of Clearwater said.

Once the St. Petersburg Times published its story about the decision — similar, anonymous comments on the Web piled up:

""Do you guys know where water fluoridation started? In the death camps in WWII.""

Bernie Sanders says six bank companies have assets equaling 60 percent of U.S. GDP
","
During an Oct. 4, 2011, interview on MSNBC, host Ed Schultz and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., discussed the ""Occupy Wall Street"" protests, which are targeting the financial services sector. Sanders offered a statistic designed to demonstrate the power of American banks.

Sanders suggested that many of the protesters ""have not seen the president be as strong as he should be on Wall Street,"" saying they want the federal government to take tougher measures against financial-services companies.

""Ed, today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America,"" Sanders said. (GDP stands for gross domestic product.)

We wondered whether Sanders’ math was correct.

When we contacted Sanders’ office, a spokesman provided testimony to a congressional oversight panel by Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of
Management. ""Our six largest bank holding companies currently have assets valued at just over 63 percent of GDP,"" Johnson testified, citing figures for the fourth quarter of 2010. ""This is up from around 55 percent of GDP before the crisis (e.g., 2006) and no more than 17 percent of GDP in 1995.""

We wanted to find the original statistics, and we located them in a chart posted by the National Information Center, the federal repository of data about banks and other institutions for which the Federal Reserve has a supervisory, regulatory or research interest. The chart lists the 50 biggest bank holding companies as of June 30, 2011.

Here are the top six and their total assets:

1. Bank of America Corp., $2.264 trillion
2. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., $2.246 trillion
3. Citigroup Inc., $1.957 trillion
4. Wells Fargo & Co., $1.260 trillion
5. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., $937 billion
6. Morgan Stanley, $831 billion

Together, the top six companies’ assets were $9.495 trillion.

For the second part of the equation -- gross domestic product -- we turned to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Though the time spans don’t line up perfectly, we decided to use the GDP figure for 2010, the most recent full year. That figure is $14.527 trillion.

Dividing these top banks’ assets by the national GDP produces a result of 65 percent -- which is actually a slightly larger percentage than Sanders had indicated, but certainly in the ballpark.

To make sure we weren’t missing something, we contacted a few experts on financial services issues. They offered a few caveats:

• The comparison is a bit of apples vs. oranges. The banks’ asset figures are an aggregation measured at a single point in time, whereas the GDP figure is an aggregation of goods and services measured over time. ""This distinction is the equivalent to a comparison of your net worth with your personal income,"" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. ""Economists generally don't find these sorts of comparisons very useful or interesting. So the best that can be said is that these comparisons provide a rough sense of comparative magnitudes.""

• The data are constantly moving. ""Several of these banks, especially Bank of America, have lost significant"" value since the figures were published in June 2011, said Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The denominator, GDP, is always changing, as well. So, any estimate is true for a specific point in time, but possibly out of date not long after it’s made.

• Banks’ overseas holdings significantly complicate the comparison. For starters, the comparison Sanders is making doesn’t mean that these banks own 60 percent of the U.S. wealth, because some of these banks’ assets are in overseas holdings. However, Sanders appears to be on safe ground with his phrasing, since all he said was that the two dollar figures were ""equivalent.""

Potentially more problematic for Sanders is that the assets-to-GDP ratio for the top six bank companies in the U.S. are actually quite modest when compared to the biggest banks in other nations.

A 2010 study by J.P. Morgan listed the 25 biggest banks internationally in 2008, along with the percentages of their home country’s GDP. The highest was UBS, with 376 percent of Switzerland’s GDP. And six other banks all had assets as large as their home country’s GDP -- Credit Suisse Group of Switzerland (218 percent), Dexia of Belgium (180 percent), Fortis of the Netherlands (155 percent), Royal Bank of Scotland of the United Kingdom (131 percent), Barclays of the United Kingdom (112 percent) and BNP Paribas of France (101 percent).

All of these dwarf the combined holdings of the top six banks in the U.S., in part because America’s GDP is so much larger than the GDP of these other nations.

The significance of this fact for Sanders’ assertion, however, is less clear.

""This doesn't tell us what is a ‘proper’ or ‘appropriate’ number,"" Thallam said. ""One might reply that other countries are much more concentrated, but that only means they're worse -- not that we're in a good position."" Some scholars, he added, have said that even at current concentration levels, U.S. banks should be broken up because they create a ""too big to fail"" problem. ""On the other hand, people for years said that banking exhibited economies of scale, so consolidation was natural,"" Thallam said.

Our ruling

Sanders’ math is correct -- in fact, the percentage he offers is actually a little low. And he’s careful to say only that the banks’ assets are only ""equivalent"" to 60 percent of the United States’ GDP, not that the banks own 60 percent of the United States. Sanders doesn’t note that big banks in other countries are far bigger, compared to their nations’ GDP, than the U.S. banks are. Still, on balance, we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097674F80>],/factchecks/2011/oct/06/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-six-bank-companies-have-assets/

Tim Ryan says the nation needs to spend $2 to $3 trillion to get infrastructure up to date
","
President Barack Obama’s $447 billion American Jobs Act is front and center on the political stage -- and those on both sides are using big numbers to bolster their arguments.

So it was little surprise that the topic stirred emotion last month when Ed Schultz, a liberal who hosts a nightly cable talk show on MSNBC, brought ""The Ed Show"" to Columbus.

Schultz, who has made it clear he favors Obama’s plan, had a friendly panel that included Ohio’s senior U.S. senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown and Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Niles.

Asked during the live broadcast if the GOP could be expected to offer any help in the House, Ryan expressed pessimism, then pivoted to a talking point dear to Democrats.

""We have a $2 trillion to $3 trillion infrastructure deficit,"" Ryan said. ""We’ve got work that needs to get done. We’ve got people that want to go to work. And they’re Ohioans.""

The American Jobs Act does call for more infrastructure investment, which would mean more jobs for construction workers and suppliers. Given the high-charged political debate and occasional theater surrounding the plan, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to check Ryan’s numbers.

But first things first. What, exactly, is an infrastructure deficit?

Generally speaking, it’s a phrase used often by politicians and policy wonks to amplify how much money needs to be spent to bring the nation’s roads, bridges and waterways up to date. Think of it as the difference between how modern and sturdy the infrastructure should be and how modern and sturdy it actually is. ""Need"" and ""should be,"" of course, can be matters of opinion.

With that background in mind, we contacted Ryan’s office, where a spokesman pointed us to a 2009 study from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Reston, Va., trade group graded U.S. infrastructure as poor and estimated it would cost $2.2. trillion over five years to modernize.

Ryan was hardly the first politician to notice or embrace the report. Our research found people on both sides of the aisle cite the ASCE study as evidence of the nation’s crumbling foundation. And we found no other estimate so detailed or so widely accepted and repeated as ASCE’s.

Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, tackled the issue at a July hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee: ""We certainly need a new approach,"" she said. ""The American Society of Civil Engineers' most recent estimate says that the U.S. needs to invest $2.2 trillion in order to keep pace with the national infrastructure needs.""

A few weeks later, Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts used the $2.2 trillion figure, though he did not note the original source, in an appearance on NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""

The conservative Hoover Institution has cited the ASCE estimate while noting, without attribution, other estimates that ""range from $1.6 trillion to $3.5 trillion."" In September, the White House Press Office sent out a statement from Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who cited the ASCE figure in his enthusiastic endorsement of the American Jobs Act. And on a web site promoting Obama’s plan, the Democratic National Committee cites the group’s study.

But Washington can be an echo chamber, where erroneous numbers take on a life of their own while being repeated as fact. So PolitiFact Ohio checked in with ASCE to get a better handle on the group’s mission and method -- and to find out if pols were using the findings correctly.

ASCE, according to its web site, represents more than 140,000 civil engineers and, though it is nonpartisan, lobbies for policy that might create more design and construction jobs. To complete the 2009 report card, researchers reviewed about 20 independent studies to calculate a deficit estimate. Sources ranged from the Congressional Budget Office and other federal agencies to other trade organizations. Brian Pallasch, ASCE’s managing director for government relations, told PolitiFact Ohio that his group tried to use as much government data as possible.

Pallasch believes the group’s $2.2 trillion figure was conservative. But slapping the word ""deficit"" after it might not be the most accurate depiction of what the number means. ASCE was careful to describe the $2.2 trillion as a ""need"" over five years to plug the infrastructure gap. The study also estimated that about $1 trillion would be spent over that time to fulfill the need. That forecast included nearly $72 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus package, from 2009.

Ryan and other politicians tend not to subtract the $1 trillion when talking of the infrastructure deficit. Then again, Pallasch said, the numbers don’t account for flooding and other calamities that have weakened or destroyed infrastructure since the 2009 study was released. And ASCE has not yet tracked how much of that $1 trillion has been spent in the last two years.

The $2.2 trillion need ""probably isn’t going down,"" Pallasch said.

Ryan spoke of an infrastructure ""deficit."" Like others before him, he did not cover all the nuance and did not account for likely changes since the year the ASCE study was released. Those who watched him on ""The Ed Show"" might have had a more complete picture of the problem had they known that nearly half of that $2.2 trillion need was expected to be met over five years.

Those pieces of information provide clarification. But given the fluidity of those numbers, and given the fact that he correctly pegged ASCE’s key number between $2 trillion and $3 trillion, Ryan wasn’t cherry-picking.

This precision gap is much narrower than the infrastructure gap.

As a result, we rate Ryan’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809676A4C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/06/tim-ryan/tim-ryan-says-nation-needs-spend-2-3-million-get-i/

Television ad promotes Chris Christie’s spending cuts, increased education funding
","
If you believe what you see on television, Gov. Chris Christie is a ray of sunshine in a dark and dreary world.

A television ad broadcast in recent weeks by a group of Christie supporters paints that image of the governor, while touting his achievements of cutting spending and increasing education funding.

From a group called the Committee for Our Children’s Future, the ad begins with a hazy image of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. as the narrator intones: ""Runaway spending, record debt, gridlock government. Washington is backwards.""

Then suddenly, the video turns to an image of a sunrise with the narrator telling us who’s responsible: ""But Chris Christie, with bipartisan support, is taking New Jersey (in) another direction.""

The ad goes on to claim Christie ""cut spending (by) $1 billion"" and provided ""$850 million in new education funding.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that the group’s numbers are technically correct, but the picture is less sunny when you examine the education funding changes over the course of Christie’s tenure.

Let’s start with that $1 billion in spending cuts.

The $1 billion in spending cuts mentioned in the ad refers to the line-item vetoes made by Christie in response to a $30.6 billion budget approved in June by the Democratic-controlled Legislature.

With his line-item vetoes, Christie reduced the fiscal year 2012 budget to nearly $29.7 billion. So the group is right that he cut spending by about $1 billion from what the Legislature had approved.

Despite that decrease, the fiscal year 2012 budget is still larger than the fiscal year 2011 budget that Christie signed in June 2010. The fiscal year 2012 budget is about $1.3 billion greater than the fiscal year 2011 budget approved last year.

David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, said that $1.3 billion -- most of which represents a pension payment and increased school aid -- was made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2012.

Now, let’s turn to the ""$850 million in new education funding"" mentioned in the ad.

In a previous ruling, we noted how the fiscal year 2012 budget increases education funding by about $863 million over the prior fiscal year. That figure supports the group’s claim, but there’s two problems with that argument.

First, about half of that increased aid -- more than $446 million -- was required as part of a court order to go to the so-called Abbott districts. So Christie didn’t have a choice about that money.

Secondly, the fiscal year 2011 budget cut education aid by about $829 million. That means the new budget only represents a net increase of about $30 million.

In a Sept. 8 interview on an online radio show hosted by the New Jersey School Boards Association, Christie backs up that analysis:

""Yes, in my first year, we had to cut $820 million in funding from the public schools because we were in an enormous fiscal crisis. But the next year, this budget that I just signed...and advocated for, put an additional $850 million into the budget for public schools. So it paid back the entire cut from the year before of $820 million and added an additional $30 million on top of that.""

Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, defended both statements in an email.

""Christie did wind up cutting $1 billion in spending, as you note below, so I don’t see how the statement can be seen as being false,"" Jones said. ""Again, Christie did wind up increasing education funding by $850 million this year. It’s a true statement.""

Our ruling

A television ad from a pro-Christie group claims the governor ""cut spending (by) $1 billion"" and provided ""$850 million in new education funding.""

Those numbers are accurate, but when it comes to the education funding, Committee for Our Children’s Future must think New Jerseyans only have short-term memory. Given the cuts made last year, education funding has gone up by a total of about $30 million since Christie’s first budget in office.

David Axelrod says typical white male worker is earning no more than in 1973
","
As the 2012 elections loom and President Barack Obama pushes for his jobs plan, a key issue is how middle-class families have fared over the past generation.

Obama and other Democrats would like to see the Bush-era tax cuts expire for couples making more than $250,000 and also raise taxes on hedge-fund millionaires paying relatively low capital gains tax rates. For their part, Republicans claim Obama is engaging in ""class warfare"" against job creators.

In a Sept. 27, 2011 speech at St. Anselm College’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, David Axelrod, one of Obama’s top strategists, said there has been a ""hollowing out of the middle class in this country"" in recent decades as ""wages have essentially flat-lined"" for many workers.

""There was a census report just a couple of weeks ago, and what it said was that the average white male worker, the typical white male worker in this country, is making in real terms what he was making in 1973,"" said Axelrod, a former White House aide and now a senior adviser to Obama’s political campaign. ""In total, the average worker is making what they were making in 1996, but we know prices haven’t gone along accordingly.""

If true, that’s quite a ride back in time. Asked for substantiation, Katie Hogan of the Obama campaign referred us to a U.S. Census report released last month, and articles in the New York Times and the New Yorker website crunching some of the numbers.

The report itself didn’t have the precise numbers to back up Axelrod’s first claim -- that the typical white male worker made the same amount -- adjusted for inflation -- in 1973, when Richard Nixon occupied the White House.

But a related census spreadsheet shows that real wages have not only failed to grow but have actually declined slightly for white males working year-round and full time. 

But first, a semantic point near and dear to the heart of economists. Even though Axelrod said ""average"" in his statement, it’s clear by his subsequent use of the word ""typical"" and the reports to which we were referred that median income, not the mean, is what applies here.

In 2010, according to census data, the median earnings for a full-time white male worker were $50,074. By comparison, in 1973, the median for that category, in 2010 dollars, was $50,513. So Axelrod not only was correct that white men were no better off, adjusted for inflation, in 2010 than they were 37 years ago, they were taking home about $8.44 less per week.

And when measured by the purchasing power of those dollars, the gap is even bigger. Because wages haven’t kept up with prices, as Axelrod asserted, the typical white male worker's purchasing power has eroded by almost 11.5 percent in 37 years.

Heidi Shierholz, a labor market economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington, said Axelrod’s statement about white male workers is ""unambiguously true,"" and that wages haven’t kept up with major gains in productivity.

""The growing wealth of the country actually didn’t translate into higher standards of living or wages for typical workers,"" she said. ""Where it [the wealth] went was to the top.""

In the second part of Axelrod’s statement -- that ""the average worker is making what they were making in 1996"" -- it appears that the Obama strategist got some numbers mixed up.

A census table shows that median earnings for all full-time workers who clocked at least 50 weeks of labor increased by about 7 percent in real terms between 1996 and 2010, to $41,919. This came as earnings by women, and their participation in the labor force, grew at a faster rate than that of men, though the female-to-male earnings ratio was still 77.4 cents to the dollar in 2010.

Given the report Hogan, the Obama campaign press aide, cited, however, along with a number widely reported in the press last month, what Axelrod apparently was referring to when he spoke of average workers making what they did in 1996 were census numbers that showed total household income, adjusted for inflation, has barely increased. Median household income in 2010 was $49,445, only a $333 increase, or 0.7 percent, in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1996.

Some important factors are at play in household income numbers. For starters, households are smaller now, meaning there are fewer wage-earners to be counted. But women’s participation in the labor market has also increased. What that means, essentially, is that wage-earners in middle-class American households are working more  to maintain the same level of income.

""One of the ways families made up the difference was more work,"" Shierholz said of the stagnant wage issue. ""It’s largely an hours story.""

A paper Shierholz co-authored after the new census numbers were released also showed that median income for working-age households fell by more than 10 percent in the past decade, to $55,276.

Given such factors, she said the second half of Axelrod’s statement ""captures the flavor"" of what the EPI and others have labeled a ""lost decade"" in terms of income.

Our ruling 
Axelrod was on the money in talking about the erosion of earnings for white male workers since the early 1970s, and basically on track in comparing how things stand today for the typical American family compared to 1996.

Should President Barack Obama apologize for flip-flop on drone strikes? Louisiana lawmaker says yes
","
During an Oct. 3, 2011, appearance on the Fox Business Network, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., said he agreed with  comments critical of President Barack Obama that former Vice President Dick Cheney had offered one day earlier during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. 
Cheney had argued that Obama had criticized aspects of the Bush-Cheney approach to countering terrorism, yet once in office chose to follow many of his predecessors’ policies. ""If you've got the president of the United States out there saying we overreacted to 9/11 on our watch, that's not good,"" Cheney said. 
Host Candy Crowley then asked Cheney, ""You'd like an apology, it sounds like?"" 
Cheney responded, ""Well, I would. I think that would be, not for me, but I think for the Bush administration. …"" 
Fleming, in his Fox Business Network interview, echoed Cheney’s line of argument. During the interview, host Eric Bolling asked Fleming, ""Does the president owe an apology to Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney?"" 
Fleming answered, ""Absolutely, Eric. I agree with the former Vice President. President Obama is more and more beginning to look like the hypocrite-in-chief when it comes to the war on terrorism. All sorts of things that he criticized the president for, he's actually continued and even extended. This drone attack program, he's got it at the highest level ever."" 
The final part of Fleming’s comment is what caught our eye -- that Obama had essentially flip-flopped on the use of drones to attack terrorist targets. The issue was particularly timely because just days earlier, Obama had announced the killing by drone of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born extremist Muslim cleric linked to several terrorist plots against Americans. He had been considered one of the nation’s top terrorist targets. 
Many human-rights advocates have expressed feelings about drone strikes that range from unease to outright opposition. So we decided to check whether Obama had expressed opposition to using drones to assassinate terrorist targets prior to becoming president. (We did not receive a reply from Fleming’s office for this story.) 
First, some background on drones, recapping what we first published in a pair of analyses in 2010. 
Drones are remote-controlled, pilotless planes that can conduct surveillance and, if specially equipped, fire weapons on targets of interest, sometimes killing individuals. Because using drones does not put U.S. troops at direct risk, they have become increasingly in demand as a tool for combating terrorists. 
Drones were initially used during the George W. Bush administration, but their use has increased under Obama. They have been used with regularity on the battlefields of Iraq, Afghanistan and in tribal areas of Pakistan by uniformed military forces, and have also reportedly been used by the CIA. 
Since 2011 is not yet over, it’s not possible to know whether this year will set a record for drone attacks, as Fleming suggested. However, it’s clear that the Obama Administration has used them aggressively and far more than Bush did. According to statistics compiled by the centrist New America Foundation, the U.S. made nine drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and 2007, 33 in 2008, 53 in 2009 -- Obama’s first year in office -- and 118 in 2010. 
Through Oct. 2, 2011, the foundation recorded 60 strikes, which would not be a record-setting pace. However, in general, Fleming is correct that their use has increased under Obama. 
Cheney has a point that the Obama administration is now carrying out some of the policies it once opposed. Obama has backed off plans to close Guantanamo (we rated this a Promise Broken) and to enact an alternative to military tribunals (also a Promise Broken). 
But did Obama -- as Fleming suggests -- do a 180 on drone attacks? 
We see no evidence of it. 
A White House spokesman told us that candidate Obama hadn’t criticized drone attacks. None of the 500-plus campaign promises we have been tracking dealt with drones. In Google and Nexis searches, we found no criticism of drone attacks by Obama or his campaign aides. 
F. Whitten Peters -- a Washington attorney who, as a supporter unaffiliated with the campaign, co-authored an Oct. 20, 2008, op-ed praising Obama’s military and counter-terrorism agenda -- said he didn’t recall hearing any criticism from the campaign about the drone program. And a foreign policy scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation said he didn’t remember any either. 
""I do not recall offhand any Obama criticisms of drones,"" said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at Heritage. ""He did regularly criticize the Bush Administration's broader counter-terrorism policies as lawless,"" even though he continued many of these policies. 
Bromund added that Obama’s disinclination to curb drone attacks ""has been widely criticized on the left,"" so much so that the administration had to assign Harold Koh, the State Department's legal adviser, to defend it publicly in a March 25, 2010, address to the American Society of International Law. Koh, the former dean of Yale Law School, came into office as a hero of liberal human-rights activists, but his high-profile justification for drone strikes has driven a wedge between him and many of his old allies. 
Justifications such as Koh’s ""are on weak ground,"" said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a University of Notre Dame law professor. ""International law does not support attacking on a state’s territory where the state is not responsible for a significant armed attack on the defender."" 
In the meantime, we found two pieces of evidence that suggested that candidate Obama was comfortable with targeting terrorists for assassination and with drones. 
In a foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in August 2007, Obama said he understood that then-Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf ""has his own challenges. But let me make this clear: There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won’t act, we will."" 
This stance became controversial, earning criticism from his primary rival (and future Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton, as well as Obama’s eventual general-election opponent, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
Meanwhile, in a policy paper called ""A 21st Century Military for America,"" the Obama campaign promised to ""preserve our unparalleled airpower capabilities to deter and defeat any conventional competitors, swiftly respond to crises across the globe, and support our ground forces. … We need greater investment in advanced technology ranging from the revolutionary, like unmanned aerial vehicles and electronic warfare capabilities, to systems like the C-17 cargo and KC-X air refueling aircraft — which may not be glamorous to politicians, but are the backbone of our future ability to extend global power."" 
Neither of these two pieces of evidence proves that candidate Obama supported a policy of assassination-by-drone. The Wilson Center speech doesn’t cite drone attacks by name, and the position paper doesn’t specifically say that the drones it supports would be used to target terrorists. But along with the lack of any other evidence to the contrary, we think it’s fair to say that Obama did not change his position on drones between the time he was a candidate and the time he entered the Oval Office. 
Our ruling 
Fleming -- and Cheney -- have a point that Obama has flip-flopped on some positions concerning counter-terrorism, notably his decision not to close Guantanamo. But Fleming was wrong when he cited the ""drone attack program"" as evidence that Obama was a hypocrite. We find no evidence to support the claim that candidate Obama opposed drone strikes on terrorist targets and no hypocrisy when he increased the frequency of those strikes well beyond what Bush, his predecessor, did. We rate Fleming’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F2680>],/factchecks/2011/oct/05/john-fleming/should-obama-apologize-policy-shift-drone-strikes-/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Miller']","
Mark Miller says Wisconsin Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 schools of any state in the nation
","
When Wisconsin’s monthly unemployment numbers for August took another bad turn, both major political parties scrambled to affix blame.

Republican Governor Scott Walker pointed at ""problems in the national economy"" in his weekly radio address on Sept. 22, 2011.

Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona, fingered the Republican agenda of budget cuts and tax breaks for businesses for failing to create family supporting jobs.

Miller tucked another element -- the impact on education -- into the Democrats’ weekly radio address the same day: ""While voting for over $2.3 billion in tax giveaways, Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation."" 
We’ve already checked a variation of the tax-break claim -- the liberal group One Wisconsin Now said that Walker’s budget ""includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade."" 
The $2.3 billion figure is indeed the projected revenue loss, but the loss is from separate GOP-sponsored legislation as well as the budget. We rated that statement Half True. Miller, though, doesn't mention the 10-year period, so that takes the first part of his statement even more off the mark. 
But what about the education-related cuts?

Were they the ""most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation""? And by what measure?

Miller pointed us to a September 2011 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that compared state-by-state budget cuts.

He specifically noted media coverage of the study in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Madison’s Capital Times and the Wisconsin Radio Network -- all of which emphasized the #1 ranking in either a headline or first paragraph.

Let’s take a deeper look.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, obtained budget data from 24 states -- not all 50 -- in conducting what experts told us was the only study that has attempted to quantify the recession-era cutbacks by state governments in aid to local schools.

The group analyzed state general education funding that is sent to local schools using formulas and ranked states by two measures.

It did not attempt to catalog how much individual school districts might have saved in costs due to limits on collective bargaining included in Walker’s budget-repair bill. But, that is potentially important. The state money to local schools was cut, but many districts were able to use the new freedom from union contracts to cut their own budgets to recover some or even all of the lost state aid. That limited the overall negative impact on the classroom.

The study is ongoing, as the group is trying to gather information from the remaining 26 states. For those states, the information was not yet available or there were other obstacles to crunching the numbers, said Phil Oliff, a policy analyst who co-authored the study.

The study found that Wisconsin had plenty of company in cutting aid for 2011-12 over the previous year -- 21 of the 24 states have cut per-student funding to some degree.

The study noted: ""Some of the deepest reductions to K-12 formula funding since the onset of the recession have occurred in the past year, as federal aid intended to sustain state education spending has expired, rainy day funds have been exhausted, and states have resisted raising additional taxes to offset the need for cuts.""

It ranked Wisconsin’s cuts as third deepest in percent change in spending per student (10.0%). The study highlighted this finding: ""Of the states surveyed, the three states that reduced per student funding the most since last year are Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin.""

So, it’s a poor ranking, to be sure. But that’s not Number 1.

By another measure, Wisconsin was Number 1 -- the dollar change per student (-$635). This was covered in a chart in the study and that is what drew the headlines -- and Miller’s attention.

Oliff told us that both measures were useful, just from different perspectives. A prominent Wisconsin education funding researcher who reviewed the group’s numbers, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Andrew Reschovsky, agreed both measures are important.

""The bottom line is Wisconsin has made very deep cuts, either year over year or compared to pre-recession (levels),"" Oliff told us. ""Some of the deepest cuts in the nation.""

We asked Reschovsky how he would characterize Wisconsin’s rankings based on the study. 
""I'd be comfortable saying that among the 24 states they studied, and focusing only on aid, Wisconsin has cut state aid more dramatically than most of those other states,"" Reschovsky said. 
That's some of the deepest cuts, and deeper than most other states, but not the deepest. 
The Journal Sentinel’s story on Sept. 6, 2011 led with ""Wisconsin leads the country so far this year in cuts to state aid for schools"" -- but immediately noted the study was limited to 24 states. The story also noted the #3 ranking on the other measure. The headline was less specific: ""Wisconsin ranks high in school aid cuts.""

The Capital Times piece the same day led with the dollar change (#1) under this headline: ""Wisconsin’s cuts to school aid steepest of 24 states studied.""

The next day, the Wisconsin Radio Network’s website said: ""Wisconsin K-12 funding cuts lead the nation.""

The WRN story led off: ""Wisconsin’s cuts to school aid are the deepest among 24 states where budget information is available, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.""

Like the others, it also prominently noted the limits of the study -- 26 states are not included.

We asked Miller’s office how he could say the cuts were the most drastic ""of any state"" when the study looked at only 24 states.

Miller spokesman Michael Browne told us that by saying ""Republicans enacted"" the deepest cuts, Miller had provided listeners with the appropriate context. ""Enacted"" signals that Miller was talking about the deepest cuts just among those states that had acted, Browne argued.

But that doesn’t square with why the study was limited to 24 states.

Some others have acted, but the data is just not available or has not been analyzed. And it’s reasonable to think some or many have cut education funding, said Oliff.

Our conclusion

Miller took to the airwaves to say that ""Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation.""  He cited media reports concerning a study by a liberal think tank.

Researchers we consulted poked no holes in the study, but it only covered about half the states. And while Wisconsin did indeed lead in cuts by one measure, it was third according to a second measure that is highlighted in the group’s report.

There’s an element of truth in Miller’s claim, but he pushed past the limits of the study. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F50C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/05/mark-miller/mark-miller-says-wisconsin-republicans-enacted-mos/

Herman Cain: EPA to regulate dust in 2012
","
It was the kind of question that any politician who opposes big government would love to field during a GOP presidential debate.

""My question is, if you were forced to eliminate one department from the federal government, which one would you eliminate and why?"" asked a man from Arlington, Va., via YouTube during the Sept. 22 debate in Orlando.

A moderator chose metro Atlantan Herman Cain to answer it, and to the delight of the audience, he turned his hypothetical ax on a favorite target of big government foes: the Environmental Protection Agency.

""Now, I know that makes some people nervous, but the EPA has gone wild. The fact that they have a regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, to regulate dust says that they've gone too far,"" Cain replied.

Dust? The EPA will start regulating dust in January?

We contacted the Cain camp for evidence, but they didn’t reply. Fortunately, the EPA posted its reports on the issue online. Factcheck.org, a fact-checking operation similar to PolitiFact, looked into Cain’s comment as well.

We found that the EPA has long regulated a category of air pollution called ""particulate matter,"" which includes dust. There’s no new regulation scheduled for Jan. 1, 2012.

Particle pollution is a floating mix of solid particles and liquid droplets. Sometimes, the particles are visible, like smoke from a power plant, haze, or the dust that Cain mentioned. Other times, they’re so small they’re invisible to the naked eye.  

These particulates can be made up of any number of chemicals, and can come from a variety of sources such as smokestacks, fires or construction sites.

A growing body of scientific evidence links particle pollution to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, lung disease, heart problems and even higher death rates, according to multiple independent reviews of the scientific literature as well as the EPA.

A small number of studies have even linked naturally occurring dust storms to a rise in trips to the emergency room for cardiovascular problems, according to an EPA review of scientific studies.  

The EPA has regulated this form of air pollution since 1971 under the Clean Air Act, and requires air monitors in areas with populations greater than 100,000, according to state and federal documents. But it does not specifically single out farm dust for regulation.

Since states have to comply with the regulations or risk losing federal money, they may institute rules for farm dust to get into compliance with the law, a lobbyist for the farm industry and news accounts confirm.  

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA reviews its particle pollution standards every five years. And that’s where the current dust-up over dust began.

The EPA released its most recent policy assessment in April. It concludes that based on the newest research, it’s worthwhile to consider tightening some standards on larger or ""coarse"" particulates. This category includes dust from landfills, construction sites, agriculture and industrial sources such as steel mills.

The agriculture industry and other groups objected, saying this suggestion doesn’t make sense for rural areas, where tractors and pickups kick up naturally occurring dirt in the fields or on unpaved roads.

But both the EPA and regulation opponents agree that no regulation is in the pipeline, and it’s certainly not coming Jan. 1.

Factcheck.org’s Sept. 23 story on the debate noted that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture in March that it was a ""mischaracterization"" that the EPA is trying to ""expand regulation of dust from farms.""

Indeed, the EPA has not formally submitted new regulations for review, an agency spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. Jackson said she would make a decision on whether to tighten the rules in July, according to a Reuters news story, but she has yet to do so.

Even if the EPA were to submit such regulations today, it could take a year or so for them to go into effect, said Richard Krause, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. The EPA would have to make any proposal available for public review and comment, a process that could take some months.

So to sum up:

The EPA has been regulating large particulate matter, including dust, for four decades, but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas.

EPA staffers and scientists concluded after an assessment of the most recent science that it’s worthwhile to consider tightening current regulations, but the EPA has not formally proposed any regulation, and even if they did so today, it could take a while for it to go into effect.

So, Cain does have a point. The EPA does regulate dust under the Clean Air Act. But Cain’s language was very specific, and now that the dust has settled in the wake of the Republican debate, it’s clear his specifics were incorrect.

Dust is regulated, but not at all in the way that Cain described. We therefore rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EF2F80>],/factchecks/2011/oct/05/herman-cain/herman-cain-epa-regulate-dust-2012/

Ohio Dems chair Chris Redfern says driving the new 15th District is like driving to Niagara Falls
","
Democratic Party chief Chris Redfern gets paid to take shots at Republicans.

On Sept.15, Redfern had a juicy new target for his barbs -- a new congressional map that Republicans had rolled out the day before. It showed several sprawling districts winding through multiple counties to create solid GOP majorities.  

Prepared by Republicans staffers, the congressional map redrew Ohio’s 18 congressional districts into 16 districts — 12 Republican and four Democratic districts. It was attacked by Redfern (and other Democrats) who said the serpentine districts were mapped out purely for GOP partisan advantage.

As he mocked the lines drawn by Republicans, Redfern highlighted the district that many independent observers found to be the clearest example of gerrymandering — the 15th Congressional District, which winds through portions of 13 counties and has a circumference of 934 miles.

Now represented by Republican Steve Stivers, the district is shaped like the open jaws of a crocodile or a ""reverse Pac-man,"" in Redfern’s words.

""To drive from northern Union County to Athens to Hillsboro without leaving Steve’s district you’d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls,"" Redfern told reporters at his news conference.

Sure, the district is a sprawling one — but a greater drive time than to the Canadian border? PolitiFact Ohio gassed up the Ford Factfinder and see where the facts met the road.

Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman shared the Google mapping he did to back up Redfern’s assertion.

He forwarded a route which began in Essex in northern Union County winding through Madison, Franklin, Fairfield, and Perry Counties as it headed east. Heading due south into Athens County, the route then swung westward traveling though Vinton and Ross counties to end in Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County.

Google maps spit out a total distance of 259 miles and said it would take nearly 6 hours — 5 hours and 58 minutes to traverse it. Meanwhile, Columbus to Niagara Falls, N.Y., is 349 miles -- mostly via freeway -- and a traveling time of six hours and one minute, according to Google Maps.

PolitiFact Ohio scrutinized the Democratic route and it does follow the contours of Stivers’ new district. However, the Democrats did fudge one tiny part of their route — they took state routes through southern Franklin County that are near, but not actually in Stivers’ district.

But they had to. Or you’d have to swim.

""It’s so skinny at the southern edge of Franklin County that no road passes through it,"" The Columbus Dispatch reported Sept. 18, 2011. ""He would have to swim across the Scioto River near the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant to travel from one end of his district to the other.""

Bringman acknowledged that the map was more of ""an interpretation"" of driving through the proposed district than actually doing it.

""To navigate the Southern end of Franklin County in the proposed 15th District, one would need to drive off-road for about 5 km between Lynnbrook and Lockbourne and ford the Scioto River Oregon Trail-style,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Depending on the vehicle being used, this could add some time to the trip. After passing Lockbourne, the driver may need to borrow a runway at Rickenbacker International Airport, assuming FAA approval.""

Additionally, it bears pointing out that the Democratic route is an attempt to get around Stivers district by staying wholly in the district at all times — it’s not how someone would actually travel to get from one point to another.

For example, Stivers district includes only portions of U.S. 33, so you can’t use it to travel from Columbus to Athens even though it’s a direct link between the two cities.

""He will be taking direct routes not only traveling within the lines of his district,"" said Courtney Whetstone, a staffer with Stivers’ Columbus congressional office. ""There isn’t any part of his district farther than an hour and a half from his house.""

Redfern’s statement does include the phrase ""without leaving Stivers’ district"" but the twists and turns of the road embodied in that statement are not made clear.

So after all this ramblin’ through Ohio, where do we end up?

Google maps estimates Redfern’s route plotted through the ""reverse Pac-man"" district would take six hours to drive and that matches the estimated drive time from Columbus to Niagara Falls.

The claim has to take a detour, though, because it’s not possible to drive through the new Ohio 15th in southern Franklin County. But then again, we can award points for context because the claim supports Redfern’s larger point -- that the boundaries for this sprawling district were drawn to achieve a political purpose.

Lastly, it needs to be said that Redfern’s route is not the way that Stivers or anyone would travel from one part of the district to another. Rather, they would choose a direct route that crosses district boundaries and would be a much shorter drive. That’s a point that provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern’s claim Mostly True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Helen Glover']","
R.I. talk radio host Helen Glover says new health care law will provide subsidies for families of four earning $88,000 a year
","
The overhaul of the nation’s health-care system -- and how Rhode Island is preparing for its impact -- dominated a recent segment of  WHJJ-AM's ""The Helen Glover Show.""

Glover's guest was Amy Gallagher, a local benefits consultant with the Cornerstone Group and a member of the health exchange work group of Governor Chafee’s Healthcare Reform Commission. The two were criticizing the federal law, warning that it will be too costly to taxpayers. 
Glover talked about how when she was younger, she couldn’t afford health insurance but managed to get by -- by tapping her savings to pay for doctor’s bills with cash.

""How do we pay for it?"" Glover asked about the new health care system and the planned exchanges that are an attempt to provide affordable insurance to the masses.

After a commercial break, Glover said that Gallagher ""was just telling me that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy for health insurance, which of course begs the question, who is paying for that in the long run? We all know that all of us are.""

We’re not going to delve into a debate about whether the health care law is going to save the country money or cost  more by extending coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. But we were curious whether a family with that much income would truly qualify for a federal subsidy.

But before we hook up the Truth-O-Meter to Glover’s statement, let’s first revisit the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law March 23, 2010.

One of its centerpieces is the so-called ""individual mandate."" Beginning in 2014, most U.S. citizens will be required to obtain health insurance, according to a summary of the law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an often-cited source of information on health care policy. If they don’t, they’ll face penalties that by 2016 will rise to $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income for individuals, whichever is greater.

Enter the exchanges. Their purpose is to create a marketplace that helps keep costs down by spurring competition between insurers while delivering to them vast numbers of consumers, including younger healthy people, many of whom lack insurance now.

Exchanges will be established in every state, with the federal government stepping in to create ones in states that opt not to participate. Rhode Island was moving toward establishing a state-based health-benefits exchange when Gallagher appeared on Glover’s show on Sept. 7. (On Sept. 20, Governor Chafee issued an executive order directing the establishment of an exchange.)

Both individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase coverage through exchanges when they open in 2014.

While the exchanges are intended to be affordable, it’s expected that plenty of people will still need financial assistance. That’s where the federal subsidies come in.

Called ""premium tax credits,"" the subsidies will be offered to income-eligible consumers who purchase insurance through an exchange. The credits will be paid directly to an insurer to help families that might not have the cash to make timely payments.

So back to Glover’s statement. Would a family of four making $88,000 a year qualify for the subsidies? The short answer is yes.

The guidelines are spelled out clearly in the Kaiser summary, as well as at HealthCare.gov, a Web site of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

They state that taxpayers with household incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level -- $89,400 a year for a family of four in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department -- will be eligible for credits.

Families at that level would contribute 9.5 percent of their income -- $8,493 --  to their health insurance premium. The tax credit would cover the remainder.

Those with lower incomes would contribute less and get bigger credits. A family at poverty level -- $22,350 for a family of four -- would contribute 2 percent of their income, about $447.

The Treasury Department, in an Aug. 12 notice, noted that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that individuals receiving tax credits will get an average subsidy of more than $5,000 per year.

Our ruling

Glover, quoting a talk show guest, said a family of four with an income of $88,000 would be eligible for a health insurance subsidy. That figure is actually $1,400 below the threshold to receive a subsidy.

And it’s in 2011 dollars, meaning that by 2014, when exchanges are scheduled to begin operation, it could be adjusted upward to reflect inflation.

While the diagnostic services of our Truth-O-Meter are not covered by any known health plan, we administer them freely. This claim gets a True.

No evidence that Joe Biden is withholding aid to Ukraine to help his son Hunter
","A Donald Trump ally who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in the investigation of whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election has accused President Joe Biden of withholding aid from Ukraine as a way of helping himself and his son Hunter Biden. The claim was made by George Papadopoulos, an adviser in Trump’s 2016 campaign who served 12 days in prison for lying about his attempts to allegedly connect other campaign staff with officials representing Russia. He was pardoned by Trump near the end of Trump’s term as president. In an April 12 tweet, widely shared on Facebook, Papadopoulos stated: ""Biden is now withholding $150 million in aid from Ukraine as tensions with Russia grow. I mentioned this a couple weeks ago. He wants to pressure Ukraine to drop all criminal investigations into him and his son, Hunter. Where’s the media on this extortion attempt?"" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence Ukraine is conducting criminal investigations of the president or his son. Congress approved and President Trump signed a bill appropriating $275 million for what is known as the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative. The secretary of defense can use the money to provide assistance, such as training and intelligence support, as well as weapons to Ukraine. In March, the Defense Department announced it was releasing $125 million of the aid in training, equipment and advisory efforts as part of the U.S. commitment to provide ""defensive lethal weapons to enable Ukraine to more effectively defend itself against Russian aggression."" The remaining $150 million will be provided when the Defense Department ""certifies that Ukraine has made sufficient progress on key defense reforms this year, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act,"" the announcement said.  ""The Department encourages Ukraine to continue to enact reforms that strengthen civilian control of the military, promote increased transparency and accountability in defense industry and procurement, and modernize its defense sector in other key areas in line with NATO principles and standards."" Previous legislation also required that some assistance be withheld to Ukraine pending completion of certain reforms, said Steven Pifer, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution and a retired foreign service officer. Lincoln Mitchell, a research scholar in war and peace studies at Columbia University said that ""in general, it is not all that unusual to withhold money for specific reasons that are required by U.S. law or policy. That is what Biden is doing."" Last July, we rated False a claim that Joe Biden was formally listed as a criminal suspect in a Ukraine case involving his son.  A judge in Ukraine ordered that a criminal case file be opened regarding Biden’s efforts as vice president to get Ukraine’s top prosecutor removed from office. But the bar is low in Ukraine for opening a criminal case file; in this case, it was requested by a member of parliament. And the opening of the file does not mean that a criminal investigation was launched with probable cause, or that Biden is a suspect. In November, Ukrainian authorities said they closed a criminal probe of Joe Biden over allegations that he improperly forced the ouster of the country’s prosecutor general in 2016. Hunter Biden held a paid directorship with a Ukrainian natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, beginning in 2014. It drew attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. Pifer and Mitchell said they have seen no evidence that Ukraine is conducting a criminal investigation of the Bidens. We tried to reach out to Papadopoulous through his book publisher and his LinkedIn account, but did not get a reply. The claim has echoes of some of the same issues raised in Trump’s first impeachment in November 2019. The House impeached Trump, and the Senate later acquitted him, on charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress. A whistleblower’s complaint had sounded alarms about Trump’s efforts to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations into Joe Biden before the 2020 election. The articles of impeachment charged that Trump held up security assistance and a White House meeting to put pressure on Ukraine, then obstructed Congress to cover it up. Trump ally George Papadopoulos claimed Joe Biden is ""withholding $150 million in aid from Ukraine"" to ""pressure Ukraine to drop all criminal investigations into him and his son, Hunter."" There is no evidence of any such investigations. The Biden administration released $125 million in military aid to Ukraine but, following federal law, is withholding $150 million until Ukraine enacts military reforms. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2D2AC0>],/factchecks/2021/apr/15/george-papadopoulos/no-evidence-joe-biden-withholding-aid-ukraine-help/

No, Moderna’s chief medical officer didn’t say mRNA alters DNA
","""Moderna chief medical officer admits: mRNA alters DNA,"" reads the description of a video in a Facebook post that’s being shared widely.  The footage in the video is from a 2017 TED Talk featuring Tal Zaks, chief medical officer of Moderna, which has created an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 that’s being used across the country. But the Facebook post misrepresents the actual title of the talk and what Zaks said during the event.  COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not affect our DNA. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) At the start of the approximately 10-minute presentation, titled ""The disease-eradicating potential of gene editing,"" Zaks said ""we’re actually hacking the software of life"" in how we prevent and treat disease.  He then briefly explains how mRNA works.  ""Our body is made out of organs, our organs are made out of cells, and in every cell there’s this thing called messenger RNA or mRNA for short that transmits the critical information from the DNA — our genes — to the protein, which is really the stuff we’re all made out of. This is the critical information that determines what a cell would actually do."" He compares the whole thing to an operating system, and then says, ""and if you could actually introduce a line of code, or change a line of code, it turns out that has profound implications for everything from the flu to cancer.""  But he’s not talking about altering DNA. He uses the flu vaccine as an example. A vaccine is an injection where we get ""bits and pieces of the virus, the proteins, and that teaches our immune system to recognize the virus,"" he said. ""Now imagine if instead of giving the protein, we would give the instructions on how to make the protein — how the body can make its own vaccine. That’s an mRNA vaccine."" He then shows two images. One represents a traditional vaccine, where the virus proteins are floating around the cell. The second shows what looks like an mRNA vaccine triggering the cells to create those proteins.  But mRNA vaccines never enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes on a page on its site dedicated to understanding mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. After the mRNA triggers the cells to create the virus proteins, the cell then breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA, according to the CDC.  We’ve previously debunked claims that these vaccines will alter the DNA of those injected. But that’s wrong, and so is the claim that Moderna’s chief medical officer said as much.  We rate this post False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C140D40>],/factchecks/2021/apr/14/facebook-posts/no-modernas-chief-medical-officer-didnt-say-mrna-a/

GOP ad misstates Warnock’s position on Georgia boycotts and MLB’s shift on All-Star Game
","An ad by a national Republican group portrays Sen. Raphael Warnock as supporting Major League Baseball’s decision to pull the All-Star Game from Georgia in protest of the state’s new voting law.  The National Republican Senatorial Committee’s digital ad begins with a clip of President Joe Biden praising professional athletes for speaking out against the law, which expands early voting but includes new restrictions on voting by mail.  The ad focuses its attack on Warnock, a Democrat who won his Senate seat in a January runoff but faces re-election again in 2022. It includes a partial clip of Warnock’s appearance on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" to discuss the voting law, a few days before MLB’s announcement.  ""Should boycotts be on the table?"" CNN’s Dana Bash asked Warnock. The ad uses only the beginning of Warnock’s response: ""I think we all have to use our voices."" The ad, titled ""Warnock’s All-Star Blunder With The MLB,"" features a business owner and a tourism official talking about the economic loss from the All-Star Game.  ""Tell Senator Warnock you oppose his Georgia boycott,"" the ad concludes. Some major Georgia-based corporations have made statements against the voting restrictions in Georgia’s law (and some Republicans, in turn, have called for boycotts of those businesses). On April 12, film director Antoine Fuqua and actor Will Smith announced that they are moving upcoming production of the film ""Emancipation,"" about a fugitive from slavery, out of Georgia in protest.  But the ad’s reference to Warnock and ""his Georgia boycott"" misrepresents the senator’s stated position by suggesting he approves of the boycott. Warnock said April 2 that he hopes ""businesses, athletes, and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on."" We watched Warnock’s full interview on CNN as well as other statements he made and found that Warnock did not call for any sort of boycott of Georgia. In the CNN interview, Warnock demurred on the question of a boycott. He gave a broad statement in favor of corporations standing up for voting rights, but also said he wants Georgia ""open for business."" Here’s the fuller exchange between Bash and Warnock, in which the senator also called for passing federal voting-rights legislation: Bash: ""Georgia-based corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta are facing intense criticism for not doing more to publicly oppose this law. Organizations like the PGA, the MLB are also under pressure to move high-profile events, like the Masters and the All-Star Game, out of your state of Georgia. Does corporate America need to be more forceful in denouncing this law? Should boycotts be on the table?"" Warnock: ""I think we all have to use our voices. And I have to tell you, as the pastor of Ebenezer Church, I have seen these corporations falling over themselves every year around the time of the King holiday celebrating Dr. King. ""And, yes, I think that the way to celebrate Dr. King is to stand up for what he represented, voting rights. And so we will see how all of that plays out. But I'm focused on what we can do in the United States Senate. ""We have a responsibility to make sure that we secure the franchise. And we — when we do that, we protect the democracy. And I think, also, we set the climate for business. We want to see people prosper, particularly who have been suffering for months under this pandemic. We need to pass this legislation, protect the right of the people to be heard in their own democracy, and to make sure that Georgia is open, open for business and open for voting.""  Bash: ""So, no boycotts?"" Warnock: ""Listen, I'm not focused on that. I am focused on what I can do as a United States senator."" The NRSC said in a press release that Warnock gave his ""implicit approval for the boycotts"" by not answering the question directly. We asked the group whether it could point to any other statements by Warnock in favor of a boycott and did not receive a response.  In other statements, Warnock called for corporations to speak out against the law, but didn’t go as far as calling for MLB or any other business to boycott Georgia. On March 25, the day Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the law, a reporter asked Warnock, ""Should Georgians who oppose this be considering a boycott of Georgia businesses?"" Warnock replied: ""We need Georgia businesses to stand up, in a moment like this. They, too, are citizens of this state, and I can tell you as someone who is the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. King served, that come Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, the corporate entities in this state will all be falling over themselves to honor Dr. King. If you want to honor Dr. King, stand up against voter suppression right now.""  It was in the next few days that the idea of the MLB moving the All-Star Game, and criticism of the law by corporations, started to pick up steam. In an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on March 26, Warnock again called on corporations to speak up. ""And I say to the corporations in Georgia that have been entirely too silent in this moment that this is what Dr. King meant when he said that there comes a time when silence is betrayal,"" he said. ""All of us have got to use our voices, our vote, and I am going to use every fiber, every effort, everything within me to stand up for our democracy."" On April 2, after pressure from players prompted MLB to move the All-Star Game, Warnock called on businesses, athletes and entertainers not to leave the state. ""Businesses and organizations have great power in their voices and ability to push for change, and I respect the decision of the players to speak out against this unjust law. It is not the people of Georgia or the workers of Georgia who crafted this law, it is politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians’ voices. And today’s decision by MLB is the unfortunate consequence of these politicians’ actions,"" Warnock said in a press release. ""It is my hope that businesses, athletes, and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on, and hand-in-hand with the community."" Warnock made a similar statement on Twitter. Other leading Democrats in Georgia explicitly rejected a boycott, including voting rights activist Stacey Abrams and Georgia’s other senator, Democrat Jon Ossoff. An online ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee suggests that Warnock supports boycotts of Georgia to protest the state’s new voting law, and uses a clip from a CNN interview. The ad ignores statements Warnock made in the interview and later, where he expressed his hope that businesses would speak out about the law, but continue doing business with Georgia.

Liz Cheney’s dubious claim that just 6% of Biden plan is “infrastructure”
","As President Joe Biden seeks to win congressional support for his American Jobs Plan, Democrats and Republicans have been attacking each other over how they define the key element of the proposal: infrastructure. The third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, appeared on CBS’s ""Face the Nation"" and argued that just a tiny fraction of Biden’s proposal consists of ""infrastructure."" During the April 11 edition of the show, host Margaret Brennan reminded Cheney that in 2017, she supported President Donald Trump's infrastructure proposal. ""Nothing ever came of that, of course,"" Brennan said. ""But you liked the concept. Why are you opposed to it now?"" Cheney responded, ""Well, it's a very different proposal, obviously. Something less than 6%, as you mentioned, of this proposal that President Biden has put forward is actually focused on infrastructure."" We didn’t see where Brennan ""mentioned"" the 6% figure earlier in the interview, but Cheney’s statement caught our eye, because other Republicans have cited a similar figure, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.  The difference is that McConnell, McCarthy and Scott specified that the 6% figure referred to spending on roads, bridges and highways. They were correct: Biden’s proposal calls for spending roughly that much on roads, bridges and highways. Cheney, on the other hand, used the broader term ""infrastructure,"" a word that would seem to encompass other provisions in the proposal, from railways and waterways to airports and the electric grid. We checked with Cheney’s office to see whether she had misspoken. In a statement to PolitiFact, they said she had not. ""Roads, bridges, and highways are what constitutes 'infrastructure,'"" the statement said. It continued, ""When taken at what infrastructure is supposed to mean — rebuilding or investing in improvements for roads, bridges, and highways — under 6% of the Biden outline goes towards 'infrastructure.'""   However, outside experts questioned that narrow interpretation. ""That’s not my definition,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-of-center American Action Forum. ""Mine is broader than hers."" A BNSF Railway train hauling carloads of coal from the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, seen east of Hardin, Mont., on July 15, 2020. (AP) It’s clear that some elements of Biden’s proposal do not fit a traditional definition of infrastructure, such as $400 billion devoted to expanding access to long-term, home and community-based care under Medicaid.  Supporters have defended such categorizations. On ABC’s ""This Week,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the definition of infrastructure ""evolves to meet the American people's aspirations."" But some experts see the administration as stretching the definition too far. ""Much of what the president is calling ‘infrastructure’ consists of exercises in industrial policy,"" said James E. Moore II, director of the Transportation Engineering Program at the University of Southern California. Economists consider infrastructure spending to be ""money that generates a return, while industrial policy tends to be a losing proposition. The administration has picked a label for its spending plan that it hopes will deflect criticism."" Some other elements of the plan fall into a gray area, arguably fitting under some definitions of infrastructure. These include $590 billion for research and development and domestic manufacturing; $400 billion in clean energy tax credits; and $328 billion for capital investments in housing, schools, child care centers, veterans’ hospitals and other federal buildings. But other provisions would fall under the traditional umbrella of infrastructure, beyond the $115 billion for roads, bridges, and highways. Here’s a list, drawn from to an analysis of the proposal by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: Public transit: $85 billion Passenger and freight rail: $80 billion Airports: $25 billion Ports and waterways: $17 billion Protecting critical infrastructure and increasing resilience of land and water resources: $50 billion High-speed Internet: $100 billion Power infrastructure: $100 billion Drinking water supply system upgrades: $111 billion These elements total $683 billion, which works out to about 26% of the $2.65 trillion proposal. That’s more than four times the 6% Cheney considers to be infrastructure. The categories totaling $683 billion are ""not only infrastructure but critical infrastructure,"" said Robert Greer, an associate professor in public service and administration at the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government and Public Service. ""As a Texan, we are acutely aware of energy system modernization issues given the recent rolling blackouts."" Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, agreed. ""There is no reason to exclude traditional infrastructure categories — transportation, water resources, energy, and telecommunications — when assessing the American Jobs Plan,"" Tomer said. ""For decades, and in some case centuries, the federal government has supported direct investment in these physical capital systems and related policies like workforce development and planning grants."" When we asked the American Water Works Association what they thought of Cheney excluding their industry from her definition of ""infrastructure,"" legislative director Tommy Holmes said, ""I have often heard ‘roads and bridges’ being used as shorthand for all infrastructure, but I have never been in a serious discussion of the nation’s infrastructure that did not include the nation’s drinking water and wastewater systems."" Heat comes off the pavement near high-tension electrical lines in Los Angeles on Aug. 15, 2020. (AP) Cheney’s statement on ""Face the Nation"" is especially striking since she has a paper trail of defining ""infrastructure’ more broadly. Here’s what she’s included in her discussion of infrastructure in the recent past: Railways and waterways: In September 2020, Cheney announced her support for the Building U.S Infrastructure through Limited Delays & Efficient Reviews Act, which would overhaul the review process for big projects under the National Environmental Policy Act. ""For too long, vital improvements to our roads, bridges, railways and waterways have stalled due to NEPA’s outdated guidelines,"" Cheney said. Cheney also co-sponsored the Critical Infrastructure Act of 2019, which addressed regulation of water infrastructure. Rural broadband: Cheney applauded the Federal Communications Commission’s February 2020 authorization of money to expand rural broadband in Wyoming. ""We need to continue prioritizing this crucial infrastructure,"" she wrote. She also released a statement in 2018 that supported the Farm Bill, touting rural broadband as one of the bill’s ""important investments in infrastructure."" Water supply: In 2019, Cheney announced that she was co-sponsoring the Water Quality Certification Improvement Act, which, according to a news release, would clarify ""the permitting process for pipelines and other infrastructure projects."" And in a September 2017 newsletter for constituents, Cheney noted House passage of the Water Resources Development Act, which aided ""water infrastructure"" such as the Fontenelle Reservoir in her home state. Transit and the energy grid: Cheney co-sponsored the Transit Infrastructure Vehicle Security Act, which bars transit rail-car purchases from certain countries, and the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, which defined the ""energy infrastructure of the United States"" as including ""pipelines, refining capacity, electrical power generation and transmission, and renewable energy production."" In other words, just in the past few years, Cheney has either co-sponsored or touted her support for bills that defined infrastructure as encompassing railways, waterways, broadband, water distribution and the energy supply, including renewable energy. Biden’s proposal includes all of those elements, but Cheney ignored them in her latest definition of infrastructure. ""Cheney was making a very legitimate criticism,"" Moore said. ""It is unfortunate she exaggerated her case."" Cheney said, ""Something less than 6% ... of this proposal that President Biden has put forward is actually focused on infrastructure."" The figure she cited applies to spending on roads, bridges and highways, but excludes items in Biden’s proposal that experts say are widely considered to be infrastructure, including public transit, rail, airports, ports, waterways, the electrical grid, drinking water systems and broadband. Moreover, her narrow definition of infrastructure contradicts her own repeated use of the word ""infrastructure"" in relation to bills that cover a wide range of matters beyond roads, bridges and highways.

1986 law did not lead CDC to recommend more child vaccines
","An image being widely shared on Facebook claims to show a dramatic increase in the number of vaccinations that have been recommended for children over the years. The image shows a list of vaccines it says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended for children. According to the list, the number of vaccines a child should get went from three shots in 1962 to more than 50 in 2019. One account that shared the image blamed the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act as the reason behind the increase. ""Look at the schedule, we have gotten sicker and sicker, spend more money on healthcare ever in history, and (the) biggest jump in shots came after the 1986 Vaccine protection act which gave them exemption for responsibility of killing people and destroying the ones they didn’t kill,"" the Facebook post said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post misrepresents and misinterprets the 1986 legislation and its relationship to the CDC’s current vaccine schedule. While the law did help ensure the nation would have access to vaccines, it has no bearing on what vaccines are recommended. Rather, the CDC’s vaccination schedule is updated annually in response to health issues impacting the U.S. and as new vaccines become available. Health Feedback also assessed this claim and debunked the notion that the U.S. has gotten ""sicker and sicker"" due to vaccines, writing, ""Multiple large-scale studies found no association between childhood vaccines and poor health or chronic conditions. Scientific evidence shows that childhood immunization schedules are safe."" Here, we focus on what we know about the 1986 law and childhood vaccine schedule. What the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act actually does The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was established after vaccine manufacturers were hit by a series of lawsuits in the 1970s from people who claimed they had experienced harmful side effects after being given the vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, commonly referred to as the DPT vaccine. These lawsuits resulted in damages being awarded despite what the CDC and experts have noted was a lack of scientific evidence backing up the claims. Seth Mnookin, author of ""The Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Autism Controversy"" said that between 1980 and 1985, vaccine-related tort claims increased more than 600% in the U.S. with total damages topping $3.5 billion.  ""By that time, the number of companies willing to distribute vaccines in the U.S. had plummeted, from several dozen in the 1960s to 4 in 1985,"" Mnookin said. It was amid what Mnookin described as ""anti-vaccine hysteria"" that one of two companies in the United States that distributed the DPT vaccine halted domestic distribution. This prompted the CDC to warn the nation its stockpile of vaccinations was running low — and eventually led to the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.  The new law was designed to encourage vaccine supply while providing some remedy to those who believed the vaccines had harmed them. The law led to the creation of three entities — the National Vaccine Program Office, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (called VAERS) and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Before it was dissolved by the Trump administration in 2019, the National Vaccine Program Office oversaw the nation’s vaccination-related activities conducted by all the agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, including the FDA and CDC. VAERS is a database that physicians and individuals can use to report any negative events that occur following a vaccination. And the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a federally backed fund that pays ""no fault"" compensation to people who claim an injury from a vaccination. The law also requires healthcare workers to provide information to patients about the risks and benefits of the vaccines they’re receiving. The image shared on Facebook suggests that the CDC in 1962 recommended only three vaccines for children but that the list grew to include 11 shots in 1983 and 54 by 2019. This ignores that many of the vaccines given to children are administered in multiple doses, such as the five-dose TDaP — which came to replace DPT vaccines in providing protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis — and the three-dose hepatitis B vaccines. Some vaccinations require multiple doses because a single shot is not enough for the body to develop a strong immune response. Those shots are spaced out over time. Some vaccines also require boosters several years after initial injection because their effectiveness begins to wear off. Yearly flu shots are also recommended because flu viruses constantly change, and new flu vaccines are released yearly in order to keep up with those changes. In all, the CDC’s vaccination schedule for children from birth to 18 years old lists 12 vaccines, which provide protection against 16 diseases and are administered in up to 54 shots, including boosters and the annual flu shots. For eight years following the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, the CDC's list of recommended vaccinations didn't change. The hepatitis B vaccine was added in 1994. Its inclusion was in response to a hepatitis B epidemic in the United States, according to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After its addition, cases of hepatitis B among children under 18 were virtually eliminated. The vaccination schedule didn't get another update until 2000 when the chickenpox and hepatitis A vaccines were added.  ""In the two decades since then, an additional three vaccines have been added to the pediatric schedule: pneumococcal, influenza and rotavirus,"" Mnookin said. ""If you expand it to include adolescents, you can add an additional two vaccines: meningococcal and HPV."" Mnookin said the claim in this post requires one to believe ""various multinational corporations (are) working in secret with governments around the world to poison innocent civilians in order to boost profits."" Mnookin called it part of a ""loopy"" conspiracy theory. A Facebook post shows an image of the CDC's recommended vaccination schedule for children and suggests that the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act led to a ""jump"" in the number of recommended vaccines because it gave drug makers ""exemption for responsibility of killing people."" That’s wrong and gives a misleading characterization of the effect of the law on vaccines. The law established an office to oversee the nation’s vaccination efforts, a database to report adverse events after a vaccine is administered and led to the creation of a fund to compensate those who claimed to be injured by a vaccine. What’s more, it was eight years after the law’s adoption before a new vaccine was added to the CDC’s list of recommended childhood vaccines. The CDC’s vaccination schedule, which today includes 12 vaccines providing protection against 16 diseases, is updated on an annual basis in response to health issues impacting the U.S. and as new vaccines become available.

Fact-checking unproven claims that rapper DMX suffered heart attack after getting COVID-19 vaccine
","DMX, the raspy-voiced rapper behind several hip-hop anthems such as ""X Gon Give It to Ya"" and ""Party Up (Up In Here),"" died April 9 at a hospital in New York, where he had been on life support after suffering a heart attack days earlier. The rapper, born Earl Simmons, was 50. The hospital where DMX died said in a statement that he died ""peacefully with family present after suffering a catastrophic cardiac arrest."" It is not clear what preceded the rapper’s heart attack. But in the days surrounding DMX’s death, social media users circulated posts suggesting that the rapper died days after getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The implication: the vaccine made his heart fail. Various social media posts sharing the same headline — ""DMX Received Covid Vaccine Days Before Heart Attack"" — got tens of thousands of interactions on Facebook and Instagram, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.  A screenshot of an April 8 Instagram post sharing an MTO News headline about DMX. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The source of the viral headline was MTO News, a gossip news site. One day before DMX died, the site quoted an unnamed family member as saying that DMX got his COVID-19 shot once he became eligible to receive it ""so that he could go travel and perform, stuff like that."" PolitiFact could not verify the accuracy of the quotes or whether DMX was recently vaccinated before he died, as the headline claimed. MTO News did not respond to a request for comment, and our inquiries to DMX’s manager also went unanswered. But Murray Richman, DMX’s longtime attorney, told PolitiFact that the rap icon did not die of COVID-19 or because of a COVID-19 vaccine. ""Earl Simmons did not die of COVID or a COVID vaccine,"" Richman said. ""Earl Simmons died of a heart attack, spurred on by I don’t know what, but certainly not COVID or the vaccine."" The MTO News article does not provide proof that DMX died because he received the COVID-19 vaccine. The statements from his family and the hospital did not mention a vaccine, and Richman had told several news outlets that he was not sure what caused the heart attack even before the MTO News article published. (He was responding to a tabloid report that said DMX had suffered a drug overdose.) ""You can get a COVID vaccine and still die from something else,"" said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. MTO News ""frequently publishes unsubstantiated claims based on unclear sourcing,"" according to NewsGuard, a service that reviews and rates news and information sites according to nine basic journalistic criteria. NewsGuard identified several articles on MTO News that made false claims about celebrities’ sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as articles that embedded a doctored video about former President Donald Trump’s hair. In 2020, PolitiFact rated False an MTO News headline attributing a fabricated quote about George Zimmerman to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The claim about DMX mirrors other social media posts that wrongly blamed COVID-19 vaccines for the deaths of other celebrities, such as baseball legend Hank Aaron. Aaron died after receiving his vaccine, but not because of it, we found.  The U.S. administered over 167 million COVID-19 vaccine doses between Dec. 14, 2020, and April 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC’s vaccine safety surveillance program received 2,794 reports of death, affecting 0.00167% of recipients.  The agency wrote that after reviewing death certificates as well as autopsy and medical records for those people, it found ""no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths."" Instagram posts claimed, ""DMX received COVID vaccine days before heart attack."" The rumor can be sourced to a website that purported to quote an unnamed family member. Statements from the rapper’s family and the hospital that kept him on life support after a heart attack did not mention the coronavirus or a COVID-19 vaccine.  DMX’s attorney told PolitiFact that the rapper did not die because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Because this claim lacks supporting evidence, we rate it False. UPDATE, April 15, 2021: This fact-check was updated to reflect comments from Murray Richman, DMX’s attorney, confirming that the rapper did not die from a COVID-19 vaccine. Our ruling remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096642C80>],/factchecks/2021/apr/12/instagram-posts/fact-checking-unproven-claims-rapper-dmx-died-afte/

Fact-checking Joe Biden on how little some corporations pay in taxes
","With Republicans criticizing the corporate tax hike proposed by President Joe Biden to fund his infrastructure plan, Biden pushed back during remarks on his proposal, the American Jobs Plan. Biden framed the issue as one of fairness, with big corporations not paying their fair share. ""A new, independent study put out last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations use the various loopholes to pay zero federal income tax in 2020,"" Biden said in his April 7 remarks. ""It's just not fair. It's not fair to the rest of the American taxpayers."" We found that Biden’s statement is supported by a recently released study from a liberal group, though that study’s methodology has its critics. President Joe Biden speaks during an event on the American Jobs Plan at the White House on April 7, 2021. (AP) We didn’t hear back from the White House, but Biden’s remarks make clear that he was referring to an April 2 study by the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. That study, which had received wide media coverage in recent days, found that ""at least 55 of the largest corporations in America paid no federal corporate income taxes in their most recent fiscal year despite enjoying substantial pretax profits in the United States."" The list of 55 companies is sprinkled with well-known names, including FedEx, HP, Nike, Salesforce and XCel Energy.  Collectively, the study concluded, the companies earned $40.5 billion in pretax income in 2020 and would have paid taxes amounting to $8.5 billion had this income been taxed by at the standard 21% corporate rate. In reality, the companies collectively received rebates from the federal government worth $3.5 billion. The study cited several tax laws that helped protect these companies’ income from taxation, including those governing the tax treatment of executive stock options, research and experimentation, renewable energy, deductions for capital expenses, and the reallocation of losses to different tax years. Some observers told PolitiFact that they took issue with Biden’s characterization of such laws as ""loopholes."" Reasonable people can disagree over the wisdom of a given tax provision, but they were ""deliberate policy choices, not rifle shots,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, agreed. ""The problem with that framing is that many of the provisions reducing tax rates are either built into the code to properly calculate net income — such as a 100% bonus depreciation, a pro-growth provision — or provisions created to incentivize preferred activity by policymakers, such as the research and experimentation tax credit,"" Watson said. Still, even experts who are critical of the study’s methodology told PolitiFact that Biden accurately portrayed the gist of the report’s findings in his April 7 remarks. Notably, Biden’s remark also stopped short of blaming the companies for evading taxes; his remarks suggest that his quarrel is with the tax system that allowed the companies to legally pay so little in taxes. The group’s study is based on an analysis of annual financial reports filed by publicly traded companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index or the Fortune 500 list of companies with the largest revenue. But while this data comes from federally required disclosures, critics say that what is disclosed on these forms is calculated differently from these companies’ actual tax filings, which are private. In other words, the critics say, we don’t really know whether these companies paid zero in taxes or not. Holtz-Eakin wrote that using Securities and Exchange Commission filings, as the study does, is ""tricky,"" because the way income is counted on these forms ""departs substantially"" from the way taxable income is reported to the Internal Revenue Service. Notably, companies have some flexibility to determine their own fiscal years for financial disclosures, whereas the IRS requires a more rigid schedule for tax payments, he wrote. ""Financial reports may not cover the same period of time as a tax return,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, the tax code allows companies to ""smooth out income by allowing losses to be carried forward or backward for a number of years,"" Holtz-Eakin wrote. As a result, ""a snapshot of the company in its single year of profitability is a necessarily distorted view, but one that some tax critics tend to highlight."" In addition, the rules governing the reporting of capital investments in the SEC disclosures may be different from what the IRS allows.  Steve Wamhoff, director of federal policy at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said he disagrees with the methodological critiques. Wamhoff said his group’s report focuses on what the companies affirm is their best calculation of taxes they have paid for the year. ""It’s very unlikely that the company’s real-world income tax liability will be substantially different from this,"" he told PolitiFact. He added that the reallocation of losses to different tax years is reasonable in theory, ""but we are finding that corporations are not paying taxes over a longer period. Our report finds that many of these companies — 26 that we have identified — paid nothing over a three-year period.  William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, agreed that it can be difficult to infer a company’s actual tax position from its SEC filings. But he said the idea that many large corporations do pay zero in federal taxes is ""by now well-established."" ""The non-partisan Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has shown that in any given year for the past 15 years or so, about two-thirds of corporations with less than $1 billion in assets paid no federal corporate income tax, and one-third of corporations with assets greater than $1 billion paid no federal corporate income tax,"" Gale said. And the committee, he said, ""has access to corporations’ actual tax returns."" Biden said, ""A new, independent study put out last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations used various loopholes to pay zero federal income tax in 2020."" Biden is right that a study had been released days earlier by a non-governmental group that concluded that at least 55 large companies paid zero federal income taxes in 2020. However, it may be incorrect to call the tax provisions cited in the report ""loopholes,"" since many of them are deliberate attempts by the government to set incentives through the tax code and may on their own be broadly popular. Critics also say that the financial disclosures used to compile the report are imperfect estimates of what the companies actually paid in taxes, since the accounting rules are different for the two types of filings. On the other hand, separate data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is based on actual tax returns, has supported the study’s general point. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2EC680>],/factchecks/2021/apr/12/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-corporation-taxes/
"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Nicholas Langworthy']","
Does New York state have the highest taxes in the United States?
","New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, besieged by allegations of inappropriate behavior with women and an impeachment inquiry by the legislature, is defying pressure to step down. Now, Republican lawmakers and the state party are seizing on Cuomo’s troubles to argue that after more than 14 years of Democrats running the state, it’s time for a change in New York politics. In a mass email sent on March 17, New York State Republican Committee Chairman Nick Langworthy warned of the ""disastrous impacts of one-party rule in New York."" (Only one Republican has won statewide office since 1994, George Pataki, who was last elected governor in 2002.) One of the consequences of the longtime Democratic rule, Langworthy said, is a high tax rate. ""We pay the highest taxes in the nation, but criminals are shown more respect than small business owners and law-abiding New Yorkers,"" Langworthy wrote. ""It's insanity. If we are going to stop the mass exodus of our family, friends, and neighbors, we need common sense to make a comeback in this state."" Is Langworthy right about New York having the highest taxes in the country? Using the broadest definition, his claim is reasonable, although what you would pay in taxes in New York depends heavily on your economic situation. Langworthy’s office told PolitiFact New York that he was referring to the total tax burden that New Yorkers bear. He shared several studies and articles that referenced comparisons of the 50 states’ overall tax burdens, which include taxes levied at the state and local level. The Tax Foundation, for instance, calculates state and local tax burden by including income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes (such as on alcoholic beverages and tobacco, motor fuel and utilities), licensing taxes, corporate income taxes, estate taxes, and severance taxes, among others. Jared Walczak, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of state projects, pointed to his group’s latest state and local tax burden report, from 2019. It shows that 14.1% of New Yorkers’ incomes go directly to state and local government, by far the highest of any state.  Neighboring Connecticut is the second-highest, at 12.8%. The national median is 7.5%. In addition, New Yorkers pay $9,987 in state and local taxes per capita, which also ranks first in the nation. Connecticut is also second highest in this category, at $9,705. The overall state and local tax burden in New York has fluctuated somewhat over time. In 2010, according to the Tax Foundation calculation, it was 13.2%. By 2015, it had risen to 14.7%, then fell to 14.3% in 2016, before settling at its current rate of 14.1%. So Langworthy has strong support for his claim that New York is the highest-taxed state overall. That said, ""No state has the highest, or for that matter the lowest, tax for every tax,"" said Richard Auxier, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center For instance, New York’s individual income tax rates are relatively high at a maximum of 8.82%, but they are not the highest, trailing several states, including California with 12.3%. Meanwhile, New York’s sales tax rate, at 4%, and its motor fuel tax rate, at 24.6%, are relatively modest compared with other states. (Most local jurisdictions in New York do levy their own sales taxes, however, which typically pushes up the overall sales tax rate to about 8%.) New York City's tax burden could increase further if legislators enact a budget agreement that includes a tax hike on New York City's millionaires. (The city also has its own sales tax of 4.5%.) The main caveat to keep in mind is that the degree of taxation depends on the household’s income level, as well as other factors such as how much they drive.  A high-income person in New York, Auxier said, may pay higher taxes than a high-income person in a state without an income tax, such as Florida and Texas. But a low-income person could find New York to be a ""low tax"" state compared with other states that have higher sales taxes, which hit lower-income households more. ""If the representative wants to say New York already has relatively high taxes on high-income people he’s all good,"" said Auxier. ""But when you talk about the entire state you’re talking about a lot of very different people with very different tax burdens."" Langworthy said that residents of New York state ""pay the highest taxes in the nation."" According to the Tax Foundation’s comprehensive study, New York does have the highest overall tax burden in the United States. However, it’s important to note that New Yorkers in certain economic situations may fare better than similarly situated people in ""lower tax"" states, given the mix of taxes in the different states.

No, an Iowa BLM protest was not like the Jan. 6 US Capitol riot
","Social media posts and a number of conservative blogs shared claims that likened a Black Lives Matter-related protest at the Iowa State Capitol that resulted in one arrest to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. We found this claim in a Gateway Pundit story headlined ""INSURRECTION? Black Lives Matter Goons Take Over Iowa Capitol,"" a DJHJ Media blog and post, and a number of widely shared Instagram posts with the words ""Insurrection at the Iowa State Capitol"" underneath video from the protest.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The event in Iowa, where speakers included Cortez Rice of Minneapolis, nephew of George Floyd, was held as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was on trial for murder in Floyd’s death.  According to news reports, it was much different from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in at least two significant ways. In Iowa a ""Kill the Racist Bills"" demonstration, billed in social media posts promoting the event as a Black Lives Matter protest, was organized by Advocates for Social Justice, which says its mission ""is to create social, political and environmental change within the Cedar Rapids (Iowa) community, prioritizing the objectives of the #BLM movement.""  The group protested four bills introduced in the Iowa Legislature that it said would ""go against the Black Lives Matter movement's progress and will negatively affect lower-income communities and communities of color.""  Rally organizers showed reporters a copy of a state permit they obtained to hold the rally outside the Capitol and in the building's Rotunda, the Des Moines Register reported. The few dozen protesters waited in line to go through a metal detector and get a temperature check from security guards before entering the Capitol, according to Iowa Public Radio. They did not disrupt any legislative proceedings. The Washington attack came after President Donald Trump repeatedly said he wanted his supporters to fight Congress on accepting the Electoral College results that showed Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election.  On Jan. 6, thousands of Trump supporters attended a Trump speech near the White House, in which he invited the crowd to walk to the Capitol, before protesters charged into the Capitol, causing Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress to flee to safety. Many in the crowd, some of whom scaled walls and broke through windows, said their intent was to stop the vote confirmation and keep Trump in office despite the election results. That’s an insurrection. In Iowa, a state trooper told the Register that as the group protested inside the Iowa Capitol, an 18-year-old protester asked him and another trooper for their badge numbers. The trooper said the teen was arrested after grabbing his arm, though other protesters told the newspaper said she did not grab him.  The protest, witnessed by Register staff, was peaceful before the woman was arrested. Some protesters started scuffling with troopers, but that ended quickly, and protesters left the building, Iowa Public Radio reported. Participants had just finished lying on the ground for what is called a ""die-in"" to honor Floyd, who was killed after Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for a little over 9 minutes.  For the Washington riot, at least 368 people have been arrested or charged, USA Today reported April 9. The list includes individuals arrested on charges filed by federal prosecutors and those arrested by Capitol Police and D.C. Metro Police for entering the Capitol or for crimes related to weapons or violence.  In its latest announcement, the Justice Department said April 5 that a member of the far-right group Proud Boys and his brother were ordered to be held without bond on charges including conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding of law enforcement and destruction of government property. The FBI has a Most Wanted List of people suspected of entering the Capitol unlawfully, assaulting officers or destroying property.  Social media posts likened a BLM protest at the Iowa Capitol to the Jan. 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol. The Iowa demonstrators, protesting four bills, obtained a permit for their rally and entered the state Capitol peacefully and were screened by security; they did not storm the building or disrupt legislative proceedings. One protester was arrested. The U.S. Capitol insurrection was largely aimed at overturning the results of the presidential election by disrupting the counting of electoral votes. It left five people dead and has resulted in at least 368 people being arrested or charged. Statements that liken the two events ignore evidence showing  the Iowa protest was not an insurrection, did not involve breaking into a government building and no damage or injuries were reported.

Grothman miscalculates with claim of ‘largest surge of migrants’
","America is seeing an increase in the number of people attempting to enter the country through the southern border.  Thousands of men, women and children have already crossed the border this year, a significant uptick after the inauguration of President Joe Biden in January 2021 -- and on the heels of a year when border crossings declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Democrats blame the increase on policies put into place when Donald Trump was president, while Republicans blame changes made by Biden.  On March 24, 2021, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, tweeted: ""We have encountered the largest surge of migrants in the last 20 years, there is a crisis at the border. @JoeBiden’s actions have told the rest of the world that the US does not enforce its immigration policies, which is harmful to our country & those seeking to immigrate here.""  For the purpose of our fact check, we’re going to focus on the first part of his statement -- that the U.S. is now seeing the largest surge of migrants since 2001.  Is he accurate?  The tweet included a link to a speech Grothman made March 24, 2021 on the House floor. But in the speech, Grothman did not reference whether the surge of migrants approaching the southern border was the largest in the last 20 years. Instead, he claimed that the number of immigrants has increased three times from what it was under the Obama administration.   So, that’s not helpful in terms of getting to the bottom of the claim that this has been ""the largest surge of migrants in the last 20 years."" Grothman communications director Tim Svoboda said the information from the tweet was taken from a March 16, 2021 Reuters article, in which Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the U.S. is ""on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years."" Note the subtle, but important, distinction: The Reuters article said the U.S. is on pace to reach that mark. The tweet made it sound as if we have already surpassed it. Svoboda said the tweet had been written by a staffer and contained incorrect information. The tweet has since been deleted.  The picture of what is happening on the border is complicated. According to a March 27, 2021 report by NPR, Biden has noted the number of migrants reaching the border typically increases in the early months of the year, as the temperatures warm but before the blistering heat of the summer months. According to U.S. Customs and Border Control data from 2019 and 2018, the number of migrants reaching the border starts to drop in May and typically decreases as the summer goes on. Of course, it’s unclear what will happen in 2021 and if this year will follow the same pattern.  In any case, while there has been a surge, the number of people trying to cross the border has not exceeded past records, according to Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute.  She said apprehensions at the border peaked at more than 1.64 million in fiscal year 2000, and remained in the 1 million range annually until fiscal year 2006. The largest spike after that was in fiscal year 2019, when more than 851,000 people were apprehended at the border, according to federal data.   So far in fiscal year 2021, which runs from Oct. 1, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021, the Border Patrol has carried out nearly 382,000 apprehensions and expulsions.  ""While it is indeed possible that the trends will be the largest in 20 years, and DHS is said to be planning for such a contingency, that reality has not yet occurred,"" Mittelstadt said in an email. ""In short, the statement could potentially be accurate in the future, but for now remains premature.""  Grothman claimed ""we have encountered the largest surge of migrants in the last 20 years."" While the number of people attempting to enter the county via the U.S.-Mexico border has increased, the numbers so far are nowhere near those reported in the early 2000s, which were in the neighborhood of about 1 million annually.  That said, Biden’s own Homeland Security secretary said the country is ""on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years."" Our definition for Mostly False is ""the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972360C0>],/factchecks/2021/apr/12/glenn-grothman/grothman-miscalculates-claim-largest-surge-migrant/
