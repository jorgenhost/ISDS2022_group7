Headline misleads about Trump's budget proposal and heating program for poor
","President Donald Trump proposed eliminating a program to help millions of Americans heat or cool their homes, according to a viral story by a liberal website. ""Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled,"" stated the Nov. 26 headline by Democrats Rising, an anti-Trump website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this story failed to tell the entire story: while Trump proposed getting rid of a heating assistance program several months ago, the federal government has continued to fund it. The Democrats Rising article, written as winter weather was setting in, misleads by stating that millions of households will be at risk of losing heat this winter. But that’s not what the facts show. Democrats Rising didn’t name the program, but it appears to be a reference to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a program started in 1981. The program provides federal dollars to help poor people pay their home energy bill, energy crises, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs. On average, the annual heating/winter crisis assistance benefit per household was $371 in fiscal year 2015. In March, Trump’s budget blueprint called for cutting money for several programs that help low-income Americans including LIHEAP. The document said that LIHEAP ""is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes."" The budget request for the Administration for Children and Families stated that utility companies and state and local governments provide significant heating and cooling assistance and that the majority of states prohibit utilities from discontinuing heat during the winter. Trump’s proposal faced pushback from senators, including many in cold weather states. A bipartisan group of a few dozen senators wrote a letter in September urging the federal government to release funds for LIHEAP as quickly as possible under the continuing resolution. U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jack Reed, D-R.I., led the bipartisan group to push for $3.39 billion, the same amount allocated in the previous fiscal year. On Sept. 8, Trump signed the continuing resolution to continue funding appropriations for a few months. That allowed the Department of Health and Human Services in October to release $3.03 billion for states, tribes and territories for the heating program for fiscal year 2018. That represents 90 percent of the funding available under the continuing appropriations act. We asked a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services when the remaining 10 percent will be provided. Trump’s proposed budget did not include funding for LIHEAP, Monique Richards said. Funding will be determined by the passage of appropriations legislation from Congress. In the past, the federal government has released 90 percent of the funding under a ""seasonability exception,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association. ""Because LIHEAP spends so early in the fiscal year, if funding was delayed it would cause a hardship to low-income families,"" he said. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to our questions. Our ruling Democrats Rising said that ""Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled."" There is a kernel of truth in that headline, because Trump’s budget blueprint in March proposed eliminating LIHEAP. But Democrats Rising omits the final outcome: amid pushback from a bipartisan group of senators, the heating assistance program continued. In October, the federal government released $3 billion for the program. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC639640>],/factchecks/2018/jan/03/democrats-rising/headline-misleads-about-trumps-budget-proposal-and/

No, Shaq didn't declare Trump possibly the best president
","A story on the website Pro Conservative News snatched a compliment about President Donald Trump from the mouth of U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch and said it came from basketball star Shaquille O’Neal. The Dec. 10 headline includes an awkwardly worded alleged quote by the basketball star: ""Shaquille O’Neal says: ‘Trump is possibly the best president of the president of all times ever, he is not afraid to...’ Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that O’Neal made that statement. The story started with a quote by Hatch that Trump had ""been one of the best presidents"" he ever served under. That was followed by a supposed quote by O’Neal: ""I don’t pay much attention to his tweets. I’ll say this for you. He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under. And the reasoning is, he’s not afraid to make decisions. He’s not afraid to take on the -- the big mouths around here."" In reality, a video of Hatch showed that he was the one who made that statement after he was asked about Trump’s tweets in November. (Hatch, a Utah Republican, announced Jan. 2 that he will not seek re-election.) We did find real examples of O’Neal talking about Trump optimistically. Before the 2016 election, O’Neal referred to Trump as his friend but suggested he tweak his language. ""I think if he could reword some of the things he says and put it in business form, it would really make sense,"" O’Neal said, according to a video posted in 2015. ""Donald is like a straight-up guy."" In November 2016 after Trump won, O’Neal said on TNT that ""everyone was in shock"" about the outcome but that he hoped Trump would bring people together. ""It’s kind of hard to believe that a guy with no political experience is the president of the United States,"" O’Neal said, calling for the public to give Trump a chance to do his job. We sent a message to Pro Conservative News on Facebook and did not get a reply. The headline stated that O’Neal said Trump ""is possibly the best president."" This fake news story appeared to take a quote from Hatch and attribute it to O’Neal. It was Hatch who said of Trump ""he’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under.""

In Milwaukee, murders are coming down from a peak, they're not up 57%, despite Jeff Sessions' claim
","The attorney general of the United States came to Milwaukee and said murder in the city ""is up an astonishing 57 percent."" His number wasn’t entirely wrong. It reflects a spike in murders that occurred after 2014. But after the spike, the murders leveled off, and have begun to drop. The claim Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump’s attorney general, came to Milwaukee on Dec. 18, 2017, to announce he was adding two more federal prosecutors to fight violent crime in the city. The former GOP U.S. senator from Alabama used statistics to underscore the need, saying: And sadly, in this beautiful city, it has not been immune to these problems. Milwaukee, rape is up 21 percent in two years. Assault is up. Murder is up an astonishing 57 percent. So, these trends cannot continue. Sessions’ statistic We asked the White House to provide information to back Sessions’ statement. A spokesman  noted that Sessions had made a two-year reference when he cited an increase in rape in Milwaukee and told us Sessions was also making a two-year comparison for Milwaukee’s murder rate. We were directed to City-Data.com figures showing Milwaukee had 90 murders in 2014 and 141 in 2016. That’s an increase of 57 percent. The City-Data.com figures do correspond with official FBI figures: Year Milwaukee  murders according to FBI UCR statistics 2014 90 2015 145 2016 141 But the FBI figures show the big spike in Milwaukee murders occurred between 2014 and 2015 (perhaps because of opioids, according to a new federal study) -- and then dropped in 2016. More importantly, figures for an up-to-date two-year comparison -- including 2017, which had nearly ended when Sessions made his statement -- were available. Newer numbers These numbers were available on the day Sessions made his statement from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s continuously updated homicide database and from the Milwaukee Police Department: Year Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Milwaukee Police Department 2015 153 147 2016 154 142 2017* 121 118 Both sets of figures show that from 2015 through Dec. 18, 2017, the number of murders was down -- by 21 percent, according to the Journal Sentinel figures, and down by 20 percent, according to the Milwaukee Police Department figures. Note: The Journal Sentinel counts are higher because they include killings, such as those deemed self-defense, that are not included in the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting counts. The figures given to us by the Police Department follow the UCR system. Our rating Sessions said that in Milwaukee, ""murder is up an astonishing 57 percent."" Sessions wasn’t entirely clear on his time frame, although in citing Milwaukee crime figures, he had just made reference in his remarks to a two-year increase in rape. The FBI’s count of homicides in Milwaukee in 2016 -- the latest year for which FBI figures are available -- was 57 percent higher than it was two years earlier, in 2014. Clearly, murders are higher since 2014. But that paints a misleading picture of the current situation. Using an up-to-date two-year comparison, homicides in 2017, while still higher than in 2014, were about 20 percent lower than they were in 2015. For a statement that has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

Story of Walmart employees operating meth lab in store is made up
","A fake news story circulating for several months on Facebook claimed that employees at a Walmart in Decatur, Ala., were operating a meth lab in the store, leading to one of the biggest police drug busts in decades. ""Police discover meth lab in back room of Alabama Walmart,"" stated a headline on the website ufconly.com on Dec. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This article is bogus. The same story appeared in March 2017 on the website Empire News, a website with a disclaimer that it is for entertainment purposes only. The story said that police received an anonymous tip about a horrible burning smell from the back of the Walmart. An officer discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room. The story stated that an ""unofficial spokesperson did say that they were ‘disappointed’ that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down."" One sign that this story is fake news: It provides a lengthy quote from ""Chief Robert Garner,"" even though in Decatur the police chief’s name is Nate Allen. He told PolitiFact that there was no such bust. ""This is fake news, and no, we don’t have a Chief Robert Garner,"" Allen said in an email. Tara Aston, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told PolitiFact in an email that the company was unaware of any meth lab being discovered at an Alabama store. While we found no news reports about busts of meth labs inside an Alabama Walmart, we did find some news reports about busts involving mobile meth labs in Walmart parking lots. In August 2016, police discovered a meth lab inside a 6-foot-high drainage pipe under a Walmart parking lot in Amherst, N.Y. The ""about"" section of the Ufconly website doesn’t describe the website’s content and instead stated that ""Ufconly is a small village in the mountains of the Western Cape, South Africa."" We found no such place. There is no evidence that police discovered a meth lab inside a Walmart in Decatur, Ala.

Trump’s False claim Dianne Feinstein said ‘there is no collusion’
","Fact-checkers found President Trump’s recent interview in The New York Times chock-full of false and misleading statements. Trump rattled off falsehoods published in the Dec. 28, 2017 article on everything from how many social media followers he has to what’s known about possible collusion between Russia and his presidential campaign. On that topic, Trump made an eye-opening claim about Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California: ""Virtually every Democrat has said there is no collusion. There is no collusion. . . . I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day on television saying there is no collusion."" Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, two of the three congressional panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. So, a statement from Feinstein declaring ""no collusion,"" would be significant. Was this another false claim or was there some truth to Trump’s words? We set out on a fact check. Our research A White House spokesman did not respond to our request for evidence backing up Trump’s claim. The president, however, was apparently referring to Feinstein’s Nov. 5, 2017 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in which she discussed the Russia investigation but never flatly said there’s no collusion. As NPR reported in a similar fact check, Feinstein’s interview took place ""following the guilty plea of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Charging documents described conversations Papadopoulos had with Russian-linked individuals where he was promised ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton, as well as hacked emails."" In the CNN interview, Tapper asked Feinstein whether she had ""seen any evidence that this dirt, these emails, were ever given to the Trump campaign."" Feinstein replied: ""Not so far.""  Sen. Feinstein's interview on CNN Tapper then asked: ""Have you seen any communications that suggested that the Trump campaign wanted them to release them through a different means?"" Feinstein answered: ""I have not."" The senator’s words were in response to a specific portion of the Russia investigation. They are not the same as saying ""there is no collusion."" Feinstein spoke more generally about collusion during an Oct. 8, 2017 CBS interview, saying she did not know whether it had taken place. ""It's an open question because there's no proof yet that it's happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller's investigation,"" Feinstein said referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In this case, again, Feinstein did not say there is no collusion. Tom Mentzer, Feinstein’s spokesman, said he was not aware of the senator ever making such a statement. Feinstein is running for re-election in 2018 and is being challenged by State Senate Leader Kevin de León, also a Democrat. Similar Trump claim In May 2017, Trump made a similar mischaracterization. He tweeted that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper ""and virtually everyone else"" said ""there is no collusion"" in the Russia investigation. PolitiFact National found Trump twisted Clapper’s words from a March 2017 interview in which Clapper said he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In response to Trump’s tweet, Clapper later said: ""I don’t know if there was collusion or not,"" and that he did not believe the probe is ""a witch hunt."" PolitiFact rated Trump’s claim Mostly False. Our ruling President Trump recently claimed Sen. Feinstein said ""there is no collusion,"" between the Trump campaign and Russia. He apparently based his statement on responses Feinstein gave in a November 2017 CNN interview about the Russia probe. While Feinstein said she had ""not so far"" seen specific evidence about one portion of the investigation, that’s far from declaring there was no collusion. Speaking  more broadly about whether collusion took place, Feinstein said in an October 2017 interview that it's ""an open question."" The president’s claim distorted the senator’s words and gave the wrong impression. We rate Trump’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Suspect in San Francisco pier Christmas plot was an anti-Trump Antifa supporter, Infowars says
","A criminal complaint against a suspect who the FBI said plotted a Christmas Day massacre in San Francisco focused on his expressions in support of ISIS and terrorism. The conspiracy-minded website Infowars said news reports omitted some of the true political affiliations of suspect Everitt Aaron Jameson, describing him as part of the anti-Trump, radical left crowd. ""Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter,"" stated the Dec. 23 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Infowars article zeroed in on Facebook pages ""liked"" by Jameson to portray him as a far-left user who ""liked"" anti-Trump and Antifa groups as well as news organizations such as CNN and BuzzFeed and pro-vegan groups. ""Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism,"" stated Infowars. We found Jameson did show some interest in anti-Trump and Antifa groups (Antifa is a shorthand term for anti-fascists.). But the headline and story failed to explain that his interest in those groups were not relevant to the alleged plot laid out in the government’s complaint. FBI criminal complaint shows allegations against Jameson Here is what happened ahead of the planned incident, according to the FBI criminal complaint filed in California Dec. 22: In September, a confidential source alerted the FBI that Jameson’s Facebook account showed he ""liked"" or ""loved"" pro-ISIS and terrorism posts, such as an image of Santa Claus standing in New York with a box of dynamite. Jameson, a recent convert to Islam, had expressed support for radical jihadist beliefs and terrorism, including the Oct. 31, 2017, terror attack in New York City in which a driver used a truck to kill eight people. ""I’m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back,"" Jameson wrote on Facebook. In December an undercover FBI employee began communicating with Jameson, who believed the agent was part of senior leadership in ISIS. Jameson indicated that he wanted to plan an attack similar to the 2015 San Bernardino massacre and the recent New York truck attack. Jameson named the Pier 39 site in San Francisco as his target because it is a heavily crowded area. He asked the undercover employee to provide ammunition, assault rifle and materials to make explosives. A couple of days later, an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson and he called back the employee’s phone number which had a 202 (Washington, D.C.) area code. Later that day Jameson told the undercover FBI employee he reconsidered the attack. On Dec. 20, law enforcement conducted a search warrant and found an incriminating letter and several guns at Jameson’s home. The letter included one mention of Trump -- a reference to Trump’s recent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: ""You’ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews."" Two days later, federal authorities announced that they had charged Jameson, a 26-year-old Modesto truck driver, with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, Jameson faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Jameson’s family said he was depressed over losing custody of his children and insisted he never talked about violence or being influenced by terrorist groups. Jameson’s federal public defender Heather E. Williams told PolitiFact that her office will investigate the possibility of an entrapment defense and whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt any attempted criminal act since Jameson ultimately told an FBI undercover employee that he had reconsidered. ""In my understanding, the label ‘antifa’ means ‘anti-fascist.’  If being anti-Trump, anti-fascist tends to show a person is more likely to be a ‘terrorist’ than not, the FBI must have a very long list of suspicious people,"" she told PolitiFact. Jameson’s Facebook page The 11-page FBI criminal complaint and the press release from the U.S. Attorney make no mention of Antifa, and the only reference to Trump is the one sentence in the letter seized at Jameson’s home. Mainstream news accounts of the case mentioned the sentence about Trump but nothing about Antifa. Antifa broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Infowars drew from an archived version of Jameson’s Facebook that showed he liked four Antifa groups -- three in California and one in Portland. He also liked a few anti-Trump groups, such as the ""Trump resistance movement."" We noticed that Jameson liked hundreds of groups on Facebook ranging from the political (""Sassy Socialist Memes"") to food, fashion, TV and sports. We asked spokespersons for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney if the fact that the complaint made no mention of Jameson liking anti-Trump and Antifa means that it was irrelevant from a law enforcement perspective, but authorities declined to answer that question. We posed the same question to a couple of experts on terrorism: Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, and Erin Miller, at the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland. Levin said federal authorities include information in the complaint that is relevant to the charge, which in this case was attempting to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations. ISIS is considered a foreign terrorist organization while Antifa isn’t. ""That’s why ISIS ‘likes’ would be factually and legally relevant and the others would not,"" Levin said. ""The focus of his alleged goals was aligned with ISIS and apparently less so than with the other entities which aren’t designated as foreign terrorist organizations."" His main interest is clearly ISIS and to suggest otherwise is not wholly accurate, Levin said. ""Extremists are not hermetically sealed in freeze-dried containers -- they often dine from buffet of hatred but usually there is one that predominants and that’s what we apparently have here,"" he said. There is a broad spectrum within Antifa, which includes some individuals who have expressed violence. But an abstract embrace of Antifa isn’t illegal. ""Like the anti-abortion movement, ‘Antifa’ is itself an ideological movement,"" Miller said. ""Like any ideological movement, individuals can identify with it. Formal organizations can coalesce within/around it. Either can engage in non-violent or violent efforts to in an attempt promote the ideology/movement."" Our ruling Infowars’ headline said, ""Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter."" Infowars drew from the suspect’s Facebook page, which showed he liked a few anti-Trump and Antifa pages as well as hundreds of unrelated groups. The FBI criminal complaint makes no mention of Jameson liking these groups, which indicates that prosecutors believe his liking of these groups didn’t play any role in the attempted terrorist plot. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB4F340>],/factchecks/2017/dec/29/infowars/suspect-san-francisco-pier-christmas-plot-was-anti/

Joe Berrios fails to lock down timeline in Kaegi prison charge
","In a recent cable TV ad, Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios accused his Democratic primary opponent, Fritz Kaegi, of profiting from the private prison industry during his tenure as an investment analyst at Columbia Wanger Asset Management. ""Kaegi personally managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons,"" the ad stated. ""Prisons where women refused food to protest abusive guards, immigrant children as young as 5 were held and detainees died suspiciously. But Kaegi only saw profits."" Berrios also aired a similarly worded radio ad. According to a new report from Comcast Joe Berrios is spending $114K on cable ads to air between tomorrow and the end of December. The for-profit prison industry has long been the focus of animus for Democrats nationally, and the very concept of private prisons has been a source of controversy generally, so connecting Kaegi to it could score political points for Berrios. Investment funds like those managed by Kaegi contain dozens of stocks covering a diverse array of industries. We took a look to see if private prisons were in the portfolio on Kaegi’s watch. Kaegi spent 13 years as an investment manager at Columbia Wanger Asset Management, where he oversaw the Columbia Acorn Fund with two other analysts. He gave up management duties of the fund and left Columbia Wanger on March 13 to begin his campaign. Our first call was to the Berrios campaign to find out the basis for the ad’s allegation. Campaign spokeswoman Monica Trevino provided a quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing from March 31 that showed the Columbia Acorn Fund contained 926,513 shares in CoreCivic, a Nashville-based company that manages 91 prisons and related facilities across the country. The shares are valued at $29,111,038, according to the filing. Trevino also sent an amendment to the Columbia Acorn prospectus dated March 13 that showed Kaegi’s oversight of the fund would end on March 14. Because the quarterly report includes time when Kaegi was one of three managers of the fund, he’s connected to the CoreCivic investment, Trevino said. ""Kaegi has not (provided) any definitive evidence that when the investment was made he wasn’t there,"" Trevino said in an email. Interestingly, Kaegi provided the same March 13 document in defending himself. He said it shows he was not active in the fund’s management after that date and that CoreCivic and other stocks were added to the portfolio between March 14 and March 31. Kaegi explained he ran the fund with two other managers — lead portfolio manager Matthew A. Litfin and co-manager P. Zachary Egan — and no investments were made without agreement from all three. ""If one person was against buying, you didn’t buy,"" Kaegi said. Kaegi consistently had blocked investment in CoreCivic and a few other stocks, but that ended when he stepped down as manager on March 13, he said. Neither Litfin nor Egan responded to our requests for comment. ""I always thought these were bad companies"" that ""try to dress themselves up as real estate companies,"" said Kaegi, adding that he believes changing attitudes on mass incarceration make private prison stocks a risky investment. That’s in addition to ethical concerns over privatizing correctional facilities, he said. In a press release issued shortly after Berrios’ ad appeared, Kaegi’s campaign provided links to all of the fund’s quarterly reports from 2015 and 2016, none of which show CoreCivic (or Corrections Corporation of America, as it previously had been known) among its holdings. Kaegi also produced a summary from Feb. 28, 2017 — just two weeks before his management ended — that does not show CoreCivic among Columbia Acorn Fund’s holdings. ""This is just about the most controversial stock you can imagine,"" Kaegi said. ""Why on earth would I do that when I’m about to step down to run for this office?"" A comparison of the Feb. 28 summary and the March 31 quarterly report shows several stocks — Bioverativ, Blackline, Brunswick Corp., Copart, CoreCivic, Credit Acceptance Corp., Pool Corp., Q2, Tractor Supply and TransUnion — that were added after Feb. 28. Kaegi campaign spokesman DeRondal Bevly said TransUnion was the only stock that was added while Kaegi still managed the fund. Berrios said his primary challenger ""managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons."" Columbia Acorn Fund, of which Fritz Kaegi was one of three managers, reported $29.1 million in stock of the private prison operator CoreCivic on its March 31, 2017, quarterly report. But Kaegi’s active management of the fund ended March 13, as documented in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kaegi said the CoreCivic investment came after he was gone, and points to two years of quarterly reports and a Feb. 28 holdings summary to back his point. We were unable to confirm from Kaegi’s co-managers, but a scenario in which Kaegi during his final two weeks as a fund manager decides to invest in a controversial private prison stock as a last act before challenging an opponent in a Democratic primary in Cook County borders on absurd. Berrios’ statement contains an element of truth — the quarterly report on March 31 shows a $29.1 million investment in CoreCivic. But it ignores the critical fact that Kaegi didn’t manage the fund as of March 14 and that as recently Feb. 28 CoreCivic was not part of the portfolio.

Has Donald Trump signed more bills than anyone? No. (His count ranks last)
","President Donald Trump is known for boasting about his achievements. But is he correct that he’s enacted more legislation than any other president? At a West Palm Beach fire station on Dec. 27, Trump said, ""You know, one of the things that people don’t understand — we have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman."" This was a variation on an earlier, Mostly True assertion by his former press secretary Sean Spicer that Trump has ""worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman."" Eight months have passed since we rated Spicer’s statement, so we -- and a lot of PolitiFact readers -- thought it was a good time to check Trump’s most recent claim. The boast's accuracy has declined with time — big time. According to calculations by govtrack.us-- a nonpartisan website that collects congressional and other governmental data -- Trump actually ranked last in legislation signed among post-World War II presidents in their first calendar year who took office on the regular four-year cycle (as opposed to those who were elevated to the presidency after a death or resignation). In a report published on Dec. 21, 2017, govtrack.us wrote that ""Trump has sunk to last place with 94 bills signed into law by his 336th day in office (today). That’s eight fewer than President George W. Bush and not even half as many as presidents Bill Clinton (209) and George H.W. Bush (242)."" Trump signed two bills the day after the report was released, including a major tax bill, but that wouldn’t be enough for him to catch up to George W. Bush. Through Dec. 28, Trump had signed 96 and the younger Bush had signed 109, Joshua Tauberer, the founder of Govtrack.us, told PolitiFact. Tauberer added that Truman signed at least  126 laws in his first 100 days, so his number for the full year would be far above Trump's current 96. Govtrack.us also looked at the number of pages signed, and Trump wasn’t first on that list either. ""Trump’s 2,038 pages put him in 4th place —  well behind Obama’s 3,473 pages but more than twice as much as George W. Bush by this point in their first years,"" the report said. Trump’s statement from West Palm Beach ""is wrong no matter how you try to repair it,"" Tauberer said. Here’s a chart summarizing both measures, which doesn’t include the two bills Trump signed on Dec. 22. In the chart, the presidents are ordered from most bills signed to least bills signed. Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gerald Ford aren’t included in this comparison because they started their tenure in the middle of a congressional session. (It would not be appropriate to compare the three presidents who entered office other than on Jan 20 to the rest because each completed their first calendar year in office with much shorter tenures in the Oval Office. Johnson, for instance, would have had only a few weeks. Also, those presidents would not have come in with a popular mandate and a new Congress starting its work.) President Bills signed in year one Pages of legislation John F. Kennedy 684 1,404 Dwight Eisenhower 514 1,107 George H.W. Bush 242 2,518 Jimmy Carter 241 1.595 Richard M. Nixon 211 545 Bill Clinton 209 2,556 Barack Obama 118 3,473 Ronald Reagan 108 1,223 George W. Bush 102 981 Donald Trump 94 2,038 The report added that Trump ""has not held the title of signing the most new legislation since his 101st day"" in office and has been in the bottom half for most of his presidency. Govtrack.us provided this chart showing Trump’s ranking among the 10 presidents throughout 2017. It shows that he moved into first place around Day 100 of his presidency, but fell to seventh place within the next two months, and slid down to tenth out of 10 as the end of his first calendar year approached. It’s also worth noting that not all legislation is of equal importance. On the one hand, Trump has signed the tax overhaul, a bill of major consequence. And on several occasions, Trump has used the Congressional Review Act -- a previously little-used power that makes it easier for Congress and the president to overturn federal regulations. But the numbers — for all presidents, not just Trump — are padded by less significant bills. Some of the ones Trump has signed have been federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running. Others have been substantive but of limited effect, such as a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy or a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets. Still others have been ceremonial in nature, such the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee or a commemorative coin for the American Legion. (Here’s a full list.) It’s also noteworthy that Trump has been working with a Congress controlled by his own party, an asset that only some of his predecessors have had at the beginning of their tenure. All told, Trump’s statement is ""nonsense,"" said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. ""Trump has signed only one major piece of legislation, barely working that into his first year."" The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Trump said, ""We have signed more legislation than anybody. We broke the record of Harry Truman."" In his first 100 days, Trump had signed the most bills of any president since Truman. Since then, however, he has fallen further and further behind. Just days before the end of his first calendar year in office, Trump ranks last among the 10 post-war presidents who began their term on the regular cycle.

Julia Roberts did not say Michelle Obama 'not fit to clean Melania's toilet'
","A phony story on Facebook says American actress Julia Roberts insulted former first lady Michelle Obama after a visit to Roberts’ New York film production studio.

Kirsten Gillibrand ""a lightweight senator ... who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them."" Some interpreted Trump’s tweet as veiled language that Gillibrand would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, although White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed that characterization because she said he used similar language about men. USA Today’s editorial board reacted to Trump’s tweet: ""A president who’d all but call a senator a whore is unfit to clean toilets in Obama’s presidential library or to shine George W. Bush’s shoes."" The fake news story about Roberts and Michelle Obama mimicked the toilet cleaning theme. USA Daily Portal stated that after Obama left the set of Roberts’ film, Roberts commented about the differences between America’s most recent first ladies. The post accuses Roberts of saying Melania Trump has been ""looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country"" while ""doing a brilliant job,"" and Michelle Obama ""isn’t fit to clean to clean her toilet."" The statements followed a fictitious pattern, with more made-up quotes from Roberts attacking singer Celine Dion for criticizing Trump. We found no evidence Roberts made any of those statements about the Obamas, Melania Trump or Celine Dion.

Jenna Fischer of 'The Office' tweets outdated info on teacher tax deduction
","Jenna Fischer, the actress best known as Pam on NBC’s The Office, prompted a bit of a Twitter tussle before Christmas. ""I can't stop thinking about how school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes...something they shouldn't have to pay for with their own money in the first place. I mean, imagine if nurses had to go buy their own syringes. #ugh,"" Fischer tweeted on Dec. 23. The tweet attracted 66,000 retweets and 223,000 likes. (Fischer has about 750,000 followers.) But the tweet was wrong, relying on an outdated proposal. (After this fact-check was posted, Fischer deleted the tweet; see ""After the Fact"" below.) An existing provision in the tax code has allowed teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was expanded and made permanent in December 2015. The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans in November would have scrapped the deduction. But amid an outcry from teachers and their allies -- we wrote about opposition from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., here -- it was stripped before the House and Senate passed identical versions of the bill and President Trump signed it on Dec. 22. (The Senate bill actually would have doubled the deduction, but that idea was rejected too.) A number of Twitter users pointed this out, including one identified as Matt Rossetto, who snarked later that day that Fischer’s tweet ""is 100% wrong, because the final bill KEPT this deduction, but 14,000 RT’s later..."" Fischer noticed Rossetto’s tweet and fired back, ""It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn't have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers."" It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn't have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers Some Twitter users, however, still found fault with Fischer, since $250 was always the limit for that particular deduction -- it was not lowered due to the new law. Rossetto, for instance, tweeted back, ""It WAS $250 before the bill and hasn’t changed. If you’re going to grandstand, get it right."" Finally, on Christmas Day, Fischer returned to Twitter to acknowledge her critics. She tweeted, ""Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250."" Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250. Fischer didn’t explicitly acknowledge that the $250 limit existed before the Republican-backed bill, but she was right on the other statistics. They refer to a national survey of 4,721 public school educators for Scholastic by the firm YouGov in July and August 2016. As of the time this article was published, however, Fischer’s initial correction tweet had garnered far less interest than her original one -- 830 retweets and about 6,600 likes. Our ruling Fischer tweeted that after enactment of the Republican tax bill, ""school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes.""

No, Roy Moore didn't win Alabama race with military ballots
","Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore appeared to hold out hope that military ballots would reverse his loss to Democrat Doug Jones -- and the theory was circulated as fake news. ""Roy Moore takes the military vote, pulls ahead by 5,000 votes,"" said the headline on the website defense-usa.xyz on Dec. 15, three days after Moore, a Republican, lost to Jones. We found no contact information on this website to probe the story further. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The special U.S. Senate election in Alabama was the subject of many fake news stories. This one, too, is fake. According to the story, the ""Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity"" had sent emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count, which showed that Moore led by 5,014 votes after 97 percent of the vote had been counted. Jones would have to pay $213 million for a recount, the story stated. ""The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount,"" stated the article. ""They can never just admit when they lost."" In reality, there is no such entity as the ""Alabama Secretary of State’s Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity."" And the number of ballots cast do not bear out what the story alleged. The official Alabama Secretary of State’s website showed that Jones received 671,151 votes while Moore received 650,436. Moore appeared to hope that military and provisional ballots would turn the tide for him after the election. In a Dec. 15 email to supporters, Moore wrote that those votes were yet to be counted and that the election was ""too close to call"" and ""the battle is NOT OVER!"" On Dec. 20, Secretary of State John Merrill provided information showing that there were 366 military and overseas ballots returned. Merrill also reported that there was a total of 4,967 provisional ballots received and of those, 2,888 had been verified. That means that even if all of the overseas and provisional ballots were cast for Moore -- an unlikely scenario -- that would not add up to enough to change the outcome of the race since Jones had a lead of more than 20,000 votes. The state is expected to certify the election results on Dec. 28. A spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office said that the final results are not significantly different from the unofficial numbers from election night but will include slight increases for both candidates due to the late-counted military and provisional ballots.

New Jersey's taxes, cost of living paid off for Georgia with Mercedes
","Last week’s announcement that Mercedes-Benz will relocate its corporate offices was a major coup for metro Atlanta and an especially hard blow in New Jersey, headquarters of the firm’s U.S. operations for 50-plus years. Despite reports of a hail-Mary incentive effort by New Jersey lawmakers, Gov. Chris Christie’s spokesman said the state could not effectively compete. ""Mercedes USA made one thing very clear about its decision to leave: the cost of doing business and the tax environment is just too high here to be competitive with a state like Georgia,"" Michael Drewniak told The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record on Jan. 6. PolitiFact Georgia has often heard political leaders toss around tax rates to explain business decisions. But are tax rates, and those ""costs of business"" so different that they explain Mercedes’ decision to uproot and pledge $93 million in capital costs to build a new headquarters in Georgia? We decided to check. Paying the tax man Let’s look first at how the two states stack up on the tax front. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation rates New Jersey as the state with the worst overall business tax climate -- literally 50th out of 50 states. Ratings are based on the states’ property taxes, sales taxes, unemployment insurance and corporate and individual income taxes. Georgia ranked 36th overall, besting New Jersey in every category but unemployment insurance. For instance, Georgia’s corporate rate of 6 percent ranked 8th, while New Jersey’s 9 percent corporate tax was 41st. Some of the other taxes are structured in such a way to make apples-to-apples comparisons difficult. But it is clear the move could pay off for Mercedes in lower property taxes. The borough of Montvale charges Mercedes $21.81 per $1,000 of assessed value for local, county and school taxes, according to Bergen County Tax Administrator Robert Layton. The rate in Sandy Springs --  expected to be Mercedes’ temporary, if not permanent, home -- would be $35.38 per thousand of assessed value. But Mercedes pays on a full assessment in New Jersey. Its taxes on its 37-acre campus last year, valued at about $37 million, were $916,700. In Georgia, residential and commercial property is assessed at 40 percent, not the full value. That difference translates into big money. For every $1 million in property value in New Jersey, Mercedes pays $21,810 in taxes. In Georgia, it would pay $14,154. Widening the gap: Expected exemptions from the Fulton development authority would cut Mercedes’ Georgia tax bill in half for the first year and increase it just 5 percent for a decade. ""What looks like a higher rate in Georgia is actually 60 percent off, right off the bat, and then even more after exemptions,"" said Fulton County Tax Administrator Matt Buff. Savings beyond taxes To assess the company’s other potential savings from the move, we reached out to John Boyd, principal of the Boyd Company Inc., a New Jersey-based site selection consultant. Boyd predicted the move to Fulton County will reduce Mercedes-Benz’s costs, including labor and property taxes, by about 20 percent. Boyd’s forecasts appear in line with company expectations. Donna Boland, corporate communications manager for Mercedes, said company research shows a cost of living differential from the move in the 20 percent to 30 percent range. This does not include incentives, something Mercedes CEO Steve Cannon has downplayed as having a role in the decision. Neither state has made public what it offered, but Georgia’s incentive package could be valued at $23 million, not including local incentives. Other savings come from the labor costs saved in a right-to-work state like Georgia, lower housing costs in the Southeast and a push by Mercedes to find employees and buyers alike in millennials – the younger generation that auto executives see as key to avoiding the appearance of being outdated, said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book (which like the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is owned by Cox Enterprises). Also a factor, Brauer said: A likely new manufacturing plant for Mercedes in the near future, somewhere in the Southeast. The new plant would benefit from all those ""business cost"" perks and also follow Kia, Toyota and other carmakers to the region. ""I’m sure they’ve mapped it out for expansion and I’m betting they know what they can build 50, 100, 250 miles from an Atlanta headquarters,"" Brauer said. ""You look at the tax elements and put it together with a lower cost of the living, and it just makes sense."" The Southeast is becoming the ""center of gravity"" for the auto industry, Boyd said. What is also interesting is that Georgia, like New Jersey, has had a tepid post-recession job recovery, said Joe Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. ""This type of intense economic development warfare among the states indicates the Darwinian nature of the competition for investment and new jobs,"" Seneca said. ""More is to be expected."" Our conclusion. We don’t begin to know all the costs that were taken into consideration, given both states staying mum on incentives and all the costs associated with running a major corporation. But we know that the move will save Mercedes on its tax bill, and expert analysis show cost savings of about 20 percent on factors such as labor expenses. In the end, Georgia comes out on top in both categories. We rate the statement as True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD4E540>],/factchecks/2015/jan/14/mark-drewniak/new-jerseys-taxes-cost-living-paid-georgia/

Rick Perry: 'I belong to the AFL-CIO'
","Suggesting Republicans should reach out to traditionally resistant voters such as union members, departing Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared himself a union member during a ""policy orientation"" held in Austin before the 2015 Texas legislative session. Perry, appearing with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the Jan. 9, 2015, gathering hosted by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, eased toward his declaration by saying the Teamsters union had supported him for governor. Reaching out to it would work, he said, ""not because I’m a dyed-in-the-wool AFL-CIO member -- which I am."" Perry then addressed a mentor in the audience, former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying: ""You didn’t know that, did you?"" Amid laughter, Perry went on: ""Not only did I used to be a Democrat, senator, I belong to the AFL-CIO. Got the card in my pocket,"" Perry said, acting as if to reach for it, ""and they probably hate it that I pay my dues every quarter."" Ed Sills, spokesman for the Texas AFL-CIO, commented on Perry’s declaration in the union’s email news distributed later the same day, writing: ""If any reader of this newsletter wants to own up to Perry's membership in their union, please send word. ""But I kid,"" Sills wrote. ""The more, the merrier. The labor movement wants to be a big tent and we do proudly represent a minority of Republican members, many of them of the rock-ribbed, partisan variety. The AFL-CIO does not have a loyalty test."" Like Sills, we wondered if Perry, who entered politics as a Democratic Texas House member before switching parties and winning his first statewide race (for agriculture commissioner) in 1990, is a union member. To our inquiry, gubernatorial spokesman Felix Browne pointed out by email the Dallas Morning News described Perry’s membership in a Feb. 22, 2010, news story. That story said: ""The governor became a member of the Screen Actors Guild after he appeared in the Tommy Lee Jones movie Man of the House. In the movie, he played the governor of Texas."" The day after Perry mentioned the membership, Breitbart.com, the conservative news site, quoted a former Perry aide, Kris Heckmann, saying Perry continued to pay his union dues after the making of the 2005 movie. At our request, Browne provided a photo of Perry’s membership card for the SAG-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which we edited for this photo solely to remove his membership number:  A web page on the union’s history says the union, bringing together the guild and AFTRA, has about 160,000 members. ""A proud member of the AFL-CIO, SAG-AFTRA partners with our fellow unions in the U.S. and internationally to seek the strongest protections for media artists throughout the world,"" the page says. A SAG-AFTRA spokeswoman, Pamela Greenwalt, told us by phone the union does not reveal whether anyone is a member. Footnote: Sills said in his item on Perry’s announcement that as governor, Perry had not been a backer of Texas AFL-CIO policies. ""He has opposed a minimum-wage increase, has rejected on ideological grounds tens of billions of dollars in federal funds that would expand Medicaid coverage, has chipped away at the ability of laid-off workers to receive Unemployment Insurance benefits, and has presided over a public school system that a state judge found to be unconstitutionally inadequate,"" Sills wrote. Our ruling Perry said he’s a member of the AFL-CIO. Since 2006, Perry has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild, which is part of the AFL-CIO. We rate his claim True.

Warren: the average family in the bottom 90 percent made more money 30 years ago
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believes the government’s economic policies over the past few decades have ""cut the legs out from underneath America's middle class."" At the AFL-CIO National Summit on Raising Wages Jan. 7, Warren spoke about growing income inequality, particularly since the 1980s, when the ""trickle-down economics"" policies gained traction under former President Ronald Reagan. She argued that this theory -- that giving tax breaks and other economic benefits to corporations and the wealthy will benefit the poor by improving the economy overall -- hasn’t worked. Warren, a former law professor and expert on the economic challenges of the middle class, cited a number of statistics to support her point, including: ""Well, since 1980, guess how much of the growth in income over the last 32 years -- how much of the growth in income did the 90 percent get? Zero. None. Nothing. In fact, it is worse than that. The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago."" We wondered if that was true -- that the bottom 90 percent of earners in America have a lower income than they had more than 30 years ago. The statistic comes from data compiled by well-known economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who study income inequality. Their World Top Incomes Database specializes in cataloging the highest level of incomes over time in more than 20 countries. To check out Warren’s claim, we looked at average income data from 1979 to 2012 for the top 10 percent and bottom 90 percent of earners. (The time frame Warren used in her speech was ""a generation,"" which is vague, but in context it’s clear she’s talking about since the 1980s.) The Saez-Piketty data comes from millions of tax returns filed over the past century. The data supports her claim. Adjusted for inflation, the top 10 percent of earners in the United States made, on average, $144,418 in 1979 and $254,449 in 2012. That’s about 76 percent growth. The bottom 90 percent of earners, on the other hand, made $33,526 in 1979 and $30,438 in 2012. That’s a decrease of about 9 percent. This chart generated on the Saez-Piketty top income database shows the growth of the top 10 percent of earners’ average income over time, compared to the relatively stagnant progression of the bottom 90 percent of earners’ average income.  Compare this to the 30 years prior, where -- according to Saez and Piketty’s data -- the average income for the bottom 90 percent of earners grew alongside the top 10 percent, albeit at a slower pace.  However there is some context to consider. Mainly, not everyone approves of the Saez-Piketty approach to cataloging income. Their approach uses pre-tax income and includes realized capital gains. Because the richest Americans earn a lot of capital gains and pay a lot of taxes, this arguably magnifies their income. On the other hand, the approach lowballs the income of lower-level earners -- the bottom 90 percent in this case. The income calculation does not include government payments, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, food stamps and the earned income tax credit. Salim Furth, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also noted that the data looks at ""tax units"" -- individuals or married couples filing together -- rather than households, which may artificially lower average incomes. For example, a young adult living with his parents are two separate tax units; together they are one household or family. The Saez-Piketty data captures that the young worker has a very small income, but not the fact that he lives in a house with multiple incomes. Also, tax law has changed over the past 50 years to increase the number of units, Furth said. Of the general trend in income growth, he said, ""Data sources that are more widely used show solid, though not fantastic, income growth for most of the income distribution through 2007. There are big losses in the Great Recession, and then an incomplete recovery since then."" The Congressional Budget Office produced a report in November 2014 showing that the bottom 80 percent of earners (measured by households rather than tax units) saw income increases of about 16 percent between 1979 and 2011. The top 81-99 percent, on the other hand, saw increases of about 56 percent over the period. And the top 1 percent alone saw their household income grow 174 percent. That report also found that if it includes government benefits in its income calculation, all income brackets saw even more income growth. Still, this data shows that top earners’ incomes are growing at a faster pace than everyone else’s -- which supports Warren’s broader point.   Richard Burkhauser, an economist at Cornell University, pointed us to a paper he co-wrote on income inequality that compares Saez-Piketty-style data to other income measurements. The results are consistent with the Saez-Piketty data until households are adjusted for size, and capital gains taxes and government payments are factored in. With those controls, incomes have grown across the board, and income inequality has also grown -- but not at as dramatic a rate as the Saez-Piketty data implies. Ultimately, Burkhauser’s report concludes that different measurements work for different policy questions. If Warren’s talking specifically about market income -- that is, income earned before taxes and before government payments -- the Saez-Piketty data ""is appropriate, and undoubtedly income inequality has grown substantially in recent years, and the middle class is struggling."" If the question is, alternatively, whether government programs are doing something to close the gap and help the middle class -- other measures show that programs like food stamps and Medicaid are helping to a certain extent, at least for people who qualify. (And of course not everyone in the bottom 90 percent of earners does qualify.) Arguably, in a speech directed at working and middle-class Americans at a summit on raising wages, the context of Warren’s remarks give credence to the fact that she was referencing data that emphasizes earned income over government-provided income. In the speech, Warren wasn’t advocating for new government programs that give out payments to individuals in need. She was making a policy argument against the idea of trickle-down economics and in favor of broad economic policies that she believes would improve Americans’ job-earned income, like raising the minimum wage and breaking up the Wall Street banks. ""We can make new choices,"" she said. ""And one way to make those choices is to talk openly and honestly and directly about work, about how we value work, and how we value those who do the work."" Our ruling Warren said, ""The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago."" According to one measurement, the bottom 90 percent of American earners had a lower income in 2012 than they had 30 years ago. By other measurements -- mainly ones that include government payments such as Social Security -- incomes have grown across the board. However, this data still supports Warren’s overall point that income inequality is growing.

Think again about mailing off your noisy kids
","A viral claim making the rounds on social media conjures up images of babies bouncing around in mail bags and wayward teenagers being stamped and shipped ""special delivery"" to grandma and grandpa down on the farm. ""In 1913, it was legal to mail children,"" the Facebook post says, among other things. The post includes photographs of a couple of ""mailed"" children. Still, it’s pretty clear from some readers’ comments that the claim is not universally taken too seriously. ""The heck with mailing the kids. I wanna mail myself some place warm,"" one commenter wrote. ""So thankful with today’s technology, we can now fax ’em,"" wrote another. But is it true? Was it legal in 1913, or at any time, to mail children? PolitiFact Georgia readers who have been bombarded with re-posts of the claim asked us to weigh it on the ol’ AJC Truth-O-Meter. We contacted Nancy Pope, a historian and curator at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum in Washington. She told us there were ""a handful"" of children, who were ""mailed"" after the Postal Service created the parcel post service in 1913. These children, for the most part, were sent short distances, not across the country or internationally, Pope said. They also were typically delivered personally to their destination by a rural letter carrier — someone well-known and trusted in the community, considered on par with a member of the local clergy, she said. ""The trust in the mail at that point was almost sacrosanct,"" Pope said. Mailing children — with stamps attached to their clothes — occurred as customers and Postal Service workers were becoming accustomed to the new service, which allowed packages weighing 50 pounds or less to be shipped by freight train at rates often cheaper than a child’s train ticket. But was it ever officially legal to mail a child? No, Pope said. ""The law did not specifically address (mailing children) when parcel post began Jan. 1, 1913, because nobody thought anybody would do such a stupid thing,"" she said. A year later, when a few children had been ""mailed"" and made the news, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson issued a memo to the nation’s postmasters, advising them that all human beings were barred from being mailed, Pope said. The first child ""mailed"" in the U.S. was an unnamed boy in Ohio. The kid’s parents paid 15 cents for stamps and insured the child for $50 in January 1913 to have a rural Free Delivery carrier take their boy to his grandmother’s house a mile away, according to the Postal Service. A year later, May Pierstorff was sent by parcel post from her parents’ home in Idaho to her grandparents’ house about 73 miles away for 53 cents worth of stamps. May traveled with a relative who worked on the Railway Mail trains in early 1914, Pope said. (She’s one of the children in pictures on the Facebook post.) A book, ""Mailing May,"" chronicles May’s adventure shortly before her sixth birthday. The longest known trip reportedly cost 15 cents. A 6-year-old from Pensacola, Fla., was mailed through parcel post from her mother’s home in Florida to her father’s home in Virginia, having just made it under the 50-pound limit, according to reports at the time. ""Babies were not being put in boxes or dumped in mailboxes,"" Pope said. ""It was just a less expensive way to get the kids to see the grandparents."" Pope wasn’t surprised to hear from us. She said reports about the ""mailed"" children began popping up all over the Internet in 2013, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the parcel post service. A second anniversary — the centennial of May Pierstorff’s delivery to her grandparents in 1914 — has kept the buzz going, she said. The claim attracted the attention of Snopes.com, the website known for debunking urban legends and Internet rumors, which found it was a mixture of truth and falsehood. So where does this leave us? The Facebook post says ""In 1913, it was legal to mail children."" Postal historians say no more than a handful of children were mailed after the parcel post service was created in 1913. The law at the time didn’t specify that it was illegal to mail children, but officials say no one had envisioned a situation where that had to be spelled out. When there was evidence that children were indeed being mailed, the postmaster general sent a memo in 1914 barring human beings from postal delivery. The Facebook post needs a whole lot of context. It leaves the wrong impression that children were being mailed legally in 1913. A few mailings did occur, but the practice — never legally sanctioned — was quickly abandoned. PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That seems to fit this one like a roll of bubble wrap. We rate the Facebook post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9BBC00>],/factchecks/2015/jan/13/facebook-posts/think-again-about-mailing-your-noisy-kids/

Matt Lauer says the name Frank more popular after Kevin Spacey's role in 'House of Cards'
","Hollywood red carpet interviews are reliably substance-free safe zones for fact-checkers, a rare opportunity to turn on the TV and turn off our ears for misleading claims. That’s what we thought, anyway, going into Sunday’s Golden Globes. We tuned in for the pre-show, with a beverage in one hand and our phone in the other. Our only care was coming up with snarky tweets about the rich and famous.   Then Today host Matt Lauer had to go and kill our vibe with an apparently researched question for Kevin Spacey, who plays the conniving House Majority Whip Frank Underwood on Netflix’s House of Cards. ""You know, we were sitting together at breakfast, and we saw a fact,"" Lauer said, ticking us off because now we had to put our beverage down and give him our full attention. ""Do you know that the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent since this show debuted? What does that say about parents across America?"" ""Well,"" Spacey said, ""if the parents also have last names that start with a ‘u,’ then, F.U. as initials has risen dramatically as well."" ""We are live, Kevin,"" Lauer said, fearing an expletive. ""Where’s that seven-second delay when you need it?"" joked co-host Savannah Guthrie. Spacey went on to have a pretty great night, winning his first Globe for Best Actor in a TV Series (Drama) for his role as Underwood. We still had work to do. We wanted to know if Lauer was for real about the name Frank taking a leap into popularity since the world was introduced to House of Cards (the third season premieres Feb. 27, 2015). What the numbers say We turned first to a super glamorous source: the Social Security Administration. The agency, which maintains a list of baby names going back to 1880, receives information on names from parents when they apply for a child’s Social Security number at his or her birth. Frank, a form of Francis as you would know from watching the show, used to be a really big name near the turn of the 20th century. From 1880 to 1892, it was the sixth-most popular name of U.S. males. It remained in the top 10 of baby names for boys until 1923, the year it started its long, slow slide to the 327th spot in 2013. The chart shows Frank was never more unpopular than in 2013, the same year subscription-based Netflix released the first season of House of Cards (Feb. 1, 2013, to be exact). The greater the ranking number, the lower the popularity of the name. Ranking of the male name Frank  2013 327 2012 319 2011 308 2010 302 2009 291 2008 278 2007 262 2006 246 2005 231 2004 230 2003 230 2002 216 2001 213 2000 208 1999 187 Source: Social Security Administration So Frank had become pretty unpopular before House of Cards started running. And now? This is where we have to introduce a major plot twist to this fact-check: The Social Security Administration has not yet released its 2014 data. The agency releases that information on the Friday before Mother’s Day in May. Without the last year’s data, we can’t discern if there was a possible increase -- much less what really drove it. We do, however, have an idea of what Lauer is talking about. BabyCenter.com, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is a popular pregnancy and parenting website that releases an annual Baby Names Survey and Top 100 Names list. The names list is based on 406,000 babies born in 2014 to mothers who are registered BabyCenter users. BabyCenter global editor in chief Linda Murray hailed 2014 as the ""year of the binge-watching baby name"" because of the influence of TV shows that about 20 percent of surveyed moms said had on their baby name choice. The press release doesn’t just single out Frank, which saw a 19-percent increase from the 352nd ranking to No. 297 among BabyCenter users, but also House of Cards characters Claire (Frank’s wife, up 14 percent), journalist Zoe (up 13 percent), and lobbyist Remy (up 11 percent). Another Netflix show, Orange is the New Black, inspired a rash of baby-naming after characters from its female-centric cast, including Galina (up 67 percent), Nicky (up 35 percent), Piper (up 28 percent) and Dayanara (up 19 percent), BabyCenter says. To be clear, these increases are just the percentage that the names moved up the list from the year before. The BabyCenter survey doesn’t include information on how many people named their children Frank (or any other name) year by year. The naming effect is similar for characters in the Shonda Rhimes-produced shows Scandal (Olivia), Grey’s Anatomy (Meredith) and How To Get Away with Murder (Annalise), BabyCenter said, as well as the movie Frozen and its star Elsa. Murray called the correlation between trending baby names and binge-worthy shows ""undeniable."" Other experts weigh in That doesn’t mean we should take the word of BabyCenter as gold. Some of its user-generated  information mirrors federal name data, but there are discrepancies. BabyCenter’s most popular male name in 2013 was Jackson, and the federal winner was Noah. Sophia remained the most popular girl name according to both sources. For instance, the popularity of the name Frank varied pretty significantly when you compared BabyCenter and Social Security information from years past. (We looked so you didn’t have to.) Basically, experts say we need to wait for the Social Security Administration list to know for sure. It isn’t inconceivable that Frank or Francis is turning a corner after the popularity of House of Cards, said Laura Wattenberg, author of Baby Name Wizard and the website of the name. But it may also have to do with parents who want to honor Pope Francis (but don’t want to call their children Francis). ""It’s hard for one use to really move the needle,"" Wattenberg said. ""Frank has been so unpopular for so long that you could get what looks like a really big jump just from a couple dozen names."" Echoing Social Security’s 2013 press release about hot baby names, Wattenberg said the reality is that ""obscure"" Spanish TV shows are more likely to have the hottest name of the year than a Netflix hit. In 2013, the girl’s name Daleyza, the name of a young woman’s character on the Spanish-language show Larrymania, increased in popularity by more than 3,000 places.  Who would do this Then we got curious about the name Frank itself. As Lauer prodded, what does naming a child after the murderous, conniving character say about American parents? Parents are ""desperate for fresh name ideas"" these days, and are not choosy about the source, Wattenberg said. Gone are the days when all-American parents name their offspring in tribute to the new president. ""They just want something that sounds fresh and creative,"" she said. ""That includes villains, video game characters."" Albert Mehrabian, professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA, wrote the books The Name Game and Baby Name Report Card based on his studies of the attractiveness of names. His studies aimed to capture the impressions left by names isolated from any other factor, such as appearance or personality. Participants in his studies were asked to imagine themselves meeting someone for the first time knowing just their first name, its spelling and the person’s gender. The participants gave numerical scores on a range of adjectives describing the name, and their responses were averaged and categorized into four areas that defined the name’s attractiveness -- ethical/caring, popular/fun, success and femininity/masculinity. The name Frank scored a 65 of 100 overall, doing really well in terms of giving a successful, ambitious impression but lacking substantially in ethics, Mehrabian said. (Sounds a lot like Spacey’s character, don’t you think?) The given name Francis, meanwhile, scores higher at 78 overall. The increase comes from the stronger impression of ethics and compassion for people named Francis, a score of 99 versus 22 for Frank. ""So Frank, I would say, it’s a so-so name,"" Mehrabian said. ""But it does have high implications of success."" A spokeswoman for Lauer’s Today show did not get back to us. Our ruling Lauer asked Spacey if he knew that ""the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent"" since the debut of House of Cards in 2013. Lauer seems to be referencing a 2014 press release from the website BabyCenter.com that played up the influence of Netflix shows on new children’s names. It should be obvious that the company’s priority is generating publicity and not sound scientific methods. Experts say the best data comes from the Social Security Administration, which will not release its baby name rankings until May 2015. And we do know that, according to Social Security data, Frank was never more unpopular than in 2013, when House of Cards debuted. Now you know more than you probably need to about baby name trends, and how a fact-checker’s mind works while trying to watch mindless television. The claim is Mostly False.

"['Energy', 'Government Regulation', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Six federal agencies must review Florida natural gas pipeline, Rubio says
","Sen. Marco Rubio previewed a potential 2016 presidential run in his new book, American Dreams, by outlining several policy positions -- including a push for energy independence and a distaste for industrial regulation. The Republican discussed in one chapter the future of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, praising the process known as hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) for providing abundant oil and natural gas. But ""government-created obstacles"" such as overregulation of the energy sector make the United States its own worst enemy, Rubio wrote, and states such as Florida suffer for it. ""A private company is interested in building a natural gas pipeline into Florida,"" the book read. ""But before it can even begin construction, it is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies."" No matter your political stance on government regulation, we’re not civil engineers, so we didn’t know how many federal entities were needed to approve a new pipeline. We decided to pull the permits and find out whether Rubio was correct. Sabal Trail Transmission Neither Rubio’s Senate office nor his book publicist returned our calls, but the biggest pipeline project on the drawing board to come into Florida is the Sabal Trail Transmission expansion. The project stretches about 460 miles from central Alabama through Georgia to Florida just south of Orlando, eventually sending natural gas all the way to a Florida Power & Light plant in South Florida. The state’s gas capacity would increase 20 percent, at a cost of $3 billion. Duke Energy also has plans to build a connection from the pipeline to power its Crystal River plant. Environmentalists have decried the project, calling the pipeline and its compressor stations unnecessary and the source of too much pollution. It would be the third major natural gas pipeline into the state. The plan begat another controversy when it was discovered that Gov. Rick Scott owned a $53,000 stake in the company responsible for the project after signing legislation in 2013 to help approve permits for the pipeline. The Public Service Commission, run by Scott appointees, later that year approved building the pipeline. When Scott in 2014 disclosed the assets of a blind trust held in his name as part of his re-election campaign, the Broward Bulldog noted he owned the stake in Spectra Energy, the Houston company working with FP&L’s parent company NextEra Energy to build the pipeline. Scott’s office argued that because the holdings were bought as part of the blind trust, there’s no way the governor knew about it, and therefore the stake didn’t present a conflict of interest. Scott did use proceeds from the trust to fund in part his 2014 re-election bid. His office told us they had no further comment on the issue. Sabal Trail Transmission LLC, the joint Spectra and NextEra company building the pipeline, made no secret about the regulatory process for the pipeline, which began surveys in September 2013. The company directed us to a resource report that listed all the agencies from which the company must get approval. There are many state agencies listed, including the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and various water management districts. There’s also a list of federal agencies: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees all pipeline building in the United States. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees permits for compliance with health and environmental requirements. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which examines the project for dredge and fill permits and compliance with the Rivers and Harbors Act. Three districts of the Corps are involved. U.S. Department of Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service, which examines the plan over three states for effects on endangered species and migratory birds. U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Marine Fisheries Service, technically two agencies in the same federal department, which consult on the impact on endangered species, marine mammals and fish habitats. So that’s five listed outright in the project’s paperwork. But Sabal Trail Transmission LLC pointed out there’s a sixth, too. U.S. Department of Transportation, which has the authority to conduct a facilities design safety review, and perform construction inspections. And since there’s construction and other work involved, we’ll go ahead and tack on the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s requirements, to give Rubio a smidge of extra credit. Is that too much regulation? That depends on your political point of view. But Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which opposes the project, says it’s not like those groups are simply there to mire the project in red tape. ""Every agency has a distinct role in this pipeline, which is going through very delicate ecosystems, geologic formations and communities in our state,"" she said. The pipeline expansion is currently in regulatory review, with a projected completion date of May 2017. Our ruling Rubio said a private company building a natural gas pipeline into Florida ""is being forced to spend months under the review of six federal agencies."" When we checked on the groups involved in the building of the Sabal Trail Transmission expansion, five agencies were listed in paperwork from the builder. Throw in the fact the Department of Transportation has to okay the plans, that makes six. OSHA compliance could bring it to seven, but Rubio doesn’t need it.

Marco Rubio says college administrators have 'more than doubled over the last 25 years'
","In his new book, American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., offers an aggregation of many of the conservative ideas he’s supported, including education policy. In one passage, Rubio takes aim at the growth in college bureaucracies, which he suggests has gotten in the way of teaching and has led to steep increases in tuition. Rubio says universities should stop hiring bureaucrats.   ""One study,"" Rubio writes, ""found the number of administrative employees at colleges and universities (think deputy assistant to the associate vice provost and gender equity administrators) has more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than two to one."" We wondered whether Rubio’s claim was correct. We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s staff, but we did find that his book footnoted an article by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, an organization affiliated with Boston University. That article, written by Jon Marcus, was headlined, ""New Analysis Shows Problematic Boom In Higher Ed Administrators."" It summarized calculations of federal data by the investigative-reporting group along with the American Institutes for Research, an independent social-science research group. The article indicates that Rubio is pretty close to the mark. At one point, Marcus writes that between 1987 and the 2012, ""the number of administrators and professional staff has more than doubled. That’s a rate of increase more than twice as fast as the growth in the number of students."" That language is very close to what Rubio wrote. We checked with Marcus, and he said Rubio’s characterization is reasonable. Donna M. Desrochers, a researcher at American Institutes for Research, added that in her view, Rubio’s statement is ""almost accurate."" She said that data from a slightly different time period -- 1990 to 2012 -- showed that the number of professional staff at four-year and two-year institutions rose by 91 percent. That’s almost double, and that came at a time when enrollment rose by 43 percent. So professional staff was growing roughly twice as fast as student enrollment, as Rubio indicated. However, Rubio’s specific examples -- ""deputy assistant to the associate vice provost and gender equity administrators"" -- don’t bear out his larger point. Executive positions, such as ones with ""provost"" in the title, have been growing at a significantly slower pace than professional jobs overall. If executive staff growth had been included in the calculations along with professional staff, the rate of increase would have been 76 percent, instead of the 91 percent for professional staff alone, Desrochers said. Indeed, in the most recent period studied -- between 2000 and 2012 -- professional positions grew twice as fast as executive positions. Another point worth noting: Students, rather than existing administrative employees, have been the biggest beneficiaries of staff growth in recent years. According to a report by Desrochers, wage and salary expenditures for student services were the fastest-growing salary expense in many types of institutions between 2002 and 2012. ""Many student-related activities (ranging from course and career guidance to disciplinary actions) that were previously under the purview of faculty have been centralized, to free up faculty time and standardize the types and quality of services provided,"" Desrochers wrote in the report. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing, she says: ""Investments that directly support student success are wise if they lead to improved learning and degree outcomes."" Our ruling Rubio wrote that college administrators have ""more than doubled over the last 25 years, outpacing the growth of students by more than 2 to 1."" Rubio’s right about the general trend, but one of the two examples he specifically mentions in the book belongs to a different employment category -- one that has been growing more slowly. In addition, there’s evidence that this is not bureaucracy for bureaucracy’s sake -- many of the positions increasing in recent years directly support students.

Doonesbury: CIA paid $81 million for torture program
","With North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., now in charge of Senate oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency, it’s unclear how much the CIA’s torture legacy will remain in the spotlight. But leave it to Doonesbury to pipe up with a reminder that enhanced interrogation came with an enhanced price tag. In Sunday’s Jan. 11 strip, the debauched character Duke, now a K Street lobbyist, looks up from his newspaper in surprise. ""It turns out that before 9/11, the CIA didn’t have any real torture experience,"" Duke says. ""So they hired these two psychologists, Dr. Jessen and Dr. Mitchell, to develop and run their torture program. For which they were paid $81 million!"" A reader asked us if that was accurate, and we can report that in large part, it is. When asked for his source, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau told PunditFact ""this one is an easy Google,"" and sent us a Wikipedia link. We looked at the report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and found the key details on page 18. ""The CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation operations,"" the report said. ""In 2005, the psychologists formed a company specifically for the purpose of conducting their work with the CIA. Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced virtually all aspects of the program. In 2006, the value of the CIA's base contract with the company formed by the psychologists with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement."" The Senate report did not name the two psychologists, but many news reports did. The Los Angeles Times reached James Mitchell at his home in Land O’ Lakes, Fla. The paper reported that Mitchell rejected the committee’s description of his work.  ""Go ahead and smear me if you want,"" Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times. ‘A lot of what's written in the Senate … report is just flat-out wrong. It's taken out of context."" (We're attempting to reach Mitchell; if we hear from him, we'll let you know.) The Los Angeles Times described how Mitchell’s colleague Bruce Jessen was on hand in 2002 when an Afghan detainee was stripped and dragged down a hallway. The detainee was later found dead in an unheated cell and an autopsy concluded that he likely froze to death. There are some details the cartoon doesn't go into that are worth noting. First, Mitchell and Jessen’s company had a total of seven owners. So presumably the two men weren't the only people receiving money. Second, the $81 million isn't pure profit.  According to the Los Angeles Times, the money covered a range of expenses. Mitchell and Jessen's company ""provided interrogators, operation psychologists, debriefers and security guards"" to CIA secret prisons. The final payments included $75 million for services and $5 million in case the company faced criminal prosecution or other legal liability, the Los Angeles Times said. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said that the CIA paid two psychologists $81 million to develop and run its torture program. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report confirms the amount of money spent on a variety of things. Other news organizations revealed the actual names of the two men -- though in reality seven people owned the company. The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Teachers' group says Va.'s school funding 16% below inflation since 2009
","The Virginia Education Association has its knives out for legislation before the General Assembly that might allow some of the state’s lottery proceeds to be spent on veterans. The state constitution requires that all lottery profits -- now about $540 million a year -- be piped to public schools. Del. Scott Lingamfelter, R-Prince William, has proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow an unspecified portion to be spent on job training and education for veterans. The measure would have to be passed two years in a row by legislators and then approved by voters before it would become law. The VEA, which represents about 50,000 teachers and public education professionals, says schools can’t afford to lose any funding. In a Jan. 2 blog post, the organization said state support for public schools still hasn’t recovered from cuts during the Great Recession. ""School funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation,"" the VEA wrote. We’re not taking sides on Lingamfelter’s resolution. But we did wonder whether the VEA’s claim about about the 16 percent drop in state support for schools, when adjusted for inflation, is correct. Robley Jones, the VEA’s director of government relations and research, told us the figure came from a study released in August by the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank. The institute updated its findings in November and now predicts that public education spending, when adjusted for inflation, will drop by 17 percent between the 2008-09 school year and the 2015-16 year. The calculation is largely based on data of past spending and inflation rates. The finding also assumes that the General Assembly will not adjust its education budget for this school year and that inflation rates will not markedly change through mid 2016. We did our own rough calculations, seeking to avoid assumptions about future budget levels and inflation. That meant focusing on data available from 2008 through 2014. We relied on a 10-year spread sheet on public school spending supplied by the Virginia Department of Education and an inflation calculator furnished online by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found: Schools may recoup a small portion of its losses this budget year, which began July 1, 2014. The state is budgeted to pay an average of $4,983 per student -- a 3 percent increase over the previous school year. The national inflation rate during the final half of 2014 was nearly flat. We should finally note that the state is one of three funding sources for public education. On average in 2013, school systems received about 51 percent of their money from their locality, 41 percent from the state and 8 percent from the federal government. The state contributes higher shares to poorer localities and lower shares to wealthier ones. Data taking into account all three money sources shows an average total of $11,316 was spent per Virginia student in the 2008-09 school year and that fell to $11,257 in 2012-13, the latest year available. When adjusted for inflation, that’s an 8.6 percent drop. The VEA’s comment, however, was clearly focused on state funding levels and that’s what we’ll judge it on. Our ruling The VEA says the state’s ""funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation."" Data we gathered shows that Virginia’s funding per student, when adjusted for inflation, dropped by roughly 16.3 percent between the 2008-09 school and the 2013-14 year.

The Senate report detailed many instances when the U.S. waterboarded suspected terrorists, a drowning-like procedure in which interrogators covered detainees’ faces with a cloth and doused them with water, sometimes until they fell unconscious. Scott, D-3rd, denounced the waterboarding as a torture method inconsistent with the United States’ image as a ""moral authority"" and said the report shows the country ""failed to lead by example."" ""After World War II, we tried, convicted, and in some cases, executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included charges of waterboarding,"" Scott said in a Dec. 9 news release. We wondered if Scott’s war history is correct. His spokesman, Dave Dailey, supported Scott’s statement by pointing to previous fact checks of similar claims, including one by PolitiFact National of a statement that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,made in 2007 and another claim that former Vice President Dick Cheney made last year. The claims harken back to the mid to late 1940s when officials of the Axis powers were tried and  convicted, and some executed, for a wide range of war crimes. The term ""waterboarding"" didn’t exist then, but the allegations levelled by prosecutors and U.S. POWs against Japanese military officials referred to techniques called ""water torture,"" ""water treatments"" and ""water cure."" The procedures were described in a 2007 essay by Evan Wallach, an attorney who specialized in the laws of war and later was appointed by President Barack Obama as a federal appeals court judge. Wallach wrote his essay in response to a 2002 Justice Department memo that said CIA waterboarding didn’t constitute torture. Wallach noted that at one of the most well-known Pacific theater post-war trials -- The Tokyo War Crimes Trials by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East -- the records show water torture was generally inflicted in two ways. In one method, the victim was restrained on his back and water was poured on a cloth that had been placed over his nose and mouth. In other cases, a prisoner would be tied to a ladder and slid into a tub of water until he almost drowned. During a 1947 war crimes trial in Yokohama, Wallach wrote that several officials of a Japanese prison camp were convicted of two incidents of strapping down U.S. prisoners and forcing water up their noses and in their mouths. Supporters of the President George W. Bush-era interrogation techniques have said that the CIA’s waterboarding was not as harsh as the torture used by Japanese soldiers. Bush adviser Karl Rove said in a Dec. 14 Fox News interview that in Japan’s case, the method was used to drown the person. Rove said the CIA version was merely done to inflict panic and fear rather than pain and suffering. Wallach, in his essay, saw little difference between Imperial Japan’s use of the procedure and its modern iteration under former president Bush. The judge took issue with media reports that the technique merely simulates drowning saying ""waterboarding is real drowning that simulates death."" We contacted three other war crimes analysts who echoed Wallach’s finding  that the U.S. prosecuted Japanese soldiers for offenses that included waterboarding. The next step, in evaluating Scott’s claim, is determining whether the U.S. executed any Japanese soldiers who waterboarded prisoners. David J. Cohen, the founder of the War Crimes Studies Center at the University of California at Berkeley, said the U.S. military convicted Japanese POW camp officials for a wide range of offenses from severe beatings, to exposing prisoners to extreme temperatures. ""There were death sentences for torture, and that torture typically consisted of multiple forms of mistreatment, of which water torture was considered one of the most severe,"" Cohen said in an email. Wallach, in his essay, wrote that six Japanese generals who ordered and permitted water torture were sentenced to death. He added, however, that those generals were also convicted of many other war crimes -- including conspiracy, aggression and crimes against the peace. Yuma Totani, a history professor at the University of Hawaii, said she knows of two additional Japanese officers who were executed after U.S. military trials conducted from 1944 to 1946. ""Both accused were found guilty on grounds that they disregarded their duty to take control of subordinate army units, which included kenpeitai (Japanese secret police) that was known to have used various torture methods against detainees at Fort Santiago, the kenpeitai interrogation center at Manila,"" Totani said in an email. ""Waterboarding being one of the commonplace torture methods of kenpeitai, one could argue that these accused were convicted of a charge that included waterboarding as one of the torture methods, commonly applied by the members of their subordinate army units."" Our ruling Scott said that after World War II, the U.S. tried, convicted, and in some cases executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included waterboarding. There’s little doubt that the U.S. tried and convicted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding. Six Japanese generals who allowed water torture were executed, although we note they faced a long list of additional charges. Scott qualified his statement to make clear he was referring to executed Japanese military members who faced a variety of war crime charges, including waterboarding, not that they were sentenced to death solely for that offense. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBC87C0>],/factchecks/2015/jan/12/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-after-wwii-us-executed-japanese-war-cr/

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says 2014 is on track to be the warmest year in modern history
","The  seasons may change, the weather may shift, but U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse keeps trying to get his colleagues to, as he puts it, wake up to the threat of climate change. As naysayers insist that global temperatures haven't warmed since around 1997, a claim that has validity only because the time around 1997 was an exceptionally warm year, Whitehouse took to the floor of the Senate on Dec. 17 to report that 2014 was shaping up as the warmest in modern history. ""January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. So unless something dramatic changes in December, 2014 is on track to be the hottest year since we began keeping records back in 1880. That would mean that 14 of the warmest 15 years on record are the 14 years of this century."" PolitiFact usually doesn't deal with predictions, but we thought we’d see if the 11-month numbers for 2014 were as Whitehouse described. When we contacted his office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to the November ""State of the Climate"" report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition to monthly data, it looks at figures from the past three months, the year to date and levels of both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. It reports, ""The first 11 months of 2014 was the warmest such period on record, with a combined global land and ocean average surface temperature of 1.22 degrees F. (0.68 degrees C.) above the 20th century average of 57.0 degrees F. (13.9 degrees C.)."" That's a land-ocean surface average of 58.22 degrees F. (The margin of error for these measurements is plus or minus 0.18 degrees F., which means the actual temperature could be as high as 58.4 or as low as 58.04. The previous record -- 58.02 degrees F. -- was set in 2010. The biggest reason wasn't the surface land temperatures, but it was the increase in the surface temperatures in the oceans, where the first 11 months of 2014 were the warmest on record. Many scientists say that a lot of excess heat from heat-trapping carbon dioxide is being stored in the oceans. NOAA hasn't released its December temperature numbers yet, but the Japan Meteorological Agency has. It has concluded that 2014 broke all records going back as far as 1891.  It may not feel like global warming is a problem when below average cold is sending a collective shiver through much of the United States. But the U.S. makes up only 6 percent of Earth's land mass and less than 2 percent of its surface area. Whitehouse reported the data accurately. We rate his claim as True.

McCaul: Western Europeans can fly to U.S. without a visa
","The slayings in France have raised awareness that terrorist threats can spring up on European soil. And if terrorists can emerge there among people holding European passports, they could come here. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, highlighted that risk during an interview on CBS News’ Face the Nation on Sunday. McCaul worried about jihadists who, like one of the killers in France, trained with terrorists in Yemen and returned to France. McCaul said tracking them is pivotal. ""Western Europe, again, is more lenient in their travel restrictions,"" McCaul said. ""And we have a visa waiver-free system where they can fly in the United States without even having a visa. We need to look at all sorts of things like that."" We decided to take a closer look at McCaul’s claim that Europeans can fly to America without a visa. A quick peek at the State Department website shows that McCaul has it right. Tourists from 28 European nations do not need a visa for visits that last no longer than three months. However, they do need to complete an online application, and in some cases, U.S. officials will deny them entry. The application covers the basics of name, address, passport number, employment status and so forth. The Department of Homeland Security recently added a couple of questions to that application precisely because it would help authorities spot travelers who bear a closer look. People now need to report if they have a second passport for another country or have ever traveled under another name. Experts we reached suggested these details do less to uncover suspicious individuals themselves and are more aimed at avoiding false positives in the system, which wastes precious resources. If McCaul is correct about the visa waiver for Europeans, then the next question is, how big a gap does this represent in border security? Assessing the risk from Europe A report from the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based group that favors a strong military to support liberal democracies, examined the number of al-Qaida-related incidents in the United States that had a European connection. It found that since 2003, there has been only one case, that of the so-called ""underwear bomber"" in 2009. The authors looked at whether perpetrators in the United States had any terrorist training. ""Since 2005, individuals charged were less likely to have terrorist training or combat experience; less likely to be linked to al-Qaida or another Designated Terrorist Organisation; and, subsequently, less likely of carrying out an attack that could lead to mass casualties,"" the authors wrote. They concluded that the European and American counterterrorism strategy had been effective in reducing the threat of an al-Qaida-related attack in the United States, although the Boston Marathon bombing showed that the risk was ongoing. That report came out in 2013. The security experts we reached generally echoed its findings, but they also noted that the number of Europeans who have gone to the Middle East in pursuit of jihad has climbed sharply. ""The jihadists now have a lot of people with western passports,"" said Brian Jenkins, a RAND Corporation advisor and a former member of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. ""It is a potential vulnerability."" But Jenkins also described the current methods that might catch the would-be terrorist. A number of security filters Jenkins walked through the example of a French citizen who went to Yemen. ""The minute they went to Yemen, the intelligence services there are cooperative,"" Jenkins said. ""We’d likely spot them on the way in and on the way out. Also, the European intelligence agencies would have a chance of picking them up, and that info would be shared with us."" Jenkins spoke of the lists the United States maintains, beyond the no-fly list of suspicious individuals. He said there are other databases. For many years, American security agencies have used airline data known as the Passenger Name Record. It provides information on how and where a reservation was made and how it was paid for. The PNR data is assessed before someone boards a plane and while they are en route. ""I wouldn’t say that there is racial or ethnic profiling here, but we have pretty good profiles of tourists and what they look like,"" Jenkins said. ""If there are anomalies, that person gets looked at."" Should the person land in the United States, Jenkins said the track record of domestic counterterrorism has been pretty good. A Saudi citizen was caught in Dallas when he tried to link up with radical Islamic sympathizers. In Jenkins’ view, the greater risk for Americans comes from people who already live here. ""When we look at the terror attacks in the United States since 9-11, the overwhelming number are homegrown,"" Jenkins said. William Braniff is executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. Braniff said there are two ways to assess how effective the current strategy has been. ""At best, it does prevent known terrorists from entering the country,"" Braniff said. ""At worst, it may serve as a deterrent. Attacking in Europe may be perceived as less risky but of similar reward than risking the flight to the United States."" Braniff cautioned, however, that the proliferation of databases and security filters comes with its own drawbacks. ""When you get to 50,000 names, countless transliterations, and then bury them among the millions of names of air travelers coming to or from the U.S., implementation can become unwieldy,"" Braniff said. Both Braniff and Jenkins noted that efforts to tighten entry rules for Europeans would have to be balanced against the strong economic benefits of tourism and business that the current system allows. Our ruling McCaul said that Western Europeans can fly to America without a visa. That is accurate. However, while a visa is not required, European travelers must fill out an application. This is the start of a digital record that allows officials to sift through a variety of databases that can flag suspicious people. To date, the experts we contacted and the research we read spoke to a set of strategies that have so far been effective at reducing the risk of European terrorists entering the country. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC746280>],/factchecks/2015/jan/11/michael-mccaul/can-europeans-fly-united-states-without-visa/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Energy', 'Chris  Coons']","
Chris Coons: Keystone means 'unlocking' Canadian oil sands
","The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States is the first big political battle of 2015. The House passed a bill Friday approving construction of the oil pipeline in spite of a veto threat from President Barack Obama, who has said he is waiting on input from the State Department before making a decision on the pipeline. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked an opponent of the project, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., what Keystone XL means for energy and the environment. Coons responded, ""Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands, some of the dirtiest sources of energy on the planet, and allowing those tar sands to go across our American midwest and then reach the international market."" We’ve looked into where Canada would export oil carried through Keystone XL, as well as the pipeline’s effect on the environment. But what about Coons’ claim that Keystone XL would mean ""unlocking"" western Canada’s tar sands? Does the pipeline make a difference between pumping, or not pumping, crude oil from the tar sands? The short story is the impact seems relatively small. Oil drilling companies in Western Canada have been extracting oil from its sands and transporting them to the United States for production for years, and that practice is expected to continue regardless of Keystone XL. But given the right circumstances, the absence of the Keystone XL pipeline could prevent the region from producing at full capacity. A Coons spokesman said ""he might have been better served saying ‘further unlocked’ than simply ‘unlocked.’ "" The basics The 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline, operated by TransCanada, would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb. Then it would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The oil would come from the tar sands of Canada’s boreal forests. Extracting this type of dirty, thick crude oil is expensive, energy intensive and produces a significant amount of carbon emissions. Critics say that Keystone XL will elevate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change by encouraging expansion of tar sands development. However, an oft-cited U.S. State Department report about Keystone XL says the project is ""unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands."" This is because Canadian officials and oil producers vow that the oil will be extracted and reach the American marketplace by other means regardless of the proposed pipeline. Already, trains and several existing pipelines carry Western Canadian crude oil into the United States at an increasing rate -- almost 2 million barrels per day produced in 2013, with the United States importing about half of that. ""Keystone XL would only provide a more direct and somewhat less costly method of transporting Canadian heavy crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining and exporting,"" said Anastasia Shcherbakova, a University of Texas Dallas clinical assistant professor in energy economics and energy finance. At most, Keystone XL would allow an increase in oil sands production of about 25 percent from today's levels, said Andrew Leach, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta School of Business. He said that tar sands will come out as long as there is someone willing to pay for the oil, and ""that demand doesn’t go away if there’s no pipeline from Canada."" There are several other pipelines under consideration that could carry tar sands oil to the United States. If they are built, Keystone XL on its own wouldn’t have much impact because the oil will get to the United States by other cost-effective means, said James Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University. On the other hand, if Keystone XL and the other pipelines aren’t constructed, oil companies could take a sizeable hit to their profit -- about $8 a barrel -- because they would have to transport the oil by rail and other means, which are more expensive, according to the State Department report. But the absence of Keystone XL on its own wouldn’t be enough to induce these added costs. Coons spokesman Ian Koski pointed to a report from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers that shows projected growth to about 8 million barrels per day by 2030 (including U.S.-produced oil that travels on the Canadian pipelines) after adding the several pipelines under consideration, including Keystone. But if those pipelines aren’t included, growth appears stuck at around 5 million barrels per day. Without Keystone XL and the other pipelines, the tar sands could not be fully extracted because the oil would ""have nowhere to go,"" he said. Koski pointed to a couple examples of Canadian oil sands mines that were put on hold due to, in part, rising industry and transportation costs: the Joslyn Mine and the Statoil Corner project. ""Costs for labor and materials have continued to rise in recent years and are working against the economics of new projects,"" Statoil said in a statement. ""Market access issues also play a role -- including limited pipeline access, which weighs on prices for Alberta oil, squeezing margins and making it difficult for sustainable financial returns."" Regardless, experts and the State Department don’t think that Keystone XL will have a major impact one way or another on whether oil companies will continue to exploit the tar sands. However, there is a catch: Low oil prices could potentially curtail production. Cost of oil Oil prices have dropped to about $50 per barrel -- the lowest prices since 2009, the height of the recession. For Canadian oil sands to break even on production costs, oil prices need to be around $70 a barrel. Without the Keystone XL pipeline, transportation costs are high, which exacerbates the hit to revenue after low oil prices. The State Department’s report assumed oil prices staying at around $75 per barrel. It said that if oil prices fall between $65 and $75 per barrel, then the cost of transporting oil without the Keystone XL pipeline might make a difference as to whether or not Canada continues to produce tar sands oil at current rates. But under $65 per barrel -- where prices are now -- it’s more the sheer low price of oil that would negatively impact oil production rather than any pipeline in particular. ""You still need pipes, but Keystone XL or any other individual line in and of itself is not as crucial to likely growth plans,"" Leach said. Additionally, the price of oil is volatile, and many experts think it will go back up again, so a long-term impact on tar sands production due to low oil prices is not likely. ""Under State's analysis, blocking Keystone XL will only have an effect on oil sands production if all the other pipelines are blocked, and oil prices stay below $75 per barrel,"" Coleman said. ""How likely is that? I'd say it's unlikely, but no one really knows."" Our ruling Coons said building ""Keystone means unlocking the Canadian tar sands."" Oil production has been steadily growing in the Canadian tar sands without the Keystone XL pipeline. Most experts expect that trend to continue despite current low oil prices. Coons would have been on safer ground if he said Keystone XL would unlock Canada’s ability to further increase its production capacity. The pipeline would offer much lower transportation costs than current transportation methods, which would encourage greater oil production. But his literal words weren’t accurate. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC729D40>],/factchecks/2015/jan/11/chris-coons/chris-coons-keystone-means-unlocking-canadian-oil-/

Advocate says Colorado received $60 million in taxes and fees from marijuana in 2014
","The debate over the legalization of marijuana is a lively one, with strong opinions on either side. In a recent commentary in The Providence Journal, James Aubin, the founder of pro-legalization group Common Sense Citizen, argued for the legalization of  marijuana in Rhode Island, saying it could boost the state’s sagging economy. He included an impressive statistic about the revenue Colorado was bringing in from marijuana sales. ""Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana,"" Aubin wrote in the Jan. 5, 2015, piece. (The Harvard report he mentioned was ""The Budgetary Implications of Drug Prohibition,"" a 2010 study by professor Jeffrey Miron. He estimated that Rhode Island spends $40 million annually fighting marijuana.) We decided to focus on the first half of his statement, dealing with Colorado revenue. We asked Aubin where he got his numbers. He responded that he relied on the State of Colorado's Department of Revenue, as well as a story from Channel 7-KMGH, the Denver ABC News affiliate. We pulled Colorado’s tax records ourselves. We added up the monthly figures, from Jan. 1, 2014, when the first recreational marijuana stores opened, through Oct. 31, the most recent report. We determined that the state’s total marijuana tax revenue was about $60 million. The revenue comes from a 2.9-percent retail and medical marijuana sales tax; a 10-percent retail marijuana special sales tax; and a 15-percent marijuana excise tax, plus application and license fees for retail and medical marijuana. In other words, Aubin got his number right. We were curious about where the money went. Colorado tax records show that a portion of the revenue from marijuana retail sales  is distributed to local governments where stores are located, including Denver and the ski resort towns of Breckenridge and Telluride, based on tax revenue brought in from marijuana sales in those communities. Denver, for example, received $128,586. Most of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that  tax has generated $10 million for the fund. The monthly revenue from marijuana has increased steadily. In January, the total collected in taxes and fee was $3.5 million; in October, it was $7.6 million. We also looked at news articles about the tax implications of legalizing marijuana. One, by Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt, reports that estimates for tax potential from marijuana sales vary widely. States with legalized recreational marijuana sales could see their revenue drop as more states move to legalize.   Another story, by Associated Press reporter Gene Johnson, detailed how tax revenues from legal sales of marijuana  were being undercut by regular users buying medical or black-market marijuana to avoid the higher taxes. Officials in Colorado and Washington, two of the four states that have legalized sale of recreational marijuana, are  considering ways to rein in the medical marijuana system and to reduce the tax differential between medical and retail sales. For the record, Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. In 2013, it decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical marijuana; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge. Our ruling James Aubin wrote that ""Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year …"". Documents we reviewed from the Colorado Department of Revenue showed that total marijuana revenue from taxes and fees was about $60 million between Jan. 1 through Oct. 31, 2014. Of course, this figure tells only part of the story about Colorado’s legalization of marijuana. There are also costs, including administrative expenses and societal costs yet to be determined. But those are beyond the scope of this fact-check. We rate Aubin’s claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9BB080>],/factchecks/2015/jan/11/james-aubin/advocate-says-colorado-received-60-million-taxes-a/

Glenn Hegar says lower gas prices equivalent to 2 percent pay raise for average taxpayers
","A reader noted Republican Glenn Hegar’s upbeat comments about plummeting oil prices and requested a fact check. Hegar, the former state senator elected Texas state comptroller in 2014, told reporters early this year there are benefits to falling oil prices. ""Lower fuel costs should reduce the price of importing goods, which is great for consumers and, ultimately, our economy,"" Hegar said, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story. ""In fact, the average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices."" The same story noted the price of oil had fallen about 50 percent since June 2014 to just more than $50 a barrel. And are lower fuel prices equivalent to a 2 percent pay raise for taxpayers? By email, Hegar spokesman Chris Bryan said Hegar drew that percentage from a December 2014 news story in the Economist magazine. The story said, in part: ""Cheaper oil should act like a shot of adrenalin to global growth. A $40 price cut shifts some $1.3 trillion from producers to consumers. The typical American motorist, who spent $3,000 in 2013 at the pumps, might be $800 a year better off—equivalent to a 2% pay rise."" The magazine didn’t engage with our inquiry about how its figures were worked up. We went on to query James Hamilton, a University of California, San Diego, economist quoted by the Wall Street Journal in November 2014 saying lower gas prices ""relative to the average of the past three years will in effect put an extra $108 billion into U.S. consumers’ pockets, generating a nearly 0.8 percent increase in disposable personal income."" By email, Hamilton pointed us to his Dec. 21, 2014, blog post stating: ""The average U.S. retail price of gasoline right now is about $2.40 a gallon. Last year,"" in 2013, ""American consumers and businesses bought 135 billion gallons of gasoline,"" per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at an average price of $3.60 a gallon, he wrote. Hamilton wrote: ""If gasoline prices stay where they are and if we buy the same number of gallons of gasoline this year as last, that leaves us with an additional $160 billion to spend over the course of the year on other items. If we restate the total savings for U.S. consumers and businesses in terms of the 116 million U.S. households, that works out to almost $1,400 per household."" We checked his bottom-line figure—$1,400 per household—and compared it to what the U.S. Census Bureau estimates to have been the median household income for the U.S. and Texas, respectively, from 2009 through 2013. In Texas, the estimated $1,400 in unspent money shakes out to a 2.7 percent increase on the median income of $51,900. Nationally, it would amount to a 2.6 percent increase from the median household income of $53,046. Also, EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan noted by email that in December 2014, the agency predicted the average U.S. household would spend about $550 less on gasoline in 2015 than in 2014 due to falling gas prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks—which would be 1 percent of the median household income in Texas. Our ruling Hegar said the ""average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices."" Provided gas prices don’t go back up, that percentage seems in the ballpark for how much Texans could save on gas compared to what they spent, though it's also possible to get to higher and lower projections.

Jerry Jones says Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops than the late Bob Hope
","Jerry Jones said the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have outflanked one of the country’s most-traveled actor-comedians. Jones, who owns the football team, spoke to ESPN’s Mike and Mike on Jan. 8, 2015, in the Dallas-area studio where the cheerleaders practice, according to a blog post by the Dallas Morning News. Opening the 15-minute interview, which aired the next morning, Jones stressed the location, saying: ""We’re sitting here in the area where the cheerleaders perform. I’ll get my little plug in there."" Then Jones said: ""They’ve entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope."" Now this isn’t politics. But Jones made his claim in Texas and the late Hope, friend to presidents and world leaders, would surely holler for the Truth-O-Meter if he could, maybe waving a golf club. Hope and the troops Over decades, often around Christmas, Hope flew the globe to put on shows for U.S. troops. In his later years, the shows were taped as TV specials. According to a web page for the USO, the nonprofit dedicated to lifting the spirits of troops, Hope performed his first USO show in California in May 1941. ""Hope entertained"" with the USO ""until December 1990, when he brought laughter and Christmas cheer to troops participating in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain on his final USO tour,"" the page says. A USO timeline, on another web page, says in the entry for 1943: ""Over the course of his career, Hope appeared in or hosted almost 200 USO performances, including annual Christmas tours for 35 consecutive years."" Hope's run with the USO nearly reached 50 years. By telephone, though, USO spokeswoman Gayle Fishel said she was uncertain the organization had a tally of the number of troops Hope ultimately entertained. Maybe millions? A 1997 congressional resolution, deeming Hope an honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, said that during ""World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War and throughout the Cold War, Bob Hope traveled to visit and entertain millions of United States service members in numerous countries, on ships at sea, and in combat zones ashore."" Responding to our inquiry by email, James Hardy, producer for Bob Hope Enterprises, Inc., pointed out an Air Force web page stating: ""For more than 50 years, Bob Hope entertained men and women of the U.S. Air Force and the other services at home and overseas, in peace and in war. At least 10,000,000 G.I.s benefited from his efforts."" Hardy said Hope routinely did 150 shows during a USO tour. Cheerleaders and the troops Dallas Cowboys officials replied to our query about Jones’ statement by noting the cheerleaders have been doing performance tours in coordination with the Department of Defense since a 1979 tour in South Korea. A page in the Cowboys media guide, emailed to us by the team, states the cheerleaders’ Show Group has made ""more international tours with the USO than any other entertainment group. They bring their own special brand of goodwill and gratitude to the men and women in the military, traveling to locations as diverse as Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cuba, Korea and the Persian Gulf."" Through 2014, the team told us, the cheerleaders had teamed up the government 78 times ""to boost the morale of the men, women and families of our U.S. military at hundreds of bases and outposts around the world."" Separately, USO spokeswoman Sharee Posey emailed that since 2002, the Cowboys cheerleaders had entertained more than 198,000 troops and military families. Posey said USO does not have information on Hope's appearances. We pressed Dalrymple on how Jones concluded the cheerleaders had entertained more troops than Hope. Spokesman Rich Dalrymple replied that the team hasn’t laid claim to the cheerleaders entertaining more troops than Hope. But Jones did, yes? ""Evidently he did not have his facts correct, which is my fault, so you can blame me,"" Dalrymple said by email. Our ruling Jones said the cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys have ""entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope."" The cheerleaders may be outpacing other groups in USO tours, having toured nearly 80 times. But it looks like Hope, who died at 100 in July 2003, performed before more troops, given that he had nearly 200 USO swings. We rate Jones' claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

UPDATE, 4 p.m., Jan. 13, 2015: We updated this story Jan. 12, 2015, to correct the spelling of a USO official's name and to fold in that group's count of the troops entertained by the Cowboys cheerleaders since 2002. We updated it afresh the next day to add an Air Force mention of Hope entertaining millions of troops. These changes did not affect the rating of the statement.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD03E00>],/factchecks/2015/jan/09/jerry-jones/jerry-jones-says-dallas-cowboy-cheerleaders-have-e/

Chuck Todd says there are estimates of a Texas recession if all unauthorized immigrants deported
","An NBC reporter made us wonder about mass deportations touching off a Texas recession. Chuck Todd, who hosts the ""Meet the Press"" program, quizzed Texas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott on a December 2014 edition of the program about the costs to Texas of schooling and otherwise serving individuals living in the state and country without legal authorization. But, Todd suggested, the same immigrants support the state’s economy, adding: ""There have been some estimates that if you deported everybody who is in Texas illegally, it would actually be an economic—it would create an economic recession for the state of Texas."" Abbott replied by saying legal immigration has been good for the country. We didn’t hear back from Todd’s office about which estimates he was thinking of to conclude that if every resident not authorized to live in Texas was deported, the state’s economy would be hammered. Meantime, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas told us through spokesman James Hoard it’s unaware of research on the economic impact should every unauthorized resident of the state be deported. But a bank economist, Pia Orrenius, said by email: ""If you take a million workers out of the Texas labor force, economic activity will contract."" Another expert on the Texas economy, Southern Methodist University economist Bernard Weinstein, said he was unaware of fresh looks at the effects of deporting all unauthorized Texas workers. Generally, he emailed, ""Texas has had the most robust economy of any large state over the past five years, accounting for about 30 percent of all the jobs created nationwide. Without question, our large immigrant population—both legal and illegal—has contributed to that growth. I don’t know that deporting all of Texas’ undocumented workers would cause an outright recession, but it would certainly impose some real pain on a number of industries such as agriculture, hospitality (hotels and restaurants), and residential construction/maintenance."" Robert Wood, a spokesman for the Texas Association of Business, replied to our inquiry by pointing out a May 2008 Houston Chronicle news story on a study overseen by economist Ray Perryman of Waco as possibly relevant. According to the story, Perryman calculated that Texas would lose more than 1 million residents if all unauthorized workers vanished overnight, costing the economy. Wood also noted a May 2013 Texas Tribune news story quoting data compiled by a Washington, D.C., think tank, the Immigration Policy Center, stating that mass deportations in the state, home to an estimated 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants, would cost the economy billions of dollars. ""If all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Texas, the state would lose $69.3 billion in economic activity, $30.8 billion in gross state product, and approximately 403,174 jobs, even accounting for adequate market adjustment time,"" the center said. We followed up with Perryman, who emailed his firm’s April 2008 report to us while cautioning that all its figures and projections would be different by now given changes over time. Sudden deportations, sudden recession? The 2008 Perryman report didn’t predict a recession anywhere in the U.S. in the event of mass deportations. Still, it said, the ""undocumented workforce comprises a notable percentage of total workers in many industrial and occupational categories, which are becoming increasingly difficult for employers to fill. Without undocumented workers, notable labor shortages would emerge, and significant economic dislocations would occur."" Whether Texas went into a recession, Perryman told us by email, ""would depend on the circumstances. If the entire workforce were removed quickly with no time to adjust, it would cause a recession. That outcome is very unlikely. If it were done on a more-phased basis with time to respond, it would still likely take a heavy toll, but an all-out recession might be avoidable,"" he wrote. Perryman continued: ""The difficulty lies in the percentage of the Texas workforce filled by undocumented workers."" The 2008 report estimated unauthorized residents to comprised 9 percent of Texas workers in 2007, compared with 5 percent nationwide. In his email, Perryman went on: ""Even if every unemployed person in the Texas labor force today could and would fill one of those slots (which is obviously not the case), the state would be short several hundred thousand workers. Those jobs would have to be filled by recruiting from other areas (which would also be facing similar situations, though in most cases not as severe) or, replaced by technology (which takes time, etc.). It would also disproportionately affect some key industries that support growth and exports (such as construction and agriculture). ""I guess the bottom line is that, under any circumstances, it would cause a lot of disruptions.  Under most circumstances, it would cause a recession with the magnitude and duration depending on the specific plan. Under a few programs (a very gradual phase-in combined with mechanisms to replace the workers with ‘documented’ ones, which would require real, comprehensive immigration reform), a recession could be averted. Whatever the politics, the sheer numbers make a quick deportation very difficult to manage,"" Perryman said. 2012 study Also to our inquiry, spokesman Ed Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO pointed out an August 2012 report from the liberal Center for American Progress estimating that in Texas or any of six other states, ""deporting even a portion of the unauthorized immigrants would lead to significant losses in gross state product, worker wages and tax revenues."" The report, undertaken by Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said unauthorized immigrants comprised 7.2 percent, or 1.02 million, of Texas workers and accounted for $14.5 billion in taxes paid in the state in 2010. (The report said its population estimates drew on the U.S. Census Bureau and Pew Hispanic Center.) The report didn’t use ""recession"" in its description of probable Texas outcomes. Still, it said, removing ""all of the undocumented immigrants from Texas would have substantial, indeed devastating, consequences for everyone remaining in the state. Driving undocumented immigrants out of Texas would lead to substantially diminished earnings, decreased gross state product and lost tax revenue for the state government."" The state’s gross state product, the report said, would be reduced by more than $77.7 billion, or 6 percent, if the ""undocumented population were driven from the state."" Another voice We also consulted Bob Dane of the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, which focuses on the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. Dane suggested the idea of sudden mass deportations is obviously absurd. Still, if they happened, Dane said by phone, there would be short-term inconveniences, even chaos. But over time, he said, vacancies would be filled by job-seeking legal residents—and wages would rise. The Perryman report said that nationally mass removals would result in the immediate loss of 8.1 million jobs, but the reduction would shrink to 2.8 million jobs once businesses and remaining workers adjusted. In Texas, the report said, there would ultimately be 403,174 jobs wiped out, compared to 1.15 million jobs lost immediately after unauthorized residents were removed. Our ruling Todd, addressing Abbott, said there had been ""some estimates that if you deported everybody who is in Texas illegally… it would create an economic recession for the state."" It’s hard to overlook that Todd’s statement was premised on hypothetical mass deportations no one expects to occur. That glitch aside, economists have said the Texas economy would suffer without its unauthorized workers, but we didn’t find ""recession"" estimates. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
