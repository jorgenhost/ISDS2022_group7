NRA's Chris Cox falsely says Dianne Feinstein wanted to take 'all of your guns'
","Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has offered a bill to ban bump fire stocks after police found 12 rifles equipped with these devices in the Las Vegas festival shooter’s hotel room. In a significant policy shift, Republicans and the National Rifle Association have said they believe that the government should intervene and regulate this kind of equipment, which allows semi-automatic weapons to fire over and over again without forcing the shooter to do all the work of squeezing the trigger repeatedly. On Fox News Sunday, NRA-Institute for Legislative Action executive director Chris Cox drew a sharp line between his group’s stance and what he sees as the underlying Democratic agenda. ""I take Dianne Feinstein at her word when she says that if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America, turn in all of your guns,' they would do it,"" Cox told host Chris Wallace Oct. 8. Cox is off target, because he said Feinstein said she wanted to take away all guns. In reality, back in 1995, Feinstein said she wanted to take away all assault rifles. That’s a huge difference. While firm numbers are lacking, assault weapons represent a fraction of the country’s estimated total of 310 million guns. We reached out to the National Rifle Association and did not hear back, but Cox was repeating a charge that has been leveled against Feinstein before. In the past, it tracked back to an interview she did in 1995. Feinstein was a driving force behind the 1994 federal assault weapons ban. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. Those restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons made before the ban’s effective date Sept. 13, 1994. (Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004.) In a Feb. 5, 1995 segment on CBS News’ 60 Minutes, correspondent Lesley Stahl explored the surge in sales that preceded the ban. Stahl cited government estimates that as many 1.5 million weapons were in circulation due to the exception carved out in the law. Stahl said Feinstein told him in an interview that she didn’t want that, but had done the best that should could. ""If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it,"" Feinstein told Stahl. ""I could not do that. The votes weren’t here."" Feinstein repeated that message in a speech on the Senate floor a few months later: ""If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that. This is a moderate law."" Her words have always applied to assault weapons, not all firearms. In a 2012 op-ed, she wrote ""Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right."" And in proposing to ban bump stocks, Feinstein said her bill ""does not take anyone's gun."" She also said she remains committed to some form of a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. Both the total number of firearms and assault-style weapons in the country remain unclear. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 2009, the country had about 310 million firearms: ""114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns."" In 2013, pro-Second Amendment rights attorney David Hardy said in Senate testimony that nearly 9 million people went target shooting with an AR-15-style weapon. (AR-15 refers to one of the more common styles of the banned weapons.) Hardy used figures from the National Shooting Sports Foundation that showed in 2012 that only about a quarter of shooters owned an AR-style weapon. Based on that, 9 million would be a high-end estimate of the number of assault weapons owned in 2012. Set against a total number of firearms in excess of 300 million, assault weapons are not a large share of all guns. Cox said that Feinstein had once said ""if she had 51 votes in the Senate for 'Mr. and Ms. America , turn in all of your guns,' they would do it."" This is an inaccurate characterization of what Feinstein said in a 1995 interview on assault-type weapons. It is clear in context about loopholes in the 1994 assault weapon ban that Feinstein would have liked the ban to apply to all assault weapons but did not have the votes. That is a far cry from banning all firearms, and Feinstein has said she supports the right of people to own a weapon for hunting or self-defense.

Did Obama administration approve bump stocks?
","In a rare move, the National Rifle Association issued a statement calling for regulation of the device that turned the Las Vegas shooter’s rifles more deadly, blaming Barack Obama’s administration for its approval. ""Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the NRA wrote in a statement. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."" A bump or fire stock is a device that allows rifles to fire bullets as quickly as a machine gun. At least 12 of the Las Vegas shooter’s guns were outfitted with them. But did Obama approve their legality? Sort of, but approved is probably the wrong word. NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter pointed us to a June 2010 approval letter from ATF, an agency under executive purview, sent to Slide Fire, a bump stock manufacturer. Spelling out the legal definition of a firearm, ATF’s technology chief John Spencer determined it was not regulated by law. ""The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed,"" Spencer wrote. ""Accordingly, we find that the ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act."" Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil to cause the user’s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don’t alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful. We found a similar 2012 letter addressed to Bump Fire, a competing manufacturer. But just as these bump stocks didn’t qualify for regulation, two similar devices did. The difference? The Akins Accelerator and the Autoglove were determined in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to have mechanical parts that enhanced the trigger mechanism, making them by definition machineguns. ""Electrically-driven trigger devices are considered ‘machineguns’ because they are a ‘combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,’ "" ATF’s letter to AutoGlove read. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted since the 1934 National Firearms Act, and 1986 regulations made it much harder for civilians to get an automatic weapon like a machine gun. Experts in firearm policy were divided when we asked about the fairness of the NRA’s characterization. Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in guns, said it was appropriate to characterize the move as an approval of its sale under the Obama administration. ""Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"" Winkler said. Other legal experts stressed that it wasn’t an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn’t allow for its regulation. ""The statement implies Obama or (U.S. Attorney General Eric) Holder was somehow involved, and that it was an issue that wouldn’t have been approved in any other administration, and that’s technically incorrect,"" said Rick Vasquez, a former Firearms Technology Branch official who first signed off on the recommendation the ATF could not regulate the Slide Fire. ""We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve (the Slide Fire),"" Vasquez said. Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns. ""I believe (the NRA) were stating that just to point out that this wasn’t some rogue decision made during a Republican administration, which would be more friendly to gun owners, and therefore that when they re-evaluate it, they’re going to have to take a really close look at the law,"" said John Pierce, a lawyer and advocate for gun rights. In order to re-evaluate the bump stock, Vasquez said the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated. The NRA said, ""The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."" We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law. We rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/oct/06/national-rifle-association/nra-claim-obama-approved-bump-stocks/

Are Republicans paying for tax cuts with reductions in Medicare, Medicaid?
","It didn’t take long for Democrats to criticize President Donald Trump’s tax proposal as being biased toward wealthier Americans. But would those same tax cuts be paid for by big cuts to Medicare and Medicaid? Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said so during a Senate floor speech on Oct. 4. ""The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid,"" Schumer said. ""That's the bombshell this week. That is the nugget that will destroy their whole plan, because Americans are so against those kinds of cuts."" In reality, the linkage between the proposed tax cuts and possible cuts to Medicare is more complicated than Schumer described. Schumer’s staff said the ""bombshell"" is in the Senate Republicans’ budget proposal, unveiled on Sept. 29. The 89-page document would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. The Medicare and Medicaid cuts Schumer cited come from relatively hard-to-find numbers released by the Senate Budget Committee, which wrote the proposal. To determine the size of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, Schumer’s office compared the most recent ""baseline"" spending amounts produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and the amounts proposed by the Senate budget document. For Medicare, Schumer’s office calculated that projected spending on the program would be in excess of $8.5 trillion over the next 10 years, if no changes are made from the status quo. The GOP budget, by contrast, projects Medicare spending over the same period to be $8.1 trillion. The difference between the estimate and the GOP budget plan: almost $473 billion, or 5.5 percent of the CBO baseline. For the category that includes Medicaid, CBO produced a baseline spending level of $6.6 trillion over 10 years. In the GOP budget, the equivalent amount is $5.3 trillion over 10 years. That’s a difference of $1.3 trillion. Since Medicaid is estimated to account for 80 percent of that budget line, the specific decline in Medicaid spending would be a bit under $1.1 trillion, or about 17 percent. On Medicare, the Senate Budget Committee did not quibble with Schumer’s number. However, the committee argued that this is not a ""cut"" because Medicare spending will still rise over the next 10 years -- by about 82 percent over 10 years, instead of 99 percent growth over 10 years under the status quo. Here’s a graph the committee produced:   The committee said this slowdown is justified because CBO says that Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund -- which covers beneficiaries’ stays at hospitals and other facilities -- will run out by 2025. Making smaller cuts all along would prolong the life of the trust fund and prevent bigger cuts later on, the committee argues. As for Medicaid, the committee said that the budget resolution does not reallocate savings from Medicaid to achieve tax relief. Instead, it projects economic growth spurred by the separately proposed tax overhaul will average 2.6 percent annually, helping pay for tax cuts. Also, the committee argues that widespread benefits from the tax overhaul will leave more money in Americans’ pockets and reduce the need for Medicaid enrollment. We should start by noting that the budget proposal -- and especially the tax proposal -- are works in progress and could change before (or if) they are enacted. The Senate Budget Committee has a point that Medicare spending will be going up, just not as fast as it would under the status quo. It also has a point that more modest cuts sooner could stave off bigger cuts later. (Experts have often told us that it’s presumptuous to assume significant economic growth impacts before they materialize.) But we don’t find it unreasonable for Schumer to call cumulative reductions to Medicare and Medicaid spending in the hundreds of billions of dollars ""cuts."" The reductions below the CBO baseline are indeed in the Senate budget document, which fits with Schumer's words that the GOP is ""proposing"" them. And an independent analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center backs up the notion that the GOP's cuts are tilted toward richer Americans. That said, he’s glossed over some nuance. The tax proposal is advancing on a different track than the Senate Republicans’ budget plan, and both are at an early stage. So Schumer’s direct linkage between specific tax cuts and Medicare-Medicaid cuts is exaggerated -- and keyed to a hot-button issue for voters. As released, the tax proposal promises to partially offset cuts by repealing other tax breaks, with the rest simply adding to the deficit. And the Senate budget resolution allows the deficit to increase by $1.5 trillion. Since money is fungible, this means that it would be at least as accurate to say that the tax cuts would be paid for by added deficits, rather than cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. In the meantime, Medicare and Medicaid cuts aren’t as inevitable as Schumer suggests. The way things look now, the tax cuts, procedurally, would be easier to pass than the spending cuts. Passage of the budget would tee up a 51-vote Senate threshold for the tax proposal -- easier than the regular 60-vote threshold for Senate business. While the spending cuts could also be passed within that 51-vote bill, the current indications from GOP leaders is that this 51-vote measure would be reserved for taxes, not spending, said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that is generally considered hawkish on deficits. And if spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid need to go through the regular 60-vote process, they would be highly unlikely to pass in the current Congress, Newton said. Schumer’s office acknowledges such difficulties but adds that an existing ""pay-as-you-go"" budget law would require mandatory cuts in any case. Newton added, however, that Congress has previously waived this requirement through legislation. ""Presumably, Schumer would be interested in ‘wiping the scorecard’ and avoiding those cuts,"" Newton said. Schumer said, ""The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid."" He has a point that the tax proposal includes significant tax cuts and that the Senate Republicans’ budget proposal reduces projected spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. However, Schumer has overstated the linkage between the proposed tax and spending cuts. In addition, his decision to highlight Medicare and Medicaid cuts with the vivid word ""gutting"" leaves the impression that such reductions are a drastic reshaping and are likelier to occur than they actually are. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2017/oct/06/charles-schumer/are-republicans-paying-tax-cuts-reductions-medicar/

In the wake of Las Vegas, lawmaker says a Wisconsin bill would let everyone carry concealed weapons
","At a news conference in response to the Las Vegas mass shooting, Wisconsin state Rep. Chris Taylor made a claim about a bill that’s advancing in the Wisconsin Legislature. The Madison Democrat said on Oct. 4, 2017, three days after the shooting: Unfortunately, the other thing that we see after these horrible massacres is a loosening of gun laws, allowing dangerous individuals to get firearms more easily. That seems to be the trend in this country. Right here, in our own state, we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools -- even around schools. Let’s see if that’s what the bill would do. The bill’s history and status Taylor was referring to Senate Bill 169, which was introduced by two GOP lawmakers in April 2017. In September 2017, 11 days before a gunman killed 58 people and wounded 489 in Las Vegas, the bill was approved by a Senate committee. The three Republicans voted yes and the two Democrats no. The full Senate could take up the bill later in 2017 or in 2018. Both the state Senate and the Assembly are controlled by Republicans. But GOP Gov. Scott Walker has cast some doubt on the legislation, saying in June 2017 it was ""appropriate"" for the state to require people to get permits to carry hidden weapons. The bill vs. current law To be clear, under current state law, certain people, such as felons, are prohibited from possessing a gun. Generally speaking, it is legal in Wisconsin to openly carry a firearm without any training or license to carry. But a state license is needed to carry a concealed firearm. Now let’s get to how concealed carry would change under the bill, according a memo by the nonpartisan Legislative Council and Larry Konopacki, the state attorney who wrote it: Licensing: Currently, it is generally illegal in Wisconsin to carry a concealed weapon unless you have a concealed carry weapon (CCW) license issued by the state. A background check and training are required to get a license. The bill would do away with the licensing requirement -- which means no training or background check would be required to carry a concealed weapon. So, the ""no training, no background check"" part of Taylor’s claim is correct. Schools: Currently, guns are generally prohibited on school grounds. The bill would do away with that blanket prohibition. Instead, individual schools could ban guns on their grounds. But people with a CCW license would still be able to bring their guns on the grounds, as long as the guns stayed in their vehicle or within five feet of their vehicle. (The provision was included so that parents who carry weapons aren’t breaking the law when they pick up and drop off their children at school, supporters say.) Those with licenses would also be free to bring guns onto any school grounds when there were no school activities. But Taylor’s claim was ""around schools,"" so let’s be clear on that. Currently, only CCW license holders are generally allowed to possess firearms within 1,000 feet of school grounds. Under the bill, anyone who legally possesses a firearm could generally carry within 1,000 feet of school grounds.   It's worth noting that while carrying within 1,000 feet of school would be made legal under state law, generally speaking, people would still be in violation of federal law if carrying a concealed weapon within 1,000 feet from a school if they don't have a concealed carry license. Prohibitions: Currently, it is generally illegal for certain persons -- such as people convicted of any felony, or of a misdemeanor involving domestic violence -- to possess a gun at all. The bill would not change that general prohibition. However, it would allow even those people who are generally prohibited to be able to legally carry, open or concealed, antique, replica and muzzleloading firearms. So, to Taylor’s claim, even felons could concealed carry those certain types of firearms and they could do so within 1,000 feet of a school. Our rating Taylor said in Wisconsin, ""we have a bill that would allow hidden, deadly weapons -- every single person to carry one -- no training, no background check, even around schools."" The ""every single person"" part of the claim needs clarification, in that not every person, particularly felons, can legally possess any type of weapon. But Taylor is correct that if the bill becomes law, people could generally carry concealed weapons without getting a license -- which would mean no background check or training would be required, either. And even felons could conceal carry certain weapons, such as antique or replica guns. As for around schools, anyone who can legally possess a firearm could generally carry it concealed within 1,000 feet of a school, under the bill. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Note: This item was updated on Oct. 6, 2017 to make reference to the federal law on carrying a weapon near a school. This does not change the rating. div class='artembed'>",/factchecks/2017/oct/06/chris-taylor/wake-las-vegas-lawmaker-says-wisconsin-bill-would-/
"['PunditFact', 'Guns', 'Newsweek']","
Are white males responsible for more mass shootings than any other group?
","As details about the Las Vegas shooter’s identity emerged, media outlets noted some of the characteristics fit neatly within a familiar profile of prior mass shooting perpetrators. Newsweek, for instance, ran a story with the headline, ""White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group."" The article builds on this claim, stating that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white males. We’ve covered the demographics of mass shootings before but had not heard this specific claim. So we decided to take a closer look at who’s behind mass shootings. No U.S. government entity specifically tracks mass shootings — much less, the shooters’ race and ethnicity, experts told us. But some media organizations and nongovernmental groups have taken up the task in various forms. Some of the differences in the datasets are the result of having no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. The number of mass shootings a group tallies can vary dramatically based on how the term is defined. For example, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks gun-related injuries and deaths, defines a mass shooting as ""four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter."" According to that group, there have been 274 mass shootings so far this year, or nearly one per day. Another widely cited source comes from the progressive media outlet Mother Jones, which created a database in 2012 after the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater. Mother Jones defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. This language is similar to a 2013 statute that defines ""mass killings"" as three or more killed in a single incident, though that applies to any weapon. The Mother Jones database, which dates back to Aug. 20, 1982, counts 91 mass shootings. Of these, 50 were carried out by white men — hence, where Newsweek and other outlets got the statistic that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white men. For comparison’s sake, Mother Jones' data show African-Americans accounted for 15 mass shootings, while Latinos and Asians were responsible for seven each. Three attacks were carried out by women, including one of the two perpetrators behind the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. We should note that some experts expressed concern that if the public debate around gun violence focuses too much on mass shootings, there’s a risk of overlooking the fact that gun murders disproportionately affect minorities, especially African-Americans.  Because Newsweek’s claim derives from Mother Jones’ data, we asked experts about the reliability of this count. Grant Duwe, author of Mass Murder in the United States: A History, considered a leading scholarly book on the subject, has long criticized Mother Jones’ accounting. Duwe pointed us to an essay he penned for Reason magazine in 2014, in which he argued Mother Jones has low-balled its tally of mass shootings as a result of relying solely on news coverage as its source of data. Duwe believes this creates a false impression that mass shootings have been on the rise (a claim that’s beyond the scope of this fact-check). ""The main concern is an underreporting problem that gets worse the farther back in time we go,"" Duwe told PolitiFact. ""This creates problems when it comes to drawing conclusions about trends in the prevalence of mass public shootings."" Nevertheless, Duwe said his own research dating back to 1900 corroborates that white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group, though he believes white men make up an even larger share than the Mother Jones data show. ""There have been at least 184 mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1900, including the Las Vegas attack,"" Duwe said. ""Among these mass public shooters, non-Hispanic whites make up 63 percent, which is close to what we see for the U.S. population in general. So, the Mother Jones data actually underreport the extent to which whites are involved as mass public shooters."" The vast majority of mass shootings is committed by men. Looking only at the male population, some have argued that statistical claims based on Mother Jones data on the racial makeup of mass shooters leaves out important context. Critics argue that when you consider that non-Hispanic white men make up about 63 percent of the male population, white men appear proportionally less likely to commit a mass shooting, according to the Mother Jones statistics showing white men account for 54 percent of mass shootings. (Duwe’s finding that non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of mass shooters is roughly in line with the white portion of the male population. White men make up roughly 31 percent of the overall U.S. population.) Duwe defines ""mass public shooting"" as an incident that occurs in the absence of other criminal activity, in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period. Mother Jones national affairs editor Mark Follman praised Duwe’s dataset as valuable, but he pushed back on the notion that they’d underreported attacks, saying that to the best of his recollection some of the shootings Duwe flagged as deserving to be included in Mother Jones' database did not fit their criteria. He also said that while most of Mother Jones’ data is initially culled from media reports, they have also relied on primary source documents, interviews with law enforcement and tips from the public about more obscure cases going back further in time. For more on how the group calculated the frequency of mass shootings, he pointed us to a 2014 Mother Jones article claiming the rate of mass shootings tripled since 2011. Newsweek said, ""White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group."" Newsweek based its claim on data from Mother Jones, which defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. Under this definition, Mother Jones found that non-Hispanic white men have been responsible for 54 percent of mass shootings since August 1982. Another tally, with a longer timeline and a different definition of mass shooting, found non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of these attacks. Under both definitions and datasets, white men have committed more mass shootings than any other ethnicity group. Newsweek's claim is literally accurate. But it's worth noting the imprecision of this data, and the percentage of mass shootings by white men is lower than their share of the male population, according to Mother Jones.  We rate this Mostly True.

Margaret Sanger, alleged white supremacist?
","The debate over confederate and white supremacist statues has ramped up in the past few months with the August attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the proposal to remove a confederate statue and the vandalization of a confederate statue in Springfield, Missouri, which prompted a Missouri state representative to call for hanging its vandal. Missouri State Sen. Andrew Koenig pointed attention away from confederate soldiers and toward a different historical figure: Margaret Sanger. Sanger was a birth control advocate in the early 1900s, set up birth control clinics and is recognized as one of the founders of Planned Parenthood. Koenig tweeted on Aug. 18, 2017, ""It’s time to remove any statue of Margaret Sanger who was a white suprematist (sic), spoke at kkk events & supported by democrats. #prolife"" It's time to remove any statue of Margaret Sanger who was a white suprematist, spoke at kkk events & supported by democrats. #prolife We contacted Koenig for clarification on his statement and received response from a Koenig staffer that ""the tweet speaks for itself and he (Koenig) stands behind it."" So we talked with experts in the fields of history, black studies and those with extensive knowledge on Sanger to verify just how many statues of Sanger there are and if she was in fact a white supremacist who spoke at KKK events. The most-well known statue of Sanger is in the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution; groups have demanded it be removed from the museum for years. The other documented statues of Sanger are in the Old South meeting house in Boston and the ""Knowledge is Power"" sculpture at Rowan University. There are also some other modern-day dedications to Sanger in the form of street signs, plaques and building names. In Koenig’s tweet, he states that Sanger spoke at Ku Klux Klan events. Sanger’s appearance at one KKK event is well documented. Sanger wrote about the event herself in her 1938 autobiography ""Margaret Sanger: an Autobiography."" In the book, Sanger writes that, ""I accepted an invitation to talk to the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver Lake, New Jersey, one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing."" But to say that Sanger spoke at KKK events, plural, is an exaggeration. The 1928 speech before the women’s group is the only documented case that our sources were aware of. And, according to Ellen Chesler, a Sanger biographer and senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute in New York, Sanger’s appearance at the event was less about race and more about reaching as many people as possible. ""It was to try to encourage a broad swath of ideological support for birth control at a time when birth control was immoral (and) illegal,"" Chesler said. This is where things get a little murky. It’s a bit subjective in this case, but several historians we spoke to said that Sanger was not a white supremacist. Jean Baker, a Sanger biographer, said Sanger was trying to bring birth control to both white and black women. Many of the race-related criticisms linked with Sanger come from her opening a clinic for birth control in Harlem. Her opening the Harlem clinic brought on allegations that she was sterilizing black women, but Baker said Sanger was not for compulsory sterilization. She was also later criticized for her work with the ""Negro Project,"" a controversial program that aimed to provide birth control services to black communities. According to a research organization at New York University specializing in Sanger, the program failed to speak with members of the black community before it was implemented and has been criticized as being racist. That said, the project was supported by black leaders of the time, including W.E.B. Du Bois, with whom Sanger worked closely. And although the project was later criticized, Sanger presented it in a fundraising request letter as an opportunity to help ""a group notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a ‘caste’ system that operates as an added weight upon their efforts to get a fair share of the better things in life."" What many argue as the sticking point for Sanger’s white supremacy was her belief in eugenics, which as defined by Merriam-Webster is ""a science that deals with the improvement (as by control of human mating) of hereditary qualities of a race or breed."" All of the historians we spoke with agreed that Sanger was a eugenicist, but most said that Sanger’s approach was not specific to race. Though eugenic policies have led to tragic outcomes such as the Holocaust, it’s important to remember that eugenics was widely supported by progressive groups during Sanger’s time, experts told us. ""Eugenics enjoyed tremendous broad support among secularist people who didn’t want sexuality and reproduction to be shrouded in the myth and mystery that organized religion had always placed them,"" Chesler said. Koenig said Margaret Sanger statues should be removed because Sanger was a white supremacist who ""spoke at KKK events."" Sanger spoke at one event for the women’s affiliate of the KKK, but it was to educate those women on birth control. And this was the only event she spoke at that any sources or documents pointed to. Sanger has been accused of white supremacy by many because of her belief in eugenics and her implementation of a birth control clinic in Harlem and other black communities. But historians point out this was because she wanted to share her belief in the importance of birth control with both white and black women. Koenig’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Berger’s office on Sept. 15 released a joint statement with state House Speaker Tim Moore. ""If Josh Stein’s partisan political bias has blinded him to the fact that our maps abide by the strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the entire country, then perhaps it’s best that he is personally recusing himself,"" the two legislative leaders said. Berger previously boasted of North Carolina’s standards in a Senate floor speech, according to a copy of the remarks on Berger’s website. The claim on Berger's website is more specific, claiming that North Carolina's rules are the strictest among states where legislatures draw election maps. That disclaimer wasn't mentioned in the statement about Stein. Federal judges on Sept. 19 described NC’s 2011 legislative maps as ""among the largest racial gerrymanders ever encountered by a federal court."" So Berger’s claim definitely raised eyebrows. But let’s set the maps aside for a moment. We wondered what anti-gerrymandering standards Berger was referring to, and whether they’re the ""strictest"" in the entire country. (We’re putting Berger on the Truth-O-Meter because he has been more visible on the issue and because it was his office that released the joint statement.) To support his claim, Berger points to the redistricting guidelines in the state Constitution and a court ruling from 2002 that gives specific instructions for how North Carolina should carry those guidelines out. The state Constitution says legislative districts ""shall represent, as nearly as may be, an equal number of inhabitants … Each representative district shall at all times consist of contiguous territory; No county shall be divided in the formation of a representative district."" The Stephenson vs. Bartlett ruling from 2002 — in which, as Berger points out, a judge scolded North Carolina over maps drawn by Democrats — further strengthens the compactness provision by encouraging the state to use a specific formula to create compact districts, Berger says. What is gerrymandering? The term ""gerrymandering"" was coined in 1812 after Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry, a Democratic-Republican, approved a redistricting map that diluted the influence of the opposing Federalist Party by placing many of its voters into a select few districts. Mapmakers drew districts with oblong shapes to increase the number of Democratic-Republican leaning districts. Gerry’s hometown district resembled a salamander, prompting a local newspaper editor to call it a ""gerrymander."" The term is now often associated with election maps that have oddly-shaped districts that stretch across multiple regions. North Carolina’s 12th Congressional District, for example, was for years known for boundaries that slithered like a sidewinder down Interstate 85 from Winston-Salem to Charlotte. But gerrymandering can occur in several forms – regardless of district shapes – such as when a district favors one political party over another, dilutes the influence of minorities or other groups, or blatantly protects or targets an incumbent. There are multiple strategies for trying to prevent gerrymandering. Each state is required to abide by the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws. Otherwise, states have some freedom in choosing who draws legislative districts, as well as how many rules they want their map-makers to follow. There’s no perfect system for preventing gerrymandering, said Wendy Underhill, director for elections and redistricting for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Government can make laws and impose a system of checks and balances – but that doesn’t mean mapmakers will follow them. ""It’s not clear what is better,"" Underhill said. ""How do you know what’s better than another? The guideline is, is it constitutional?"" Experts told PolitiFact some states do a better job than others of ensuring the map-drawing process is politically neutral. One way is by reducing the influence elected officials have over the map-drawing process. Who draws districts? Most states allow the legislature to draw legislative districts. This structure, as the Harvard Political Review noted, can lead to problems. ""Allowing partisan legislators to redraw their own districts creates a clear conflict of interest, and historically the temptation to game the system has proven too great to resist for the majority party,"" the review says. About 13 states use commissions. Depending on the state, the commission can include members of the legislature and/or play merely an advisory role. Six states use independent commissions that are run by people who aren’t elected officials but are chosen by the legislature and/or governor. Experts often point to Iowa, Arizona and California as having some of the best structures for creating fair legislative districts. Iowa’s legislature has final say over the maps. But its governor has veto power, the state’s geography makes it hard to gerrymander and the legislature relies heavily on Iowa’s Legislative Services Agency. In Arizona and California, the map-making process is placed in the hands of independent commissions. In each state, Republicans and Democrats have equal say in choosing commissioners. One study, pointed out by Berger’s office, suggests that maps drawn by independent commissions may offer as much protection to incumbents as maps drawn by legislatures. Additionally, experts like Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation cast doubt on the idea of commissions as impartial map-drawers. He doesn’t like that the commissions move the mapmaking process further from the traditional political arenas. ""When a legislature does redistricting and voters don't like what they've done, they can always vote the legislators out of office,"" von Spakovsky said. ""With these independent commissioners, if you don't like what they've done, you can’t vote them out of office."" Republicans control NC Debates over commissions aside, other legislatures do a better job of including both political parties and have more structural checks and balances than North Carolina does. Connecticut, for example, requires supermajorities for approval of maps. In most of the states where legislatures draw the maps, the governor is involved in the map-drawing process and may have veto power, according to Justin Levitt, a redistricting expert at Loyola University. Levitt, who started allaboutredistricting.org, expressed concern about North Carolina’s maps in the 2013 and 2015 gerrymandering cases. He signed what’s known as a ""friend-of-the-court"" brief with other election law professors and redistricting experts. In North Carolina, the legislature (where Republicans currently have a supermajority) draws the districts and the governor (currently a Democrat) doesn’t have veto power over the proposed legislative maps. In fact, excluding states with independent redistricting commissions, North Carolina is one of only five states — along with Connecticut, Florida, Maryland and Mississippi — where the governor has no veto over the maps, Levitt said. In North Carolina, the party that controls the most seats in the legislature can control the entire redistricting process. ""The biggest protection against gerrymandering are provisions that require that both parties have a role in approving maps,"" said Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel for the NYU School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. ""Single-party control is the biggest factor that correlates with extreme gerrymanders of the type that we've seen in North Carolina and Pennsylvania this decade,"" Li said. ""If you take away the ability of one party to make all the decisions, you are virtually guaranteed to eliminate gerrymandering."" Rules for drawing States can also prevent gerrymandering by adopting strict redistricting rules. Rules for mapmakers vary state-by-state. They regulate things like a district’s population, shape, partisan bent, inclusion of minorities and whether it favors an incumbent. This is where Berger’s argument comes in. He mostly focuses on the shape of districts, saying in online remarks and through his spokeswoman, Amy Auth, that the 2002 court decision prompted the General Assembly to incorporate strict metrics for measuring compactness. ""The criteria also included a mathematical standard for measuring compactness … a mathematical standard which had never been adopted before in North Carolina or in many other states,"" Auth said. Experts place value in compact districts because they keep communities – often identified by city or county boundaries – intact. They say it’s unfair to include communities with unique populations and problems into one voting bloc. The influence of voters in, say, a farming community might be greatly reduced if the community was included in a district where the majority of voters were from an urban area. Experts acknowledge that North Carolina’s mathematical standard for measuring compactness can help keep communities intact. However, they say North Carolina’s rules don’t necessarily set the state apart. For one, the mathematical compactness standard isn’t written into the state constitution. While the redistricting criteria adopted this year by the legislature says districts ""shall"" be contiguous and ""shall"" keep county groupings as required by the 2002 court case, the criteria says mapmakers ""may"" use the mathematical compactness equation ""as a guide."" And, like NC, other states use formulas to regulate district compactness and contiguity, according to Levitt, the Loyola professor. He said Arizona uses part of the same test for compactness, known as the Polsby-Popper test, as North Carolina uses. He says Michigan also uses a compactness formula that's a variant of the Reock test, which NC uses, whenever there are multiple districts within a city or township. Meanwhile, ""Iowa has three different formula for requiring that its districts be ‘reasonably compact,’ measured by comparison with regular polygons, by comparison of length and width, and by total perimeter,"" Levitt added. So let’s focus on state constitutions. North Carolina appears to be one of several states — including California, Oklahoma and Hawaii — where the state Constitution tells mapmakers to keep districts compact, populations even and counties as whole as possible. Charts published by the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Brennan Center for Justice, part of New York University’s School of Law, offer comparisons of each state’s map-drawing rules. Shapes aren’t everything District shapes may indicate whether an election map is gerrymandered, but they’re not the determining factor. Eric McGhee, a public policy fellow at University of California-Berkeley, said Berger may be right about North Carolina’s compactness formula being unique. But he emphasized that geographical guidelines alone aren’t enough to prevent gerrymandering. ""If you're just talking about shapes, there's truth to it,"" McGhee said. ""But if you’re saying there’s no advantage for either party, that's not necessarily true."" McGhee and Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor from the University of Chicago, created a new measure known as the ""efficiency gap"" -- the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast -- which is a focal point in the partisan gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that was argued at the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday. ""You can have pretty districts and still deliberately, severely, and durably disadvantage the other side,"" Stephanopoulos said. ""Your pretty districts are irrelevant to whether the map is a partisan gerrymander."" Nate Persily, a law professor at Stanford University, noted that other states, such as Florida, have constitutions that bar mapmakers from drawing districts to favor one party over another. ""The restrictions in the Florida initiative passed several years ago are stricter (than North Carolina) because they prevent drawing districts for the benefit of a party or incumbent,"" Persily wrote in an email. NC as ‘the strictest?’ PolitiFact found no evidence that North Carolina is considered among the states with the strictest anti-gerrymandering protections. Experts not only pointed to other states with similar standards, some scoffed at the notion that North Carolina’s protections might be among the nation’s strongest. Stephanopoulos called the claim ""preposterous."" He said, ""It's true enough that NC (like many states) requires preserving counties, but I don't know how one could possibly jump from that fact to the claim that NC has the country's strictest anti-gerrymandering requirements."" Theodore Arrington, professor emeritus of political science at UNC-Charlotte, also knocked Berger’s claim, noting that North Carolina ended up in court despite having compactness and contracting with prominent redistricting mapmaker Tom Hofeller. ""What restrictions there are in the law are easily worked around given the use of sophisticated GIS software and the use of an experienced map drawer hired by the majority,"" Arrington said.   And von Spakovsky, the Heritage Foundation expert, couldn’t say whether redistricting experts had ever considered North Carolina as having some of the strongest protections. ""It may hold a record for being before the Supreme Court more than any other state,"" von Spakovsky said. ""That doesn't mean the state standards aren’t good ones."" Our ruling Berger claimed in a press release that North Carolina has the strictest anti-gerrymandering protections in the entire country. North Carolina may have strict rules for grouping counties and a unique formula for measuring compactness. But the legislature didn’t require themselves – at least on paper – to use that compactness formula, and other states have similar rules for the shapes of districts. Furthermore, experts consider other states to do a better job of promoting fairness by mandating the inclusion of both parties or, in a handful of cases, strictly prohibiting mapmakers from favoring one party over another. Perhaps most tellingly: PolitiFact couldn’t find, and Berger’s office couldn’t point to, an expert or ranking system that puts North Carolina’s redistricting standards among the nation’s best. We rate this claim False.    ",/factchecks/2017/oct/05/phil-berger/berger-says-nc-has-strictest-anti-gerrymandering-s/
"['National', 'Guns', 'Steve Israel']","
Does US really spend research dollars on massages for rabbits but not gun violence?
","The mass shooting in Las Vegas prompted former Democratic Congressman Steve Israel of New York to write that these horrific events have little impact on public policy. In a New York Times op-ed, Israel walked through a list of shootings -- the murder of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, the June 2016 mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub, and others -- and noted that despite the hand-wringing after each one, nothing changed. Israel said Democrats were unable to enact reforms, including ""our attempts to rescind the infamous Dickey Amendment, which prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching the relationship between gun violence and public health."" ""The result?"" Israel wrote Oct. 2. ""The government can’t study gun violence but is spending $400,000 analyzing the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits."" There are two elements to sift through here: Does the Dickey Amendment block government research into gun violence and public health? And is Washington studying Swedish massage on rabbits? In 1996, with strong support from the National Rifle Association, Congress included an amendment by Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., in its omnibus spending bill. The amendment said ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" In the same bill, Congress pulled $2.8 million aimed at gun injury research and assigned it elsewhere in the CDC. Ever since, Washington and the CDC have steered clear of funding research that could run afoul of that amendment. Israel said the provision prevents government-funded studies of the ties between guns and public health, but plenty of people say the rule is not binding. Dickey himself joined with the former head of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Mark Rosenberg to challenge that long-held assumption. ""We believe strongly that funding for research into gun-violence prevention should be dramatically increased,"" they wrote in a 2016 public letter. ""We do not see the congressional language against using federal funds ‘to promote or advocate gun control’ as a barrier to this research."" An article on the Harvard Law Petrie-Flom Center blog argued that the amendment bars research aimed at promoting gun control and not all research. U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., echoed that point in a letter to the CDC, saying the meaning had been ""misconstrued."" But that belief had its own consequences. ""As a result, public health researchers at the CDC and other federal agencies have been discouraged from conducting scientific research on gun violence,"" Carper wrote March 17, 2016. ""Although the CDC self-directs a portion of its nearly $6.2 billion annual budget to a wide variety of intra- and extramural research, the CDC has been reluctant to devote funding to gun violence research without a specific appropriation from Congress."" Carper offered proof that the Dickey Amendment can co-exist with government gun violence studies. He noted that in 2015, the CDC assessed the causes of a rise in gun violence in Wilmington, Del. In general, the impact of the Dickey Amendment is more political than legal. Research could move forward, but without an explicit signoff from Congress, there’s been limited activity. After the 2012 Newtown slayings, President Barack Obama directed the CDC to conduct or fund research into the causes of gun violence. The impact was modest. ""As far as I can tell the CDC still correctly believes that gun research, or even mentioning guns, is too hot to handle,"" said director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center David Hemenway. Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research director Daniel Webster also said there’s been no new funding from CDC or the National Institutes of Health. Rosenberg told us, ""The research scientists at CDC are very anxious to do this research, but the recent directors of CDC have been willing to let this eminently solvable problem fester because they fear that the NRA will prod Congress into cutting public health programs that are viewed as more central and critical to CDC's mission."" As for the $400,000 spent on studying the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits that Israel mentioned, yes, the government did that. (The exact amount was closer to $387,000.) It gave the Ohio State University Sports Medicine Center money to build a small device that mimics the action of Swedish massage to see if the treatment reduced pain and inflammation. Rabbits were the test subjects. The treatment helped, by the way. Researchers found that with the right mix of force, duration and frequency, there was ""maximal recovery of muscle and joint function."" However, there’s an issue of timing with Israel’s statement. He said the government is currently spending money on this research. In fact, the study ended in 2014. Israel spokesman Harrison Feuer didn’t argue that detail. ""The larger point that Congressman Israel was looking to accurately make is that the government has funded studies into various endeavors that are less impactful than guns on public health,"" Feuer said. Israel said the Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC from researching the relationship between gun violence and public health. As a matter of law, it only prevents money going toward research aimed at promoting gun control. But as a matter of politics, that distinction is murky, and as a result, research has been limited. Israel’s point about Swedish massage on rabbits is off on the timing, but right on the substance. Israel’s statement has some technical flaws, but the broader thrust is accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/oct/05/steve-israel/former-democratic-congressman-compares-gun-violenc/
"['Public Service', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz, asked if he's interacting with Texans, says he's done 17 'town halls' in 2017
","He’s not Waldo. But could it be that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas doesn’t get personally grilled by constituents very often? Cruz, a Republican poised to seek re-election in 2018, hardly has a reputation of avoiding attention. After all, he ran for president shortly after making waves in Washington and held on as the last viable Republican alternate to Donald Trump. Regardless, the Houston lawyer was told during the 2017 Texas Tribune Festival about a Democratic challenger’s suggestion that Cruz hadn’t visited small Texas towns during the term he won in 2012. ""Do you do enough interaction with your constituents, Sen. Cruz?"" interviewer Evan Smith asked. Cruz replied: ""That is a huge part of the job. In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls."" We wondered about that. A town hall, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack later noted by email, is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members."" By that definition, Novack was nudging, town halls don’t have to be open to just anybody to ask anything. Indeed, when we looked, Merriam-Webster followed its definition with this sample sentence: ""Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on."" Cruz’s office lists 19 events Novack otherwise told us Cruz had held 19 town halls with Texas constituents in 2017, all ""organized by third parties who determined attendees, where"" the senator ""has taken unvetted questions from anyone in the crowd--at businesses, factories, chambers of commerce, and in public venues."" Novack said three of the gatherings--which would be 16 percent--""were open for the general public to register and attend."" Those, he said, were hosted by Concerned Veterans for America, a group that seeks to shift veterans hospitals from the federal government to a nonprofit corporation. Eleven of the 19 events were open to reporters, Novack said, four were aired live. Novack provided a chart specifying each event, its date and location, which shows three events were hosted by business chambers of commerce and a dozen were hosted by business groups or specific businesses. Individual businesses hosted 11 of the listed events that weren’t open to the general public, according to the chart. The businesses, including Division Laundry & Cleaners in San Antonio, Sysco Central Texas in New Braunfels and Igloo Products Corp. in Katy, had employee town halls with Cruz, the chart says. The veterans group, per the chart, hosted Cruz at July events in McKinney, Austin and Houston. On Aug. 24, the chart says, the Border Patrol union hosted the senator at an El Paso meeting. By email to our inquiry, a CVA spokesman, Jim Fellinger, told us each CVA event with Cruz was open to the public by registration, without the group screening out anybody who registered. ""Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions by submitting question cards that were handed out at the beginning of the event,"" Fellinger said. ""These events involved a discussion about bringing greater health care choice to the Department of Veterans Affairs."" Fellinger pointed us to video posts of the CVA events showing that Cruz each time took questions via a moderator, who recognized a few individuals to speak directly to Cruz. We didn’t spot any questions straying from health care. Events confirmed Next, we confirmed from press releases, news stories and video snippets that Cruz made the appearances described in the Novack-provided chart. Events in bold on the chart below were open to reporters, Phil Novack, a spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz, said. From our research, we added web links to news reports, videos and press releases about the events.

Ted Cruz, Sept. 28, 2017 We also asked Novack to share 2017 events Cruz had in Texas that were open to the public without registration--where anyone could ask a question on any topic. Novack replied by email: ""I appreciate your efforts to move the goalposts but we’ll stick with the premise of your original question to us"" about town halls. Experts evaluate Cruz's claim Next, we shared our annotated version of the chart by email with academic experts and requested appraisals of Cruz’s statement that he’d done 17 ""town halls."" Several deemed the claim inaccurate because most of the tallied events, especially meetings limited to business employees, weren’t forums open to all or likely to encourage wide-open questions and answers. A Duquesne University professor, Mike Dillon, replied: ""The term ‘town hall’ implies an event is open to the entire community and that competing ideas will be welcomed and discussed. It seems these town halls are open only to the people from the sections of ‘town’ that support Ted Cruz. These are scripted pseudo-events,"" Dillon wrote, ""not genuine public forums."" Ashley Trim, a Pepperdine University administrator, agreed that an ""employee town hall"" is far from the original use of the ""town hall"" term. Still, Trim told us, it’s not uncommon for employers to have or host Q&A sessions and call them town halls. But University of Alabama political scientist Joe Smith commented: ""Employees know that their employer has arranged for and endorsed the visit, and that therefore assertive questions are not welcome."" Smith elaborated: ""Since employees depend on these employers for their livelihoods, they are not likely to be fully candid in expressing their views.  Also, attendees at this sort of gathering won’t feel able to bring up any topics they want to.  Topics are likely to be limited to those related to the employer’s business area."" Smith said he’d rate the CVA-hosted events and possibly three chamber of commerce town halls as more wide-open. Mark Rozell, a George Mason University dean, called the listed events mostly ""quite different"" from traditional open town halls held by members of Congress. ""So it's apples and oranges here,"" Rozell said, adding: ""The senator's office cannot just slap the label ‘town hall’ on site visits to factories and companies and then claim he's holding a lot of town halls. That's misleading."" Rozell later agreed there persists ""no precise, legal definition of what constitutes a town hall. So I suppose the senator, or any other member, can play word games and try to label any gathering of a group of people a ‘town hall’ in an attempt to rebut criticism for holding too few town halls. But it doesn't pass the common sense test to call a factory visit or selected audience event a ‘town hall.’"" In contrast, Trim, who directs a Pepperdine public engagement institute, said Cruz’s use of the ""town hall"" term struck her as ""valid within the common use of the term ‘town hall’ in 21st century America."" After all, Trim reminded, town hall meetings have greatly evolved from their New England roots as community gatherings to set a hamlet’s course. Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist, said Cruz’s claim fits a ""minimalist"" definition of town hall in that they involved the senator speaking to, and fielding questions from, constituents from all walks of life across the state. But for a town hall ""maximalist,"" Jones wrote, none of Cruz’s events would qualify as a town hall ""because they were held in largely controlled settings and were not open to the general public"" with the exception of the veterans gatherings open to people registering ahead of time. John Gastil, a Penn State University professor, said that while the ""town hall"" term has lost clarity of definition over the years, he thinks Cruz’s claim was made to affirm his availability to the public. Gastil offered as keys to gauging the claim’s accuracy whether each event was open to the public and had an open agenda or one limited to a particular issue--and also whether members of the public at each event were allowed to speak and ask questions, with the senator proving responsive. Gastil conceded he didn’t have time to fact-check the entire Cruz-provided list of events. But on their face, he wrote, ""only a few seem worth checking further. Events held by and at private corporations wouldn't count as a town hall. Those sponsored by nongovernmental organizations have a better prospect of being town halls (e.g., chambers of commerce), but you'd need to see affirmative evidence"" that they were open to the public and had an open agenda. Cruz’s claim ""strikes me as dubious,"" Gastil summed up. ""Electeds do meet-and-greets with employees and other such things frequently, as part of their outreach, but it's disingenuous to call them ‘town halls.’"" Our ruling Cruz, asked if he interacts enough with constituents, said: ""In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls"" in Texas. The listed events Cruz attended from April through August 2017 demonstrate that the term ‘town hall’ can be stretched every which way, even to events not open to the public. All told, it looks to us like Cruz took questions at gatherings of selected constituents, mostly business employees--with the three veterans events open to members of the public who registered.

No, Celine Dion's son did not die in the Las Vegas shooting
","René-Charles Angélil, Celine Dion’s son, was not one of the people killed in the Las Vegas shooting, despite a fake news article that says he was. HoustonChronicle-tv.com posted an article claiming that ""Celine Dion’s 16-year-old Rene-Charles Angelil’s was among the 58 victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire late Sunday at a Las Vegas concert that left at least 58 people dead and 515 injured."" There is no indication that Angélil was even at the country music concert, let alone murdered there. HoustonChronicle-tv.com attributed to Dion a statement that it said she made on Oct. 2 about her son’s death: ""At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. René-Charles was the most kind-hearted, loving son I have ever seen."" However, Dion never said this. Instead, Heather Gulish Melton said it in a statement made to radio station WCYB about her husband, Sonny. Sonny and Heather Melton attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival together. There, Sonny was shot and killed as they were running away from the shooter at the concert. ""At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his,"" said Heather Gulish Melton. HoustonChronicle-tv.com changed the quote by switching the names from ""Sonny"" to ""René,"" altering the last part of the quote from ""loving man I have ever met,"" to ""loving son I have ever seen,"" and eliminating all together ""he saved my life and lost his."" Often, fake news sites use site names that are close to the name of an existing news publication to trick people into thinking it is legitimate.

Did budget director Mick Mulvaney flip-flop on higher deficits?
","President Donald Trump’s budget director raised eyebrows during a recent appearance on Fox News Sunday when he seemed to display a tolerance for bigger deficits. Mick Mulvaney’s comments came during a discussion of Trump’s tax plan, which, due to a variety of tax cuts, has been independently projected to add nearly $5.6 trillion to the federal debt over the next 20 years when compared to the current path of debt growth. Host Chris Wallace reminded Mulvaney about his tenure in the House, when Mulvaney often took a hard line on deficits and the debt. ""You were a deficit hawk,"" Wallace said. ""What happened, sir?"" After a brief back-and-forth about the groups that had projected the debt increase, Mulvaney responded, ""I've been very candid about this. We need to have new deficits because of that. We need to have the growth, Chris. ""If we simply look at this as being deficit-neutral, you're never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth. We really do believe that the tax code is what's holding back the American economy."" Was Mulvaney’s embrace of future deficits a flip-flop, as Wallace suggested? We put his position on the Flip-O-Meter, which describes whether someone’s stand has changed and is not meant as a value judgment. The evidence shows it has changed. Mulvaney’s remarks on Fox News Sunday clashed in tone and substance with a portion of his opening statement at his Senate confirmation hearing in January 2017. ""We can turn this economy, and this country around, but it will take tough decisions today in order to avoid impossible ones tomorrow,"" Mulvaney told the Senate Budget Committee. ""Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion. That number is so large as to defy description. ... I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This must include changing our government’s long-term fiscal path, which is unsustainable."" Mulvaney’s tough-on-debt remarks at his confirmation hearing were consistent with his position while in Congress since 2010. Mulvaney made clear shortly after taking office that he had little patience with rising debt. In January 2011, Mulvaney joined a faction of Republicans seeking to cut federal spending by $2.5 trillion over 10 years, significantly faster than the official party position. He then told Politico that President Barack Obama’s 2011-12 budget proposal was ""a joke. It’s hard to explain how detached from reality this is, to think that the country can spend another $1.6 trillion when it doesn’t have the means."" And in an interview with Fox News that April, host Alisyn Camerota asked Mulvaney whether he would vote to to raise the debt limit, which some had called ""Armageddon."" (Experts have agreed.) Mulvaney responded, ""It's no more Armageddon and no more catastrophic than what we're doing right now -- spending, what, $1.5 trillion we don't have this year."" During a debate over raising the debt ceiling, Mulvaney ended up authoring a budget bill dubbed ""Cut, Cap and Balance"" in 2011 that would have capped spending and added a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Mulvaney also held a series of ""Spending, Debt and Deficit"" town halls around his district in 2011, telling attendees at one of the gatherings, in the Sun City Carolina Lakes development, that ""the country’s debt is much worse than I ever thought. Forty-two cents of every dollar Americans spend is borrowed. Allowing this figure to increase compromises U.S. foreign policy."" In January 2013, Mulvaney sought across-the-board cuts in federal spending to offset $51 billion in proposed aid for those hit by Hurricane Sandy. While Mulvaney acknowledged the need for Sandy aid, he added, ""I believe we can provide that relief while finding ways to pay for it rather than adding to the nation's ballooning deficit."" In March 2015, as lawmakers were considering whether to find ways around budgetary spending caps, Mulvaney sided with sticking to the caps because ""deficits matter. Still,"" he told the Washington Examiner. The authors of the Almanac of American Politics 2016 noted Mulvaney’s strident position, writing, ""In his first term, he often bucked his party’s leadership in the name of fiscal discipline and voted against several spending bills backed by House Speaker John Boehner."" Asked about the discrepancy, OMB spokesman John Czwartacki said it stems from the change in the political dynamics of Washington. When Mulvaney was in Congress, there was a Democratic president and, for much of the period, a Democratic Senate, both of which preferred to stimulate the economy through spending. Mulvaney did not have the ""chance to support tax cuts with a chance of passage,"" so Mulvaney fought instead to decrease the deficit by challenging the Obama administration on spending, Czwartacki said. Since Trump’s election, Republicans have had unified control of Washington, so Mulvaney ""is now in a place where he can drive the idea of spending restraint while at the same time emphasizing the need for economic growth through deregulation, fairer trade, and of course tax cuts."" Independent budget experts still see a stark contrast between Mulvaney’s views then and now. At an Oct. 4 tax policy panel on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, PolitiFact asked panel members what they thought of Mulvaney’s Fox News Sunday comments. Marc Goldwein, the group’s senior vice president, said as recently as a few months ago, when Trump released his annual budget proposal, Mulvaney ""called for revenue-neutral tax reform,"" a sign that he came into his new position as ""one of the true fiscal hawks in the Trump administration."" However, he added, Mulvaney is ""now saying that we need big debt to grow the economy. I think that's backwards. If you got Congressman Mulvaney from two years ago to look at this statement and told him that it was Obama's OMB director (saying it), I can only imagine what he would say."" Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president at the MSL Group consulting firm, called Mulvaney’s switch ""hypocrisy"" and that ""there are no extenuating circumstances"" for it. Deficits from tax cuts should not get a pass if deficits from spending don’t, experts said. Both add to the debt. ""Our nation's debt situation makes deficits at the current and predicted level unsustainable,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""It doesn't matter if the deficit comes from a shortfall in revenue or increased discretionary or mandatory spending -- it all adds to the debt."" Asked about the additional deficits that are projected to accompany Trump’s tax proposal, Mulvaney said ""we need to have new deficits."" That’s a sharp contrast with his long record of statements, both as a member of Congress and as a nominee for OMB director, that deficits and debt are a major problem. We rate his recent statement a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2017/oct/04/mick-mulvaney/did-budget-director-mick-mulvaney-flip-flop-higher/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
John Cornyn says Obamacare premiums more than doubled in a few years
","John Cornyn of Texas accurately told a Texas constituent that residents of a third of U.S. counties are down to a single choice of insurance plans under the Obamacare law that Republicans vow to repeal. PolitiFact this year rated True a similar claim. According to a 2016 analysis, people trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only had one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties. Some 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people, could pick from a single insurance provider. But a Houston resident asked us to check another part of Cornyn’s September 2017 email to her, in which he said: ""Under the Affordable Care Act (P. L. 111-148), premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since"" 2013. We decided to put that declared increase to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. This claim, we found, stems from a reputable report, though the percentage cited by Cornyn merits explanatory clarifications. Cornyn cites HHS report At our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie traced the 105-percent figure to a five-page May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that average premiums charged in 2017 for health insurance policies sold to individuals shopping for coverage on the online federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, were 105 percent higher ""than average individual market premiums in 2013."" The report further says: ""The median state percent increase was 108%. The results are similar with those published by online health insurance broker eHealth, which found a 99% increase in premiums for plans purchased on their portal between 2013 and 2017."" See the undated eHealth state-by-state chart here. Nationally, the HHS report says, average ""monthly premiums increased from $232 in 2013 to $476 in 2017 and 62% of those states had 2017 exchange premiums at least double the 2013 average."" A chart in the report shows variations by state ranging from a low of 12 percent (New Jersey) to a high of 222 percent (Alabama). For Texas, the 2017 average premium for individual coverage purchased through the exchange, $404, was costing 82 percent more than the $222 market average price in the state in 2013 for an individual policy, the chart says. Report comes with conditions Experts we reached agreed premiums in 2017 were up quite a bit from 2013. They also noted contrasts to take into consideration. Michael Tanner, who studies health care reform for the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called HHS’s reported percentage and other escalation estimates ""in the ballpark."" By phone, Tanner went on: ""To try to pin it down to an exact percentage, that’s why we don’t (calculate) those numbers."" The Cornyn-cited HHS report itself offers clarifications, including: --A reminder that the Obamacare law imposed coverage expectations not fully in place until 2014. ""The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced many new regulations in the market for individual health insurance,"" the report says. ""These included a number of changes to the types of insurance products that could be offered and the rules insurers could use to vary prices based on customer risk,"" a reference to the Obamacare law’s mandate that insurers cover pre-existing conditions without imposing additional purchaser costs. ""In most states,"" the report says, ""these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans all else equal."" --""This analysis,"" the report says, ""does not account for the fact that the overall populations enrolling in the individual market in 2017 are different from those enrolling in 2013. Older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool now than in 2013. The changing mix of enrollees and adverse selection pressure has likely been a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market over this four-year period,"" the report says. --The research didn’t consider premium changes in states including California and New York that set up their own online exchanges. ""To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges,"" the report says, ""the national average increase may differ"" from the report’s results. --The report did not reach to checking premium changes on individual policies purchased privately, not through exchanges. In 2016, the report says, an HHS office estimated that the non-exchange individual market equaled 38 percent of total individual market enrollment. News accounts on the report similarly noted caveats. Prior to Obamacare, The Washington Post pointed out, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses and states varied the types of coverage insurers could offer. ""At the time,"" the newspaper said, ""health insurance could be sold with fewer medical benefits. This allowed for lower premiums for healthier people, but it also put coverage out of reach for millions of others."" A New York Times story on the report said ""the plans and the insurance pools of 2013 are not the same as those of 2017. Some plans may have been cheaper in 2013, but covered so little that they would now fail to meet the Congressional Budget Office’s definition of insurance."" Most significantly, the Times reported, the HHS ""report compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: those in the entire individual market in 2013 and those only in the federal exchange in 2017."" News reports also noted that the Obamacare law provides tax-credit subsidies to many insurance purchasers, driving down what they pay out of pocket--a point acknowledged in a report footnote. The Post’s story said: ""But middle-class individuals and families, who make more than $48,240 or ​$98,400, respectively, often take on the full increases."" Meantime, the Fact Checker at the Post provided additional perspective by noting the number of people directly affected by Obamacare premium increases breaks out to one-fourteenth the size of the employment-based health-insurance market. Experts suggest other considerations Tanner and Craig Palosky of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care, each noted a way to gauge changes in premiums since the Obamacare law took full effect is to look at changes in premiums for the benchmark ""silver"" health plan, the second-lowest-cost insurance offering sold on exchanges. Kaiser’s June 2017 analysis, taking into account plans available in each state to a 40-year-old, shows the 2017 average benchmark silver U.S. premium of $371 up 32 percent from $271 in 2014, the earliest year of comparison. In Texas, per the analysis, the 2017 average benchmark silver premium of $319 was up 29 percent from $248 in 2014. By email, Brandewie of Cornyn’s staff said we were venturing into an apples-to-oranges comparison in that Cornyn’s claim focused on all plans sold on exchanges in 39 states and started a year earlier. To our inquiry, Gail Wilensky, an economist who oversaw Medicaid and Medicare during President George H.W. Bush’s administration, said by phone that ""the ultimate qualification is you don’t know what would have happened to the premiums for this particular group in the absence of the Affordable Care Act. Having said that, we, of course, know the premiums have gone up a lot."" Experts conceded that under the Obamacare law, tax credits have eased what 80-plus percent of purchasers on the exchanges pay for coverage. Regardless, Wilensky and Tanner each said, that doesn’t make the premium increases less real; taxpayers pick up the costs of tax credits. Like Wilensky, Timothy Callaghan, a Texas A&M University expert on health policy, said a driver behind the difference in premiums is that insurance companies initially ""incorrectly priced their plans during the first year of exchange operations"" by expecting many more younger healthier adults to sign up in contrast to older individuals more likely to be ill--and then they had to adjust. Callaghan further suggested by email that ""at least some of the increase in premiums in the past year has been caused by the actions of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress and their efforts to repeal and replace the ACA and undermine it bureaucratically."" We also asked the experts to look over data activist Charles Gaba’s June 2017 web post, in the wake of the HHS report, estimating that across all 50 states, 2017 average monthly individual premiums on policies sold on exchanges were 84 percent greater than 2013 premiums on policies sold on the private market. Wilensky expressed doubts about figures Gaba relied on for New York and California while she, Tanner and Callaghan each said even an 84 percent rise over a few years seems large. Brandewie said he couldn’t speak to Gaba’s accuracy. Our ruling Cornyn told a constituent that under the Obamacare law, health insurance ""premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since"" 2013. This claim traces to an admittedly incomplete federal analysis of changes in 39 states that didn’t endeavor to research premium changes in 11 states that run their own insurance exchanges. It’s also worth clarifying that Obamacare policies must cover pre-existing conditions without penalty and they generally provide more benefits than what was required in most states in 2013—surely factors figuring into increased premiums. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['Crime', 'Government Regulation', 'Guns', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Was the Las Vegas mass shooting the 273rd this year? Or the seventh? Or somewhere in between?
","In an email released to reporters on Oct. 3, 2017, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin lamented the mass shooting in Las Vegas two days earlier, calling it ""the 273rd mass shooting this year."" There’s no question it was a massacre: A lone gunman perched high in a hotel suite killed 59 people, including a Wisconsin native, who had gathered for an outdoor country music concert. More than 500 people were injured. But have there really been 273 mass shootings in the United States so far in 2017, as the Wisconsin Democrat says? What a ‘mass shooting’ is SFGate.com, which is associated with the San Francisco Chronicle, reported that on the morning after the Las Vegas incident, many news media and social media users were calling it the 273rd mass shooting of the year. But the actual number depends on the source being cited. Here’s a look at two counts as of Oct. 3, 2017 that reveal two extremes: Source Mass shooting definition Count of 2017 mass shootings Gun Violence Archive, nonprofit organization Four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter. 273 Mother Jones, liberal magazine A single attack in a public place in which three or more victims were killed.  7 Baldwin was relying on the Gun Violence Archive figure, her campaign told us. (The first-term senator is up for re-election in 2018.) For an idea of how broadly the archive views mass shootings, here are the circumstances of the two incidents that occurred before the Las Vegas shooting, according to news reports: A shooting in Memphis, Tenn., was believed to be the result of someone bringing a gun to a fight. A shooting in Lawrence, Kan., occurred in a street during a fight involving a number of people. There are other definitions of mass shootings, as well, including some that have produced much lower counts. The non-profit Everytown for Gun Safety -- counting incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter -- said there were 156 mass shootings from 2009 through 2016. That’s an average of 19.5 per year. The Washington Post counted 131 events in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (or two shooters in three cases), dating back to the University of Texas tower killings in 1966. That’s an average of less than three mass shootings per year. The Post didn’t count gang killings, shootings that began as other crimes such as robberies, and killings that involved only the shooter’s family. The point is: There is no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. Indeed, we’ve run into this before. Almost exactly two years before Baldwin made her claim, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., said that at that point in 2015 there had been 294 mass shootings. That number also came from the Gun Violence Archive. PolitiFact Florida rated her statement Half True, saying she relied on an overly broad definition of what most people would consider a mass shooting, counting people shot in bar fights along with victims of school shootings. Our rating Baldwin says the Las Vegas shooting was the ""273rd mass shooting"" in the United States so far in 2017. She cites a source that arrived at that figure using a very broad definition of mass shooting. Other sources use narrower definitions that yield much lower counts. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. Note: This item was changed on Oct. 5, 2017 to indicate that, beginning in 2013, Mother Jones changed its definition of mass shooting to three or more victims, rather than four. This change does not affect the rating. div class='artembed'>",/factchecks/2017/oct/04/tammy-baldwin/was-las-vegas-mass-shooting-273rd-year-or-seventh-/

Democrats say Republican presidential candidates did not mention middle class or education in debate
","
To illustrate that the Republican presidential candidates are out of touch with ordinary Americans, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney cited two things that he said the candidates failed to mention during a two-hour CNN debate from New Hampshire: education and the middle class.

Flying to Puerto Rico on Air Force One on June 14, 2011, Carney told reporters:
 
""I was struck by the fact that over the course of two hours, the phrase ‘middle class’ and the word ‘education’ did not pass anyone’s lips that I heard, which was striking to me because the middle class is obviously, to our mind, the primary focus of everything that we do in terms of the economic policies we pursue and the concerns we have. The middle class not only suffered tremendously during the great recession and is suffering as we emerge from it, but was under a great deal of pressure even prior to the recession. While incomes were growing rapidly under the previous administration and the economy was expanding, middle-class incomes were flat, stagnant, and even dropping. So that was one observation.

""And another is that . . . as the president talks about a lot, education could be the key, the defining element of whether or not the United States of America can compete globally in the 21st century -- compete and win.  We think it’s a high, high priority.  And I was struck by the absence of attention to that very key issue last night.""

Carney's comment was a Democratic talking point on the day after the debate. The Democratic National Committee issued a Web video called  ""What in the world are they talking about?"" that made the same point.

So were Carney and the DNC right? We checked the debate transcript and found that Carney is technically correct that the words ""middle class"" and ""education"" did not appear in the 21,798-word debate. But it's important to look more broadly and see whether the candidates used other words with the same meaning.

And indeed, we found the candidates made several references to middle-income Americans — they just used different words:

● Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty referred to America’s ""middle-income and modest-income people"" when WMUR political reporter Josh McElveen questioned him on his plan to ""right the housing ship.""

""Well, the first thing we need to do is get the government out of crony capitalism,"" Pawlenty said. ""We have this alliance between big government, big unions and certain big bailout businesses. And as Congressman Paul said a few minutes ago, we had politicians in Congress trying to micromanage the housing market, and they created a bubble and they created the mess. And now we have all these innocent bystanders, the good people of the United States of America, many middle-income and modest-income people, who've been devastated by this.""

●  Pawlenty also mentioned ""blue-collar communities"" as he cited his upbringing in a ""meat packing"" and  ""manufacturing"" town with a father who worked as a ""Teamster truck driver"" for much of his life.

Speaking about a plan to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S., Pawlenty said, ""I understand what it's like to see the blue-collar communities and the struggles that they've had when manufacturing leaves. So I've seen that firsthand. But No. 1, we've got to have fair trade, and what's going on right now is not fair.""

●  We counted three references to the middle class by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who spoke of the ""broad middle of America.""

""I always am from Pennsylvania,"" Santorum said. ""We still make things there, and I represented the Steel Valley of Pittsburgh when I was in the Congress. And what I learned from growing up in Butler, Pa., steel town is that the broad middle of America was a broad middle of America when we had lots of manufacturing here because that's how the wealth from those who create the jobs get down. … We want to encourage people to set up jobs here in America. Take that R&D credit, make it permanent, take that innovation and then invest that money here to create that broad middle of America and have that wealth really trickle down.""

On education, however, Carney was correct. We couldn't find any reference to the subject during the debate.

Still, it's important to note that the candidates didn't choose the topics for questions. That was done by CNN host John King, New Hampshire journalists and voters. They chose not to ask about education.

In fact, King started the debate reminding candidates of the rules, saying, ""We've also asked the candidates to answer the questions that they're asked, rather than the question they might have wished to be asked.""

Our ruling

Carney was technically correct that education and the middle class were not mentioned in the debate. But several times candidates made references to middle-income people using other terms. And they never got asked about education.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'New Hampshire 2012', 'Tim Pawlenty']","
Tim Pawlenty says President Obama is going to break promise on deficit and will double it
","
In a recent interview on New Hampshire Now, a talk show on WKXL-AM in Concord, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said President Barack Obama’s first term was littered with broken promises.

""People won’t be duped twice. He made huge promises to the country -- 10, 15 big promises and he’s broken or left unfulfilled almost every one of them,"" Pawlenty said. ""Just a couple of quick examples: He said in 2009 early, ‘I will reduce the deficit in half by the end of my first term.’ Instead he’s going to multiply it by two, three, four or five.""

We raised our eyebrows.

So we checked in with Alex Conant, spokesman for the Pawlenty campaign, and asked him to provide some supporting evidence.

Conant cited a comment by Obama in February 2009 at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit in which  Obama said he was ""pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""

So Pawlenty is right about the first part.

As for the second part of the statement, Conant pointed us to an estimate of federal debt from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that does official budget estimates.

""If you look at this CBO projection of federal debt, (Table 1, Page 2), you'll see that the publicly held debt will double with even the most generous revenue projections,"" Conant wrote. ""If revenues continue to stagnate, and businesses do not grow, the debt will grow by even larger margins.""

But Pawlenty said ""deficit"" -- not ""debt."" They are not the same thing. We inquired again but never heard back from Conant.

Here's how they're different:

The deficit is the amount by which the government’s spending exceeds its revenue for a given period, usually one year. The debt is the accumulation of the prior deficits.

There are actually two major ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt owed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money that is owed to beneficiaries in the future.

The ""debt held by the public,"" which Conant referenced, currently represents about two-thirds of the $14.4 trillion gross federal debt.

If you're measuring the deficit, Pawlenty’s right that Obama hasn't yet fulfilled his promise -- at least according to the current projections for the end of his four-year term. The annual deficit was $1.4 trillion when he took office in 2009. In CBO's most recent projections from April, the deficit is projected to be $1.16 trillion in fiscal year 2012 and $901 billion in 2013.  

So he's got to cut a lot more from the budget in the next two years to achieve the goal.

But it was incorrect for Pawlenty to say the deficit will more than double. In fact, it is on track to go down, although possibly not as much as Obama promised.

And even if Pawlenty meant ""debt,"" the facts don't support his claim. The publicly held debt is projected to continue growing -- from the $7.5 trillion in fiscal year 2009 to $12.66 trillion in 2013, which is less than double.

Daniel Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that Pawlenty may have erred by using fiscal year 2008 as a starting point. The debt and deficit both roughly double if he were comparing 2008 to 2012.

The debt also doubles by the end of 2013 if you use, as a baseline, Obama's first full day in office -- Jan. 21, 2009 -- when the publicly held debt was $6.3 trillion.

But even then, Pawlenty’s multipliers of ""three, four or five"" would be gross exaggerations.

Marc Goldwein, an economist at the centrist New America Foundation, said it’s more important to take in the big picture, rather a small sample of years, for analysis.

""The baseline should be -- what do we need to do to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path,"" Goldwein said. ""We can manipulate numbers however we want to show how deficits change, but the important thing is what deficits and debt are and will be.""

Our ruling

There is some truth to Pawlenty’s claim: Obama made a pledge to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. And he’s falling short so far.

But there’s a lot more of Pawlenty's statement that’s wrong. The deficit, which should not be confused with the debt, is projected to decrease, not increase. And even if Pawlenty mixed up the words or used the incorrect fiscal year as a baseline, Pawlenty’s suggestion that the deficit could multiply by ""two, three, four or five"" is not supported by the facts.

Virginia GOP says Phil Puckett voted against sending EPA a message
","
The Republican Party of Virginia says state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell, is whistling and cheering as President Barack Obama kills the coal industry.  

The RPV’s attack comes on the heels of warnings from American Electric Power, one of the nation’s largest utilities, that new air quality rules from the Environmental Protection Agency could force the company to shutter as many as 20 coal-fired plants and fire hundreds of employees.     

That’s added fuel to the fire in coal-rich Southwest Virginia, which is served by Applachian Power, an AEP subsidiary. The state GOP has declared war on the EPA for imposing ""job-killing"" regulations and is calling Puckett ""President Obama’s lead cheerleader in Southwest Virginia.""

""He talks a good game on his campaign website, but when Southwest Virginia needed Puckett to stand up for coal jobs, Puckett stood up for President Obama,"" a recent release from the RPV says. ""Phil voted NO on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far, not once, but twice.""

We wondered whether Puckett really did vote twice to back the EPA.

To support the claim, the state GOP points to two identical pieces of legislation from this year’s General Assembly session -- one introduced in the House, the other in the Senate.

The measures, however, make no mention of the EPA or coal.

The GOP release refers to two resolutions calling for a ""repeal amendment"" that were killed in the Democrat-controlled state Senate. The measures called for a U.S. constitutional amendment that would nullify any federal law or regulation at the vote of two-thirds of all the state legislatures.

What does that have to do with coal jobs? Not a lot, other than the fact that if the repeal amendment survived an extremely difficult path to national ratification, then one of the countless regulations two-thirds of the state legislatures could theoretically agree to repeal might be an EPA rule affecting the coal industry.

To date, North Dakota has the only state legislature that has endorsed the repeal amendment, according to Raegan Weber, director of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization promoting the constitutional change.

Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the state GOP, said the intent of the repeal amendment was to alert Washington it is encroaching on states’ rights. That’s different from his party’s claim that the amendment's purpose was ""sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far"" in regulating the coal industry.

The next problem is that Puckett technically did not vote against the resolution twice -- or even once.

The measure introduced on the Senate side, sponsored by Sen. Ryan T. McDougle, R-Hanover, was killed by a seven-member subcommittee of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee. Puckett is not a member of the subcommittee and did not participate in its vote.

Puckett is a member, however, of the full 15-member Privileges and Elections Committee. Its chairman -- Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax -- declined a procedural request by GOP senators to resurrect the resolution and allow it to be considered by the full committee.  When Republicans objected, Puckett voted with other Democrats to uphold Howell’s authority to set the docket.

The House version of the resolution, sponsored by Del. James M. LeMunyon, R-Fairfax, was left in the same committee without ever coming up for a vote.  

Shipley conceded to us that Puckett didn’t cast a single vote directly on the repeal amendment, but insisted the Democrat ""did everything he could to prevent it from being brought to the floor.""    

Now, here’s the kicker: Puckett actually sponsored a resolution this year that urged Congress to stop the same type of environmental regulations the state GOP accuses him of supporting.

Puckett’s resolution died in the Senate Rules Committee. It would have urged Congress to  adopt legislation ""prohibiting EPA by any means necessary from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, including if necessary defunding EPA greenhouse gas regulatory activities."" The measure also asked for at least a two-year moratorium on new air quality rules.  

So let’s look back.

The state GOP says Puckett betrayed his Southwest Virginia constituents by voting twice against sending the EPA a message that new regulations would harm the coal industry.

Here’s the reality: The repeal amendment, which the Republicans use as the basis for the claim, has no direct tie to the EPA or coal. It could just as easily apply to any federal law or regulation in existence, from health care reform to playground safety requirements. Puckett didn’t vote twice against the amendment; he didn’t vote on it at all. Lastly, Puckett actually introduced a resolution seeking to achieve the very goal the GOP accuses him of opposing.

This one’s more than a stretch, it’s absurd. Pants on Fire!  ",/factchecks/2011/jun/24/republican-party-virginia/virginia-gop-says-phil-puckett-voted-against-sendi/

Ad claims Rep. Vern Buchanan's 'old business' illegally funneled campaign cash
","
When it comes to illegal campaign cash, the wheels of justice move slowly. So when a May 2011 court filing brought fresh attention to old claims involving illegal campaign contributions to U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, Democrats jumped, airing a radio ad in his Florida district. 
""Congressman Vern Buchanan. His old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election,"" the narrator of the ad says. ""Tell Buchanan to come clean.""

The ad ran from June 13-17 and was paid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. It relied on news articles about a lawsuit filed by the Federal Election Commission against a business Buchanan once owned, the DCCC said.

The 'old business' 
Buchanan, 60, is a wealthy Republican from Longboat Key serving his third term in Congress representing Florida's 13th Congressional District. He built his wealth founding a chain of print shop franchises in Michigan, leaving for Florida in the 1980s as the chain struggled and investing in a range of new businesses, including Florida auto dealerships.

One of those dealerships is at the heart of this claim.

Buchanan had owned a majority interest in Hyundai of North Jacksonville, the FEC says, when his business partner Sam Kazran arranged for dealership employees and relatives to donate to the Vern Buchanan for Congress committee, then be reimbursed by the business. This went on during the 2006 and 2008 campaigns, the FEC says.

(We should note that the date Buchanan legally parted ways with the dealership is a matter of disagreement. The FEC says Buchanan owned 51 percent of the dealership until Kazran completed his purchase of Buchanan's stake to become the sole owner in 2008 — after the suspect contributions were made. Buchanan spokeswoman Sally Tibbetts says Buchanan sold the dealership to Kazran in 2005, putting more distance between the congressman and the illegal contributions.)

What's the big deal with reimbursing contributions? It violates federal election law, which says ""(n)o person shall make a contribution in the name of another person."" The Federal Election Campaign Act also limits how much a single contributor may give to candidates' campaign committees. Funneling cash through employees would have made it possible for the dealership to bust through that limit.

The Buchanan campaign said they brought the questionable contributions to the attention of the FEC, which then launched the investigation. We can't independently confirm if that's the case, because the FEC does not comment on open cases. However, we found no evidence to the contrary. 
The commission combined the complaint with one filed in 2008 by a Washington group and two employees of a Venice dealership, which you can read more about here. 
The FEC investigated, finding probable cause to believe that the Hyundai dealership and Kazran had illegally reimbursed $67,900 in campaign contributions, but it didn't go after Buchanan.

Instead, it's now seeking $67,900 in fines from Kazran.

Kazran, for his part, admits reimbursing campaign contributions, but told the Bradenton Herald he did it at Buchanan's direction. ""I've been caught in this political nightmare that I have nothing to do with,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. But he failed to reach an agreement with the Federal Election Commission — and failed to respond to the complaint on behalf of Hyundai North Jacksonville, which is no longer in business. That means facts in the case stand uncontested. So the commission voted to sue him to collect the fines, asking a judge for a default judgement.

The FEC told the U.S. District Court that the dealership ""illegally spent $67,900 in an attempt to influence an election for Congress, presumably believing this to be a worthwhile investment."" 
And that's the May suit that prompted stories in a WSJ.com blog, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and the Bradenton Herald that the DCCC cited as it released the script for its Florida radio ad. Jesse Ferguson, speaking on behalf of the committee, the official campaign arm of the Democrats in the U.S. House, used partial quotes from the lawsuit when he said, ""The FEC is seeking fines from a business that Vern Buchanan owned at the time for an 'extensive and ongoing scheme' of 'secret illegal contributions' to help his campaign and we’re going to make sure his constituents know about it.""

Buchanan's response

What does Buchanan's team say? That the FEC has cleared Buchanan himself — so the ad linking the behavior of Kazran and his dealership to the congressman is ""misleading and dishonest.""

""It creates the false impression that Vern Buchanan has done something wrong when in fact he has been fully exonerated by the FEC,"" said Sally Tibbetts, his spokeswoman.

A related news release that says Buchanan ""has been completely exonerated"" is the subject of its own fact-check, and we found the claim to be Barely True. But we'll summarize here by saying that what little information is available so far from the FEC doesn't fully clear Buchanan — though it does mean the commission won't take any further action against him in the case.

Information's limited because the case isn't yet closed, so confidentiality rules apply.

That means for the purposes of this fact-check, we'll rely on what's in the public record — information that the DCCC had access to when it scripted its ad.

The ruling

That ad starts by naming the congressman, then says his ""old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election."" 

The FEC and Buchanan's team agree that he owned a significant stake until at least 2005, when suspect campaign contributions started. The FEC says the dealership reimbursed more than $60,000 in contributions. The money went to Buchanan's main campaign committee, and the FEC says the money was spent ""in an attempt to influence an election for Congress.""

What is contested is Buchanan's role in the scheme.

The FEC has said it will take no further action against him, closing his file. But it didn't go further to declare it had no probable cause to believe he was involved — which would have better supported his team's claim that he's been cleared. Meanwhile, his former business partner still says Buchanan put him up to it, and says he plans another lawsuit to prove it.

While we think the DCCC could have done a better job noting it was Buchanan who turned in the illegal contributions, we rate this ad Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/24/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ad-claims-rep-vern-buchanans-old-business-illegall/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Florida', 'Vern Buchanan']","
Rep. Vern Buchanan 'exonerated' by FEC, his spokeswoman says
","
It's tough to be a campaign under scrutiny for illegal campaign contributions — investigations can take years, and even when they're over, true vindication is hard to come by. 
And while the investigations grind on, any findings by the Federal Election Commission stay confidential until the entire case is closed, making it harder to clear your candidate in the public eye.

That's the situation faced by the team for U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Longboat Key, as it battles attacks by Democrats such as a June 13, 2011, radio ad saying ""his old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election."" (We've rated the ad Mostly True in a separate fact-check.)

But in a helpful turn of events, Buchanan's attorney recently managed to get approval to release two letters from the commission in a still-open case that say when it comes to Buchanan, the FEC will ""take no further action.""

That prompted Sally Tibbetts, Buchanan's spokeswoman, to put out a news release June 13, 2011, declaring the ""FEC Vindicates Buchanan."" 

""The Congressman has been completely exonerated, as we knew he would be,"" it read. ""These phony accusations have been exposed as dishonest and partisan attacks.""

We wondered: Do the FEC letters really leave Buchanan ""completely exonerated""?

The complaints

The letters, from an attorney for the commission to Buchanan attorney Chris DeLacy, address a ""matter under review,"" MUR 6054, which includes separate complaints that campaign contributions were illegally reimbursed by two Buchanan car dealerships. Buchanan had ownership stakes in Venice Nissan Dodge and Hyundai of North Jacksonville as at least some of those contributions were made, though he no longer owns either one. 

The basic allegation is that dealership employees, business partners and their family members made contributions to Buchanan's 2006 and 2008 campaigns, then were reimbursed by the companies.

At Venice Nissan Dodge, two employees joined a complaint filed by a Washington group in 2008 against Buchanan and the dealership with the Federal Election Commission. Carlo Bell, the dealership's then-finance director, said the company's general manager pulled him into an office in 2005 with two co-workers and told them they needed to contribute to Buchanan's campaign for Congress. If they wrote campaign checks for $1,000, the company would reimburse them in cash. Bell, who said he was afraid he might lose his job if he refused, got the cash and wrote a check. 

David Padilla, a finance manager at Venice Nissan Dodge, said he was told by another manager in 2005 that Buchanan needed campaign contributions, and ""that anyone who made a contribution would get his money back plus additional compensation."" He said he was told that all of the managers were being asked to contribute, but he refused.

In the case of Hyundai of North Jacksonville, the Buchanan campaign says it reported illegal contributions to the FEC. The commission went after the dealership and Sam Kazran, a minority owner who later bought out Buchanan's stake, for reimbursing employees and family members. The FEC now seeks a $67,900 fine from Kazran for the dealership's role. Whether Buchanan himself was involved in the illegal reimbursements is a point of dispute. Kazran says he was. Buchanan's team says he wasn't, and that the letters from the FEC show he has been ""completely exonerated.""

The first letter, from February 2011, says that the FEC had found ""reason to believe"" that Buchanan had violated federal law by knowingly receiving contributions that had been reimbursed by Kazran and Hyundai of North Jacksonville. But after considering circumstances, it had decided to ""take no further action and close the file"" as it related to Buchanan. But the letter provided no reason as to why. 
The second letter, from March 2011, addresses ""other allegations against Rep. Buchanan that were made in the complaint in this matter."" The commission hadn't found ""reason to believe"" that Buchanan violated the law in those instances, and its decision to ""take no further action and close the file"" applied to them, as well. While the specific subject of the second letter isn't clear, Buchanan's team says the letter refers to the Venice Nissan Dodge complaint.

'No further action'

So, what does it mean that the commission won't take further action? Is that the same as being exonerated? Does it clear Buchanan from accusation or blame?

First a little background on the Federal Election Commission. No more than three of its six members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can belong to the same political party. But four votes are required for the commission to act. That's supposed to ""encourage bipartisan decisions."" It also means the commission frequently splits along party lines and doesn't take action.

But it did get at least four votes to move forward against Buchanan in the Hyundai of North Jacksonville case, finding ""reason to believe"" he knowingly received tainted contributions.
Larry Noble, general counsel to the FEC from 1987-2000, says that was the first chance the commission had to say there wasn't sufficient evidence — it could have said it had ""no reason to believe"" a violation occurred. 

Instead, the commission moved forward with a ""reason to believe"" finding, meaning it found the allegation credible enough for a full investigation. After the investigation, if it had decided there wasn't enough evidence, it could have found ""no probable cause to believe"" a violation took place. 
If the FEC had found either ""no reason to believe"" a violation occurred, or, later, ""no probable cause to believe"" a violation took place, Noble said that would have been akin to exonerating Buchanan. 
But it didn't. Instead, the FEC informed the Buchanan team it would ""take no further action and close the file,"" which it could do for any number of reasons, including the difficulty or cost of determining whether a violation occurred or the likelihood the statue of limitations would pass, Noble said. 
And those reasons won't become clearer until the FEC releases the case file after it closes the matter for the rest of the people named in the complaints. In fact, very little is clear until that happens, other than that the commission decided to close Buchanan's file without declaring whether it believed he did or didn't violate the law.

""'Take no further action' means they're not going to do anything else,"" said Mary Brandenberger, spokeswoman for the FEC. ""It doesn't mean anything further than that.""

Still unknown

Buchanan's attorney, Chris DeLacy of Holland & Knight, says that no matter what term is used, ""the indisputable fact is the FEC reviewed the merits of the case and voted affirmatively and decisively to take no further action and close the file against Congressman Buchanan.""

That may be true. But any details that may further clear Buchanan won't be independently verifiable until the full case is closed.

""We cannot comment on it at all till it's closed,"" Brandenberger said. ""And I don't have record of it being closed.""

Melanie Sloan, the attorney behind the group that brought the Venice Nissan Dodge complaint against Buchanan in 2008, says, ""I wouldn't use the word 'exonerated.'""

""It's premature to make too many conclusions about what the FEC's going to find here,"" she said. ""On Vern being exonerated, you just have to take his lawyers' word for it. ... There is nowhere where anyone with any authority has said that Vern Buchanan has been exonerated.""

The ruling

Tibbetts said the FEC has vindicated the congressman, taunting Democrats as she declared he had been ""completely exonerated."" But a review of FEC procedure and discussion with an attorney who was general counsel to the FEC for more than a decade shows that's not exactly the case. 

It's true that the FEC has said it won't take any further action against Buchanan. And there may indeed be strong evidence in his favor in the confidential FEC case file — but that's not yet available. All we know now is that the FEC declined to make its strongest finding, that there was no probable cause to believe Buchanan violated the law.

In other words, Tibbetts' statement contained an element of truth, but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/24/vern-buchanan/rep-vern-buchanan-exonerated-fec-spokeswoman-says/
"['Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says he didn’t cut Medicaid, but instead added $1.2 billion
","
Gov. Scott Walker got a friendly reception during a June 21 turn on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box,"" but he was asked to respond to the notion that his budget was balanced on the backs of the poor and schoolchildren.

In an exchange with Walker, the show’s co-anchor Becky Quick noted that critics say Walker cut Medicaid-funded health programs by $500 million and public education by $800 million.

The Republican governor disagreed, calling the critiques ""Madison math"" -- his shorthand for common-sense-defying arithmetic.

""This budget actually adds $1.2 billion more for Medicaid, to make sure the neediest, the poorest of the poor, seniors, needy families and children are the ones taken care of,"" Walker responded.

He also said his education cuts were offset by employee benefit savings his budget allowed.

But even as he spoke, the budget was on Walker’s desk after legislators gave approval to a 2011-’13 Medicaid plan that Walker’s own budget documents had pledged would ""reduce expenditures by over $500 million in the next biennium.""

That sounds like an open and shut case.

But, as you might expect, there is more to this story.

It’s as much a case of ""Medicaid math"" as ""Madison math.""  

To understand both, you need to remember that Medicaid costs are driven by many factors, from how many people are eligible for the program to the cost of treatment and what recipients are asked to contribute in co-pays. So, when spending adjustments are made, it does not necessarily change the benefits to the individuals.

In this case, projections called for a need to spend at least $1.8 billion more in the two-year budget to keep the program running as it currently does. The Medicaid funding gap amplified the size of the overall state deficit Walker said he was facing, but ultimately he did not put all of the money into his plan.

The budget Walker introduced did increase baseline spending for Medicaid by $1.2 billion.

But it also made cuts -- though little is yet known about their impact on the state-federal program that cares for low-income families with children under 19, the elderly, disabled and others.

Charles Morgan, the top expert on health services at the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, explains it this way:

""They first fully funded it but then reduced it. It depends on what you are comparing it to, the gross funding or the base. Total funding is up, but there is a funding reduction.""

Many Medicaid-funded health services are an entitlement, and enrollment soared as the economy cratered.

Therefore, the normal ""cost to continue"" the program would have required an increase of $1.8 billion to $2 billion compared to the $1.2 billion that Walker and legislators added, according to Fiscal Bureau figures, outside analysts and our own calculations. Part of the challenge was that federal stimulus funds for Medicaid have dried up.

In the end, Walker, trying to plug that shortfall, won approval from the Legislature for his Health Services Department to find $466 million in budget savings over two years through as-yet-unidentified changes. Many of the changes likely will need approval by federal authorities.

Some other states have made or proposed dramatic across-the-board cuts, limited enrollment or dropped certain medical procedures.

But it’s not clear yet whether Wisconsin’s actions will go that far, or rely on more cost-sharing by clients, tighter enrollment rules, less money for hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, or other moves.

The details will determine which group views the moves as ""cuts.""

The impact of one Wisconsin cost-saving move is clear, however: The budget approved by legislators caps enrollment in Family Care, the long-term care program that gives seniors options rather than nursing-home living. That could save $265 million by blocking new enrollments.

Dennis Smith, Walker’s Health Services chief, put it this way after Walker’s budget came out: ""Despite a historic 23% increase to the Department's budget, Wisconsin's Medicaid program still faces a serious fiscal challenge over the next two years as we identify over $500 million in cost savings. To meet our goals, and balance the Medicaid budget, we have to find ways to be more efficient and cut costs.""

In future years, those savings would continue to grow, totaling $1.2 billion in all funds by fiscal year 2016-’17, according to the governor’s original budget plan, which was adjusted only modestly by legislators.

How have similar moves been portrayed in the past?

Two years ago, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walker’s predecessor, made a very similar move -- increasing the Medicaid budget but trimming $600 million from the ""cost to continue"" price tag. His top budget administrator bluntly called it  ""cuts of over $600 million to Medicaid.""

Media accounts called it ""cost cutting,"" as did some major actors in the budget drama, such as the Wisconsin Medical Society.

We give a lot of weight to the independent Fiscal Bureau and history.

But there are well-informed partisan voices on this topic -- and previous PolitiFact rulings on a somewhat similar claim to consider as well.

As we have already seen, ""cost cutting"" did not equal a real-dollar decrease in Walker’s Medicaid budget proposal. (The 2011-’13 budget, as adjusted by lawmakers, was sent to the governor’s desk  on June 16, 2011.)

George Lightbourn, a former top administration official under two Republican governors, said the bottom line was the program would receive a big funding increase, a remarkable reality in a budget that made actual deep cuts in other areas.

It could only be a ""cut"" if the state had been in a position to take a business-as-usual approach to the budget -- and it wasn’t, said Lightbourn, president of the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute.

Jon Peacock, a Medicaid expert at a liberal advocacy group, the Wisconsin Budget Project, agreed with the Fiscal Bureau -- he said the two statements could accurately co-exist.

Peacock said it was appropriate for Walker to use realistic projections of the Medicaid ""cost to continue"" in his budget -- and appropriate for his budget to be judged on not fully funding that.

""As an analogy, imagine that Social Security spending was going to increase by 5 percent because the number of people eligible was increasing 2 percent and the average benefit per person was increasing 3 percent (tied to the cost of living),"" Peacock wrote. ""If the President or Congress decided to provide a total spending increase of 1 percent, by cutting the benefits by 1 percent, rather than increasing them 3 percent -- lawmakers could correctly argue that they were increasing spending, and seniors could correctly argue that the program was being cut.""

Finally, we turned to PolitiFact National and PolitiFact state sites, which have dealt with a claims regarding a similar program, Medicare, which like Medicaid is an entitlement program.

PolitiFact consistently has rated as Barely True Republican claims that federal health care reforms supported by President Barack Obama and Democrats ""cut"" Medicare.

Here was PolitiFact’s rationale: ""It's important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase...""

It’s not a totally clean comparison to the Wisconsin situation: Walker’s cut is in two years, not 10, and it’s not clear yet here whether benefits will be cut to get the savings. But it’s in the ballpark.

Let’s get to the bottom line.

In the wake of his controversial budget proposals, Walker co-hosted a CNBC program and disagreed with a critique that he made cuts to the state’s Medicaid program. Walker ridiculed the idea as ""Madison math.""

Experts are not united on this one, but Wisconsin’s nonpartisan official budget scorekeeper thinks both the cuts and the increase are accurate claims. Media accounts have portrayed past moves as cuts, as well. What’s more, when Walker introduced his budget, he also described the changes as cuts.

So, Walker made a generally accurate statement about the increase, but by dismissing the talk of cuts he left out a lot of context and important details on his budget move.

That’s a Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/24/scott-walker/governor-scott-walker-says-critics-are-wrong-he-cu/
"['Rhode Island', 'City Government', 'Public Safety', 'Paul Doughty']","
Firefighter union chief says Providence has one of the busiest fire departments for its size in the U.S.
","
When layoffs were looming in the Providence Fire Department, Paul Doughty, the president of the firefighters' union, went on the WPRI ""Newsmakers"" program June 12.  He talked about the changes that cutbacks would entail, and whether a different type of schedule -- 24 hours on the job followed by a 48-hour break -- would pose a threat to public safety.

Doughty said the cutbacks could significantly expand a firefighter's workweek in a city where mandatory overtime is already common.

""Providence is one of the busiest fire departments for its relative size in the country and in terms of volume of runs,"" he said. ""The rescues are some of the busiest. ... Engine 3 out of downtown is usually in the top 10 percent across the country.""

The threat of layoffs apparently has been averted now that the union and the city have tentatively agreed on contract modifications that include several union concessions, including giving up a planned pay raise and reducing paid vacation time.

But the question still intrigued us: Is Providence's department really one of the busiest for its size? We had a burning desire to know whether that was true or just an attempt by the union to discourage cutbacks.

We called Doughty, who said his source was the trade publication Firehouse Magazine, which has been collecting city-by-city data on firefighter activity for 30 years as part of its National Run Survey.

The latest data available online, from 2009, includes information supplied by 287 departments in 47 states, the District of Columbia and six Canadian provinces. But Providence is not included. (The magazine looks at a different combinations of departments from year to year.)

So he took us back to 2008's listing, which has data for Providence and 256 other U.S. departments. In those rankings, the city does look busy, with the 10th busiest engine (Engine 3, with 4,809 runs per year), the 13th busiest station (15,626 runs from the downtown station per year) and the 31st busiest ladder truck (Ladder 1 with 2,160 runs).

It also ranked 50th out of 257 in total calls, with 42,989 runs that year, or 118 calls to the fire department per day. (To confirm that volume, we randomly picked seven days in 2008 and asked for copies of the department's logs. The number of runs ranged from 98 to 131 calls per day. Average for those days: 112.)

But those are just raw numbers, and  don’t take into consideration the size of population of the area being served or whether the station and equipment statistics reflect having only one station in an exceptionally busy area.

The citywide number of calls would be the best indicator of activity. With 178,000 residents, according to the latest U.S. Census numbers, that would amount to 242 calls per 1,000 residents.

Firehouse Magazine is a trade publication that doesn't double check the numbers it receives from fire departments. So we tried to get independent numbers from other sources.

When we contacted the National Fire Data Center, part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, statistician Gayle Kelch told us that the center couldn't break down the numbers by department because they wouldn't include rescue calls or false alarms.

""Each city or town would have to do their own data runs,"" she said. Instead, the center had a nationwide estimate of 26.5 million fire department calls for all types of calls for 2009.  (With a U.S. population of 307 million in July 2009, that would break down to 86 calls per 1,000 people. Providence’s reported volume is three times higher.)

As part of our search, we also contacted the Insurance Services Office, a private company that collects fire data for insurance purposes. ""ISO does not compile data related to this topic. It is not aware of any other organization that may track such information about fire departments, but suggests reaching out to Firehouse Magazine or Fire Chief Magazine,"" a spokeswoman responded in an e-mail.

So we went back to Firehouse and its lists from 2008 (where Providence is mentioned) and 2009 (to see where Providence would fit into the list). ""They're recognized as a reputable journal in the fire service,"" said Ken Willette, manager of the public fire protection division of the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), based in Quincy, Mass.

We were concerned that the number of runs, because they are self-reported, might be inflated by multiple pieces of equipment going to the same call. For example, a fire truck will always show up at a rescue call in addition to a rescue wagon, a widespread practice that's been in place in Providence for over 30 years because it provides an extra set of hands and a fire truck can often get to the scene first, said Providence assistant chief Michael Dillon.

That practice is common, Firehouse editor in chief Harvey Eisner told us. Thomas Warren, assistant chief for administration in the Providence department, said that in Providence, if more than one piece of apparatus goes to the scene of a fire or heart attack, that only counts as one run.)

With those assurances, we took the total number of runs for all U.S. departments -- a combination of fire calls, emergency medical service calls and false alarms -- and factored them in with population statistics supplied by the departments, compiled by Firehouse Magazine, and published on a separate list. Warren supplied the number of runs made in Providence in 2009.

For 2009, Providence, with 41,553 calls, ranked as the 14th busiest community, with 233 runs per thousand.

Providence was behind Chicago (244 runs per thousand), Newport, R.I. (246), San Francisco (274), St. Louis (283) and Hartford (389), but the department was busier than larger cities such as Fort Lauderdale (231), Miami (209), Nashville (208), Cincinnati (196), Dayton (194), Orlando (191), Memphis (186), New York City (184), and every Massachusetts community, including Boston (124).

In the 2008 Firehouse survey, when we adjusted for the populations of the areas covered, Providence ranked 15th.

And when we combined the data for both years to include statistics for nearly 400 departments, Providence and Newport were virtually tied for the 20th busiest departments on the list.

""It's a very large volume of runs,"" Doughty.

Why so many calls?

Providence's Dillon said it’s because residents have confidence that the department can handle emergencies quickly and efficiently, so they may be quicker to call for help than in other communities. Willette of the NFPA said that in addition to the confidence factor, Providence provides medical and rescue services that some departments don't. A higher call volume could also be due to the need to provide more mutual aid to neighboring communities that have cut back on their fire services.

It may also reflect the presence of more fire suppression systems that are in place, especially following The Station nightclub fire.  ""You cannot underestimate the effect of that in a department's operation,"" he said.

In summary, we think that being ranked in the top 20 when it comes to the number of calls per person qualifies Providence as one of the busiest departments in the United States.

We rate Doughty's statement True.

Gingrich says large percent of Social Security payments are government waste
","Pundits may have decided Newt Gingrich’s bid for president is on life-support. But the former U.S. House Speaker hasn’t gotten the memo.

Days after his campaign staff quit en masse, the Republican was back to skewering the media, liberals and government ineptitude on ""The Neal Boortz Radio Show"" on Atlanta’s AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB.  

The June 15 interview made news because Gingrich railed against an ABC News investigation that called into question cash transactions between his charity and one of his for-profit companies.

But PolitiFact Georgia reporters took note because true to wonkish form, Gingrich peppered his arguments with factoids. He used this one to argue the government is inept:

""They reported this morning that every 10th dollar spent by the Social Security Administration on its program for the poor -- every 10th dollar -- is waste, or fraud. They can’t validate that the people should have gotten it. That’s about $8 billion a year, just in that one program,"" Gingrich told Boortz.

That sounds like one big, wasteful problem. Is Gingrich right?

Waste in entitlement programs has been much on Gingirch’s mind lately. Two days earlier during the Republican presidential primary debate in Manchester, N.H., he said ""we think you can save $70 billion to $120 billion in Medicare and Medicaid annually by not paying crooks.""

The Washington Post’s Fact Checker column disputed the claim, noting that while there were about $70 million in ""improper"" payments in those programs, that doesn’t mean the money is going to ""crooks.""  

The federal definition of ""improper"" includes non-criminal mistakes such as underpayment of benefits as well as fraud or cases of insufficient documentation.  

Gingrich’s statement to Boortz was different. He didn’t mention ""crooks"" and used different figures. We took a look.

An Associated Press story posted Tuesday on AJC.com gave us the scoop.

Bear with us. The explanation involves an alphabet soup of government programs.

In July 2010, Congress passed legislation aiming to reduce improper payments to beneficiaries by $50 billion in 2012 for a variety of programs, including some run by the Social Security Administration.

The Social Security Administration, or SSA, administers two ""High-Error Programs,"" programs that have a track record for making improper payments. One is the Supplemental Security Income program, or SSI. It helps the elderly, blind, and disabled by giving them cash for necessities such as food, clothing and housing.

Patrick P. O’Carroll, Jr., the SSA’s inspector general, testified June 14 before a joint subcommittee of the U.S. House Ways and Means committee to discuss the Administration’s progress.

O’Carroll said that overall, the SSA made an estimated $6.5 billion in overpayments and $1.5 billion in underpayments in fiscal year 2009, according to the AP article. This means it made $8 billion in improper payments.

SSI issued an estimated $4 billion in overpayments and $800 million in underpayments, the AP article said. Since SSI paid out $48.3 billion in payments, about 10 percent of SSI payments were improper.

This means that according to the AP, Gingrich was right about the overpayment rate for Social Security’s program for the poor.

But he was wrong about the amount of SSI’s improper payments. The overall amount of improper payments by the SSA is $8 billion, but Gingrich was talking about SSI, SSA’s program for the poor.

This initiative accounted for 60 percent of the Administration’s total improper payments -- $4.8 billion.

We checked the AP figures against a copy of O’Carroll’s statement and data from PaymentAccuracy.gov, the website of the federal payment accuracy improvement program. The AP’s numbers checked out.

So, as Gingrich said, ""every tenth dollar"" paid out by the Social Security Administration on its program for the poor is ""waste, or fraud,"" or ""they can’t validate that the people should have gotten it.""  But he’s wrong about the amount of improper payments.

Still, Gingrich’s broader point holds true. SSI makes billions of dollars in improper payments. Dollar-wise, they account for a majority of the Social Security Administration’s mistakes. We therefore give him a Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84e46582-0caa-4e67-817f-61134e3ea461",/factchecks/2011/jun/24/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-large-percent-social-security-paymen/

Will Multnomah County’s food plan make it harder for people to eat and pay for their food of choice?
","
A tweet came to our attention recently, courtesy of the lively left-leaning and right-leaning twitterati who use the #orpol hashtag. ORLibertyGal tweeted: ""Multnomah County plans to interfere with your food delivery. Oh goodie http://bit.ly/jFhTe5""

Minutes later, BlueOregon contributor T.A. Barnhart responded: ""onus on fearmongers to provide FACTS. | RT @ORlibertygal: MultCo plans to interfere w/food delivery. http://bit.ly/jFhTe5 #orpol #orleg""

Facts? We love facts. Multnomah County wants to mess with food delivery? We better look into this. (Thanks Barnhart!)

It turns out that the tweet stemmed from an online post at Red County, a website for conservative politicos. Gresham resident and Tea Party activist Roxanne Ross accused Multnomah County of using its 2009 food action plan ""to artificially inflate the market"" for organic local produce while dampening the availability of cheaper mass produced foods.

The county,writes Ross, ""clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice."" Some specifics cited by Ross (in our own words):   


Naturally, we had to study the plan for ourselves. We wondered if the county had visions of turning itself into a self-sustaining village with high taxes on out-of-county products. We turned to the Multnomah Food Action Plan 2025 and found that it’s not quite what Ross claims. The plan is aspirational and fuzzy, with backers saying it should lead to more collaboration and focus. From the document itself:

""The 15-year action plan offers four action areas containing 16 goals and 65 communitywide collaborative actions for local government, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith communities, and learning institutions. This Plan also offers 40 actions for individual community members whose daily choices or lack of choices in what to eat, where to shop, and how to become an advocate for change greatly influence our community.""

That’s a lot of partnerships and a lot of emphasis on individual choice. And frankly, it all sounds very pie-in-the-sky to PolitiFact Oregon. But we digress. Simply put, we bet that by 2025, shoppers will still be able to buy low-priced meats and potato chips from Fred Meyer.

David Austin, spokesman for the county, agrees. He described the food plan as a promotional tool, a way to encourage residents and businesses to think of healthy food choices. (For example, sustainability staff just held its second ""food summit"" in June.) In 15 years, he said, as a result of the plan there might be healthier food choices in food-deprived neighborhoods currently served by convenience stores. Or, he said, there might be more community gardens with neighbors donating produce to the Oregon Food Bank.

""Multnomah County is not going to put a sign on every corner and demand that no chips are sold here. At the same time, we want to make sure all of our residents have equal access to healthy food,"" he said.

In an email, Ross said she’s not saying the county will halt importation of food. But she insists that the ""market manipulations"" cited in the plan, such as zoning for urban farms, will protect local foods, meaning that ""for those people who prefer meat and food from outside the county, it will mean increased cost for food.""

Since we’re not economists, we decided to ask Portland State University environmental economics professor David Ervin how a fuzzy food plan could result in higher prices for meat and other foods from outside the county. He was puzzled.

""Unless there’s regulations restricting the entry of food, of those foods she’s talking about, or there’s some additional costs imposed on those foods, then there’s not good economic logic on why their costs would go up,"" he said. ""Those prices are set in national markets.""  

Ervin explains that if more people choose to eat local food, that ""will reduce the demand for those other imported foods, but I doubt that would have much of a price effect because we’re such a small part of the market.""

Just to make absolutely sure, we called the Cascade Policy Institute, a libertarian think tank that loves all things free market and hates government meddling. We got an earful from John Charles, the institute’s president and CEO, on both the meaninglessness of the plan, as well as its inconsistencies, and its poor writing. But the bottom line, he said, is that government already has the tools to encourage food choice: get rid of restrictive codes and high business taxes.

""Assuming that eating locally grown food is desirable -- I don’t care whether people eat imported food, it is not a function of government to even care... ,"" he said. ""... Assuming there’s some reason why local is good, we can accomplish that by relaxing some regulations, and giving producers and consumers the maximum choices.""

We asked Charles specifically whether the county’s plan would result in higher prices of meat and non-local foods. He said no.

In the end, we don’t see how encouraging urban gardening and healthy eating and supporting a communal kitchen and small farmers will lead to higher prices for meat and bulk foods. There’s no disruption to the free flow of goods in and out of the market. In fact, those points -- price and disruption -- are ridiculous.

We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says one-quarter of residents qualify for emergency food in 70 of Ohio's 88 counties
","
A report by the Government Accountability Office on potential duplication of federal programs led the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to call a hearing on welfare spending.

Two Ohio congressmen took lead roles that showed contrasting approaches to the subject.

Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican whose 4th District includes a broad swath of conservative countryside in the central and western Ohio, accurately characterized the GAO report when he said it ""concluded that not enough is known about the effectiveness of many of these programs.""

Jordan has introduced H.R. 1167, the Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would change eligibility requirements and reduce funding.

The committee's ranking member, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, whose heavily Democratic 10th District includes part of Cleveland and several urban suburbs, said the GAO report ""did not find waste, fraud and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs. It does not recommend delivering fewer benefits to those in need.""

Jordan asked if Kucinich agreed the government should be able to determine if programs are effective and make sure they do not ""encourage the wrong kind of behavior.""

Kucinich replied that the issues can be examined ""while we keep feeding people"" during a time of continuing need. And he offered statistics to illustrate that need.

""Seventy of Ohio's 88 counties now have more than 25 percent of their residents eligible for emergency food,"" he said.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take check that claim out.

Kucinich's office referred us to recent reports from the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies and the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks, using data from the Ohio Department of Development.

The starting point for the figure is poverty, defined in the OACAA report as a state of deprivation in which a person or family lacks sufficient resources for a minimally adequate standard of living. The 2009 federal poverty threshold for a family of four with two children was a household  income of $21,756.

Higher up the scale of economic well-being is the self-sufficiency level, or the income that a household needs to meet its basic needs without public or private assistance.

That is generally considered to be about 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and is a ceiling for eligibility for food assistance programs.

The Ohio Department of Development data shows that in 70 of the state's 88 counties, at least 25 percent of their citizens live  at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level -- and are therefore eligible for emergency food.

The level drops below 20 percent in only three counties -- Medina, Delaware and Warren -- but tops 45 percent in five: Adams, Meigs, Morgan, Pike and Vinton. In rural Morgan County, 51 percent of residents live below the self-sufficiency level.

The data shows that Kucinich’s statement is both accurate and not lacking significant details. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates as True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-one-quarter-residents-qua/

Sen. Loretta Weinberg claims New Jersey Network is the only station covering New Jersey government

","
Sen. Loretta Weinberg may need to do some more channel surfing for news about government in New Jersey.

After Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in early June to turn over control of the 40-year-old New Jersey Network to New York-based television station WNET, Democratic legislators called for a closer examination of the proposal. Assembly Democrats on Thursday rejected Christie's plans, however. As a result, the fate of the public broadcasting network is in limbo.

Weinberg, a Democrat who represents Bergen County, raised concerns about the deal in a June 6 column on Bluejersey.com, calling it ""a give-away of one of our state's greatest assets.""

Using bold and italics in the following statement, Weinberg went on to say: ""NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government. Their public affairs and interview shows as well as the nightly news will be no longer. We still don't have the detail on this, and once the state report is officially released, the Legislature will have 15 days to respond or the ‘give-away’ is considered approved.""

The only news station covering New Jersey government? It didn’t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Weinberg was wrong.

We found stories about New Jersey government on the websites of television stations based in the New York and Philadelphia areas. Some stories were written by the Associated Press, but others were covered by reporters working for those stations or their affiliates.

Secaucus-based My9 News also runs a weekly political talk show called ""New Jersey Now."" In fact, Weinberg appeared on that program on Feb. 6 to discuss the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission.

News 12 New Jersey provides news coverage for cable subscribers in northern and central parts of the state, as well as its weekly show, ""Power and Politics,"" and its monthly ""Capital Hotseat"" interviews.

While other stations cover the metropolitan areas, NJN and News 12 are comparable in the amount of time devoted to New Jersey news, according to Lawrence Londino, chair of the Department of Broadcasting at Montclair State University.

""It’s certainly not the only game in town,"" said Londino, referring to NJN.

Weinberg acknowledged in a phone interview that other stations provide news coverage and said she could have been more articulate in her statement. She maintained that NJN is the only network providing regular nightly news shows focused on New Jersey government.

""I knew what was in my mind,"" said Weinberg, before referring to News 12 New Jersey: ""Whatever news they cover is very sporadic.""

Janice Selinger, the acting executive director at NJN, also argued that News 12’s coverage is not comparable to NJN.

""Other people do cover state government. They don’t cover it as extensively as we do and they don’t cover it for the whole state,"" Selinger said. ""We’re not just there when the story breaks. We’re there every day.""

The NJN News broadcast appears at three regular times each weekday night, and other news programs such as ""On the Record"" appear on weekends. News 12 New Jersey runs a live broadcast for a total of nine and a half hours each weekday, and then two live newscasts on Saturday and Sunday.

In a statement, News 12 New Jersey General Manager and News Director Randal Stanley responded to Weinberg’s comments.

""With a full-time news bureau at the State Capitol, News 12 is dedicated to providing New Jersey’s communities and its local residents with daily coverage of events and issues on state government and other important topics,"" according to the statement. ""In addition, News 12's election season includes live coverage on election night, a schedule of political debates, live coverage of the State of the State address, plus inaugurations, town hall meetings, and more.""

Let’s review:

Weinberg said NJN is the ""only news station which covers New Jersey government,"" but other television stations clearly cover government in the Garden State through news and political talk shows.

Weinberg later praised the extent of coverage provided by NJN, but her statement was not about comparing coverage among different news stations. She said NJN was the only one doing the job, and that’s why we rate her statement False.

Jon Huntsman said 1 in 6 defense dollars are spent on Afghanistan
","
Jon Huntsman announced June 21, 2011 that he is running for the Republican nomination for president. Huntsman was previously governor of Utah but also recently served in the Obama administration as ambassador to China.

How is it that Huntsman is running against a president he served? Huntsman has said several times that when a president asks him to serve his country, he serves. He expanded on the point on Wednesday on MSNBC's Morning Joe. 

""The president is a good man. He's earnest, he's hard working, he's a great family man,"" Huntsman said. ""But I got to say on the economy, we're not near where we should be, and internationally we're in places I believe we should not be, spending one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan. And I'm here to tell you that America's future is not going to be won or lost in the prairies of Afghanistan. It's going to be won or lost based upon our ability to compete in the 21st century crowds of Pacific.""

We were interested in fact-checking Huntsman's statement, which he repeated in other interviews, that one out of every six Defense Department dollars goes to Afghanistan. 

To do that, we turned to government budget data and an array of defense spending policy experts. It turns out there are a number of ways to slice up the defense budget, and you get slightly different numbers depending on which you choose. You could consider the current fiscal year, 2011, or the one that starts in October, which is 2012. You could also consider authorizations (the legal limits for spending) or appropriations (the money actually approved within the legal limits).

We contacted the Huntsman campaign for its source, and it referred us to testimony from Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank. Haass testified at a U.S. Senate hearing in May; he opposed continuing the war in Afghanistan, which he said had now evolved into a war of choice. 

""Just to be clear, wars of choice are not wrong per se. But before undertaking one, it is essential to demonstrate that the likely benefits of using military force will outweigh the costs and produce better results at less cost than other policies. Afghanistan does not meet these tests. It is not a major terrorist haven, and it should not be assumed it will again become one even if the Taliban make inroads,"" said Haass in his written testimony. 

Haass said that if terrorists renewed their activities in Afghanistan, the United States could respond as it has done in countries such as Yemen and Somalia. 

""At the macro or global level, Afghanistan is simply absorbing more economic, military, human, diplomatic and political resources of every sort than it warrants. The $110 to $120 billion annual price tag -- one out of every six to seven dollars this country spends on defense -- is unjustifiable given the budget crisis we face and the need for military (especially air and naval) modernization,"" Haass said. 

We ran the one-in-six number by several defense spending experts who said Huntsman was either correct or close to it. 

""He is correct. In the current fiscal year (fiscal year 2011), Congress has appropriated a total of $689 billion for the Department of Defense. Of that, $113.5 billion is for operations in Afghanistan,"" said Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, via e-mail.

Another expert, Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said you could choose to exclude money that goes to the Energy Department’s nuclear weapons budget as well as money that goes to military construction, and then the Afghanistan spending would be between one sixth and one fifth of Defense Department dollars.

Huntsman said we're spending ""one out of every six Defense Department dollars on Afghanistan."" Budget numbers and defense spending experts said that's a reasonable extrapolation, though there are slightly different ways to calculate it as a little more or a little less. Still, Huntsman's number is a legitimate calculation. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/23/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-said-1-6-defense-dollars-are-spent-af/

Gimenez group says Robaina highest paid mayor in Florida
","
In the June 28, 2011 Miami-Dade mayor's race, the opposing camps have tried to portray the other side as living high off the government hog.

PolitiFact Florida has been watching the tit-for-tat, and trying to keep all of the tax dollars straight.

Previously we explored a claim from supporters of former Hialeah Mayor Julio Robaina, who said former Miami-Dade County Commissioner Carlos Gimenez ""drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense"" like recalled Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Alvarez. We found the claim Half True, noting the deals for Gimenez and Alvarez were not identical, and that taxpayer-funded cars are a common perk for South Florida politicos.

Now, we're checking a claim from the other side. A group called Common Sense Now is airing an ad criticizing Robaina, and specifically, his salary while Hialeah mayor.

""Say no to Mayor Julio Robaina ... No to Mayor Robaina because he has the highest salary among Florida mayors. More than $260,000,"" the ad claims (as $50 bills float around the screen no less). ""More than our governor and U.S. Senators.""

Is that true?

Hialeah has what's considered a strong mayor, in that the mayor acts like a city manager and serves as the executive of government.

The position comes with a full-time salary, two expense accounts and access to city vehicles. The current city budget includes a salary of $155,243, a $75,019 expense account and an additional $41,616 for travel/per diem, or $271,878. (The city did cut its health insurance cost to Robaina, because Robaina gave back 7 percent of his base salary as an extra insurance contribution. That brings his total compensation to around the $260,000 cited in the ad).

The ad, as you can tell, is including the expense account and travel budget in calculating Robaina's salary.

But that's not altogether inappropriate.

Unlike most situations, Robaina got the full amount of the expense account and travel budget whether or not he spent that money on travel or city expenses. In other words, Robaina did not have to submit receipts to get reimbursed for expenses, travel or per diem. ""Expenses"" could go toward anything he needs for city business, and whatever he didn't spend he could keep.

""He doesn't have to show us what he uses it for,"" said Hialeah finance director Vivian Parks. ""The intention is the mayor has to do a lot of city business on his own time and he doesn't get reimbursed for any of that. This is to cover his travel, his meals and his expenses for all city-related business.""

Check registers from 2010 and 2011 confirm that payments for salary, expenses and travel all were directly deposited to Robaina. And all three sources of money would be considered income for tax purposes.

What's difficult to figure out, of course, is how much of that money Robaina spent on city business (which he could deduct from his income for tax purposes), and how much he pocketed as what most people would classify as salary. We called Robaina, but did not hear back.

No matter, the setup -- or at least the size of the expense accounts -- appears unique within Florida government.

We contacted several other large cities and asked about annual salaries and expenses for mayors. We couldn't find any in excess of $260,000. In Orlando, St. Petersburg, Tampa and Jacksonsville -- all strong mayor positions -- mayors made anywhere from $150,000 to $175,000. But none had expense accounts like Robaina. The mayors in those cities are reimbursed for city expenses.

As for Robaina earning more than Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Senators, it again comes down to the expenses. Senators earn $174,000 in salary and travel expenses come out of an office budget. Florida's governor is paid $130,273 (though Scott is declining a salary) though most of a governor's expenses, including housing, are paid for by the state.

We also checked the position of Miami-Dade mayor, the job Robaina wants.

County spokeswoman Vanessa Santana-Penate said the mayor's last annual salary was about $233,000 with around an additional $80,000 in benefits. But not all of those benefits are income, and not all of them come up front like they do in Hialeah.

So it's clear on salary vs. salary, Alvarez made more. But when you factor in the expenses, it becomes more difficult to say.

J.C. Planas, an attorney for the Gimenez campaign told us it's right to include Robaina's expense accounts as salary because he ""does not submit invoices or receipts to get reimbursed, but simply collects the amount regardless of whether he spends it or not.""

But Planas' explanation ignores the fact that the some of that money was being used to conduct city business -- even though Robaina did not have to turn in receipts.

To recap, the Common Sense Now add said Robaina ""has the highest salary among Florida mayors. More than $260,000."" Robaina had a salary of around $155,000 -- which is in line with many strong mayors in Florida, though less than Miami-Dade mayor. But Robaina received more than $105,000 for expenses, which he got whether or not he used the money on business. Other mayors in Florida are reimbursed for their expenses. We don't know how much of that money was used for legitimate expenses. So it's not fair to include all of that money as straight ""salary.""

NRSC claims Sen. Sherrod Brown voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare
","
When Sen. Sherrod Brown spoke at a Youngstown senior center against a Republican proposal to convert Medicare to a voucher system, the National Republican Senatorial Committee had a ready response.

The NRSC revised and reissued a three-day-old news release that targeted virtually identical statements at Brown, of Ohio, and four other senators who all are Democrats up for re-election next year: Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Bill Nelson of Florida.

""Despite Sherrod Brown's transparent political strategy to mislead Ohio seniors and demagogue Medicare, this serves as another reminder he is the only candidate in Ohio who has voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care,"" said NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox.

Wilcox cited the New York Times, Washington Post and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as supporting sources.

PolitiFact has examined at least four previous claims that the health care reform bill -- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally tagged as Obamacare -- would cut Medicare by $500 billion.

The important point in each examination is that $500 billion -- the figure confirmed by the NRSC's citations -- are not taken out of the current Medicare budget and are not actual cuts. Nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said.

The $500 billion are reductions to future spending. The health care law attempts to slow the projected growth in Medicare spending by that amount over 10 years.

Medicare spending will still increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

Some of the changes in the health care law increase Medicare spending ""to improve benefits and coverage, Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation told PolitiFact.

Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, she said.

The projected $500 billion in savings will come from changes that include higher insurance premiums for wealthier seniors, reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage plans, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and a slowing of increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. (Neuman explains the changes in a video tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website.)

The NRSC recycled another talking point when it further asserts that the changes in the health care law will ""fund government-run health care.""

PolitiFact has repeatedly issued Truth-O-Meter ratings of False or Pants on Fire for claims that the law represents a government takeover of health care. The claim was selected as PolitiFact National's 2010 Lie of the Year.

We found that critics of the law are correct that it significantly increases government regulation of health insurers. But it is, as noted previously, a system that relies on private companies:
  
The NRSC’s claim cites a real figure -- $500 billion -- that is part of the health reform debate. But it incorrectly describes it as $500 billion in Medicare cuts, rather than as decreases in the rate of growth of future spending.

And the NRSC piles on the incorrect talking point about ""government-run health care.""

Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno says foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London boosted exports by 18 percent
","
If you heard Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno on the Brian Lehrer Show on May 11, you'd think New Jersey didn’t have any foreign trade offices for at least a decade until the administration of Gov. Chris Christie set up outposts in Shanghai and London, which led to a big surge in exports.

In the middle of her statewide tour to highlight New Jersey’s commitment to economic growth, Guadagno did a radio interview on the WNYC program. After discussing the state’s effort to attract jobs from the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, the conversation turned to where Guadagno said the ""real game"" is -- overseas.

Here’s how Guadagno summed up New Jersey’s international outreach:

""It's no longer just a regional market. It's attracting business from overseas. And New Jersey, for the past decade, hasn't had any offices overseas. Compare that to Pennsylvania (that) has 23. Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent.""

Fred Snowflack, a spokesman for Guadagno, said the offices in Shanghai and London opened last year through a joint effort between the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Two people are stationed in Shanghai and one person is in London, Snowflack said.

According to a September 2010 press release announcing the deal, the duties of the foreign trade representatives include helping to advance export sales of New Jersey companies and arranging visits for potential investors. The London office covers the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.

PolitiFact New Jersey also confirmed that Pennsylvania has 23 foreign trade offices covering 67 countries. So she is right on that point.

But she's wrong on two other key points: that the state lacked foreign trade offices for the past decade and that the two new ones led to the 18 percent increase in exports.

Actually, a total of 10 full- and part-time overseas offices were in operation during the past decade.

New Jersey had full-time offices in Tokyo from 1988-2006; London, 1994-2004; Ra’anana, Israel,  1995-2007; Mexico City, 1999-2006; Cairo, 2000-2004; and Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2000-2007. The state had part-time offices in South Korea from 1999-2004; Greece, 2000-2004; China, 2001-2004; and Argentina, 2001-2002.

Snowflack told us those offices closed for financial reasons. Asked about the discrepancy between Guadagno’s radio interview and the information on previous offices, Snowflack wrote in an email:

""As for the other question, the lieutenant governor has said on many other occasions, including her budget testimony of last year, that the offices were closed during the Corzine Administration.  I submit that the important point here is that the state has reopened overseas offices, not the exact year in which some of the old ones closed.""

Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce back up the 18 percent increase in exports. Those exports included chemicals, computers and electronic products, and transportation equipment.

But that's a figure for exports throughout the world and an economics professor expressed doubt that the new offices deserve much credit.

""I wish economics were that easy,"" Rutgers University professor Thomas Prusa said.

Snowflack told us Guadagno was not linking the export increases to the new offices.

""She was not saying that the two new offices were directly responsible for the increase in exports,"" Snowflack wrote in an email. ""Her point was that New Jersey is trying to rekindle business relationships overseas, as evidenced by an increase in exports and two new offices. But she never said two offices that opened within the last year prompted an 18 percent increase in exports.""

That may have been what she meant, but listeners who heard her would clearly be under the impression there was a link. She said, ""Now we just opened in the last six months, two offices. One in Shanghai and one in London. And we actually saw an increase in our exports of 18 percent.""

Her wording suggests a clear linkage.

Let’s review:

Guadagno said New Jersey has opened foreign trade offices in Shanghai and London, marking the first in at least a decade. She’s right about those two offices, but she’s wrong to say such international efforts haven’t been done before. In fact, New Jersey had 10 offices at various times during the past decade.

And there's little, if any, evidence that the offices led to the 18 percent increase. We find her statement False.

Dems say under Gov. Mitt Romney, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation
","
On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney often blasts President Barack Obama's record on job creation while touting his own success in creating jobs as governor of Massachusetts.

But a popular rebuttal by a number of Democratic leaders lately is this statistic: When Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation.

Most recently, senior Obama re-election campaign strategist David Axelrod dropped the statistic in an interview on CNN's State of the Union on June 19, 2011.

""If you're Governor Romney and you say I'm going to turn this economy around, I've got the answers. You don't offer them. Then people have a right to say, why is it that your state was 47th in the country in job creation when you were governor?"" Axelrod said.

Former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cited the 47th out of 50 statistic in interviews before and after the most recent Republican debate. And on NBC's Meet the Press on June 12, 2011, Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said, ""Mitt Romney is pretty darn vulnerable on the economy himself. When he was governor, he literally was 47th in job creation. For someone who touts his own ability to create jobs, we're talking about somebody that never created and recovered the amount of jobs lost in Massachusetts from the 2001 recession when he was governor.""

Clearly this statistic is now part of the Democrats' playbook on Romney, prompted by his claims about success in job creation.

First, it's true that when Romney took office, Massachusetts was losing jobs. And when he left, it was gaining jobs. So the job situation clearly improved. The argument, however, is that Massachusetts' jobs recovery was much slower than other states.

We asked the Democratic National Committee for backup on the statistic, and they pointed us first to a Feb. 23, 2010, story in the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch website.

Reporter Brett Arends looked at statistics from January 2003, when Romney took office, to January 2007, when he left, and reported:

During that time, according to the U.S. Labor Department, the state ranked 47th in the entire country in jobs growth. Fourth from last.

The only ones that did worse? Ohio, Michigan and Louisiana. In other words, two rustbelt states and another that lost its biggest city to a hurricane.

The Massachusetts jobs growth over that period, a pitiful 0.9 percent, badly lagged other high-skill, high-wage, knowledge economy states like New York (2.7 percent), California (4.7 percent) and North Carolina (7.6 percent).

The national average: More than 5 percent. 

Romney campaign spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom called the DNC's statistic ""laughable"" in view of President Obama's negative jobs record.

""Mitt Romney took office during a recession when the state was losing thousands of jobs every month,"" Fehrnstrom wrote in an e-mail. ""He not only stopped the job losses, but ended his four years in office with positive numbers on the board.  If you go back and look at the last 10 years, it was a lost decade for job growth in Massachusetts. The only bright spot was Mitt Romney’s term as governor. Both his predecessor and his successor posted job losses.""

Fehrnstrom's statement about the anomaly of net job growth during Romney's tenure, as opposed to net job losses under both his predecessor and successor, is accurate. But there were two national recessions that bookended Romney's four years in office. Again, the DNC's point isn't that Massachusetts' job picture didn't improve during Romney's term in office, rather it's that it didn't improve as much as most other states during the same period.

The DNC pointed us to an article from the Associated Press on Feb. 4, 2008, which begins:

It's part of Mitt Romney's core narrative: Massachusetts, in the throes of a fiscal freefall, fell back on his CEO skills and turnaround wizardry to spark -- in his words -- ""a dramatic reversal of state fortunes and a period of sustained economic expansion.""

It's a rosy opinion of Massachusetts' economy that few in the state share. Instead, observers say, the state's recovery from a disastrous 2001 recession has been tepid at best, and Romney gives himself more credit than deserved on job creation and balancing the state budget.

Romney says that by the time he left office, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was lower, and the state had recovered nearly 80,000 jobs from the low point of the recession.

A fuller look reveals a state still struggling to recoup the jobs washed away in the recession, while much of the rest of the country has already sailed past pre-recession highs.

According to state unemployment numbers, the net number of jobs added during the four years Romney was in office was 24,400 -- a fraction of the total of about 200,000 lost during the recession.

Although the number of new jobs steadily climbed during Romney's four years in office -- from a loss of 54,700 in his first year to a gain of 34,700 in his final year -- most of the rest of the country rebounded much faster.

Massachusetts is one of just six states that hasn't added back all the jobs lost during the recession.

We ran the some numbers ourselves using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. We should note up front that there are a number of ways to slice the data, and the numbers change a bit depending on the parameters of your search. For example, do you look at all nonfarm workers (which includes government workers) or only private workers? We ran the numbers a few different ways, and while the numbers changed slightly, the ranking did not: Massachusetts was 47th out of 50 in the percentage of job growth.

If you look at all nonfarm workers, for example, Massachusetts went from 3,158,800 jobs to 3,198,500, an increase of 1.3 percent. Only Ohio, Michigan and Louisiana were worse. The national average was 5.3 percent.

At our request, the taxpayer-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which does nonpartisan analysis of the state's financial and economic statistics, ran some numbers as well. They looked at figures from December 2002 (right before Romney took office) to December 2006, so the percentages were slightly different than ours, but they came to the same ranking for Massachusetts.

""Jobs grew, but they grew at an anemic rate compared to the rest of the country,"" said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

The country was coming out of a recession when Romney took office. And it's likely, Widmer said, that Massachusetts emerged more slowly from that recession because its pre-recession numbers were disproportionally inflated by the technology bubble. A lot of those tech jobs never came back.

Widmer warned not to put to much stock in any governors' influence over their states' rate of job growth, or decline. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, he said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he said, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly.

But when you have Romney running for president as a business person who says he created jobs for the private sector when he was governor, ""In that context, the numbers from the DNC are relevant,"" Widmer said. ""They are a relevant and accurate rebuttal.""

However, to the extent that some may interpret the Democrats' statistic that Romney is to blame for Massachusetts ranking 47th out of 50 states in the percentage of job gains, Jeffrey Miron, director of undergraduate studies at the Harvard University Department of Economics, advises caution.

""Governors and presidents generally get way too much credit and blame for job creation or losses,"" Miron said. Assessing a governor's performance on jobs is difficult due to national economic forces and policies that predate a governor's term in office, he said. ""It's misleading to give him too much blame,"" Miron said. ""I'm having a hard time pointing to anything he did that was that dramatic.""

And, Miron said, you'd also need to consider that if a state was faring better than others through the recession, there would be less room to go back up, and so the percentage gains would be smaller.

Again, there are lots of ways to present jobs data. And jobs statistics can often be manipulated by political campaigns, so that it's possible for competing campaigns to point to equal and opposite statistics -- as is the case with Romney and job creation as governor. For example, the Romney campaign provided data showing that Massachusetts' rank in terms of the percentage of job growth improved from 49th out of 50 during 2003 to 36th during 2006. And, they note, Massachusetts added more than 47,000 jobs over the course of the Romney Administration -- a gross number that does not factor in job losses during the period Romney was governor, as the Associated Press did in citing the 24,400 job number. 
Our ruling 
As with many of the claims we check, there are two elements to Axelrod's claim. He is saying that 1) Massachusetts ranked 47th in job growth and 2) suggesting that Romney is to blame. 
We find he is right about the numbers. Indeed, federal jobs numbers indicate that, no matter how we sliced the data, the state was 47th. 
But we found little evidence to support the other part of Axelrod's claim, that Romney is responsible for those jobs numbers. Economists told us that it's a stretch to blame or credit Romney or any governor for job numbers. Overall, we find Axelrod's claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/22/david-axelrod/dems-say-when-mitt-romney-was-governor-massachuset/

George Allen changes stance again on ethanol subsidies
","
Republican George Allen made headlines in 2005 when he voted for a bill in the U.S. Senate that helped the ethanol industry by mandating greater use of the biofuel in the production of gas.

The story was first reported in the Des Moines Register, which noted that Allen ""used to be a reliable vote against expanding the ethanol industry.""

There were two reasons why Iowa’s largest newspaper was interested in the changed position of the Virginia senator.

The first concerned the nature of ethanol, a type of alcohol that can be combined with gasoline and burned in engines. Demand for ethanol drives up demand for corn, which is used to produce the alcohol. And no state produces more corn than Iowa.

The second reason had to do with politics. Iowa is home to caucuses that make it the first state to weigh in on whom the Democrats and Republicans should nominate for president.

And back then, Allen, was giving plenty of thought to a White House bid. The Register wondered whether Allen’s change on ethanol might ""have anything to do with the possibility that he may enter the Iowa caucuses and run for president in 2008?""

At the time, an Allen spokesman told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the senator’s position had ""evolved with technology"" which had ""made it more practical, more efficient and more affordable to produce biofuels.""

Some were skeptical of Allen’s conversion. ""If you think presidential ambition has nothing to do with it, I’ve got some nice beachfront property in Des Moines to sell you,"" quipped Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University.

Allen made several trips to Iowa in 2006 -- as well as to other key presidential primary states, including New Hampshire. But his national ambitions tumbled later that year when Allen was upset in his reelection bid for the Senate by Democrat Jim Webb.

Now, let’s fast forward to 2011. Allen is campaigning hard to regain his old Senate seat next year and seeking to establish his credentials as a fiscal conservative. Although Allen is the favorite to win the GOP nomination, there’s a feisty group of other Republican candidates nipping at his heels.

With the United States having maxed out its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, Congress faces an Aug. 2 deadline to reach a deal that cuts spending and raises the borrowing limit on Uncle Sam’s credit card. And ethanol is a small part of that debate.

The Senate this month passed a measure that would end a 45-cent per gallon tax credit to U.S. ethanol refiners and a 54-cent per gallon tariff on imported ethanol. The measure -- pushed by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.-- would save the U.S. about $6 billion a year.

Allen applauded the legislation, which still faces a difficult route through Congress.

""I have long maintained our biofuel mandates have become unrealistic and drive up the cost of our food and feed,"" Allen wrote in a June 14 campaign blog. ""I commend Senator Coburn’s amendment to end the tax breaks and subsidies for ethanol.""

Bill Riggs, Allen’s campaign press secretary, said the candidate stopped supporting ethanol subsidies when Congress passed a 2007 mandate for another dramatic increase in production of the biofuel -- from a future goal 8 billion gallons a year to a new objective of 36 billion gallons annually.  At that level, Riggs said, ethanol could consume about one-third of the U.S. corn crop.

Riggs said Allen’s view in 2005 was that supporting emerging ethanol technology would be a relatively small mandate. But the 2007 bill pushed food and feed prices higher, he said, and was inconsistent with the legislation Allen had supported two years earlier.

Allen’s new position caught the attention of one of his opponents for the GOP nomination, Tea Party activist Jamie Radtke. She issued a news release headlined, ""George Allen Flip-Flops on Ethanol.""

The candidate has his reasons for changing his position, but everyone agrees a change occurred. Full Flop! ",/factchecks/2011/jun/22/george-allen/george-allen-changes-stance-again-ethanol/
