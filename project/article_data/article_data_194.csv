Does truck claim carry its weight in accuracy?
","A congressional candidate says Uncle Sam is making it tougher to keep on truckin’. Mike Collins told the Gwinnett Daily Post that changes in federal emissions standards have added $10,000 to the price of every new truck his family’s trucking business buys. ""The EPA is stifling business,"" Collins told us, referring to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which helped write those standards. PolitiFact Georgia was curious about his claim and hit the fact-checking trail for more details. Collins is running as a Republican for the U.S. House of Representatives in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, a conservative stretch of northeast Georgia. The current officeholder, Paul Broun, is running for the U.S. Senate. Broun’s successor will take office in January 2015. Collins is one of six candidates in the race. Collins’ father, Mac, served 12 years in the U.S. House, from 1993 to 2005, representing portions of several south metro Atlanta counties. The younger Collins is the vice president and financial officer of Collins Trucking, which boasts on its website that its vehicles can haul a minimum of 48,000 pounds of cargo. A heavy-duty truck can cost about $100,000. Collins said new federal emissions regulations that took effect in 2011 on heavy-duty trucks are responsible for some big changes in sales prices. In May 2010, President Barack Obama announced a plan to produce more environmentally friendly vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA created new guidelines for combination tractors that are used for freight transportation, heavy-duty pickup trucks, and gasoline and diesel heavy-duty engines. The goal: reduce carbon dioxide emissions by anywhere from 7 percent to 20 percent, along with reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new regulations took effect in August 2011. The EPA outlined the environmental and cost benefits in one report: ""The agencies estimate that the combined standards will reduce (carbon dioxide) emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save about 530 million barrels of oil over the life of vehicles built for the 2014 to 2018 model years, providing $49 billion in net program benefits. The reduced fuel use alone will enable $50 billion in fuel savings to accrue to vehicle owners, or $42 billion in net savings when considering technology costs. A second phase of regulations is planned for model years beyond 2018."" So have these changes resulted in $10,000 price increases in the past two years? ""That’s the number that’s been floating around,"" said Guy Young, vice president of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association, based in Marietta. There are no studies of the impact of emissions changes that took effect in 2011 on truck prices. An EPA spokeswoman said the $10,000 upfront cost is consistent with the EPA’s regulatory impact analysis for heavy-duty vehicles starting in model year 2014. ""It should be noted, however, that the same analysis finds that using technologies commercially available today, the majority of vehicles will see a payback period of less than one year, while others, especially those with lower annual miles, will experience payback periods of up to two years,"" said the spokeswoman, Davina Marraccini. ""For example, an operator of a tractor-trailer can pay for the technology upgrades in under a year and have net savings up to $73,000 over the truck’s useful life."" Marraccini said the standards were developed with support from the trucking industry. The National Automobile Dealers Association and American Truck Dealers released a report in March 2012 on the impact of emissions requirements on vehicles with a model year from 2004 to 2010. It disputes the EPA’s cost-benefit projections. ""EPA underestimated compliance costs by a factor of 2-5,"" the report said. ""These higher-than-projected costs resulted in, among other things, significantly lower-than-projected new truck sales which necessarily reduced the environmental benefits associated with these standards."" The report found the average surcharge on heavy-duty trucks made in 2010 that were compliant with the emissions guidelines was about $9,000 for nearly every manufacturer. For medium-duty trucks, the surcharge was generally between $6,000 and $7,300. Bill Iredale, who’s been in the truck sales business for nearly 40 years, said Collins was correct about the price increase. ""Absolutely,"" said Iredale, sales manager at Ace Beverage Refurb & Sales, based in Norcross. Iredale said the price increases have resulted from a series of new federal emissions regulations over the past decade. Ten years ago, a medium-body truck cost about $50,000. Today, the price is about $75,000. Iredale said the recent emissions requirements do have a positive impact on air quality. ""It’s a good thing,"" he said. ""It really helped clean up the air."" Young agreed that the vehicles have better fuel economy. ""They’re really good fuel engines, but (manufacturers) had to make some changes to get that way,"" he said. So, is Collins right? The EPA anticipated such additional upfront costs. Not surprisingly, the EPA and trucking industry debate the cost benefit of the regulations. The anecdotal evidence we heard and the 2012 truck dealers report suggest Collins may be right about the higher costs. The statement, however, falls a bit shy of an absolute True ruling. It has to be viewed in the context of the overall fuel savings the new vehicles will accrue. That could be substantial and actually offset the higher costs in the long run. We rate this claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4C980>],/factchecks/2013/aug/09/mike-collins/does-truck-claim-carry-its-weight-accuracy/

Kathleen Ford: There's 'no planned air-conditioned restaurant out on the Lens'
","Opponents of the Lens design for St. Petersburg’s Pier knock it as a ""sidewalk to nowhere,"" a function-less structure lacking important amenities of the retired inverted pyramid. Take, for instance, the ability to eat food above water in cool air. ""Folks, there is no air-conditioned restaurant at the Lens,"" mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford declared at the Aug. 6 Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral forum. ""Let me just clear that up for you. There’s been a lot of questions about that issue. There is no planned air-conditioned restaurant out on the Lens."" Ford’s claim came in response to a question about whether residents should get to vote on a replacement design for the Pier if they decide to cancel the current project in the Aug. 27 primary election. Stop the Lens has argued against the Lens for a host of reasons, including the lack of a restaurant. The inverted pyramid Pier, which closed May 31 but has not been demolished, had a few restaurants, including the Columbia Restaurant. The new plan for the Pier, with its looping, futuristic, open-air design, does not allocate nearly the same amount of space for restaurants as before. Instead of a full-size restaurant topping the water, Lens designers opted for a new restaurant strategy, in part to cut the taxpayer subsidy for the Pier. They planned a small, open-air cafe run by the Columbia restaurant on the Lens structure’s ""promontory,"" which overlooks the water. Meanwhile, a new Columbia restaurant would anchor a waterfront location at the approach to the Pier known as the Hub, which is currently the Pelican parking lot. Columbia owners say it will have about 8,000 square feet of air-conditioned space as well as outdoor and rooftop seating. Richard Gonzmart, a member of the family that owns the Columbia Restaurant Group, said the cafe would be different from traditional fare at the Columbia, featuring a fusion of Japanese and Peruvian seafood and an open bar. Would it have air conditioning? It’s hard to say, because final planning stages have not yet begun. Enclosing the cafe space would take away from the intended experience, he said, adding he sees himself enjoying a glass of sauvignon blanc at the water’s edge in casual Florida wear with his German shepherd Rusty. Vivid personal preference aside, he acknowledges it may not be ideal for heat-weary visitors. His company is testing out a fan misting system at its cafe location at the Tampa Bay History Center in Tampa, he said. Still, the looming referendum makes brainstorming ideas for either location with the California-based architects very difficult, he said. Much is left to be determined, and the City Council has not yet approved a lease with his restaurant for either space. ""We’ll have to come up with a way to cool it down,"" Gonzmart said. ""I will investigate what we can do to make it comfortable."" City architect Raul Quintana said the nitty-gritty of the design will only be worked out between Columbia ownership and architects if the project survives the public vote. ""There’s no ‘yes or no’ answer,"" Quintana said. ""Could (the cafe) be air-conditioned? Absolutely, if that’s what Gonzmart wants."" Two more parts of the promontory, a small ice cream parlor and bathroom facilities, will be air-conditioned, said Lisa Wannemacher, the associate local architect for the project. Lens opponents, including president of Concerned Citizens of St. Petersburg William Ballard, have criticized the design for not including 26,000 square feet for a restaurant, one of the recommendations of the 2010 Pier Advisory Task Force report. ""We feel very comfortable stating that there is no air-conditioned restaurant out on the over water portion of the Lens,"" Ballard said, ""nor is there an air-conditioned space just for people to go out there, even an enclosed space that they could retreat to get away from the weather."" There was not enough money to meet all of the task force’s recommendations, Wannemacher said, and building the restaurant on land helps reduce the project's costs. Two leaders of the task force defended the plan for the upland restaurant and promontory cafe, saying while it’s not exactly what the group had in mind, ""it does substantially address the task force’s identification of a restaurant-based program as a focus."" Our ruling Ford said, ""There is no planned air-conditioned restaurant out on the Lens."" Ford's specific wording is technically accurate, but it ignores the fact that there are two places to get food that are part of the Lens project. The latest designs from the architect envision an open-air cafe at the endpoint of the Lens. The cafe's final design awaits collaboration between Columbia ownership and architects, and those talks are stalled with the big vote on the Lens on Aug. 27. Further, the Columbia will open a separate air-conditioned restaurant that's on the approach to the Lens and has a waterfront view. Her statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C451040>],/factchecks/2013/aug/08/kathleen-ford/kathleen-ford-says-lens-design-new-pier-does-not-i/

Democrats say Florida stripped insurance commissioner of power to set health plan rates
","Florida lawmakers have left the state vulnerable to unreasonably high insurance premiums in an effort to undermine Obamacare, say the state’s U.S. House Democrats. Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature cynically stripped Florida of its ability to review rates for the law’s rollout, U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch writes in a letter signed by all 10 of the state’s Democratic representatives. The letter, which appeals to the federal government to step in on Floridians’ behalf, blames a law Scott signed at the end of May for refusing to allow the state insurance commissioner to ""negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high."" It asks the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to ""protect Florida consumers — since Gov. Scott, the Florida Legislature and Insurance Commissioner (Kevin) McCarty will not."" Did the governor and state legislators prevent the insurance commissioner from negotiating lower rates and refusing high ones? Deferring to the feds Legislators faced a unique challenge during their 60-day session in 2013. Unlike many states that had laid groundwork to implement the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010, Florida had repeatedly refused — first challenging the constitutionality of the law, then waiting to see if a new president would offer a reprieve. But with the law upheld by the Supreme Court and President Barack Obama back in office, the state was stuck. It had refused federal money to help with the transition. Now it was also running out of time. A state Senate committee in 2013 said it sought a ""rational, reasonable approach."" State law needed an update to match federal requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The committee sought to do as little as possible. ""We want to make sure that we're in compliance, that we're doing what we're required to do,"" said Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, at a March committee meeting. The Affordable Care Act assumed that states would continue to take a lead role in setting insurance rates, just as Florida had done in the past. It encouraged states to strengthen their rate-setting authority, offering millions of dollars in grant money to help. But it didn’t require that. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation faced a serious time-crunch to get up to speed on a host of new requirements under the law. Legislators offered a compromise. If the federal government wanted to impose new coverage requirements — well, it could set rates, too. ""Since the federal government is requiring these additional coverages that will cost more,"" said Sen. Joe Negron, Republican chair of the Affordable Care Act Committee, ""then to me it makes sense for them to be responsible for approving rate increases that are certain to come."" Democrats on the committee agreed with this approach at its final meeting on March 18. ""I think we're going to find it's going to cost us a lot of money to set rates here in Florida,"" said Sen. Eleanor Sobel. ""... I think we should rely on the federal government."" She expressed confidence the federal government would have a ""greater wealth of knowledge."" ""If we have concerns about the rates that the feds do set, then we should work with them,"" she said. One hitch she didn’t mention: the federal government didn’t give itself rate-making authority. What resulted was Florida Senate Bill 1842, which among other things, suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans — such as those that will appear on new marketplaces. Companies would still have to file rate changes with the state. But they could act on those changes without approval. Sobel now says that wasn’t at all clear at the time. The bill earned unanimous support from the Senate Appropriations Committee, then passed the Senate 28-8, mostly along party lines. Six senators voted after roll call, including Sobel, who changed her vote from yea to nay. ""I was reading very quickly. Then I realized this was something that was not good for the people of the state of Florida,"" she said. The 78-36 House vote also mostly followed party lines, with a few Democratic supporters. Gov. Scott expressed the same confidence that the federal government would step in. When he signed the bill into law May 31, he wrote, ""I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period."" Limits of federal authority Here’s the thing: The federal government, even under the Affordable Care Act, can’t do what Insurance Commissioner McCarty can do. Florida grants its insurance commissioner a range of powers. McCarty can negotiate lower rates with companies. He can refuse rates that the state determines to be too high. The federal government can do neither of those things. On July 31, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation released projected insurance premiums for policies that will be for sale on the new health insurance marketplaces launching in January 2014 — premiums it has no authority to review. The state estimated rate increases in the individual market between 8 percent and 59 percent. (The federal government and consumer groups, we should note, dispute the state's projections, with one group suggesting they're inaccurately and irresponsibly high to discourage Floridians from participating in Obamacare.) In a bulleted list, the office noted all of the ways the Affordable Care Act might be driving up costs. It didn’t mention McCarty had no power to negotiate or refuse because of the new law. And that matters. A Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2010 found that those states with robust authority to approve or disapprove rates were ""able to extract significant reductions."" While Florida used the Affordable Care Act as a reason to reduce its rate oversight, most states used the law’s grants to boost theirs. North Carolina reduced a rate increase request with its new authority in 2010 that saved beneficiaries $14.5 million. The Palm Beach Post noted that Maryland used its negotiating power to push rates for next year’s premiums down ""by as much as a third"" from what companies had proposed. In the absence of oversight from Florida, the federal government does have some power to protect Florida consumers from outrageous rates — even if it can’t rescind them or otherwise impose penalties. Chief is the new requirement that insurers must spend at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates. So, if an insurer filed for a rate increase that granted it profits far beyond the benefits it offered, it would owe consumers a rebate the next year. Second, it could refuse to let an insurer sell its product on Florida’s federally run marketplace. But not all insurance will be sold through the marketplace. Meanwhile, the process was supposed to rely on states’ determination of whether a rate was justified. Lastly, it wields shame. If Florida doesn’t weigh in, the federal government will review any increase greater than 10 percent to evaluate whether it’s unreasonable — a designation the insurer will have to feature on its website. Our ruling A letter from Deutch and Florida’s U.S. House Democrats says that the governor and legislators refused to allow the state insurance commissioner to ""negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high."" They did precisely that, though they argued that the federal government could step in on Florida’s behalf. It turns out, that’s not how it works.

Prospective House candidate says Austin school district has classrooms lacking electrical outlets
","A prospective Texas House candidate said some Austin schools shockingly lack a necessity. Ramey Ko, a lawyer who joined candidates for an  Austin-area House seat at the July 25, 2013, meeting of the Austin Young Democrats, is not running in the November 2013 special election to serve out the term of Democrat Mark Strama, who resigned. But Ko has said he intends to run in the 2014 Democratic primary. As noted by Austin American-Statesman columnist Ken Herman, Ko said at the meeting: ""The very first issue I want to tackle when I'm in the Legislature is public education. Right now in the eastern part of the district in particular we see schools where over half the kids are in portables. We see situations where we may have bought new technology from the bonds that we passed in the past but then we discovered that there are no electrical outlets in the school classrooms because they are over 50 years old. I mean this is literally true. It's amazing when you finally look at the details of this."" That does seem amazing. Does the Austin school district have classrooms lacking electrical outlets? Revisiting a board's discussion By telephone, Ko told us he heard about such classrooms at a March 2013 meeting of the board of the Greater Austin Asian Chamber of Commerce in which board members discussed Austin school bond propositions on the May 2013 ballot. Ko said board member Catherine Crago said that some district schools ""average"" 0.5 outlets per classroom and, Ko said, Crago added that this means some classrooms have no outlets. Ko said he is an advisory board member of the chamber. By phone and email, Crago told us that at the meeting, she mentioned research she helped compile in the early 1990s that inventoried some five million square feet of Central Texas schools, counting among features each school’s windows and outlets. Crago said she did not say that she was referring to classrooms in the Austin district. Precisely, Crago said, she told board members that the research showed some Central Texas schools with 10 outlets per classroom and others averaging 0.5 outlets per classroom. She said she then asked an Austin district representative at the meeting: ""Is that still true?"" Crago said the representative nodded yes, which could have been in reference to Central Texas schools rather than Austin schools alone. Crago said her broader judgment is that older classrooms lack sufficient infrastructure to handle several computers in addition to a teacher's equipment. Did the Austin district official at that meeting agree that some classrooms lack outlets? That’s not the recollection of Perla Delgado, the district representative at the chamber’s board meeting, Alex Sanchez, a district spokesman, told us by phone. Delgado ""did not remember any specific question that she received or answered about electrical outlets,"" Sanchez said. ""It’s not something she said that even came up."" Separately, the executive director of the chamber, Marina Bhargava, said by phone that there was extensive discussion of the bond proposals at the meeting. She said she didn’t recall the electrical outlet moment, though such an exchange might well have happened. Austin district says classrooms have multiple outlets Recollections aside, do Austin classrooms lack outlets? Sanchez and other district officials said not. District spokesman Antonio Lujan said by email that there have been no classrooms lacking outlets for years. ""Even the district's oldest schools and portables would have several outlets in a room designated as a classroom,"" Lujan said. ""A classroom could not function without electrical outlets, and staff members would request to add them to accommodate the teaching environment."" Lujan passed along a response from Jeff Kauffman, the district’s director of construction management, stating that every classroom has an outlet. ""For new construction, every type of classroom, (from basic elementary school general-use classrooms to specialized computer classrooms in high school) has a minimum number of outlets (electrical and computer) required to fully operate the space as defined"" in the district’s educational specifications, Kauffman said. Kauffman said the specifications for a basic elementary school classroom (the least-wired situation) calls for a minimum of six electrical outlets with separate dedicated outlets (three to five) for computers..."" Kauffman said that more ""technology-based"" classrooms would have more outlets. ""Older classrooms,"" Kauffman said, ""have had outlets added, as needed, to accommodate the use of the space."" Also, he said, new ""classroom portables have a minimum of eight electrical outlets and six data connections per classroom. Older portables have had outlets added, as needed,"" Kauffman said. Sanchez later said that according to Paul Turner, the district’s executive director of facilities, the typical district classroom has about six outlets, each of them enabling two plugs. Also, according to Turner, each classroom on average would have six ""drops,"" meaning electrical cables enabling multiple connections such as those needed for laptops. Sanchez said voters provided for the ""drops"" by approving a 1996 bond proposition. We shared the district’s replies with Ko, who said by email that the average number of outlets ""doesn't really speak to whether certain schools currently have classrooms that either lack working or usable outlets for whatever reasons."" He also said that he apologizes if what he thought he heard was incorrect. Our ruling Ko said some Austin classrooms lack electrical outlets. We see no basis for this statement, which shakes out as horse-and-buggy ridiculous.

Paul Ryan says government shutdown wouldn't sideline Obamacare
","Some congressional Republicans are threatening to deny funding for government operations unless a provision is included to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law. Because defunding Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment is a nonstarter for Democrats, lawmakers are now openly pondering the possibility of a government shutdown. Other Republicans -- including Paul Ryan, the party’s former vice presidential nominee -- are warning that a government shutdown is a bad idea and won’t work anyway. That was a point he made on the Aug. 4, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. ""Obamacare is an entitlement like Medicare and Social Security is, and so the entitlement carries on even under a government shutdown scenario,"" said Ryan, who is also the House budget chairman. First, some background. Shutdowns occur when appropriations bills expire, and Congress and the president are at an impasse. A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential. A shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996. Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown. Several elements of the health care law fall into this category. Here’s a summary of some of the key provisions of the health care law and how they might be affected by shutdown. Insurance exchanges and premium subsidies Ryan referred to Obamacare being like such ""entitlements"" as Social Security and Medicare, which are not affected by shutdowns. An entitlement is a government program that is funded by a formula, rather than by the kinds of specific congressional appropriations that run out in a shutdown. Any American who meets the criteria for receiving the benefit will keep receiving payments even in the absence of congressional appropriations. The health care law creates online marketplaces where uninsured Americans can purchase health insurance, and it offers them means-tested subsidies to help pay the premiums for those plans. The subsidies fit the definition of an entitlement most directly. Because the subsidies are provided in the form of tax credits, they are not subject to appropriations, and thus should be able to proceed during a shutdown. As for the operations of the exchanges themselves, these too seem likely to be unaffected by a shutdown, although for a different reason. The independent Congressional Research Service has concluded that implementation of the insurance marketplace is being funded by long-term appropriations -- funding streams that won’t be cut off during a government shutdown. There’s one caveat, however: Delays could still occur if federal agencies have no workers, or too few, to carry out needed tasks. This has been an issue in the past with Social Security Administration employees. The agency’s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. Would a shutdown prevent employees from going to work, potentially halting operations? A 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that’s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns. According to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut ""significantly impacted the Agency’s service to the public,"" the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work. The second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal. Noting the past experience of Social Security, CRS wrote, ""it may be reasonable to infer that any similar benefit programs"" under the health care law would have enough administrative flexibility to keep operations going during a shutdown. In other words, there’s no guarantee, but it’s likely that operations will continue. Tax provisions In general, tax collection is not affected by a shutdown. Anyone who incurs taxes is still liable for paying them on a quarterly or annual basis, even if the IRS is in shutdown mode. In addition, exceptions exist for processing tax payments received during a shutdown. Some Obamacare taxes, such as those on branded pharmaceuticals, need to be calculated and assessed in writing by IRS before the manufacturer pays them, so these could be affected by a shutdown, according to the Congressional Research Service. But even if there’s a delay, the taxes will ultimately be paid, shutdown or not. This is true for the mandate on individuals to purchase health insurance; people who run afoul of this pay their penalty through their tax return. Regulations Many key aspects of the health care law are regulatory in nature -- for instance, rules about what insurers have to cover, how much insurers need to spend on health-related expenses and protections for patients with pre-existing conditions or those with young adult children. While these are all part of the health care law, a government shutdown wouldn’t really affect them. At most, enforcement efforts might lag during a shutdown, but the rules will remain on the books and will have to be respected. ""At most, government enforcement activity might be put on hold, but after the shutdown people could be investigated and held liable for violations they committed during the shutdown period,"" said Ronald Levin, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. We will conclude by emphasizing the rarity of government shutdowns, and the absence of any that lasted any significant period of time. ""It depends how long any shutdown goes on,"" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""It's easy to be creative for a short period but harder after a while."" Our ruling Ryan said that ""Obamacare … carries on even under a government shutdown."" For various reasons, most key parts of the law -- the insurance marketplace, the premium subsidies, and the taxes and regulations -- should continue unimpeded. But shutdowns are rare and unpredictable, so we can’t be entirely sure that there will be no major interruptions. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A51C40>],/factchecks/2013/aug/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-government-shutdown-wouldnt-sidelin/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Jan Schakowsky']","
Schakowsky says half of all adults have pre-existing medical condition
","One of the more popular provisions in the Affordable Care Act is the one that prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems. Pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, depression and diabetes are among the most common ailments that can get in the way of being accepted by a new insurance company. The health care law tackled this problem in two steps. Starting with children, as of September 2010, insurers could not deny coverage, charge significantly higher premiums, require an extended waiting period or curtail benefits due to a pre-existing condition. The second step takes place Jan. 1, 2014, when the same protections kick in for adults. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., appearing Aug. 5, 2013, on PoliticsNation on MSNBC, chastised Republicans for wanting to repeal Obamacare, saying many benefits would be lost. ""Half of all adults have a pre-existing condition that will go away in terms of insurance coverage on January 1st,"" Schakowsky said. ""I mean, what a blessing that is for sick Americans, for people who are walking around uninsured or underinsured."" We know that Americans face a lot of health challenges, but do half of adults have a pre-existing condition? In the eye of the insurer There are a range of estimates for the number of people with health issues that would put them at risk of running afoul of an insurance company. One reason is that insurers have different lists of conditions that raise a red flag. Similarly, researchers can take a conservative approach and use a short list, or be more expansive with a longer one. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, examined five studies on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. The lowest estimate counted just eight diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. That study came up with about 36 million people between 19 and 64 who have one of those health issues. Another study used a list of 60 conditions and arrived at a number of 60 million who might be vulnerable to denial of coverage, and the GAO itself used medical survey data and reached a high-end estimate of 122 million. As percentages, this translates into a low-end estimate of 20 percent of American adults potentially at risk, 66 percent on the high end, with a midpoint of 32 percent. An analysis from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services came up with a roughly similar range of 19 percent to 50 percent. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, notes that projections of the scope of the problem can miss the mark. The administration expected about 375,000 people would enroll in a special insurance program for those who had been denied coverage but as of January 2013, only about 107,000 had. That said, many factors apart from health could have affected enrollments. The main caveat with these studies is they estimate the number of people who have a health issue that might lead to denial of coverage by an insurance company. That describes a group of people who are at risk. What’s missing is an estimate of the number of people who actually run into the problem of being denied coverage. A limited analysis emerged from the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2009. Using data from four of the country’s largest private insurers, committee investigators found that the companies had denied coverage to one out of seven people based on pre-existing conditions during a three-year period. The denial rate rose each year, increasing by nearly 50 percent over the three years while at the same time, the number of new applications for coverage only rose by about 16 percent. Survey says Another line of data comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation and its monthly tracking polls. In June 2013, Kaiser reported that 49 percent of adults said that they or a family member has heart disease, diabetes, cancer or another condition that generally triggers an issue with insurance companies. Within that group, about a fourth of them reported that coverage had been denied or higher premiums had been charged due to a pre-existing condition. This is far from a perfect fit with the other studies. To say someone in your family has a health condition is essentially reporting at the household level, while the GAO and other studies were estimating the number of individuals. And if we do the math, it seems like about an eighth, or 12 percent of the households had actually run into a problem with a health insurance company. The Kaiser survey does affirm that the problem is substantive and relatively widespread, although not necessarily as broad as the higher estimates in the studies. Our ruling Schakowsky said that half of all adults suffer from a pre-existing condition. Studies reflect a range of estimates and Schakowsky’s figure falls at the high end. A government analysis points to a mid-range estimate of 32 percent, a significant fraction of the adult population. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CFE280>],/factchecks/2013/aug/07/jan-schakowsky/schakowsky-says-half-all-adults-have-pre-existing-/

Wendy Davis says Texas women make more than $8,000 less than men for same jobs
","In a July 29, 2013, email blast, state Sen. Wendy Davis wrote, ""Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job."" The Fort Worth Democrat concluded her note by calling out Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s June 2013 veto of legislation that would have changed state law to mimic the 2009 federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to sue their employers over pay discrimination. Proponents said the Texas law was needed so women had recourse to state courts, not just federal ones. Pay gaps persist, PolitiFact colleagues have noted, though two claims like the one aired by Davis drew Mostly False ratings. Former President Jimmy Carter said in June 2013 that U.S. women are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. President Barack Obama said in a 2012 campaign ad that U.S. women are paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men. Both statements relied on data that did not speak to individuals doing the same or similar jobs, also overlooking variations in hours worked and lengths of tenure. Austin lawyer Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, forwarded Davis’ email blast and asked us to investigate her pay-gap statement. By email, Smith wrote, ""Does the management at the (Austin) American-Statesman pay you less than your male counterparts? Seems like something from the 1950s."" Senator draws on 2010 data By email, Sonya Grogg, Davis’ chief of staff, told us that the $8,355 figure came from an April 2012 report from the National Partnership for Women & Families, an advocacy group for workplace fairness and other issues. The report drew on 2010 data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicating the median pay for a woman working full-time, year round in Texas was $33,689 annually that year, while the median pay for a man was $42,044. The report said these numbers amount to a ""yearly gap of $8,355 between full-time working men and women in the state."" According to the report, that means Texas women made 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. By this measure, too, Texas ranked better than 37 states, the partnership said. In Vermont, which had the smallest difference in pay, women were paid 84 cents for every dollar paid to men. Wyoming had the widest wage gap, with women making 64 cents for every dollar paid to men. More recent numbers suggest a narrower difference. Census Bureau data from 2012 found a wage gap of $7,859 between Texas men and women working full time, year round, according to an April 2013 report by the partnership. Cited information did not compare the same jobs Another salient wrinkle is that Davis referred to a gap between Texas men and women doing the same jobs, which the partnership’s reports did not do. By phone, Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us the figure aired by Davis is a comparison between all men and women, regardless of the type of work they do. In reality, for instance, more men hold higher-paying jobs. In Texas in 2011, men accounted for nearly 78 percent of workers in the higher-paid computer, engineering and science fields, according to Census Bureau data. Meanwhile, the data show that women account for nearly three in four workers in the lower-paid fields of education, training and library jobs. Studies have shown that, when occupational differences are accounted for, more than half of the gender wage gap is explained, Abbot said. She pointed us to Cornell University labor economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, who wrote a February 2007 paper titled, ""The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone Far Enough?"" The paper says that 53 percent of the gender wage gap stems from variation in job, industry and union status between the genders. Grogg acknowledged in her email on the senator’s behalf that applying the figure Davis cited to any specific job ""doesn’t work,"" though she also pointed out that a lawsuit filed in 2012 by the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that women in two state agencies made up to $23,157 less than men who had the same job as them, and said that ""partially verifies our statement."" In late 2012, the state agreed to pay $175,000 to settle the suit regarding the Texas Department of Agriculture and General Land Office. Relevant research Next, we looked for on-point research on pay gaps between Texas men and women doing the same jobs. An expert on Texas demographics, Steve Murdock, who directs Rice University’s Hobby Center for the Study of Texas, directed us to a center associate director, Mike Cline, who by email sent us 2011 Census Bureau data specific to Texas. In more than half of 36 listed occupations, the pay gap that year exceeded the $8,355 cited by Davis. The largest gap -- $31,628 -- was between Texas men and women in health diagnosing and treating professions. The smallest difference, $71, was for men and women employed in installation, maintenance and repair. (See our chart based on what Cline provided here.) Even though the pay gap was more than $8,355 in most of the jobs listed, that doesn’t mean Davis is right, Cline said by telephone. There might be a smaller number of women employed in the jobs with the largest difference in earnings, and a larger number of women employed in the jobs with the smallest difference in earnings. If that’s the case, then more women could be working jobs with a wage gap less than $8,355. But, it could also be the other way around, Cline said. The lead economist at PayScale, a Seattle company that compiles salary information enabling clients to evaluate wages, counseled against reaching pay-gap conclusions based solely on such census data. Katie Bardaro said by telephone that the census figures do not control for differences in years of work experience, educational attainment or companies. For instance, Bardaro said, women may have fewer years in the work force; the median job tenure for men 25 years and older is about one month longer than for women, according to the labor bureau. We had reached out to the company after spotting its 2013 national study of the median pay for men and women in each of about 150 jobs, controlling for ""years of experience, education, company size, management responsibilities, skills and more,"" according to its website. The study also controlled for job-specific factors, for instance considering the types of offices where nurses worked. After controlling for numerous factors, ""the wage gap all but disappeared,"" Bardaro told us. Using information from 13,500 survey respondents, PayScale found, for example, that among civil engineers, registered nurses and human resource administrators, there was virtually no difference between what men and women earned. But there were noticeable differences for some upper-level management and executive positions. Male CEOs made $23,000 more than their female counterparts, according to PayScale. Bardaro said she attributes that to qualities that are hard to measure, such as relationships with co-workers. Estimated Texas gap In Texas, which scored better than 24 states, PayScale saw a $2,000 gap between median pay for men and women in similar jobs, according to numbers Bardaro sent us by email. (See our chart of this information here.) There’s another reason why the $8,355 figure has weaknesses. Men might work longer hours, Bardaro said. Davis’ statistic comes from the earnings of full-time, year-round workers, which the Census Bureau defines as those who ""usually worked 35 hours or more per week for 50 to 52 weeks."" There’s a range of how many hours full-time workers log, and men are more likely than women to be on the job for 41 hours or more per week, according to the labor bureau. Because more men work overtime, that should translate into higher earnings for them -- because they are paid more, or because their longer hours lead to more job success -- and contribute to the wage gap. Though more nuanced analysis shows that job differences explain much of the pay gap, experts agree that much of it still cannot be accounted for. That’s where sexism comes in, some say. Even when looking at salaries job by job, men still make more than women in almost every single field. Our ruling Davis declared an average $8,355 earnings gap between Texas men and women working ""the very same job."" In 2010, that was the general gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women, according to federal figures, while the 2012 gap was nearly $500 less.   More significantly, the research that Davis tapped did not drill down to salaries for workers doing the same jobs. We found 2013 survey results indicating that among Texas workers with comparable professional experiences, there was a $2,000 gap between the median pay for men and women in the same or similar jobs. This statement, based on an outdated figure that also didn’t speak to people with the same jobs, still has an element of truth; sizable pay gaps exist. We rate the claim as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C178F00>],/factchecks/2013/aug/07/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-men-paid-more-8000-more-women-sam/

Alan Krueger, top economist to Obama, says most new jobs since health care law passed are full time
","Policymakers and pundits are spending a lot of time these days talking about part-time jobs -- whether they are becoming more common at the expense of full-time jobs, and how problematic that is. Republicans note that President Barack Obama’s health care law requires larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers, which they say gives companies an incentive to cut workers’ hours so much that they become part-time workers and thus exempt from the health insurance mandate. And beyond the question of Obamacare’s incentives, some economists worry that since the most recent recession, companies have been unusually willing to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers. We recently noticed two seemingly contradictory comments on this topic -- one from a Republican, one from a Democrat -- and thought it would be worthwhile checking both. In this item, we will check a comment made by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, during an interview with Sara Eisen of Bloomberg television. Eisen asked Krueger whether we’re ""creating a part-time economy. The news is filled with stories of small businesses and colleges cutting back worker's hours or putting a freeze on hiring."" He responded, ""I think that's highly misleading. Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions."" (The Affordable Care Act is the more formal name of Obama’s health care law.) In the other item, we checked a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that ""this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time."" These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For Krueger, we checked the change in full-time and part-time employment between March 2010 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here’s the summary:   Date Full-time employees Part-time employees March 2010 111,195,000 27,527,000 July 2013 116,090,000 28,233,000 Change +4,895,000 +706,000   So Krueger is right -- 87 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from full-time jobs. Still, we will note that if you use a shorter time horizon, such as calendar year 2013, a large percentage of jobs created were part-time positions. In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument. Our ruling Krueger said that ""since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions."" The statistics show that 87 percent of the increase in jobs between March 2010 and July 2013 consisted of full-time jobs. A shorter time frame would show the opposite pattern, but on the numbers, Krueger is right.

In this item, we will check a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a response to one of Obama’s Saturday radio addresses. ""In the past, most new jobs were full time, but, this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time,"" Collins said. ""Under this troubling trend, more workers will find their hours and their earnings reduced. Jobs will be lost. This is especially disturbing as our country is still battling high unemployment."" The other comment we will check separately is by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers: ""Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions."" These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For Collins, we looked at the change in full-time and part-time employment between December 2012 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here’s the summary:   Date Full-time employees Part-time employees December 2012 115,868,000 27,502,000 July 2013 116,090,000 28,233,000 Change, Dec-July +222,000 +731,000   So Collins has a point -- 77 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from part-time jobs. We think a 3-to-1 ratio qualifies as ""overwhelming."" Still, we will offer a few caveats. • A large majority of these jobs are being taken by people who want to work part time. BLS breaks part-time jobs into two categories -- people working part-time for economic reasons (meaning they want a full-time job, but have to settle for a part-time job), and people working part-time for noneconomic reasons (because they prefer a part-time schedule to a full-time schedule).   Date Part time for economic reasons Part time for noneconomic reasons Dec. 2012 7,918,000 18,763,000 July 2013 8,245,000 19,128,000   In other words, about 70 percent of people working part time right now are doing so because they want to work part time, not because the economy is forcing them to. This doesn’t mean there are no problems associated with a rise in part-time jobs -- such a shift could make it harder for the recovery to gain momentum, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Still, it’s important to point out that most people taking part-time jobs aren’t being forced into those jobs purely because of the economy. • Timing matters. If you use a longer time horizon, a large percentage of jobs created were full-time positions. ""Over longer periods, a much smaller percentage of job gains have taken the form of part-time jobs,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument. Our ruling Collins said, ""This year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time."" The statistics show that 77 percent of the increase in jobs between December 2012 and July 2013 consisted of part-time jobs.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Nancy  Gordeuk']","
Nontraditional education centers face change in policy
","School is starting for most Georgia students. And a group of parents and education leaders is warning about changes to the state’s class credit policies. A reader asked us to check out a claim that has been making the rounds, including in a posting found on the Lilburn Patch website. The posting, by Nancy Gordeuk, claims that the state Department of Education is implementing a policy change that will limit parents’ choices of education options. ""Do you realize that the Georgia Department of Education has implemented a new policy beginning in August that states that public schools will no longer accept credits from home school entities or non-traditional education?"" Gordeuk writes in the Patch item. That seemed like a rather significant policy for the state to change, and we investigate the claim further. Gordeuk, a teacher, founded and operates TNT Academy in Lilburn. According to its website, TNT Academy is a nontraditional education center serving middle and high school students engaged in independent study. The academy also provides credit recovery for public school students who have failed a class. TNT Academy lists its accreditation from the Georgia Accrediting Commission along with the Chancellor’s Office of the University of Georgia and the Georgia HOPE scholarship program for nontraditional study centers. Gordeuk and other parents and nontraditional educators have started a petition to change the new policy they say will force parents to use only public schools. She said she was notified about the policy change in May when a television reporter came to her academy claiming the facility’s testing standards were not tough enough. (Gordeuk says Gwinnett County was trying to shut down her school). That story, reported by Channel 2 Action News, notes that Gwinnett, where TNT Academy is located, was changing its policies to ensure all students -- including home school and private academy students -- were held to the same academic standards. So, was the policy change a county or state effort? Sort of a mixture of both. In April, the Georgia Department of Education updated its policies for accepting high school transfer credits and grades. The new rules require local school systems to develop their own policies for validating credit for courses taken through home study programs, nontraditional educational centers and non-accredited schools. The local systems are required to outline procedures for determining whether transfer courses meet the state-adopted curriculum, among other items. ""What we’re saying in the policy is at the local level they have to develop policy around who they accept courses from,"" Matt Cardoza, a spokesman for the state Education Department, told us. The state rules do not include a provision grandfathering existing centers and home school. Cardoza could not provide information on how Gwinnett’s school system was handling the state requirements, so we went to the source. Two months after the state Education Department approved its new policy, Gwinnett changed its policy on awarding units of credit and accepting transfer credits. The policy, approved by the Gwinnett school board on June 20, does not change the requirements for home schooled students, Gwinnett schools spokeswoman Sloan Roach told us. But students at nontraditional educational centers, such as Gordeuk’s TNT Academy, will have to follow the process currently in place for home schooled students. They will now have to take a state-mandated test or one provided by a local school system in order to validate the credit. Grades for course credit awarded through this process will be ""pass"" only and not appear as letter or number grades on report cards. High school transfer students must take any state-mandated tests including End-of-Course Tests. ""In the past, (Gwinnett schools) would accept credits from anybody accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission,"" Gordeuk said. With the changes, ""I think it all comes down to an issue of Gwinnett not wanting people to know how many of their kids are failing their classes."" To sum up, Nancy Gordeuk, founder of a nontraditional education academy in Gwinnett County, said that the state Education Department changed its policies and will no longer accept class credits from home schools and facilities like hers. In April, the Georgia Department of Education did update its transfer credit policy. But the changes pass the decisions about accepting credits to local school districts. The local districts can determine which credits they will accept and from which education centers. In Gwinnett County, where Gordeuk’s facility is located, students seeking transfer credits from these centers must first pass a county-issued test. Gordeuk is correct in noting that the transfer credit policy has changed. But the local school districts can make the decisions on how that process is handled. We rated Gordeuk’s claim Half True.

ForAmerica says Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals
","An image posted on Facebook by the conservative group ForAmerica says, ""The Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals!"" ForAmerica, which according to its website is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Reston, Va., urges Facebookers to ""like"" the image ""if you agree this is wrong!"" Well, turns out it is wrong -- just not in the way ForAmerica meant. ""That’s an old story,"" Houston National Cemetery director Mat Williams told us by phone. ""We got a bunch of calls about that. But it’s not true."" ForAmerica spokesman Keith Appell told us the image and an accompanying blog entry, posted July 11, 2013, were based on a item posted the day before on the conservative Breitbart.com website and a July 9 report from the Family Research Council, a conservative, Christian group based in Washington, D.C. The Breitbart item and the council’s report said that on July 26, 2011, U.S. Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, ""determined that Houston National Cemetery was preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals."" Such allegations about the 430-acre cemetery in northwest Houston resulted in legal action in 2011 that drew national attention, according to Houston Chronicle news stories from June 28, 2011, Sept. 22, 2011, and Dec. 12, 2011 and an Oct. 20, 2011, KHOU-TV news story. U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes granted a temporary restraining order May 26, 2011, that allowed a pastor to deliver his Memorial Day invocation as written after the clergyman said then-director Arleen Ocasio told him not to say ""Jesus Christ"" in the service held at the cemetery, where nearly 70,000 service members and veterans and their spouses have been interred since its dedication in 1965. Ocasio, according to a Aug. 30, 2011, New York Times news story, ""began enforcing a little-noticed 2007 policy that prohibits volunteer honor guards from reading recitations — including religious ones — in their funeral rituals, unless families specifically request them."" U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs officials said the policy originated after ""complaints about religious words or icons being inserted unrequested into veterans’ funerals,"" the Times story said. Later that year, the Chronicle reported, Veterans’ Affairs settled a lawsuit that alleged officials had told local veterans and volunteers not to use religious words such as ""Jesus"" and ""God"" during funerals at the cemetery. In the settlement reached Sept. 21, 2011, the VA did not admit fault but agreed not to interfere with religious speech at funerals unless relatives objected, according to the next day’s Chronicle news story. Since then, current cemetery director Williams said, ""We haven’t had any incidents; no problems."" U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, and a Culberson aide have visited the cemetery, he said, and veterans are there every day: ""If there was anything like that, they would be in an uproar. But no, it’s a phony story."" Veterans’ families aren’t restricted from practicing any religion, he said. ""It’s their service; they can do any religious ceremony they want."" Leaders of Houston volunteer groups that were plaintiffs in the 2011 lawsuit gave us similar accounts. ""Everything is running very smooth there. There are no problems,"" said Cheryl Whitfield, director of National Memorial Ladies, whose 34 members sometimes are, she said, the only mourners during funerals at the cemetery. ""We attend all of the burials at Houston National Cemetery every day. There are anywhere from four to 12 a day. So we attend approximately 60 a week. And we give our condolences to the family,"" Whitfield told us by phone. ""We use God’s name, we use Jesus’ name; we’re able to say anything to help console the family."" Her group finds out in advance about relatives’ wishes regarding religion’s role in the funeral, she said. ""We pretty well know ahead of time if they have an issue with us saying ‘God bless you’ or anything."" The current commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars district that brought the lawsuit, Bill Shaffer, told us by phone that he’s been with District 4 for about 16 years and knew of no such problems before or since the 2011 events. ""I know we’ve had Jewish people, I know we’ve had Muslims, we’ve had Christian Science, Baptist, Catholic,"" he said. ""We adhere to whoever it is. That veteran deserves his last rites and we go along with whatever the family wishes, and I just hope that the government continues to do that."" The VFW has been a Christian organization since its founding in 1899, he said, and the team from District 4 that provides funeral honors performs a ritual that can include a 21-gun salute, presentation of the American flag, a chaplain and prayers. ""It’s up to them. Whatever part of the ritual they want, we do,"" he said. ""If they want the entire ritual, we do the entire ritual."" ForAmerica spokesman Appell, when informed that we’d found no evidence Christian prayers were being prevented, told us the group ""believed the information to be current."" Our ruling ForAmerica said the Houston National Cemetery ""is preventing"" Christian prayer at military funerals. The group based its claim on recent online references to a congressman’s claim in July 2011. We found no current restrictions or even proof that anyone was stopped from saying a Christian prayer in the past. To the contrary, volunteers and the current cemetery director told us Christian prayers are welcome.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Veterans', 'Michelle Nunn']","
Senate candidate pushes for war vets in Medicaid plan
","Democrat Michelle Nunn recently jumped into Georgia’s race for the U.S. Senate and talked about a troubling issue: military veterans without health insurance. Nunn, who is campaigning as a problem-solver and not a partisan politician, responded to a question about the controversial federal health care law, widely called ""Obamacare,"" by saying she supports efforts to suture trouble spots, but not to repeal it. Nunn then added in an exclusive interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog that by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the new law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the accuracy of Nunn’s claim. Nunn was CEO of the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan volunteer organization inspired by then-President George H.W. Bush. Her father, conservative Democrat Sam Nunn, represented Georgia in the U.S. Senate from 1972 to 1997. Her entry into the race was widely welcomed by Democrats and by Republicans who’ve portrayed Nunn as a liberal who’ll be in lockstep with President Barack Obama. She’s never run for political office. An estimated 650,000 Georgians would be eligible for Medicaid if the state agreed to expand coverage. The health law calls for states to expand coverage to individuals with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $26,300 for a family of three. The federal government would cover the entire cost of the expansion for the first three years and at least 90 percent after that. Many Republicans, including Gov. Nathan Deal, do not believe Washington can keep such a commitment considering the federal government’s financial challenges. Critics worry the state could eventually get stuck with the tab. States have the option to participate in the Medicaid expansion. Deal declined. ""The state simply can’t afford to expand Medicaid as Obamacare is now structured,"" Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said. ""The majority of our population will bear huge new costs as individuals covering their families and as taxpayers."" We read several accounts that Georgia has one of the largest populations of veterans in the nation. Georgia’s Department of Veterans Services estimates that there are 776,000 veterans in the state. Not all veterans are eligible for medical benefits through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, thus some of them are uninsured, said Tim Sweeney, director of health policy for the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, which has done research on the subject. Priority for benefits goes to veterans injured in combat, those receiving pension benefits and those determined to be disabled. Nunn’s deputy campaign manager, Zac Petkanas, said the candidate’s claim was based on two reports released earlier this year. One was a nationwide study of uninsured veterans compiled by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The institute describes itself as a nonpartisan research center, but its leadership includes several former Clinton administration officials. The second report was an examination of the potential impact of Medicaid expansion on veterans by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. The Urban Institute report said it used U.S. Census Bureau data to come up with its estimate. The institute found there are about 1.3 million uninsured veterans younger than 65. The estimate is in line with several news reports on the topic in recent years. The institute found 535,000 of those uninsured veterans were eligible for Medicaid under the income guidelines set by the federal government. ""We used data from the American Community Survey, which asks about veteran status, health insurance status, and various sources of income; the income measure we used approximates the way income will be counted under the Affordable Care Act,"" said Jennifer Haley, a co-author of the report. The report found that 43 percent of all poor, uninsured veterans reside in seven states, and Georgia is one of them. About 56,000 Georgia veterans were uninsured, the report found. Of that number, 24,900 of them fell within the Medicaid eligibility guidelines, the Urban Institute found. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported about the study in May. The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute also estimated 25,000 Georgia veterans would be eligible for Medicaid under the rules in a report it released in May. Sweeney said its report was primarily based on prior Urban Institute research. ""They’re as robust and credible as it gets when it comes to research like this,"" Sweeney said. Slightly more than 6 percent of veterans nationwide lack health insurance, according to a 2011 profile of U.S. veterans done by the Department of Veterans Affairs. If the numbers are similar for Georgia veterans, that amounts to about 50,000 of them without insurance, which is close to what the Urban Institute found. The profile does not specify how many of them would be eligible for Medicaid. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep its own data on veterans without health insurance. A Census Bureau official suggested we contact the Urban Institute for such information, noting it did a study on the topic and may be a good resource. State officials said they did not have research on how many veterans could be added to Georgia’s Medicaid rolls. ""The state can’t cherry-pick which groups of people would be eligible for expanded coverage under Medicaid. Nunn is making a political argument, not a policy argument, so it’s not something we’d have numbers on,"" Robinson said. To sum up, Nunn claimed 25,000 military veterans could be added to Georgia’s Medicaid rolls if the state would sign up for the federal government’s plan under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. The claim was based on research that hasn’t been reviewed for a second opinion and appears on target. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E1F780>],/factchecks/2013/aug/06/michelle-nunn/senate-candidate-pushes-war-vets-medicaid-plan/

Eric Cantor says the federal deficit is 'growing'
","During an interview on Fox News Sunday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., took aim at red ink in the federal government. Cantor said, ""What we are trying to do is fund the government and make sure also that we take away the kinds of things that are standing in the way of a growing economy (and) a better health care, and all the while keeping our eye focused on trying to deal with the ultimate problem, which is this growing deficit."" There’s one problem: The federal deficit isn’t ""growing."" At least not now. First, a refresher on what a deficit is. If revenues are bigger than spending, you have a surplus. If spending is bigger than revenues, you have a deficit. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal deficit -- the amount by which the government has been spending more than it has been taking in -- has been declining since peaking in 2009:   Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as percentage of GDP 2008 $459 billion 3.2 percent 2009 $1.413 trillion 10.1 percent 2010 $1.294 trillion 9.0 percent 2011 $1.296 trillion 8.7 percent 2012 $1.089 trillion 7.0 percent 2013 (projected) $ 642 billion 4.0 percent   So, the deficit trendline has been generally downward, both in raw dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product. And the CBO projects that the deficit will continue to go down for two more years:   Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as percentage of GDP 2014 (projected) $560 billion 3.4 percent 2015 (projected) $378 billion 2.1 percent   If CBO is on target, then by 2015, the deficit will be roughly a quarter of what it was in 2009. In other words, Cantor is wrong about what has been happening to the deficit, and what is projected to happen in the near future. After 2015, however, Cantor has a point -- the deficit begins growing again, according to CBO projections:   Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as percentage of GDP 2016 $432 billion 2.3 percent 2017 $482 billion 2.4 percent 2018 $542 billion 2.6 percent 2019 $648 billion 3.0 percent 2020 $733 billion 3.2 percent 2021 $782 billion 3.3 percent 2022 $889 billion 3.6 percent 2023 $895 billion 3.5 percent   ""The current baseline has deficits growing again in 2016, and even with his proposed tax increases, deficits are set to begin growing again in the out-years under President Obama’s own budget proposals,"" said Rory Cooper, Cantor’s spokesman. Cantor, he said, ""is equally concerned with this long-term deficit trend"" as he is with the shrinkage of the deficit in recent years. We should also note that, despite the recent progress in shrinking the deficit, the federal debt continues to grow -- just more slowly than before. The debt refers to the accumulation of all prior yearly deficits, offset by any yearly surpluses. So until there’s a surplus -- and there hasn’t been one since fiscal 2001 -- the debt keeps growing. The public debt is projected to grow from $11.3 trillion in fiscal 2012 to higher than $19 trillion in 2023. As a percentage of GDP, the rise is more modest, from 72.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to 72.9 percent in 2023, according to CBO. Our ruling Cantor said that the federal deficit is ""growing."" Annual federal deficits are not growing right now, and they are not projected to grow through 2015, a point at which the deficit will have shrunk by three-quarters since 2009. By this standard, Cantor is wrong. However, unless policies are changed, deficits are projected to grow again in 2016 and beyond, according to the CBO.

Perdue touts state's rising graduation rates
","
With the announcement that Georgia's high school graduation rate topped 80 percent, Gov. Sonny Perdue took a celebratory tour of the state's standout schools.

Perdue thanked students and staff at schools across North Georgia and along the South Georgia coast for their hard work. He promised he'd reach the 80 percent mark by 2010. With their help, he kept his word.

Or did he?

Other measures say Georgia's rate is lower by as much as 15 points. And while the state Department of Education reports it's making great strides, one group said last year that Georgia's graduation rate is so low Georgia's children are in ""crisis."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has uncovered multiple problems with how the rate is reported.

Is Georgia's graduation rate really 80 percent? We went to the Georgia Department of Education to sort the issue out.

Raising the rate to 80 percent by 2010 has been one of Perdue's major education initiatives. In 2005, he signed on to a national effort by the National Governors Association to standardize how states determine the graduation rate and improve the figure's accuracy. Under the new method, which the state will report for the first time this school year,school officials expect the rate to drop. 

Perdue also created the position of ""graduation coach,"" and he announced at a 2008 national education convention that it helped reduce dropouts by 10 percent in one year. The coaches identify high school and middle school students at risk of dropping out, find them mentors, organize tutoring programs, and help them sign up to retake classes they failed.

Now, back to the graduation rate. There are lots of ways to calculate it. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. They can vary greatly. For instance, some count only students who graduate on time. Others count graduates who take longer.

Georgia uses what's commonly called the ""leaver rate,"" a method used by 32 other states. The Education Department puts the exact graduation rate at 80.8 percent. It includes students who take more than four years to graduate.

The leaver rate is not the actual percentage of students who graduate. Until recently, the state Education Department lacked a record keeping system that could track that.

Instead, it's an estimate. To calculate it, you take the number of students who receive regular graduation diplomas and divide it by the following: the number of regular diploma recipients, plus the number of students who receive special education diplomas and certificates of attendance, plus the number of dropouts from grades 9-12.

State officials acknowledge the measure is imperfect. The new method will be more accurate. 

Still, it's a fair accountability measure, they said. Since the state has used the same method to calculate graduation rates since Perdue took office in 2003, a year-to-year comparison is valid. Those numbers show the graduation rate surged from about 63 percent to 80 percent, said Perdue spokesman Bert Brantley.

Another advantage of Georgia's leaver rate is it's the most current data around. Graduation rates calculated with other measures have yet to be updated with numbers from two or three years ago. That means they don't measure the impact of the graduation coach program, Brantley said. 

But AJC PolitiFact Georgia thinks there are other shortcomings with the leaver rate that should be acknowledged, and which cast Georgia's apparent success in a different light.

The most perplexing is that the state's calculation misses thousands of students.

In 2008, the state Department of Education could not account for nearly 20,000 students they marked as transfers, although it's not clear they went. 

The state's 2010 graduation numbers raise similar questions. Georgia's Class of 2010 entered high school in 2006 at about 146,000 strong, according to the state's figures.

But when the state calculated its 2010 graduation rate, it pegged the combined number of Georgia students who graduated plus those who didn't make it at about 113,300.

That means this year's graduation calculation does not include about 33,000 of the Class of 2010's original members. A portion likely went to private school or are being home schooled, but given the department's past problems, it's far from clear that that's where all of them went. 

Another problem is that while Georgia's leaver rate soared during Perdue's term, other widely used measures did not.

Consider the public high school averaged freshman graduation rate, which is collected and published by the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. Department of Education's main data clearinghouse, and graduation calculations from Editorial Projects in Education, a nonprofit education research center.

The averaged freshman graduation rate uses the number of on-time graduates with regular diplomas and an estimate of the freshman class size four years earlier to come up with its rate.

The Editorial Projects in Education rate multiplies together how many students were promoted on time each year to get its rate.

According to Editorial Projects in Education, Georgia's graduation rate grew between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007, the most recent school year available, by about 1.4 points to 57.8 percent.

During that same time period, the U.S. Department of Education's averaged freshman graduation rate for Georgia grew by 3.3 points to 64.1 percent.

In those same years, Georgia reported its graduation rate grew by 9 points to 72.3 percent.

These discrepancies may occur because the rates count different things, said state Department of Education spokesman Matt Cardoza. Georgia's leaver rate includes five-year graduates, but the other two measures count only those who finish on schedule.

Georgia officials think it's important to count students who take extra time, because it shows schools are committed to students who need more help.

""If we keep them [high school students] five years instead of four, and that helps them graduate, we're all for it,"" Cardoza said.

Still, it's difficult to tell which measure is more accurate, said John Robert Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist. He was part of a major effort by the National Academy of Education that studied how to improve the reliability of graduation rates.

""They're all sort of in the ballpark of not being that good,"" Warren said of the measures.

In the case of leaver rates, experts agree they often inflate graduation figures. That's because the formula depends so heavily on a state's dropout rate. Experts agree dropouts are easy to undercount. A typical dropout doesn't bother to tell his school he no longer intends to show up, and schools often don't have the resources or incentive to track down missing students. 

Another problem is shared by all measures. They're only as accurate as the data used to calculate them. In Georgia, there's evidence that at least some of this data has serious problems. 

In June 2009, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found the state couldn't locate nearly 20,000 students who local districts said transferred to other Georgia schools
during the 2008 school year, but who never re-enrolled. 

In April, the U.S. Department of Education rebuked the state Department of Education and Clayton County and determined the county's 2006-2007 dropout rates were undercounted.

A state Education Department spokesman said they enhanced their procedures, but did not correct older data.

In August, another Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found that thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students vanished from its rolls during the past eight years, and this may be the primary reason behind the system's rising graduation rates. Many students were marked as transfers, even though there was no evidence they re-enrolled elsewhere. 

So what does all of this information say about Georgia's graduation rate?

If one thing is clear, it's this: No one knows the state's true graduation rate.

Although the state Education Department said it has improved its reporting methods, the way the agency calculates the rate and the data's quality still have enough unresolved problems that it's hard to say whether the state actually met Perdue's goal.

It's also not clear how much the state graduation rate has improved. Georgia said its rate has soared during Perdue's term, but one measure said it's flat and another said it rose by a few percentage points. Those other rates don't measure the exact same thing. They also use old data, so it's possible that fresh calculations will show a spike in rates. But at this point, it's doubtful they'll register a 17-point change as Georgia's leaver rate did.

This means that while the high 2009-2010 graduation rate may be an encouraging sign, it's not quite a cause for celebration.

Perdue's statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. By PolitiFact's standards, it rates a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A762C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/12/sonny-perdue/perdue-touts-states-rising-graduation-rates/

Kathie Glass says more than 25 percent of state budget funds services to non-citizens
","
Libertarian Texas gubernatorial nominee Kathie Glass finished third; she also didn't get to hand-deliver her letter to the re-elected winner, Republican Rick Perry, urging him to send troops to the Texas-Mexico border.

Glass touted the letter during an Oct. 19 debate at Austin's KLRU-TV, Channel 18, then turned to the impact of illegal immigrants on state spending. ""We have budgetary problems that are serious and (that are) going to get worse,"" Glass said. ""These taxpayer-funded services going to non-citizens is over 25 percent of our (two-year) $180 billion (state) budget.""

Whoa! Non-citizens cost the state more than $45 billion every two years?

Glass told us later she'd gleaned the 25 percent stat from an online post by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston. We found Patrick's statement, dated May 1, on his Facebook page: ""We need to control our border and determine who comes into our country. If we do invite workers to take jobs Americans will not take, we cannot allow those workers to bring entire families with them. While we do not have exact figure, an estimated 25 percent of our $180 billion budget goes to pay for illegals in Texas.""

In an interview, Patrick told us that no one knows the state costs of providing services to illegal immigrants. He said too that he should have said ""up to 25 percent."" Later that day, Patrick said his percentage speaks to all costs, including costs to local governments. ""Is it accurate to say it's 25 percent of every state dollar? That may not be accurate,"" Patrick said.

Patrick said factors behind his estimate include the number of public school students not proficient in English which, he said, can cost about 30 percent to 40 percent more to educate compared to English-savvy students. ""On top of that, the law does not allow our principals to ask students how many are here illegally,"" Patrick said. ""So we really don't know.""

Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Suzanne Marchman told us via e-mail that schools might ask into a student's legal residency status. However, she said, a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidated a state law restricting access to the schools to legal residents. Hence, she said, districts cannot exclude any student based on their immigration status.

We were unable to verify the added cost percentages listed by Patrick, but we dug up some numbers on state aid to educate students with limited English proficiency. An agency pocket guide to public school statistics states that 17 percent of the state's more than 4.7 million students in 2008-09 had limited English proficiency; that's 799,000 students. Due to state school funding formulas, each district in 2010-11 gets an average adjusted allotment of $5,933 per student. Marchman said that each district fields an additional $577 -- a little less than 10 percent -- for each student with limited English proficiency. That makes for a statewide additional expenditure on LEP students of around $461 million.

We wondered how many illegal immigrants attend Texas schools. Marchman said the agency does not know. This year, though, the Washington-based Pew Hispanic Center, whose declared mission is to ""improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation,"" drew on 2009 population surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate that a little more than 500,000 Texas public school students are children of unauthorized immigrants, spokesman Jeffrey Passel told us via e-mail. Passel said almost 70 percent of those children are U.S. citizens, with the rest being unauthorized immigrants.

Patrick said other factors include health care and criminal justice costs. As examples, he noted that at a Houston hospital, 70 percent of babies are born to mothers who aren't legal U.S. residents, a claim we confirmed earlier this year. Patrick also said nearly 15 percent of individuals in state prison for driving while intoxicated are illegal residents. Patrick's office later told us that, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 914 of 5,943 individuals in prison for DWI convictions, 15 percent, claim foreign citizenship. TDCJ spokesman Jason Clark told us Patrick's numbers reflected the prison system's DWI convicts claiming foreign citizenship as of May 31, 2010. In an e-mail, Clark said the state spent $47.50 a day on average per offender in fiscal 2008; a reasonable estimate of the total 2010 cost of imprisoning DWI offenders claiming foreign citizenship is nearly $16 million.

We wondered if anyone had added up the overall costs of illegal immigrants to the state; some have tried.

In December 2006, then-Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn issued a report on the economic impact on Texas of its undocumented immigrant population. It concludes that illegal immigrants paid more into state government in taxes and fees in fiscal 2005 than they cost the state, though local governments and hospitals spent nearly $929 million more on illegal immigrants than they recovered in revenue.

Strayhorn's report says that state educational, health care and incarceration costs due to illegal immigrants totaled $1.16 billion that year, while state revenues collected from illegal immigrants totaled $1.6 billion--nearly $425 million more than state expenditures related to the residents. The largest cost factor to the state was education, followed by incarceration and health care. Consumption taxes and fees, the largest of which is the sales tax, were the largest revenue generators from undocumented immigrants, the report says.

We made a run at applying the Strayhorn report to the latest state budget.

Taking into account inflation, the comptroller's estimated state costs due to illegal immigrants would be $1.3 billion by 2010, while payments to the state by illegal immigrants would be $1.8 billion, for a net gain of $500 million. We then doubled the cost figure to estimate state expenditures on services to illegal immigrants for the 2010-11 state budget period. The resulting $2.6 billion equals 1.4 percent of $182 billion in state, federal and other funds budgeted by state legislators for the period.

More recently, Austin consultant James Aalan Bernsen wrote a 2009 analysis of the costs of illegal immigration to Texas for the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, which advocates for stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States. Bernsen's 13-page report draws on U.S. Census population estimates and research by the Pew Hispanic Center and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says it seeks to improve border security and stop illegal immigration. The report lays out Bernsen's methodology for reaching an annual net cost to Texas estimate of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.

We doubled Bernsen's high-end net cost to get a two-year estimate, with the result that services to illegal immigrants by his methodology account for about 7 percent of the 2010-11 state budget. In an interview, Bernsen termed not credible the ""over 25 percent"" figure aired by Glass; the cost to the state of serving illegal immigrants, Bernsen said, is ""not to that extreme.""

Finally, we asked the Pew Hispanic Center and FAIR if they had estimated the cost to the state of Texas from serving illegal immigrants. Passel said the Pew center doesn't have that information. FAIR spokeswoman Kristen Williamson said that group estimates that illegal immigration in 2010 is costing Texas taxpayers nearly $8.9 billion a year, though Williamson said it has not broken out costs solely related to the state budget. ""It could take one researcher four or five years to comb through the state budget to come up with all the costs,"" Williamson speculated.

Summing up: Glass based her claim on a months' old Facebook post that she evidently didn't verify and that the senator who made the post says may be overstated. A 2009 analysis by an anti-illegal immigration group pegs the cost of services to illegal immigrants at a figure that's about 7 percent of the state's budget -- up to $12 billion over two years, well short of the $45 billion suggested by Glass. And the only relevant state agency report we found said that state revenue from illegal immigrants exceeded what they cost the state budget in fiscal 2005.

Significantly, there's a paucity of information on which to ground such estimates.

Regardless, we rate the statement so far off, it's ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280967892C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/12/kathie-glass/kathie-glass-says-more-25-percent-state-budget-fun/

E-mail claims Obama's finance team wants a 1-percent tax on every banking transaction
","
Is President Obama's finance team scheming with Congress to place a 1-percent tax on every banking transaction you make?

That's the assertion of an e-mail that's been showing up in local inboxes.

It says: ""President Obama's finance team is recommending a transaction tax. His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.""

The e-mail is anonymous -- isn't it always? -- but it says, in effect, that if you deposit $1,000, $10 will go to the government. If you withdraw $1,000, $10 from the balance remaining in your account will be sent to Washington. The e-mail claims that the bill, HR-4646, was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

Because DeFazio is from Oregon, Oregon PolitiFact checked into the claim and reported its findings last month. Here's what they said, reprinted with a few editing changes:

The bill, HR-4646, is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that's where the similarities end.

The ""Debt Free America Act"" was introduced by Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., in February 2010. He proposed a 1-percent tax on all money transactions, ""including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale."" Fattah's idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004.

HR-4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama's ""finance team"" -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner.

Penny Dodge, DeFazio's chief of staff, told PolitiFact Oregon that the congressman opposes HR-4646. An unamused DeFazio doesn't know who is behind the e-mail attack.

""It's slanderous,"" DeFazio said of the electronic claim. ""I have nothing to do with the bill, no one pays any attention to the bill. It's chronically introduced, and never received any attention before this.""

One final point about the e-mail that's been circulating in Rhode Island. It says at the beginning, ""You can confirm with Snopes as it is no exageration (sic),"" a reference to our good friends at Snopes.com, which examines the truthfulness of urban legends.

Yet if you actually search Snopes.com, you'll discover that the website concluded that it IS an exaggeration. That's a trend we've been seeing a lot lately -- e-mails with bogus information that try to sound authentic by falsely claiming that Snopes has found it to be true.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Workers', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul says federal workers paid $120,000, private-sector workers only $60,000
","
During the 2010 campaign, some Republican candidates criticized the federal workforce for being overpaid and bloated during a recession. Rand Paul, the newly elected senator from Kentucky, reprised the theme in the Nov. 7, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour.

""The average federal employee makes $120,000 a year,"" Paul said. ""The average private employee makes $60,000 a year.""

We investigated this question 10 months ago, when we looked at a statement by Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., that ""federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts."" At the time, we ruled it False. But we're taking a fresh look.

We found that the answer to whether federal workers are paid more than private-sector workers is actually pretty nuanced.

Right off the bat, we need to mention that while Paul's statistics are based on real numbers, his phrasing is problematic.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal statistics-gathering agency, federal worker compensation in 2009 averaged $123,049, which was double the private-sector average of $61,051. That's a gap of almost $62,000 -- and is pretty close to what Paul said on This Week.

However, that figure includes both salary and benefits. This is a legitimate number to raise, but using it requires more explanation than Paul gave it. Since most people usually think about how much they, their spouses and their colleagues get paid in salary alone -- not salary plus benefits -- we think most people hearing this statement would assume that Paul means that the average federal employee gets paid a salary of $120,000. That's simply not true.

That said, there's still a gap between federal and private-sector pay if you strip out the portion that's in the form of benefits. BEA found that federal civilian employees earned $81,258 in salary, compared to $50,464 for private-sector workers. That cuts the federal pay advantage almost exactly in half, to nearly $31,000.

Case closed? Not at all. Several additional caveats are required.

The first is that there's an imbalance in the types of jobs that make up the federal workforce compared to the private-sector workforce. The federal workforce is disproportionately composed of employees with higher educational attainment. Think of all the low-wage burger-flippers, gas station attendants and domestic workers in the private-sector economy. The federal government has some of these types of employees but proportionately far fewer -- especially after nearly two decades of aggressive contracting-out of duties that need not be handled by salaried federal employees. This has further expanded the federal government's disproportionately large numbers of lawyers, scientists and other highly skilled professionals.

If the federal sector today is hiring a lot of people with specialized expertise and the private sector is hiring a lot of people with skills that don't require a college, or even a high school, degree, then it's no surprise that the average salary levels in each sector are going to be at odds.

So the fairer way to compare pay is by an apples-to-apples comparison of equivalent jobs. A widely referenced study by USA Today attempted to do this.

The newspaper found that ""overall, federal workers earned an average salary of $67,691 in 2008 for occupations that exist both in government and the private sector, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The average pay for the same mix of jobs in the private sector was $60,046 in 2008, the most recent data available."" Doing this calculation reduces the federal pay lead over the private sector even further, to $7,645.

More strikingly, however, the USA Today study found that federal pay was higher than private-sector pay in four out of every five job categories that existed in both sectors. These included accountants, nurses, chemists, surveyors, cooks, clerks and janitors.

This would seem to be strong evidence that the federal government pays better than the private sector. But caution is warranted here, too.

This comparison involves jobs with the same title, but nothing beyond that. And there are any number of factors -- employee seniority, job duties and the number of employees in the comparison -- that could explain the pay differences in jobs with the same title. So the data is not a perfect match.

Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that ""there are certainly many positions where the federal job is compensated less generously than comparable positions in the private sector. These tend to be the most demanding jobs in the federal service -- doctors, attorneys, scientists and senior executives. The U.S. Secretary of Education, for example, is paid far less than the presidents of major public and private universities, even though he has far greater responsibility.""

Despite Paul's exaggeration of the numbers, critics of federal compensation patterns do have some valid points.

For instance, Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that federal pay has risen faster than private-sector pay in recent years, despite the recession. ""BEA data show that average federal salaries rose 58 percent between 2000 and 2009, which was much faster than the 30 percent increase in the private sector,"" he writes.

But let's return to Paul's assertion. Paul said that the ""average federal employee makes $120,000 a year. The average private employee makes $60,000 a year."" Most people hearing that would assume he was talking about salary alone, but  he was talking about total compensation, including benefits such as retirement pay and paid holidays. Although studies show federal employees typically earn more than their private-sector counterparts, the difference is nowhere near as much as the doubling Paul says. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D94800>],/factchecks/2010/nov/11/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-workers-paid-120000-private/

Tim Kaine says Republican effort to extend Bush tax cuts would double deficit
","
There’s a heavy cost to extending the Bush-era tax cuts, according to Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

""What the Republicans want to do is extend these tax cuts, make them permanent to the wealthy, and the CBO (Congressional Budget Office)  has estimated that would double the deficit projections going forward for the next couple of decades,"" Kaine, a former Virginia governor, said during a CNN interview.

Double the deficit? We decided to check.

First, a word of background. The tax cuts, enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2003, lowered rates on income, capital gains and dividends and: 


The cuts are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them.

A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said Kaine based on his statement on a CBO report released in September.

We dug up the study and found Kaine was correct. ""A permanent extension of all those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in 2020,"" the report said.

The CBO projects the 2020 deficit -- based on an assumption that the tax cuts will not be extended -- at $685 billion.

Republican congressional leaders want to make the tax cuts permanent. ""This is from a Republican Party that’s been griping about deficits,"" Kaine said on CNN.

But by bringing up deficits, Kaine also sawed at the branch President Obama and many other Democrats have perched on during the tax debate. They’ve wanted to eliminate that tax cuts for the ""wealthy,"" defined as families with annual incomes exceeding $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Democrats have supported extending the reductions to families and individuals beneath those thresholds.

Here’s the rub: Eliminating tax cuts for the wealthy and keeping them for everyone else doesn’t save big money. The Democratic tax plan would leave a projected deficit in 2020 that would be ""roughly three-quarters to four-fifths"" as high as that caused by the GOP plan to eliminate all the levies, according to the same CBO report cited by Kaine.

Kaine didn’t mention this on CNN.

""What he said is factually correct,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington. ""What he didn’t say is that the Democratic plan to extend taxes for 98 percent of the population shoots almost as big a hole in the budget as the Republican plan.""

We agree that the buyer must beware when browsing political statements. Kaine is correct in saying that the CBO estimates the Republican tax plan would double deficit in 2020. But he omits an important fact: The Democratic plan would would increase the deficit by almost as much.

As a result, we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A46BA80>],/factchecks/2010/nov/11/tim-kaine/kaine-says-republican-effort-extend-bush-tax-cuts-/

Sen. George Voinovich suggests 25-cent increase in revenue-flat gasoline tax
","
Gasoline prices are climbing, nudging $3 a gallon in Ohio. If a politician was bent on self-preservation, this would not be the best time to propose a tax that would raise the price a little more.

But before you suggest firing U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, remember that he’s retiring at the end of the year. Before then, the Ohio Republican wants to start raising the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents -- one cent a month, for 25 months. This would create more than 750,000 jobs by funding road and bridge construction projects, he says, and a portion of the tax could be used to reduce the federal deficit.  

The general proposal is not new; Voinovich has been pushing it for months. But Voinovich and a Democrat, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, trotted it out again on Nov. 5 with a letter to the co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission, appointed by President Barack Obama, is working toward a Dec. 1 deadline on a proposal to reduce the deficit and address looming fiscal issues.

It is not PolitiFact’s mission to say whether Voinovich’s proposal is sound, though there are opponents to his idea. Nor will we take bets on the likelihood of it passing in the very short time Voinovich has left in office. But in a news release announcing the letter, Voinovich on Nov. 8 stressed that the federal fuel tax has not been raised since 1993.

Seventeen years without an increase seems like a long time. Has it really been that long?

According to the Congressional Research Service, it has.

The reasons include not only the long-term nature of highway funding bills and the projects they pay for, requiring years of planning, but also a political distaste among many lawmakers for higher gasoline taxes.

Some key dates in the heated history of fuel taxes provide a sense of the challenge. These come from the Congressional Research Service, which provides in-depth analysis for both houses of Congress: 
  
That’s where the tax stands today: 18.4 cents a gallon. It is charged to refiners but passed along to consumers at the pump. The good news for drivers is that the tax stays flat regardless of how much they pay for gasoline. If the per-gallon price at the pump is $2.00, it includes 18.4 cents worth of federal gasoline taxes. If the price jumps to $3 a gallon, the federal gas tax share is still only 18.4 cents.

But Congressional Budget Office projections show that the 18.4 cents a gallon isn’t enough to keep pace with planned highway and transit projects, let alone with the possible rate of inflation. That’s even before considering proposals like Voinovich’s to ramp up road and bridge repairs. ""The Interstate Highway System is more than 50 years old and many roadways and bridges are reaching the end of their useful life,"" he and Carper wrote in their letter to the fiscal reform commission.

Starting in 2014, the Highway Trust Fund will go into the red, according to CBO projections, which note that its figures are strictly for illustrative purposes -- because under law, the fund is not allowed to incur negative balances. Unless the gas tax is raised or highway projects cut, the fund will have to draw money from the general treasury, with negative budgetary consequences, CBO figures show.
 
Voinovich notes that that has happened before -- in 2008, 2009 and this year. Altogether, Congress had to transfer $34.5 billion from the general treasury so it could maintain a positive balance in the Highway Trust Fund. The fund fell short those years because of the recession and the high cost of gasoline -- Americans cut out some of their driving -- and from better fuel efficiency, which reduced gasoline consumption. While arguably good for the environment, this created a shortfall for the fund that pays for highway repairs.

The trust fund needs $34 billion over the next six years, Voinovich says, and if it doesn’t get it from gasoline taxes, Americans will face the choice of higher deficits or fewer road repairs -- which in turn ""will create additional unemployment and continued deterioration of infrastructure.""

The Congressional Research Service agreed with the need in general, saying in an April 2010 report: ""The Highway Trust Fund is in need of an increase in funding.""

But the report ended with a dose of political reality: ""However, a gasoline tax increase is also likely to be unpopular with consumers. It might also drain purchasing power, especially from an economy that is weakened by recession.""

Voinovich has a difficult case to make. He’s been pushing it for months. But he’ll apparently have some sympathy from the debt commission; in a draft report released Wednesday, Nov. 10, the commission proposed a higher gasoline tax -- raising it gradually by 15 cents beginning in 2013 -- as a way to pay for transportation improvements without raiding the general government treasury.

That’s less than Voinovich proposed, and it’s unknown if the provision will be included in the commission’s final report. Also unknown is whether a super-majority of the commission will agree with the full extent of commission proposals -- which include an array of discretionary spending cuts and an eventual raise in the Social Security retirement age -- and whether Congress then will approve the recommendations or shelve them, putting off decisions for another day or year.

But when it comes to the history of gas-tax hikes, the facts are on Voinovich’s side, so we rate his statement True.

"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Barrett']","
Tom Barrett says he helped create 4,000 jobs in the Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee
","
Once the industrial heart of the state of Wisconsin, over the decades the Menomonee Valley gradually deteriorated into a high profile eyesore.

Polluted, smelly, and ugly ... all were used to describe the stretch of land from roughly the 6th Street viaduct to what is now Miller Park. Though hundreds of people worked there -- at the stockyards, gear manufacturer Falk Corp., railroad switching yards and other industries -- the area was best known for acre upon acre of brownfields.

Local historian John Gurda noted the economic importance of the valley but said ""its persistent pollution problems and the generalized ugliness of much of its development made the district a civic embarrassment to some Milwaukeeans.""

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett put a different spin on it during his unsuccessful campaign for governor against Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, saying under his leadership the city had turned the area into a job-creating machine.

In a video, Barrett compared the jobs created in the valley to the lack of development on county-owned land in the Park East freeway corridor, claiming: ""Tom Barrett redeveloped the Menomonee Valley, which now supports nearly 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin.""

The election is over, but we were still wondering about that claim.

Without a doubt, the recession cost the Milwaukee area thousands of jobs. The state Department of Workforce Development says metro area employment is 798,400, down about 65,000 jobs from December 2007, when the recession began.

But this claim relates to a different time frame -- since Barrett took office -- and a specific area. So was the city able to add thousands of jobs in the valley?

In an word: yes.

But the work didn’t start with Barrett, who took office in 2004. There have been several master plans cooked up for the valley over the decades until the current onetook effect in 1998.

As far back as 1977, Mayor Henry Maier saw the valley’s potential, saying: ""The Menomonee Valley redevelopment project is probably the largest industrial revitalization project in the country, and I am determined that it will also be the best.""

Maier’s successor , Mayor John O. Norquist, spent years fighting for control of a key piece of valley property -- 134 acres held by CMC Heartland Partners, the parent company of the old Milwaukee Road railroad. The city finally wrested control of that site in 2003  for $6.8 million.

That move in particular cleared the way for a city-owned Menomonee Valley Industrial Center.

Additionally, moves under Norquist -- such as bringing the 6th Steet Viaduct down to the valley level -- improved access. The bridge previously stretched across the valley.

What did Barrett do since taking office?

According to Rocky Marcoux, head of the Department of City Development, the city has spent some $48 million in public improvements -- cleaning polluted ""brownfields,"" site preparation and so forth -- and created seven tax incremental financing districts.

It also spent $25 million to extend Canal St., which runs down the center of the valley, so it links up with the freeway at Miller Park. That’s important because it gives another easy way for traffic to reach businesses there.

Marcoux said the city can offer business owners lots that compare with suburban industrial parks: ""We can offer them land at market rates. We don’t have to induce them.""

A quick tally of the major additions to the valley on Barrett’s watch:

Recreation-related: The Harley-Davidson Museum, Iron Horse Hotel, and Potawatomi Casino expansion. Combined, 1,332 jobs.

Industrial park:  From the first industrial park tenant, pizza maker Palermo Villa Inc., which has grown from 180 to about 500 jobs, to the most recent addition, windmill generator-maker Ingeteam. Combined 1,156 jobs.

Others: An assortment of jobs retained (Cargill)  and new ones (such as Zimmerman Design Group, Proven Direct). Combined: 1,671 jobs.

That tallies out to 4,159 jobs, a figure deemed accurate by Laura Bray, executive director of the Menomonee Valley Partners, a nonprofit group established to promote business development in the area. It also corresponds with coverage in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by commercial real estate reporter Tom Daykin.

In all, about 10,000 people work in the valley -- a figure Bray called a rough estimate because there has not been a recent detailed study of total employment.

And some 26 companies have moved or expanded in the valley, according to the Menomonee Valley Partners.

In some cases, expansion hasn’t gone according to plan. For instance, Harley originally expected to build an office complex with nearly 400 jobs near its museum, but those plans have been on hold since the economy tanked.

Nevertheless, there is plenty to look at in assessing Barrett’s claim.

As a former candidate for governor, and current civic cheerleader, Mayor Tom Barrett boasts of creating thousands of jobs in the Menomonee Valley. While overall jobs in the city are down, and Barrett came into office with some key assets put in place by his predecessors, our tally puts new jobs in the valley since 2004 at more than 4,000.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Public Safety', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
Texas AG Greg Abbott says he's arrested more criminals, including thousands of child predators and sex offenders, than any previous AG
","
On his way to winning a third term as the state's attorney general, Republican Greg Abbott hit the airwaves with a TV ad that made him sound like a round-'em-up sheriff. 
""He’s arrested more criminals than any Texas attorney general, including thousands of child predators and sex offenders,"" the narrator says. This claim wrested the attention of reader Joyce Lynch, who suggested that we look into whether Abbott has been 'cuffing suspects while working as the state's top lawyer. 
First, we asked Jason Johnson, Abbott's campaign consultant for back-up evidence. He pointed to the office's criminal investigations division, ""staffed by commissioned peace officers and crime analysts who undertake a wide range of investigations and activities to support detection, prevention, and prosecution of crime,"" according to the attorney general's website. 
In a document e-mailed to us, Johnson focused on two division units that Abbott created in 2003: 
* The Cyber Crimes Unit, which ""arrests child predators who commit sex crimes against children using technology and the Internet,"" according to the attorney general's website. That includes people who contact youths online and try to set up a time, date and location to have sex with them. In some cases, undercover officers identify suspects by posing as children in chat rooms and on websites. The unit also makes child pornography arrests. 
* The Fugitive Unit, which seeks out and arrests people with histories of sex crimes who have violated their parole or sex offender registration requirements, the site says. According to an overview provided by Abbott's office, the unit has also arrested other kinds of fugitives, including ""Louisiana criminals with outstanding warrants who fled to Texas during Hurricane Katrina,"" as well as gang members and other offenders rounded up under Falcon II, an initiative led by the U.S. Marshals Service that targeted sexual predators and violent offenders. 
The units work in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, including local police and the FBI, according to the attorney general's website and news releases. However, Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the office, told us that the peace officers employed by the attorney general's office consistently make arrests on their own. Strickland also said that although Abbott is not a certified peace officer and cannot make arrests, he has been present during some apprehensions by his officers. 
According to information from Strickland, the cyber-crimes and fugitive units arrested 2,052 child predators and sex offenders from the teams' creation in 2003 through mid-October, when Abbott's TV ad began running. Of those arrests: 
* 1,806 were by the fugitive unit; the majority were arrests of sex offenders who had violated their parole or failed to register. 
* 246 were by the cyber-crimes unit and were related to child pornography or online solicitation of a child. Of those, 221 have led to convictions. 
Next, we wondered how Abbott's arrest record stacks up against those of his predecessors. 
Although Johnson didn't have data showing the number of arrests by the attorney general's office over the years, he said he was confident that the ad — claiming that Abbott has arrested more criminals than any Texas attorney general — was correct because of the surge in criminal division officers on Abbott's watch. 
Background: The 1991 Legislature gave the attorney general's office permission to employ up to five peace officers. Bill analyses from that time say that the office needed the extra staff to assist local prosecutors in investigations. In 1999, lawmakers removed the hiring limit, partly because of an expansion of the Medicaid fraud program within the attorney general's office. 
According to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Education, which tracks the number of peace officers in the state, the number of officers appointed by the attorney general's office rose each year between 1999 and 2010, from five to more than 150. (The growing number of peace officers of all kinds has been a trend statewide. According to a 2009 Statesman story, there are three dozen types of agencies, institutions, boards, commissions and political subdivisions that can appoint their own law enforcement agents.) 
According to information from Johnson, in fiscal 2002, just before Abbott became attorney general, 36 peace officers were working for the attorney general's office and made 99 arrests. That compares to fiscal 2010, when the agency employed 141 officers (as of Sept. 9) and arrested 795 people. 
Summing up: Abbott's campaign ad stated that he had made ""thousands"" of arrests. Abbott hasn't personally arrested anyone, but he has put into place criminal investigation units that had taken into custody more than 2,000 ""child predators and sex offenders"" through mid-October. Legislative actions during the past 20 years lend credence to the claim that the arrests outnumber those of his predecessors, though his campaign didn't have data to prove it. By the same token, most earlier attorneys general didn't have the same manpower or authority to make arrests. 
We rate Abbott's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809667C500>],/factchecks/2010/nov/11/greg-abbott/texas-ag-greg-abbott-says-hes-arrested-more-crimin/
"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'Safe Routes to Schools']","
Safety group says 50 percent of children hit by vehicles near schools are struck by parents of other schoolchildren
","
Sometimes a ""fact"" is repeated so often that it becomes true, regardless of where it came from or whether the original study exists to back up the claim.

A good example is this tantalizing statistic, posted on the city of Portland’s Safe Routes to School program summary page: ""Nationally, 50% of children who are hit by cars near schools are hit by cars driven by parents of other students."" The figure also is contained in a how-to safe routes guide put out by the state. The claim is repeated in other Portland safe routes newsletters and in brochures, sometimes with the ""national"" modifier, sometimes not.

And while the number on its face seems to make sense -- who is most likely to be driving near schools than parents? -- the figure begged even more questions: How many children are hit by cars each year? What is the sample size? And how did they track the numbers to figure that parents of other children were involved in half of those cases?

In short, is this percentage accurate? PolitiFact Oregon set to find out.

First up, a call to the Portland Bureau of Transportation. Spokesman Dan Anderson consulted with Gabriel Graff, a city safe routes organizer. Anderson said the city doesn’t track the number of children hit by cars near schools, so we have no idea whether the national number is true in Portland.

But Anderson did come up with a source for the statistic: the Safe Routes to School National Partnership, an advocacy group launched in 2005 to score money and support from Congress for safer roads to school. (Its 500-plus members include cities, counties, bike shops and pedestrian friendly planners.) The footnote on the group’s ""National Statistics on School Transportation"" cites yet another source: ""Washington State Department of Transportation; cited in Safe Routes to School, National Highway Transportation & Safety Administration, 2002.""

So on to the Washington State Department of Transportation. There we found Charlotte Claybrooke, the person responsible for coordinating the safe routes program in our neighbor state. She said she was unaware of any study and wrote:  ""Unfortunately, I can't be of much help except to say that I've tried to run that statistic down before and could not find a reference to substantiate it."" Washington does not use the figure.

At the same time, we checked with Julie Yip, the safe routes coordinator at the Oregon Department of Transportation. Yip did an online search and came up with a report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which repeats the figure and sources ""Kallins, Wendy. Safe Routes to School. US Department of Transportation: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.""

Ah-ha, a name -- albeit misspelled -- of someone who may have conducted the study or seen it first hand. Wendi (not Wendy) Kallins, we learned, launched the original safe routes pilot in Marin County, California, and still lives there. We asked via e-mail whether she had details of the original study.

She wrote: ""I get lots of inquiries about this one - it came from Washington state and I subsequently cannot find the original document I got it from.  I believe it came from a school traffic calming document back in the ‘90's.  Since I can't verify it, I don't recommend using the stat unless you can track down the original.""

We asked Kallins whether she was comfortable with the fact that public agencies and public policy groups were using the figure in their literature. Her response? ""I can't speak for them. They may have tracked down the original source.""

But it’s clear that Portland and Oregon have not. Yip said she would stop using the figure, since the National Center for Safe Routes to School, which is not the same as the partnership, could not verify the figure and does not use it. Anderson said the city will scrub the statistic from its website barring last-minute evidence.

The message remains the same, he said. ""Reducing the need for children to be driven to and from school means fewer cars on the road and fewer opportunities for crashes.""

Fewer people could argue with that.

We acknowledge this is not a statistic that will alter how much Congress spends on safer roads. (By the way, Oregon received more than $6 million of $612 million for 2005-2009.)  We’re not suggesting that proponents of safer roads have trumped up a figure to champion a cause.

But the twisted tale of this claim is a case study in how falsehoods get passed along with good intentions and nothing to back them up. Just because a statement keeps getting repeated doesn't mean it's true -- even if a source is cited. We find the claim False.

"['Health Care', 'History', 'States', 'Florida', 'Pam Bondi']","
In defending health care suit, new Florida AG says the United States is the only federalist country in the world
","
Pam Bondi, Florida's next attorney general, already is delivering on a campaign promise to keep fighting the new federal health care law.

Bondi, a Republican elected with almost 55 percent of the vote, appeared on On The Record with Greta Van Susteren on Nov. 9, 2010, to discuss how she was taking over the suit from outgoing Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum. Bondi said she was prepared to argue the case and that she attended the first round of oral arguments in Pensacola.

Van Susteren then asked Bondi if she had examined election results across the country to target other states that might now be willing to join the legal challenge. Nineteen states already have signed onto Florida's suit, and Van Susteren wanted to know whether it would matter if a majority of states could be roped in as well.

""Well, and it does (matter),"" Bondi said. ""And I mean, we're the only system of federalism in the world. And I think what this does, if we -- and we are going to have a majority of the states joining in. And I think it's going to vindicate our Constitution and what our Founding Fathers believed that our system should be made of.""

Bondi went on to say that she hopes the states of Oklahoma, Ohio and Kansas will join the lawsuit, as could Wisconsin, Wyoming, Maine, and maybe even California.

""If you look at the whole board game, we could have a total of 28 states joining in this lawsuit,"" Bondi said.

The lawsuit filed in Florida argues that the federal government cannot impose taxes or financial penalties on someone who fails to have health insurance.

In this fact check, we're not going to analyze how many states will join the challenge to the health care law. Instead, we want to examine Bondi's statement that the United States is the only country in the world with a federalist system -- a system where sovereignty is constitutionally split between at least two levels of government. And, put another way, where states can have greater power than the national government.

The basic principle of federalism originates in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1791, which says: ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""

James Madison helped explain the delegation of powers between the states and the federal government in The Federalist Papers. ""The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined,"" Madison wrote in 1788 in The Federalist No. 45 under the pseudonym Publius. ""Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.""

Is the United States the only country in the world where the power to govern is shared between a central government and provinces or states?

Hardly, experts we talked to said.

""Our neighbors Canada and Mexico would find this declaration rather surprising, given that both systems are federal systems of government, with states or provinces sharing specific and separate authority over different areas of policy,"" said Christopher Reenock, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University.

Reenock pointed to at least 19 other countries that have a federalist form of government, including Germany, Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Russia, Brazil, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

""Given that there are around 195 countries in the world, it is certainly true that federalist systems are in the minority, comprising only about 10 percent of those countries,"" Reenock said. ""But one would have to stretch (the) data quite a bit to declare that the U.S. is the only system of federalism in the world.""

Carl Steiren, an expert with the Forum of Federations, said that his organization considers 25 countries around the world to have a federalist system, and that nearly 40 percent of the world's population lives in a federal country. You can see the list here. Steiren described the Forum of Federations, which is based in Canada, as an international organization that brings together people from different federal countries to share best practices and horror stories, in order to emulate the former and avoid the latter. Its board of directors includes policy makers and diplomats from Canada, Europe and Africa.

""Pam Bondi is not correct in saying 'We're the only system of federalism in the world,' unless she qualifies it by adding something else, such as 'that has 50 states,' "" Steiren said.

Steiren said the United States is widely considered to have created the first federal system, but it's far from the only.

Switzerland, for instance, decentralizes many of the functions of government among its 26 cantons. And Australia copied much of its federal system from the United States.

""We must not lose sight of the essential condition that this is to be a federation of States and not a single government,"" said Australian founding father Samuel Griffith in 1891. Sounds a bit like Madison, huh?

Griffith continued: ""The separate States are to continue as autonomous bodies, surrendering only so much of their power as is necessary to the establishment of a general government to do for them collectively what they cannot do individually for themselves, and which they cannot do as a collective body for themselves."" 
We reached out to Bondi, who acknowledged the mistake. 
""Pam intended to say that we have the 'oldest' system of federalism, not that ours is the 'only' one,"" said Carlos Muniz, the executive director of Bondi's transition team. ""For her, the relevance of this point is that federalism -- the U.S. Constitution's clear delineation of powers between the federal and state governments -- has always been a fundamental aspect of our Constitution and of our national heritage. Completely apart from any policy-based disagreements with the federal healthcare law, Pam is committed to Florida's lawsuit precisely because she sees it as necessary to preserve our federalist system of government."" 
Appearing on Fox News, Bondi got off track in discussing a legal challenge to the federal health care law by saying the United States has the ""only system of federalism in the world."" The United States may have been the first, but it's far from the only. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970AC0C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/10/pam-bondi/defending-health-care-suit-new-florida-ag-says-uni/

Who's right on food inflation: Sarah Palin or the Wall Street Journal?
","
Almost anything Sarah Palin says on her Facebook page draws attention -- especially if someone thinks she's got it wrong. And that's exactly what's happened in the past few days. 
It all began Nov. 7, 2010, when the National Review Online published an advance version of a keynote address Palin was preparing to give to a trade-association convention in Phoenix. Her comments were pegged to the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors economic summit in South Korea, at which a central point of discussion was expected to be a Federal Reserve bond-buying proposal called ""quantitative easing,"" or ""QE2"" for short. Palin warned that the U.S., specifically Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, ""shouldn't be playing around with inflation."" 
She explained part of her reasoning this way: 
""All this pump priming (by the Fed) will come at a serious price. And I mean that literally: Everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so. Pump priming would push them even higher.""

This triggered a response from an economics blogger at the Wall Street Journal, Sudeep Reddy.

In a Nov. 8, 2010, blog post, Reddy wrote that inflation generally, and food inflation specifically, are actually quite low right now. Here's part of what Reddy wrote:

""Grocery prices haven't risen all that significantly, in fact. The Consumer Price Index's measure of food and beverages for the first nine months of this year showed average annual inflation of less than 0.6 percent, the slowest pace on record (since the Labor Department started keeping this measure in 1968). Even if you pick a single snapshot — say, September's year-over-year increase in prices — that was just 1.4 percent, far better than the 6 percent annual increase for food prices recorded in September 2008.

""The overall consumer price index was up 1.1 percent in September from a year earlier. Apart from September 2009 (when prices were down 1.3 percent), that was the slowest annual inflation rate for September since the early 1960s. That's not strong evidence to argue about rising prices today.""

The same day, Palin fired back via Facebook. She titled her post, ""Do Wall Street Journal Reporters Read the Wall Street Journal?"" 
""Really?"" Palin wrote. ""That's odd, because just last Thursday, November 4, I read an article in Mr. Reddy's own Wall Street Journal titled 'Food Sellers Grit Teeth, Raise Prices: Packagers and Supermarkets Pressured to Pass Along Rising Costs, Even as Consumers Pinch Pennies.' The article noted that 'an inflationary tide is beginning to ripple through America's supermarkets and restaurants. … Prices of staples including milk, beef, coffee, cocoa and sugar have risen sharply in recent months.' Now I realize I'm just a former governor and current housewife from Alaska, but even humble folks like me can read the newspaper. I'm surprised a prestigious reporter for the Wall Street Journal doesn't."" 
Ouch. So, on Nov. 9, Reddy replied to Palin in another blog post. 
Reddy reiterated the statistics he had cited earlier, then added some additional detail. ""While some items in the shopping cart have risen in price (ground chuck beef is up 4.8%) and others have decreased (bananas are down 5.3%), overall food price inflation has been historically low for the past year. This is not surprising. Weak demand, high unemployment and thrifty shoppers have led retailers to keep many prices from rising despite the rising cost of some commodities, including coffee and sugar. The Nov. 4 Wall Street Journal article noted, in its first sentence, 'the tamest year of food pricing in nearly two decades.' It does indeed report that supermarkets and restaurants are facing cost pressures that could push their retail prices higher -- but it hasn't happened yet on a large scale. Critics of the Fed's quantitative easing policy are focused primarily on concerns about potential future inflation.""

Clearly, sorting all this out sounds like a job for PolitiFact. 
We first turned to the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, the most widely used statistic to measure inflation. During the 12-month period ending in September 2010, we found that the CPI showed food costs rising 1.4 percent -- exactly as Reddy said they did. For some historical context, we also looked back a couple years. We found that for the year ending in September 2009, food prices dropped two-tenths of 1 percent; for the year ending in September 2008, food prices rose by 6 percent; and for the year ending in September 2007, food prices rose by 4.4 percent. So 2009 and 2010 have indeed been years of relatively low inflation for food. (Here's a chart Reddy provided us showing some of the data he used.)

In the meantime, we also looked at additional data. One database we used comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the U.S. Commerce Department. BEA produces a table that shows monthly, quarterly and annual prices for consumer products. One of the categories BEA tracks is food. (The differences between the data sets we used are of interest only to deep-in-the-weeds statisticians; we'll just say that all the databases cited here are considered trustworthy.)

We compared food prices in the first quarter of 2009 with food prices in the first quarter of 2010 and found that they had declined 0.9 percent during that period. Making the same comparison for the second quarter of both years showed an increase of 0.2 percent, and a comparison for the third quarter showed an increase of 0.9 percent.

These sounded like modest increases to us, but we confirmed that by comparing them to the historical trends in BEA's data. Looking at the past decade of year-to-year price changes, we found that annual food inflation averaged about 2.7 percent a year. The annual increases varied from 1.3 percent to 6 percent.

In other words, so far so good for Reddy's critique of Palin: We found no sign that grocery prices ""have risen significantly over the past year or so."" Still, there are two other points worth making.

One point (also mentioned by Reddy) is that certain grocery items increased faster than others -- and that included some staples. CPI data showed that the price of butter increased by 19.1 percent during the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2010, while the price of bacon rose by 15.7 percent, lamb increased by 9.4 percent and milk increased by 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, BEA statistics show that certain broad food categories rose faster than the food-sector average: a 3.4 percent increase for meats and poultry, a 3.4 percent bump for milk, dairy products and eggs; and a 2.8 percent hike for sweets and sugar.

All of these items, in other words, rose a whole lot faster than food inflation generally. And it's simply human nature for a consumer to feel like prices are rising quickly if you have to pay increases like that every time you enter the checkout line. As long as you're paying through the nose for milk, the brain tends to forget that the dried lentils you just bought are down 5.5 percent, and the peanut butter you just bought is down 5.1 percent.

The second point is that even if food prices are flat or rising slightly, Americans are living through a period of stagnating or contracting incomes, which means even slowly rising prices hurt.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service assembles a table detailing ""food expenditures by families and individuals as a share of disposable personal money income."" The table essentially shows what percentage of their income families are paying for food.

In total, Americans tend to spend about 11 percent to 12 percent of their income on food, with a small majority spent on food at home and the rest spent at restaurants. Over the last three years, the food-at-home portion of that spending -- the only part relevant for judging Palin's statement -- rose from 6.4 percent in 2007 to 6.5 percent in 2008 to 6.8 percent in 2009.

The reason that families are paying a larger share of disposable income for food had little to do with food prices and a lot to do with contracting incomes. For the first time since at least 1959, ""disposable personal money income"" dropped between 2008 and 2009, by 1.3 percent. Because food is more of a necessity than many other consumer items, that budget line ended up taking a larger share of many families' shrinking incomes.

Neither of these two factors support Palin's claim that grocery prices ""have risen significantly over the past year or so."" Strictly speaking, grocery prices have generally risen at historically sluggish rates during the period Palin is talking about. However, important food categories, including meat and dairy products, have risen at much faster rates. And in a time of shrinking family incomes, Americans are indeed paying slightly more for food as a percentage of their income. These two additional pieces of information make Palin's observation about grocery prices understandable, even if it isn't borne out in the most widely tracked statistics. So we rate her statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB0DC0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/10/sarah-palin/whos-right-food-inflation-sarah-palin-or-wall-stre/

Rep. Marcy Kaptur chides FirstEnergy rate plan, noting annual revenues top many nations' GDP
","
Roughly 361,000 electrically heated Ohio households were shocked last year when Akron-based FirstEnergy began phasing out discounted rates it had provided for decades to ""all electric"" customers whose households run exclusively on electricity.

FirstEnergy has said those customers need to pay the actual costs for the services they receive, and the longtime discounts can’t continue because of electricity deregulation and new conservation mandates, The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio took up the issue after some families complained of doubled electricity bills, and has held hearings on the subject throughout the state.

At an Oct. 25 hearing in Sandusky, Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur told PUCO the discounts should remain, and noted they were part of a longtime all-electric marketing scheme in which the company agreed to provide lower rates to customers who forfeited alternative utility choices.

As part of her statement, Kaptur asked: ""Are we to believe that a corporation such as FirstEnergy, with annual revenues of approximately $1 billion -- that’s a thousand million dollars a year, more than the GDP of Haiti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, or 15 African nations -- are we to believe that such a giant corporation cannot afford to keep its promises to senior citizens and working families in all-electric homes and apartments?""

Do FirstEnergy’s revenues actually exceed the gross domestic product of so many countries? We decided to do some digging.

FirstEnergy’s most recent annual report says its total revenue for 2009 was nearly $13 billion, down from $13.6 billion in 2008. Kaptur’s $1 billion statement significantly understates the company’s yearly revenues, but she’s correct to state those revenues exceed the gross domestic product of many countries.

According to statistics compiled by the World Bank, FirstEnergy’s yearly revenues are greater than the 2009 gross domestic products of 85 nations including Iceland ($12.1 billion) Haiti ($6.7 billion) and the Kyrgyz Republic ($4.6 billion). It’s also higher than the gross domestic product for 29 African countries: Zambia, Botswana, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Namibia, Madagascar, Mali, The Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, Burkina Faso, Chad, Benin, Niger, Rwanda, Malawi, Guinea, Mauritania, Swaziland, Togo, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Liberia, Seychelles, The Gambia. Comoros, and Sao Tome and Principe.

FirstEnergy spokeswoman Ellen Raines said the company’s $13 billion yearly revenue doesn’t reflect what it pays for expenses like taxes, infrastructure maintenance, electricity generation, and employing 14,000 workers.

""We have a vast and complex infrastructure that is used to provide electric service to 4 ½ million customers,"" said Raines. ""We invest every day in helping ensure that service is safe and reliable.""

FirstEnergy is committed to finding a resolution to the electricity rate issue that is ""fair to all our customers,"" said Raines, adding that said current rates for all-electric homes will continue through the winter heating season.

Asked why Kaptur said FirstEnergy’s yearly revenues are $1 billion instead of $13 billion, Kaptur spokesman Steve Fought took the blame. He said he did the research and intended to write that the company’s monthly revenue, not yearly revenue, was $1 billion.. After The Plain Dealer inquired about the discrepancy, he corrected the version of the statement that appears on Kaptur’s website.

""I have to take responsibility for that,"" said Fought. ""Looking back on it, I wish I had just referred to FirstEnergy's annual revenues instead of trying to break it into a billion dollars a month. In trying to make the numbers more understandable, I succeeded only in making them more confusing."" 
Fought said Kaptur’s point is still valid despite the mistake: ""FirstEnergy has plenty of money to keep their promises to all electric customers.""

PolitiFact Ohio isn’t in the business of playing ""Gotcha!"" We recognize sometimes people can misspeak. Her staff had the correct revenue number, and Kaptur's mistake certainly didn’t lead to exaggeration. In fact, she understates the number of countries that have smaller GDP. Her underlying point, that FirstEnergy has sizable annual revenue, is accurate.

So we’re not downgrading her on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Kaptur’s claim as True.

"['National', 'Stimulus', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama claims most stimulus projects have come in under budget, faster than expected
","
President Barack Obama says the time is ripe for immediate investment in infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. With the nation recovering from a recession, interest rates are low, competition among contractors for work is intense and the cost of building materials are down.

As evidence, Obama pointed to the government's experience with the economic stimulus package, saying that taxpayers have gotten pretty good bang for their buck.

""One of the interesting things about the Recovery Act was most of the projects came in under budget, faster than expected, because there's just not a lot of work there,"" Obama said in an interview on 60 Minutes on Nov. 7, 2010. ""I mean, there are construction crews all across the country that are dying for work. And companies that are willing to take a very small profit in order to get work done. And so for us to say now's the time for us to rebuild this country and equip ourselves for the 21st Century. That's something that could make a real difference.""

In the fall campaign, Republicans assailed the stimulus as wasteful spending, but now Obama is citing it as an example of efficiency. And so we decided to collaborate with our colleagues at ProPublica to see if Obama was right that ""most"" of the projects funded by the stimulus came in ""under budget"" and ""faster than expected.""

We'll break this into two parts: whether most stimulus projects came in under budget, and whether they were faster than expected.

Under budget?

There is no comprehensive federal database that tracks whether stimulus projects have come in under budget. But the White House pointed us toward Vice President Joe Biden’s latest stimulus report, issued in early October, which found that ""Contract bids, in some cases, have come in anywhere from 6 to 20 percent below expected costs, allowing agencies to do more work within their original appropriations.""

But that was based on a limited sample -- an administration survey of eight agencies with a large number of infrastructure projects. The survey found that project bids came in about $8.5 billion less than anticipated, allowing the stimulus to fund more than 3,000 additional projects.

The bulk of the ""bid savings"" in the survey came from the Department of Transportation, where low bids for projects came in $7.5 billion less than expected, allowing the department to fund an additional 2,500 projects. But DOT wasn't alone. All of the agencies surveyed reported projects coming in under budget. In the Department of Veterans Affairs, for example, project bids came in 8 to 12 percent below estimates, allowing the VA to stretch its number of funded projects from 942 to 1,521.

Those figures come as little surprise to industry experts who said that projects in the last couple of years have often been below estimates. The recession decimated the construction industry, which led to intense competition for public projects like those funded by the stimulus.

Whereas most projects would typically get five or six bidders, they now get 20 to 25 -- heightening pressure for lower bids, said Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors of America. In a survey of its membership near the beginning of 2010, 90 percent said they had lowered their bids that year; and 10 percent said they were even bidding below the cost of the project, ""buying work,"" just to keep employees busy until things pick up, Turmail said.

Another factor: Construction estimates were unusually high in 2006 and 2007, when many estimates were first made. They were inflated by strong demand for construction and high materials costs.

As a result, officials began revising their estimating formulas to account for higher costs, at the very time when costs for construction goods and services actually were coming down. As a result, many projects in 2008 and 2009 -- prime time for the stimulus -- came in well under budget.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office confirmed the trend in a March report.

""Many highway contracts were awarded for less than the original cost estimates,"" the report states. ""These 'bid savings' allowed states to fund more projects with the Recovery Act funding than were initially anticipated.""

For example, an Interstate 59 pavement project in Gadsden, Ala., came in 31 percent below the original estimate of $53.9 million. The 8-mile Old Glenn Highway resurfacing project in Anchorage, Alaska, was nearly 50 percent below the original estimate of $25 million.

So there is some truth to Obama's point. But without definitive data telling us what percentage of all stimulus projects have come in under budget, we think it's a stretch for Obama to claim that most stimulus projects have come in under budget. After all, that's based on a survey of just eight agencies that found ""contract bids, in some cases"" were coming in well below budget.


Faster than expected?

This statistic depends somewhat on who is doing the expecting.

Asked for backup, the White House again pointed to its October report, which noted the administration met its target of ""outlaying,"" or spending, 70 percent of the stimulus funds by the end of September 2010. The administration also provided data on various deadlines met, or exceeded, to ""obligate"" money to various agencies. But ""obligated"" simply means the money has been committed to a project. It could take months before it's spent.

So back to the money ""outlaid."" Shortly after the law passed, the administration set a goal of having 70 percent of the funds outlaid and delivered in tax relief by Sept. 30, 2010. In the report, the administration boasted that as of that deadline, the government had outlaid $308 billion and paid out $243 billion in tax relief - a total of $551 billion, or almost exactly 70 percent of the Act's $787 billion cost estimate at the time of enactment.

Liz Oxhorn, a White House spokeswoman for the stimulus program, defended Obama's ""faster than expected"" claim based on outlays, saying,  ""Because most projects pay out on the back end, money out the door is one of the best indicators that projects are being completed ahead of schedule.""

But if outlays are the measuring stick, the projects have not come in ""faster than expected,"" they have come in exactly as expected.

And a couple caveats are in order here. The stimulus bill contained $288 billion in tax cuts and $499 billion in spending. As of Sept. 30, 85 percent of the tax cuts had been issued, along with 62 percent of the spending. In other words, the 70 percent threshold is inflated a bit by tax breaks.

An analysis by ProPublica also found that a number of agencies were lagging behind spending estimates.

The Department of Energy, for example, has been the slowest agency to spend its stimulus funds, as many of the agency's programs have been tied up by an onslaught of applications and regulations regarding prevailing wages, American-made materials, increasing electricity rates and environmental clearances. As of Sept. 17, it has spent only $7.6 billion of its $32.7 billion allocation. The slowest energy programs include the $3 billion ""clean coal"" carbon capture program, the $4.5 billion smart grid program and the $2.5 billion loan guarantee program to support clean energy projects.

The Department of Homeland Security spent less than $500 million of its $2.8 billion allocation. When the stimulus bill was passed, the CBO estimated that Homeland Security would spend more than $1 billion by now. The slow spending comes from nearly every part of the agency. For example, Customs and Border Protection has paid out less than $50 million, even though it was authorized to spend $680 million to modernize ports of entry and deploy other border technology. That program was halted briefly last fall as news media and members of Congress questioned the plan to modernize little-used border stations in Montana and North Dakota instead of busy crossings along the southwest border.

While outlays may be a good measure of the progress of stimulus spending, we also think most people would interpret Obama's comment to mean that projects were actually being done faster than expected. Again, there is no comprehensive federal database tracking that statistic.

But ProPublica analyzed a piece of the stimulus, the money awarded to the Federal Highway Administration. Of the 12,932 projects listed in a database provided by the agency, 5,752 are marked as completed, about 45 percent. Of the completed projects, 51 percent were completed earlier than the estimated date. About 30 percent came in late and 12 percent on the same day. Several hundred projects had no estimated date.

In the case of the Federal Highway Administration, Obama could rightly claim that ""most"" projects have come in faster than expected (though barely, at 51 percent). But this is just one agency.

As with the claim about projects coming in under budget, Obama would have been on firm ground had he said ""many"" projects have come in faster than expected. Many have. But many have not. And if the claim is based on meeting a deadline to outlay funds, the overall target of 70 percent was reached -- barely -- by the end of September. That's only faster than expected if you expected the government to fail.

Obama makes a valid point about this being a good time to get deals on infrastructure projects. The recession has created desperate workers willing to work cheaper, and the cost of materials is still relatively low. Obama's point that this was borne out by the stimulus projects is on target. But he stretched the facts -- at least what is actually known -- when he claimed most projects have come in under budget and faster than expected. And so we rate his claim Half True.

Alderman says Milwaukee Public Schools spends 77 cents on employee benefits for every dollar it spends on salaries
","
When new census numbers ranked Milwaukee among the poorest big cities in America, Alderman Bob Donovan laid part of the blame on Milwaukee Public Schools -- and proposed an extreme step for the district.

In a statement issued Sept. 29, 2010, the fiery alderman said MPS should declare bankruptcy.

It’s not clear if the district could. The state Department of Public Instruction says the MPS board would have to determine if it is possible and the city attorney has not researched the question.

We’ll leave it to students of finance to sort out if bankruptcy is the right approach to take. But we were struck by one of the claims Donovan made in stating his case.  

Arguing that MPS’s pension and health benefits are ""unsustainable and overly generous,"" Donovan pointed to the district’s 2010-2011 budget and said:

""MPS will provide 77 cents in employee benefits for every dollar it spends on wages.""

Wait a minute. Don’t most employers -- even public sector ones -- pay far less in benefits for every $1 in wages?

Let’s start with Donovan’s specific claim, then take a look at his larger point -- that MPS benefits are excessive, taking limited money away from the classroom.

In making his claim, Donovan said the 77 cent figure came from the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau, which is the research staff for the Common Council.

In turn, the reference bureau said it came from a March 2010 column written by education writer Alan Borsuk in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Borsuk said the figure came from an estimate MPS made that month, in developing the school district’s 2010-2011 budget.

By the time Donovan made his statement in late September, however, the district had revised its estimate to a somewhat smaller number: 74 cents. That is where the figure remained after the School Board approved the budget in October 2010.

So, Donovan is generally on target.

But some additional clarification is in order. Donovan’s statement suggests the pay-to-benefits ratio applies to the cost of current employees only.

When MPS calculates its benefits in this fashion, it also includes the cost of providing benefits -- including pensions and health care -- to retirees. The district could not separate those costs for us, but that approach makes the figure higher.

How does the 74-cent figure compare?

Here’s what some other local governments estimate they will spend in 2011 on benefits -- for employees and retirees -- for every $1 spent on wages: 
Meanwhile, Milwaukee County -- struggling with the cost of enhanced pension benefits that led to officials being removed from office -- projects it will pay $1 in benefits for each dollar it pays in wages in 2011.

All right, the bell is about to ring, so we’ll wrap up our lesson.

In calling on Milwaukee Public Schools to file for bankruptcy, Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan said that for every $1 MPS will spend in 2011 on wages, it will spend another 77 cents on benefits. The figure was off a bit, since he used an early estimate -- the actual number is 74 cents. And it’s a little confusing for taxpayers, since it rolls in costs related to retirees, not just current employees. But his larger point -- that MPS pays a lot more in benefits than other local governments pay -- is on the money.

We rate Donovan’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BC8580>],/factchecks/2010/nov/10/bob-donovan/alderman-says-milwaukee-public-schools-spends-77-c/

Gov. Rick Perry said that five of his citizens were killed last week
","
Which has been Gov. Rick Perry's favorite fight — flicking off Democratic challenger Bill White or saving the states from Washington? 
He has talked more about states' rights lately, in part via a busy campaign to promote his new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington. On Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show"" Monday night, host Jon Stewart wondered whether Perry would be ""more comfortable with the United States under the Articles of the Confederation,"" a reference to the first constitution of the United States. 
Perry responded: ""What I'm really comfortable with is Washington understanding that they're doing too much. I'd like for them to do their basic responsibilities like secure our border with Mexico. I had five of my citizens that were killed last week. I've asked two administrations to put the boots on the ground, to secure that border."" 
Perry has often talked up his requests for more National Guard troops on the Texas border. In a February 2009 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, he asked for an ""additional 1,000 Title 32 National Guard positions."" And in April, we rated Half True Perry's claim that ""we've got a 1,000 National Guard troop request that's been in front of this president for over a year and no response."" 
But the governor's mention of slain Texans to bolster his calls for more border security was new to us, and we wondered which citizens Perry was citing. 
Responding to our request for elaboration, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier sent us a link to a Nov. 5 article on CNN.com naming six U.S. citizens who were killed last week on the Mexico side of the border near El Paso. 
CNN reported that Eder Diaz Sotero and Manuel Acosta, both American students at the University of Texas at El Paso, were killed in Ciudad Juarez on Nov. 2, according to the U.S. Consulate in that city. CNN reported that the two students were ""gunned down in a hail of more than 30 bullets while driving in Chihuahua State."" 
Four more U.S. citizens were shot to death in Ciudad Juarez (adjoining El Paso) the weekend of Oct. 29, according to CNN and other news reports: a woman who was shot inside a tortilla shop; a man and woman who were shot in a car near the Zaragoza International Bridge connecting Juarez to El Paso; and a man who died of multiple gunshot wounds outside a house. It was the deadliest weekend for Americans in Mexico since February, according to a Nov. 2 Associated Press story published in the Austin American-Statesman. 
Separately, we reviewed other news reports indicating that six U.S. citizens have been killed in Juarez since Oct. 30. The St. Petersburg Times reported that they were from El Paso. 
As we completed this article, Nicole Thompson, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of State, confirmed to us that six U.S. citizens have been killed recently in Juarez. 
Summing up: Perry was one short in recounting the six Americans from El Paso killed in Ciudad Juarez since little over a week ago — presumably missing the sixth because there was a delay before the U.S. Consulate confirmed the American identity of one of the slain students. 
But Perry made his claim in the context of arguing for tougher border security in the U.S. without mentioning that his citizens, as he put it, were killed in a foreign country, not the U.S. Nor did he say how securing the border on the U.S. side would prevent shootings in Mexico. 
Those are important details to omit. We rate his statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB71C0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/10/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-said-five-his-citizens-were-killed-/

Portland’s Voter-Owned Elections failed because voters here like to say no?
","
In 2005, the Portland City Council approved a campaign finance program to give candidates public money to run for office. It was supposed to get big money out of politics and let candidates focus on talking to voters, not raising campaign cash. It was considered very progressive and very Portland, and city commissioners said they would put the issue to voters in 2010. Last week, those voters rejected it by a slim margin.

Heather Stuart, spokeswoman for the ""Yes on 26-108"" campaign, issued a statement the day after the election, expressing disappointment over the results. She said the other side had distorted the financial cost of the program, and she said that the campaign had suffered from the bad economy.

Stuart also wrote this: ""Historical data shows that it is always more difficult to get a ‘yes’ vote, especially in the face of organized opposition.""

The reporters at PolitiFact Oregon have been in the game long enough to know that, indeed, voters statewide tend to say no when the proposal on the ballot is confusing, is controversial or costs money. But Stuart’s implication that statewide skepticism played a role in sinking a campaign-funding measure solely in Portland is suspect.

Portland isn't like the rest of Oregon. Portland, which exists mostly in Multnomah County -- with teeny bits in Washington and Clackamas counties -- likes to say yes.

We have backup from Pat McCormick, a veteran of ballot measure battles, most recently on the losing side over tax-raising Measures 66 and 67. He was hard-pressed to think of a spending plan that Portland didn't like. ""You have to do quite a bit to get to a 'no' on a money measure in this city,"" he said.

Want more evidence? Let’s take a stroll through the votes of Multnomah County. (We’ll use this because elections usually are conducted by counties, and Portland is the most dominant city in Multnomah County. Where appropriate, we’ll cite Portland-only measures.)

November 2010: County voters approved four of six statewide ballots measures, and five of seven county measures. County voters even approved the unpopular TriMet levy that failed because of opposition in Washington and Clackamas counties. And, finally, Portland voters weren’t afraid to embrace a property tax levy for new fire trucks and other emergency equipment.

January 2010: Voters approved two statewide tax measures -- 66 and 67 -- by more than 70 percent.

November 2008: County voters approved all three property tax levies on the ballot. They were for the Oregon Zoo, Portland Community College and children’s programs.

November 2007: Voted yes on a statewide land-use rewrite, yes on a statewide tobacco tax that went down elsewhere; and yes to a city measure tweaking medical benefits for retired police and firefighters.

May 2007: Of four wonky city measures on the ballot, voters said yes to all but one. (They opted to keep the city’s commission-style of government.)

November 2006: County voters renewed a local levy to continue library services and to give Metro more money for fish and wildlife protection. Portland voters also approved a schools levy and a measure to reform the police and fire disability and retirement fund. (But people on the outer edges of the city and county, who tend to be more tight-fisted, said no to levies for Mt. Hood Community College, Reynolds School District and David Douglas School District.)

February 2004: Voters issued a rare no on Ballot Measure 30, which would have enacted a temporary tax surcharge and other changes to avoid budget cuts.

January 2003: But the year before, Multnomah was one of just five counties in Oregon to say yes to Ballot Measure 28, which again would have increased taxes temporarily to plug the budget.

November 2002: Voters approved funding for children’s programs, parks and the county library. (Again, Portland voters in the Parkrose and Reynolds school districts said no to operating levies for those schools.)   

And so on. Readers, you get the picture.

Stuart said money is key here, as well as the strength of opposition. And she’s right when saying that money measures, historically, have had some money behind them to send the message to voters. In this case, however, the ""organized opposition"" cited by Stuart spent one-fifth of what supporters did. Supporters spent $311,200, while the main opposition group spent $66,100.

It was more than organized opposition or the bad economy or a general dislike of spending measures that defeated Voter Owned Elections, McCormick said. Voters really don’t like it when politicians go ahead and spend taxpayer money ""and then come back and ask after the fact, ‘Was it OK that I spent your money on this?’"" Which is what happened here.

So the statement contains some element of truth -- but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Portland, as a city, is not one that says no a lot. We rate this claim Barely True.

State senator says animal cruelty lead to violent adults
","
State Sen. Robert Brown wants to strengthen Georgia's animal cruelty laws and made his case at a recent hearing.

""Animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans,"" said Brown, a Democrat from Macon, ""and prosecuting such behavior is our first line of defense against potentially dangerous criminals.""

Is it true? Are people who abuse animals more likely to hurt people?

""He's right,"" said Mary Lou Randour, professional outreach director for animal cruelty for the Humane Society of the United States. ""It's just another example of the type of people who are anti-social and aggressive.""

Animal cruelty became a hot topic in these parts in 2007 when one of the state's biggest athletic stars, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, was accused of participating in a dogfighting ring with some of his longtime friends. Vick pleaded guilty, served time in prison and is now the starting QB for the Philadelphia Eagles.

Randour sent us links to several academic studies that link animal abuse to violence against people. We looked at those. And we looked at a variety of other information relating to the subject.

Researchers have been conducting more detailed studies on the subject for several decades. The findings are similar:

- The Chicago Police Department looked at 332 animal cruelty and related cases from July 2001 to July 2004. Police found 70 percent of suspects had prior arrests for other felonies. Eighty-six percent of them had two or more prior arrests.

- A 2007 study of some women in domestic violence shelters found their abusers were 11 times more likely to have harmed or killed a pet.

- A 1983 study of alleged child abuse found evidence in 60 percent of the cases of possible earlier animal abuse.

- Of 117 men serving time in South African prisons for crimes ""of aggression,"" nearly two-thirds of them admitted to cruelty to animals, according to a 1999 study.

Brown authored legislation in 2000 that allows animal abuse to be charged as a felony. The senator said he pushed for the changes, in part, from anecdotal stories of people who abused animals when they were young and committed felonies against people as adults. Brown also was swayed by FBI agents who made the connection between animal abuse and violence against people.

Brown said he's considering legislation that would create tougher penalties on people who abuse animals in the presence of children. Brown said he's not sure whether it will pass when the Legislature convenes in January because he understands lawmakers will be focused on the state's budget challenges and there will be a large freshman class at the Gold Dome next year.

""We want to look at a remedy [to the existing law] that will have some broad impact,"" he said.

Brown appears to have done his homework on his claim about the connection between animal abuse and violence against humans. There is overwhelming research that Brown is right. This one is a slam-dunk. We rate his claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E5200>],/factchecks/2010/nov/10/robert-brown/state-senator-says-animal-cruelty-lead-violent-adu/
