A social media post about a passenger on Rosa Parks’ bus is satire
","The story of Rosa Parks is a milestone in American civil rights history. On Dec. 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Ala., during the era of legalized racial segregation across the South, Parks, a Black woman, was arrested and fined for refusing a bus driver’s order to give up her seat to a white male passenger. Her arrest led to the Montgomery Bus boycott, a turning point in the civil rights movement that led the Supreme Court to order the desegregation of Montgomery’s buses. But a Facebook post added an eyebrow-raising plot twist: ""The Rosa Parks story gets more complicated when we acknowledge that the white man who wanted her seat was suffering from ADHD and anxiety.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It originated from a tweet that appeared to confuse many people who were unsure whether it was for real. ""I have ADHD and anxiety,"" one person replied. ""I have never in my life even felt remotely compelled to tell someone to get up from their seat at any public place because ‘I deserve it more.’"" ""Maybe I need tone tags, cause this fooled me,"" wrote another Twitter user, referring to symbols or codes that help to convey the tone of a message. The author of the Twitter post, Charles Austin, cleared things up: It was meant as satire. ""I think a good rule of thumb when people see a post like that is just to check what that person's other recent tweets are like,"" Austin told PolitiFact. ""If all my other tweets from that time are stuff like ‘cigarettes are vegetarian,’ it should be clear it’s satire.""  Austin said he wrote the tweet to mock social media users who post these types of statements for real. ""The joke is ultimately about the tortured logic people use on social media to justify abhorrent opinions using language that is ostensibly inclusive and empathetic: we must ‘acknowledge’ the ‘suffering’ of the guy who's clearly in the wrong,"" Austin said. Lopez D. Matthews, digital librarian at Howard University who specializes in Black history, said that kind of logic has been invoked against civil rights throughout history. ""Those who were anti-civil rights would claim that by granting civil rights protections, you were taking away the rights of people who wanted to discriminate,"" Matthews said. Historical records, including accounts from both Parks and Blake, don’t identify the passenger whom Parks was ordered to move for. Donna Beisel, assistant director of the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery, said the only public information available about the man is that he and the others who boarded at the same time had come from the Empire and Paramount theaters.  In any case, ADHD and anxiety weren’t officially recognized as diagnoses by the American Psychiatry Association until the 1980s and early 1990s, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Records in the National Archives say Parks was seated in the row just behind the section reserved for white people. When the bus became full, Blake ordered Parks and three other Black passengers to give their seats up for the white passengers. Parks refused, and Blake called to have her arrested.  Blake said in an interview years later that Parks was in violation of city codes.  ""What was I supposed to do?"" Blake said. ""That damn bus was full and she wouldn’t move back. I had my orders. I had police powers — any driver for the city did. So the bus filled up and a white man got on, and she had his seat and I told her to move back, and she wouldn’t do it."" Parks recounted the story in an interview on ""The Merv Griffin Show,"" which was posted in a clip to YouTube. Parks said Blake told her and the other Black passengers to ""make it light"" on themselves and give up their seats so the man could sit. Parks refused. ""Living under that type of oppression, I didn’t feel like it was making it light on us or anyone else for me to stand up,"" Parks said. ""So I didn’t.""  A social media post said that the white man who wanted Rosa Parks’ seat on the bus was suffering from ADHD and anxiety. The author of the post said it was satire.  Historical records have limited information about who the passenger was on the bus.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/aug/02/facebook-posts/social-media-post-about-passenger-rosa-parks-bus-s/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Joe Biden']","
Biden's claim about Virginia unemployment largely holds up
","President Joe Biden recently lauded once and possibly future Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s record as a job creator when he led Virginia from 2014 to 2018. ""Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia by nearly 50%,"" Biden said during a July 23 campaign speech for McAuliffe in Arlington County. Biden’s statement has a familiar ring; McAuliffe has made similar claims for years. As we examine the president’s claim, keep in mind that McAuliffe was governor during a prosperous time. The United States had shaken the Great Recession and was well advanced into what became a record 128-month economic expansion. Both the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed people dropped in all 95 Virginia counties and 38 cities during McAuliffe’s term, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Virginia's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5% when McAuliffe took office in January 2014 and sank to 3.6% during his last full month as governor in December 2017. During the same span, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped from 6.7% to 4.1%. Virginia had the 13th lowest unemployment rate among states and the District of Columbia when McAuliffe took office. It ranked 17th in the nation when he left. The number of unemployed Virginians fell from almost 228,000 to about 144,000 during McAuliffe’s term — a 37% decrease. The number of unemployed people in the U.S. dropped from almost 10.2 million to almost 6.6 million during the same time — a 35%  decrease. To define rural areas in the state, we relied on a map posted by the Virginia Department Health that identifies rural counties and towns. Then we added BLS estimates for the number of unemployed people in each of those 50 localities. There were about 37,000 unemployed people in those rural areas when McAuliffe took office and 22,500 when he left. That’s a 39% decrease which, although sizable, seems a little below Biden’s claim of almost 50%. We asked the White House for the evidence supporting Biden’s statement and did not hear back. McAuliffe’s campaign tied the president’s remark to a 2018 PolitiFact Virginia fact-check on a similar claim by the former governor. McAuliffe said that when he had been governor, ""every single city and county in Virginia, their unemployment dropped, and in most of the rural communities, it dropped by over 50 percent.""  We rated McAuliffe’s statement Mostly True, taking slight issue with the part of his claim that most rural areas saw their unemployment cut by more than half. ""If McAuliffe had said most rural localities had seen a 45 percent drop in their number of unemployed people, he would have been correct,"" we wrote. Biden’s statement, however, is slightly different.  He says unemployment went down across rural Virginia by ""nearly 50%."" That requires different math than McAuliffe’s claim.  PolitiFact usually puts a caveat on fact-checks about employment numbers. Although presidents, governors and mayors love to take credit for good numbers, economists generally say politicians have only a marginal effect on the numbers. The economy, they say, ebbs and flows with global trends over which politicians have little control. While Virginia unemployment significantly fell during McAuliffe’s years, the decreases were in step with national trends. Biden said that during McAuliffe’s term as governor, ""Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia by nearly 50%."" Biden is right on the first part; each Virginia locality did see a drop in unemployment during McAuliffe’s term from 2014 to 2018. McAuliffe governed during boom years and unemployment rates fell in every state. The second part of Biden’s statement, that unemployment decreased by almost 50 percent in rural Virginia, is slightly inflated. It fell by 39%. On the whole, we rate Biden’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2021/jul/30/joe-biden/bidens-claim-about-virginia-unemployment-largely-h/
"['Debt', 'Illinois', 'Coronavirus', 'JB Pritzker']","
States can use ARPA money to replenish unemployment funds, contrary to Pritzker’s claim
","To meet a tidal wave of unemployment claims during last year’s COVID-19 shutdown, Illinois borrowed billions from the federal government. In fact, Illinois is among 17 states currently indebted to the federal government for more than $53 billion in unemployment benefit loans collectively. During an interview with Capitol News Illinois reporter Jerry Nowicki, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker was asked if he was considering paying the debt with money from President Joseph Biden’s pandemic relief package, known as the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. ""You can't actually use ARPA funds according to the rules of ARPA,"" Pritzker said. ""You can’t repay any debt that's already owed to the federal government with ARPA funds."" As Nowicki pointed out in the article and podcast following that interview, however, federal guidance issued in May by the U.S. Department of the Treasury carves out an exception to get unemployment funds back to pre-pandemic levels. So we reached out to Pritzker’s office to ask what the governor meant when he said federal relief can’t be used that way. Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh told us the governor mistakenly referred to an earlier version of Treasury rules and ""misspoke when discussing the current version."" Indeed, during his conversation with Nowicki about ARPA rules, Pritzker described Illinois’ unsuccessful push earlier this year to use the pandemic aid to repay another kind of federal loan the state took out during the pandemic. At the time Pritzker misspoke during the July 21 interview, however, many other states had used or were planning to use ARPA money to replenish unemployment funds, according to a May report from the Associated Press. And in June and early July, state business leaders and lawmakers from both parties were calling for Illinois to restore its unemployment fund with some of its approximately $8 billion in ARPA aid. Illinois currently owes the federal government $4.2 billion in unemployment advances. Unemployment benefits are funded by payroll taxes levied on employers. Federal law allows states to borrow money if they exhaust those funds. And while federal lawmakers paused payments on those advances during the pandemic, the loans will start accruing interest again on Sept. 6. ""Such states may need to raise taxes on their employers or reduce UC benefit levels, actions that dampen economic growth, job creation, and consumer demand,"" a December 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service warned. Whether Pritzker supports using ARPA dollars to help replenish the state’s unemployment fund, Abudayyeh did not say. ""The administration looks forward to working on a solution that considers the needs of both businesses and the Illinoisans who rely on these vital programs,"" she wrote in her emailed response to our inquiry after acknowledging Pritzker’s misstatement. We followed up asking if using ARPA dollars is among the solutions the governor is now considering, but did not hear back. Pritzker said ARPA funds cannot be used to pay down state unemployment insurance fund deficits. His office acknowledged federal guidelines released in May permit states to use that aid to replenish those funds and said Pritzker misspoke. We rate Pritzker’s claim False.

Most states require signature verification for mail ballots
","Former President Donald Trump generated loads of falsehoods about voting by mail in 2020 — a theme that continues to echo among some pundits and social media users who wrongly suggest that voting by mail lacks security provisions.  ""Firearms dealers should be able to sell guns by mail without seeing the buyer or verifying the signature,"" states a July 19 Facebook post. ""Just like mail-in voting."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post uses a sarcastic setup and a comparison to guns to make a point about the security of mail-in voting. But its suggestion that mail-in voting requires no signature verification is wrong. Many states require signature verification for mail-in voting, and others have separate processes for checking the identity of the voter on a mailed ballot. Voting by mail has grown in popularity in recent years with roughly half of voters doing so in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats who voted by mail far outnumbered Republicans, and after the election many GOP state lawmakers proposed or passed new restrictions on voting by mail. The most common method to verify that absentee or mailed ballots are coming from the correct voter is signature verification or matching, according to Amanda Zoch, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, a policy research organization. For 2020, 31 states had laws requiring signature matching, including some key battlegrounds where Trump and his allies disputed the results. The 31 are Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington and West Virginia. For example, Nevada election officials verified voter signatures on every ballot they received, according to the secretary of state’s website. If the signature was missing or the signature on the ballot return envelope didn’t match the signature on file, the ballot wasn’t counted until the voter took steps to verify their signature. States without signature matching requirements use other processes to verify absentee ballots, which may include requiring photocopies of ID documents when returning the ballot, requiring that the ballot envelope be countersigned by a witness or notarized, or some combination of these steps, Zoch told PolitiFact.  There are several other steps election officials take to verify that a person who receives a mail ballot is an eligible voter. That starts with election officials regularly updating voter registration records by checking national change-of-address databases or death records.  ""It is ludicrous for these individuals to suggest there are not security measures for mail ballots and clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding of state laws and election procedures,"" said Amber McReynolds, founding CEO of the Vote at Home Institute. Steven Bellovin, a computer science professor and expert on security at Columbia University,  wrote an essay in October 2020 about all of the steps taken to ensure security of mail-in ballots, starting with the first layer of defense: They are sent only to registered voters. ""These security measures bring the integrity of mail-in ballots to levels very close to those of in-person ballots, while also considerably increasing availability,"" Bellovin wrote. ""In my business, we call that a net win for security."" Voter fraud prosecutions — including related to mail ballots — are rare. When there has been evidence of voter fraud, it’s often in a local election, as was the case in a small city in Mississippi. Bloomberg reporters recently contacted state officials nationwide to ask for evidence of voter fraud that led to court charges since the November 2018 elections and found about 200 cases. The reporters also examined news reports and the database of voter fraud cases compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Their number may not reflect a full accounting nationwide since local prosecutors can make their own charging decisions, but it shows that voter fraud is rare. Finally, a word about the post’s reference to gun sales by mail. Federal law requires that all retail firearm sales through a federally registered firearm dealer be completed face to face and include a signed background-check form, verification from the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and verification of ID and residency, said Mark Oliva, spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Federal law places some limitations on the mailing firearms directly to purchasers across state lines without meeting in person or delivering the firearm through a licensed firearm dealer, according to Ari Freilich, state policy director at Giffords Law Center. The Facebook post suggests that mail-in voting requires no signature verification. As a blanket statement nationwide, that’s wrong. In 2020, 31 states required signature verification for mail in voting. The other states take other steps to ensure the security of mail in voting, starting with the voter registration process.  We rate this statement False.

No proof man who filmed Capitol riot led it, or was antifa
","A viral image claims that a member of the left-wing movement antifa disguised himself as a Donald Trump supporter and instigated the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead. The image, posted on Facebook on June 21 and widely shared more than a month later, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post alludes to activist John Earle Sullivan, a 27-year-old Utah man who has often posed as a journalist to record protests. He joined Trump supporters rioting at the Capitol, extensively recorded the violence and is charged with crimes for his participation. But we found no evidence that Sullivan is a member of antifa, or that he caused the riot, even as he celebrated the violent acts he recorded. Antifa stands for ""anti-fascist."" It’s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that’s been around for decades, but has had a resurgence since Trump’s election in 2016. Sullivan told PolitiFact in January that he’s not part of the antifa coalition, and that he went to the Capitol to document what was going on.  The image shows two whiteboards, both of which have a photo and text.  The top panel, without identifying him by name, shows a widely circulated photo of Sullivan, who became one of the better known figures in the riot. The caption says: ""This is a known antifa member who was paid $70,000 for his Capitol riot video Jan. 6."" The bottom panel shows a man wearing a ""Trump 2020"" hat pulled over his eyes. The caption suggests the photo is of Sullivan, saying: ""The FBI says they have no proof antifa members dressed as Trump supporters & caused the Capitol riot January 6, 2021."" According to news reports, news outlets paid $90,000 to Sullivan for his riot videos, including one that captured the fatal shooting by a Capitol Police officer of Ashli Babbit, who was with rioters who tried to force their way into the House chamber. Federal authorities in May seized $90,000 from Sullivan as part of the criminal case against him.  The Justice Department has so far charged 556 people in connection with the siege, according to a database run by the George Washington University Center on Extremism. The charges against Sullivan include  felony interference with law enforcement and weapons counts. According to the charges, he led an organization called Insurgence USA, through which he organized protests, and he has posed as a journalist. Wearing a bulletproof vest and gas mask on Jan. 6, he said, he entered the Capitol with others through a broken window and filmed the violence, which the video footage shows him cheering on.  The charges do not say whether Sullivan wore pro-Trump gear. Sullivan’s affiliations are complicated, according to news stories about him.  The protests he organized included one that featured Black leaders as well as members of the Proud Boys, an all-male extremist group with ties to white nationalism, and he organized racial justice rallies as well as a pro-gun rights rally, in which he marched with self-styled militia members, the Washington Post reported. He ""made a habit of blurring the lines between activism, advocacy journalism and opposition research,"" wrote the New Yorker. The New Yorker quoted Sullivan as writing in an unpublished memoir: ""I was able to collaborate with the left in their community to gather information.

CDC test can’t differentiate between COVID and the flu? That’s wrong.
","Posts circulating on Facebook and Instagram claim the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will stop using its COVID-19 test because it cannot differentiate between the COVID virus and flu viruses. ""CDC has just announced they will revoke the emergency use authorization of the RT-PCR tests first introduced in 2/20,"" reads a July 25 post, which goes on to quote from the agency’s lab directive: ""CDC encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS CoV-2 and influenza viruses."" It continues: ""Translation: They've been adding flu cases to COVID cases when using that test."" Mike Huckabee, a former Fox News host who was also a Republican presidential candidate and governor of Arkansas, similarly claimed on Facebook that the CDC test cannot tell the difference between coronaviruses and flu viruses. A July 24 Instagram post went further: ""The FDA announced today that the CDC PCR test has failed its full review. Emergency Use Authorization has been REVOKED."" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’s partnership with Facebook.) We wanted to know whether there was any truth to the idea that the CDC was removing its test because it is faulty and cannot tell one virus from another. So we consulted several laboratory testing experts. The first Facebook post we referenced quoted from and linked to a July 21 CDC laboratory alert that informed labs that as of Dec. 31 the agency would withdraw its emergency use authorization request for the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel or, for short, the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR. It is standard practice for the Food and Drug Administration to issue temporary emergency use authorizations for tests and other medical products that have not yet undergone the FDA’s full approval process but need to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious diseases. The FDA issued the EUA for the CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR in February 2020. At that time, no other tests were available in the U.S. to determine whether someone had COVID. But it’s important to remember that what the CDC developed and submitted for its EUA request was not a tangible product but rather a protocol for how to test for COVID, said Susan Whittier, a professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. That means the CDC wrote out directions specifying which reagents were needed to test the laboratory samples for the presence of the COVID virus. The CDC does not distribute COVID tests. ""It’s not like they have a test that laboratories can purchase. We borrow their protocol and use the reagents that they say,"" said Whittier, who recently retired as director of the clinical microbiology lab at Columbia. So withdrawing the EUA request just ""means that protocol will no longer be available."" In the lab alert, the CDC said it was withdrawing the EUA request because, rather than testing only for the COVID virus, it wants labs to test people for multiple viruses simultaneously, using what is known as ""a multiplexed method."" The CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR panel tests only for COVID-19. ""Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season,"" noted the alert regarding the multiplexed method. Dr. Christopher Polage, an associate professor of pathology at Duke University, said his take on the CDC’s message is that, because flu season is on the horizon, a patient might come in with respiratory symptoms that could be attributed to either COVID-19 or the flu. Laboratories need to start testing for both COVID and various flu viruses. But the lab alert does not mean the CDC’s test cannot differentiate between COVID-19 and the flu. In fact, the CDC’s test was developed to look for the presence of a nucleic acid found only in the COVID virus, said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. ""It is not remotely accurate that the CDC test doesn’t differentiate between flu and SARS-CoV-2. It doesn’t detect influenza. It only detects SARS-CoV-2,"" said Wroblewski. ""If flu and COVID are both circulating, you would be able to detect only SARS-CoV-2 and not flu."" How the PCR test (or any other PCR test) works, Wroblewski said, is that primers, which are little bits of a genetic material, are used to identify specific viruses. In this case, the primer is built to identify a nucleic acid found only in the COVID virus. If the COVID virus is present in the sample, the primer will attach to the virus’s nucleic acid and make many copies of it. A chemical in the test will then fluoresce, which the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, machine will interpret as a positive result. If the COVID virus is not present, the primer will have nothing to attach to. When asked about the CDC withdrawing its EUA request, FDA spokesperson Jim McKinney told us PCR tests are considered the ""gold standard"" for COVID diagnosis. He pointed us to data that illustrated the specificity and exclusivity of the CDC’s test. That data shows test results came back negative for samples that contained similar viruses, including different types of flu and other coronaviruses. All of this means the CDC’s test would not erroneously detect flu viruses. Thus, the Facebook posts’ assertions that the test cannot differentiate between COVID and flu is demonstrably false. Even though the CDC is withdrawing its EUA request for this specific test, Wroblewski pointed out, it still has an EUA for a second PCR test, a multiplex one that simultaneously tests for COVID and influenza types A and B. The FDA has issued EUAs to many laboratories and testing companies for hundreds of COVID tests that use the same PCR technology the CDC uses — which experts said essentially made the CDC testing protocol moot, since similar tests will still be available. So, while it is true the CDC is withdrawing its EUA request for its test that tests solely for COVID, it is not for the reasons given by the Facebook posts. The assertion that COVID case counts were inflated because the test was faulty and was counting flu cases as COVID cases is false. ""They didn’t withdraw the EUA because the test wasn’t working,"" said Whittier. ""They just wanted people to look for other viruses as well."" Polage agreed. ""The CDC is pulling their test ‘off the market’ as a gesture to encourage labs to use tests that include reagents (primers and probes) for both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza so providers, labs, states, and CDC will have better data this fall and winter to estimate how much of clinical influenza-like illness is due to SARS-CoV-2 and how much is due to seasonal influenza,"" Polage said in an email. Social media posts claimed the CDC was revoking its emergency use authorization request for its COVID test because it couldn’t differentiate between the COVID virus and flu viruses. While the CDC is withdrawing its EUA request for the 2019-nCoV RT-PCR test, it is not because the test is faulty. Rather, it’s because the agency is concerned that, with flu season approaching, patients with respiratory illness symptoms should be screened for both the flu and COVID. The patients shouldn’t be tested for COVID alone, because flu cases might be missed. The statements made in these Facebook posts are not accurate. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/30/facebook-posts/cdc-test-cant-differentiate-between-covid-and-flu-/

A UK health official misspoke when he said 60% of hospitalized patients had been fully vaccinated
","In a July 19 press conference, the U.K.’s chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, incorrectly said, ""around 60% of the people being admitted to hospitals with COVID have been double vaccinated."" Vallance corrected himself later that day, tweeting: ""About 60% of hospitalisations from covid are not from double vaccinated people,"" Vallance wrote. ""Rather 60% of hospitalisations from covid are currently from unvaccinated people."" But by then, clips of Vallance’s initial statement began circulating online. A viral Facebook post repeated the incorrect statistic and said, ""60% of patients admitted to the hospital in the UK have been fully vaccinated."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post didn’t acknowledge Vallance’s correction, leaving the misleading impression that it was accurate. But even the corrected statistic has raised eyebrows. It suggests that 40% of hospitalized patients are people who were at least partly vaccinated. On his July 19 show, Fox News host Tucker Carlson cited the corrected statement and went on to question why it appears that so many vaccinated people in the U.K. are being hospitalized. ""The fact that anybody is going to the hospital, particularly a big percentage of people who are going to the hospital who have already been vaccinated, is the opposite of what they've been telling us here in the United States,"" Carlson said. ""They've been telling us anyone who is fully vaccinated is fine; the only people getting dangerously sick or dying from COVID are those people who have refused to get the vaccine."" The explanation lies in both the high rates of vaccination in the U.K., and the rapid spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus, health officials say. ""Even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated,"" a spokesperson for the agency said in an email. A July 23 technical briefing from the government agency Public Health England found that 229,218 delta variant cases were recorded between Feb. 1 and July 19. Of these cases, 7,790, or 3.4%, of the total recorded infections resulted in hospitalization. Of these 7,790 hospitalizations, 4,853 or 62.3%, of people were unvaccinated, aligning with the 60% Vallance mentioned. The breakdown for the remaining nearly 40% went like this: 1,101 (14.1%) had received both doses 1,148 (14.7%) were at least 21 days past their first dose 608 (7.8%) were fewer than 21 days past their first dose 80 (1%) of the samples sequenced could not be matched to someone.  What all that means is that roughly 0.48% of people who tested positive for COVID-19, and had been fully vaccinated in the U.K., had to be hospitalized. Vaccination still helps prevent a large number of hospitalizations. While no vaccines are 100% effective, Public Health England cited a study suggesting that with two doses, both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are over 90% effective in preventing infections that require hospitalization. So even though the delta variant has reduced the efficacy of the available vaccines, the U.K.’s National Health Service still recommends vaccination against COVID-19. The country’s vaccination program is estimated to have prevented at least 21.3 million infections, 57,500 deaths, and 52,600 hospitalizations so far. A Facebook post said ""60% of the people admitted to hospitals with covid have been double vaccinated."" The claim was based on a misstatement by a U.K. health official. The official issued a correction where he said he meant to say that 60% of hospitalized patients were unvaccinated. The post didn’t acknowledge the correction.

No, DC Officer Michael Fanone isn’t man who stormed Capitol with Confederate flag
","As he defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone was beaten and tased, he testified before a House select committee. Fanone, 40, described being dragged into the crowd, stripped of his badge, and threatened with chants to ""kill him with his own gun."" He said he fell unconscious, suffered a heart attack, and was later diagnosed with a concussion, a brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, some social media users are falsely claiming that Fanone played a much different role during the insurrection — not as an officer guarding the Capitol, but as a rioter who stormed it.  Their posts on various platforms were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But the two men in the photographs are not the same person, and one wasn’t pretending to be the other.  One photograph in the posts shows Fanone, the D.C. police officer, during his July 27 testimony before Congress. The other shows Kevin Seefried of Delaware, who was indicted on five charges after entering the Capitol with his son, Hunter Seefried, who was also indicted.  ""That is not Officer Fanone,"" said Sean Hickman, spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., when asked about the second photograph showing Seefried. Further proof that they are not the same includes their actions and outfits on Jan. 6. Fanone was dragged into the crowd by rioters on the Capitol grounds that afternoon, the video footage from his body camera shows. The House select committee investigating the insurrection played the footage during his testimony, as Fanone talked about it. Fanone described to lawmakers his whereabouts throughout the day. He said he arrived at the Capitol around 3 p.m. But around the same time on Jan. 6, Seefried was inside the Capitol. According to court filings, Seefried confirmed in a voluntary interview with the FBI that he had entered the Senate building through a broken window at approximately 2:13 p.m., and that he had brought a Confederate flag to Washington from his home in Delaware, where he usually displays it outside. And while the photograph of Seefried in the social media posts shows him wearing a sweatshirt and a coat, Fanone was in ""full uniform"" at the Capitol, he testified. Court documents in the case against another man who allegedly assaulted Fanone confirm that he was dressed that way.

Yes, George Washington ordered troops to be inoculated against smallpox during the Revolutionary War

Smith National Library for Study of George Washington, Washington and his Continental Army ""faced a threat that proved deadlier than the British"" in the first years of the Revolutionary War — smallpox.  Infrequent outbreaks and wariness of inoculation made his troops very susceptible to the disease,"" according to the library. ""After heavy losses in Boston and Quebec, Washington implemented the first mass immunization policy in American history.""  Washington issued the order to have all troops inoculated on Feb. 5, 1777, in a letter to John Hancock, who was president of the Second Continental Congress. In another letter, Washington ordered all recruits arriving in Philadelphia be inoculated.  ""Finding the smallpox to be spreading much and fearing that no precaution can prevent it from running through the whole of our army, I have determined that troops shall be inoculated,"" he wrote. ""This expedient may be attended with some inconveniences and some disadvantages, but yet I trust in its consequences will have the most happy effects. Necessity not only authorizes but seems to require the measure, for should the disorder infect the army in the natural way and rage with its virulence we should have more to dread from it than from the sword of the enemy.""  By the end of 1777, about 40,000 soldiers had been inoculated against the disease.  Washington had initially ordered that no one in the army be inoculated, which was done by infecting them with a less-deadly form of smallpox, because he didn’t want to risk debilitating his men and leaving them vulnerable to a British attack while they recovered.  ""The enemy, knowing it, will certainly take advantage of our situation,"" he wrote at the time.  But inoculating recruits as soon as they enlisted meant they contracted the milder form of the disease at the same time they were being outfitted for war, and they would be healed by the time they left to join the army, according to the library.  Washington, who had suffered from smallpox as a teenager, strongly believed in the effectiveness of inoculation and persuaded his wife to undergo the procedure in 1776 even as he forbade his troops from being inoculated, National Geographic reported.  Back then, the inoculation process was called variolation, named after the virus that causes smallpox — the variola virus.  It involved exposing people to the virus by scratching material from smallpox sores into their arms or having them inhale it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Variolation was eventually replaced by vaccination after an English doctor named Edward Jenner noticed in 1796 that milkmaids who had gotten cowpox were immune to smallpox, according to the CDC. He guessed that exposure to cowpox could be used to protect people against smallpox and developed a vaccine. Our ruling The image claims, ""George Washington mandated smallpox vaccines for the Continental Army.""  The shorthanded history is basically right. The smallpox vaccine didn’t exist when Washington was commander in chief of the Continental Army, but the point remains: he ordered the inoculation of troops against smallpox by the means that was then available, variolation.  We rate this post Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/jul/30/viral-image/yes-george-washington-ordered-troops-be-inoculated/

In that clip, the GM executive acknowledges that the electricity charging the demonstration car likely comes from coal and natural gas. She does not say that 95% of the energy for electric cars comes from coal.

The film’s writer-director, Jeff Gibbs, attended the news conference, in Lansing, Mich., and asked questions of Kristin Zimmerman, who was then a GM executive and part of the team that developed the Volt. Standing near the demo vehicle at an electric-car charging station, Zimmerman is asked what the source of the energy is for the electricity. She says that the charging station’s power is connected to the building in the background, but that she doesn’t know whether the building’s energy comes from coal or natural gas.  The clip then cuts to J. Peter Lark, who was then an executive of the Lansing Board of Water & Light. He says the Volt was charging off Lansing’s electric grid, ""which is about 95% coal.""  If that was accurate, there’s a good chance that the Volt at the news conference was charging its battery at that moment with electricity from coal.  But that’s not the case for all charging stations. The electricity supply for electric cars depends on whatever the local sources of energy are where they’re being charged. Some regions don’t have coal-fired power plants.

Rigell says GOP Medicare plan offers those under 55 same healthcare options enjoyed by Congress
","
Seeking to dispel concerns that House Republicans want to end Medicare and push granny off a cliff, U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd, recently reached out to his constituents.

In a letter titled ""An open and honest conversation about Medicare,"" Rigell defended House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s ""Path to Prosperity Plan"" and attempted to address the ""misinformation coming out of Washington"" about it.  

Rigell laid out a series of ""facts,"" the first of which reads: ""Under the Path to Prosperity, there are no changes to Medicare for anyone 55 and older; those 54 and younger would receive the same kind of healthcare options now enjoyed by Members of Congress.""

We thought it worthwhile to look into the assertion that Americans 54 and younger would enjoy the same type of health care Rigell does. PolitiFact national has walked this road in April,  checking a claim from Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind.

As pointed out in that fact check, Medicare is currently a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.)

Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government ""premium support"" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care.

Here’s how Ryan’s plan explains it: ""When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.""

Ryan’s proposal would require the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, an agency that administrates the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, through which members of Congress buy their insurance.

Additionally, Ryan’s plan would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provide smaller premium supports to high earners.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found it would save the government money. But it would do so by requiring future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance.

""A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare,"" the CBO concluded.

Now let’s compare the benefits under Ryan’s plan to what members of Congress can buy.

How the plan is like what members of Congress get.

Asked to support Rigell’s claim, a representative from his office passed along information from the House Budget Committee. It points out that like the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, the Ryan plan would provide seniors a list of approved plans from competing private insurance companies and allow them the flexibility to choose.  

Those plans would be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. The government would also pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress.

How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. 
First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.)

Second, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise rates, through a formula known as ""Fair Share."" Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent.

Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs.

Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it’s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000.

Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

""As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs,"" the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report.

So let’s look back.

While Rigell’s office -- via the House Budget Committee -- points to similarities in the two plans’ flexibility, they remain fundamentally different at the core.

At a minimum, the premium supports of the Medicare plan would not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and would not likely have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they would not receive the same protection against rising costs that ""Fair Share"" provides members of Congress.

We rate Rigell’s statement Barely True.

Gary Johnson says tax breaks made New Mexico the 'second Hollywood'
","
Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson is basing his Republican presidential campaign on his fiscal conservatism and libertarian stands, but he’s also big on tax breaks, like the rest of the GOP field.

In an interview in Manchester, N.H., in June 2011 with the New Hampshire Business Review and thelobbynh.com, Johnson cited a 15 percent film production tax credit he signed in 2002, his last year in office, as the type of pro-business tax relief that can help create jobs.

Under the incentive, spending on production and post-production film and television work subject to New Mexico state taxes, including wages paid to state residents and nonresident actors working through a personal service corporation, can generate a tax credit now worth up to 25 percent. (The program was capped at $50 million worth of tax credits available annually as of July 1, 2011.)

""They passed a film incentive bill in New Mexico. The idea was to make New Mexico the second Hollywood. I signed the bill. I said I'm going to sign this bill but doesn't everyone see that we could be doing this for every business in New Mexico? ... It will happen. This will happen. But why the film industry? Why not all of us that have been here working all this time,"" Johnson said.

""Well, did it work?"" asked Review editor Jeff Feingold.

""Yeah, it's the second Hollywood of all 50 states. New Mexico is the second Hollywood,"" Johnson said.

Met with some friendly laughter, he continued: ""No, it is, it is. They built all sorts of film studios. I can just go down the list, I can click down the list for you of all the movies that have been made in New Mexico.""

Johnson may have greenlighted the tax incentives for the film industry but has New Mexico’s program become a Hollywood blockbuster?

The state certainly is scenic and hip -- spend a few nights in Santa Fe and a sunny day driving the High Road to Taos, and you may want to move to the Land of Enchantment, pronto. Albuquerque is only a 90-minute flight for actors and producers flying in from Los Angeles, and the sunny weather in winter and high-altitude temperatures in the summer makes for a cooperative climate for shoots, as well.

But when PolitiFact asked about Johnson’s claim, his campaign wasn’t able to provide much substantiation and said determining ""the second Hollywood"" isn’t easy.

In an e-mail, the Johnson campaign’s communications director, Joe Hunter, wrote: ""While quantifying -- or even determining how to quantify -- that New Mexico or any other state is the ‘second Hollywood’ is obviously imprecise, Governor Johnson’s statement was made in the context of having signed into law tax credits that were tremendously successful in attracting the film industry to the state. Those tax credits worked, and New Mexico is consistently identified as one of the best locales for film production.""

Actually, it is possible to compare the size of film industries in various states, and New Mexico does have a decent story to tell.

For starters, it’s no California, which tallies its film and television industry at $30 billion a year, with 140,000 production jobs, according to Amy Lemisch, executive director of the California Film Commission.

And New Mexico is not about to supplant New York either. In 2008, 63,000 people were employed as actors, camera operators, film editors and other production and post-production jobs in the state, with film and television-related wages of about $5 billion, according to the New York Office of the State Comptroller.

Industry experts say New Mexico can rival Louisiana, generally perceived as the third-largest state for the film and TV industry, especially since Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson, who succeeded Johnson, helped expand the incentive program, including raising the tax credit to 25 percent.

Both states adopted film tax credits in 2002, and an estimated $674 million was directly spent on motion picture productions in Louisiana in 2010. Since the tax credit became law, the state has averaged 92 productions, and more than 6,000 jobs per year, according to Louisiana Entertainment, the state agency that works with the film industry.

Louisiana has recently been the locale for Twilight: Breaking Dawn, Battle: Los Angeles, Green Lantern and 21 Jump Street, a new movie based on the TV series.

Meanwhile, in fiscal year 2010 in New Mexico, $204 million was spent directly on filming, creating 184,120 ""worker days"" and a financial impact of $612 million, according to the New Mexico Film Office.

And as the state’s production facilities – like the state-of-the-art Albuquerque Studios-- have grown and matured, the ""filmography"" from the state has increased from five major productions in 2003 to 17 in 2011.

Among the films and TV shows shot in New Mexico over the past nine years are Rent, Transformers, Fright Night, No Country for Old Men, Breaking Bad, True Grit, In Plain Sight and Marvel’s The Avengers.

Still, it’s a stretch to call the state ""the second Hollywood.""

Jeff Begun of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based The Incentives Office, which tracks inducements from various states for the film-production industry, said by e-mail that New Mexico ""is not the second Hollywood -- particularly with the new $50 million ‘rolling cap’ per year"" recently imposed on available tax credits in the state.

Begun said a handful of other states host more production than New Mexico, and ""If anything, Louisiana would be the second Hollywood -- I think they will do fairly close to a billion dollars in production this year.

""That being said, N.M. is not bad -- a 25% refundable credit with $50 million available represents about $250 million in production,"" Begun noted.

Similarly, Joe Chianese, the senior vice president of tax production planning and business development at Entertainment Partners in Burbank, Calif., said calling New Mexico the new second Hollywood ""is probably being a bit overdramatic.""

But he also said the state ""has been busy,"" and noted that the crew base in New Mexico has grown from less than 300 a decade ago to more than 3,000 now.

Lemisch, the director of the California Film Commission, also suggested Johnson’s claim was a bit over the top but not without some foundation.

""Obviously, he was exaggerating, but New Mexico has been quite a hub, but not as much a hub as Louisiana,"" she said.

To be clear, New Mexico hasn’t gotten all the business it wanted. Although the Disney Channel zit-flick High School Musical is set in Albuquerque, it actually was shot in Utah, which also offered incentives.

It’s also worth noting that the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal group that researches tax and budget issues, last year reported that 41 states followed New Mexico and Louisiana’s lead, but that many of the tax credits were costing the states money while generating few meaningful jobs for in-state residents.

The study said employment in the film and video production industry grew ""six-fold"" in the two states between 2002 and 2008, and that New Mexico also had used its colleges and universities to foster the industry. But the study also noted that employment dipped in 2009 during the recession and that the California firm that owns Albuquerque Studios, which has four of the largest sound stages in the country, filed for bankruptcy in July 2010. The studio has continued to operate during the reorganization, with major productions such as The Avengers and Breaking Bad being filmed there.

So was Gov. Johnson overstating the case when he said New Mexico has turned into the ""second Hollywood""?

Of course, but hey, it’s show business. And he is correct in asserting that New Mexico has become a player in the movie industry. We’ll give him a Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/15/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-tax-breaks-made-new-mexico-secon/

Ex-Mayor Franklin says small percent of educators named in APS cheating
","
Former Mayor Shirley Franklin won’t let a cheating scandal of historic proportions darken her sunny assessment of Atlanta’s Public Schools.

Franklin said that ex-APS Superintendent Beverly Hall, whom investigators implicated in the cheating, left the district ""significantly better than she found it."" Pants on Fire, we ruled.

The day after our ruling became public, Franklin told WXIA 11 Alive that she stands by her comments, and critics need to put the controversy in perspective. Cheating took place at some 40 schools, she said, but an investigative report on the scandal implicated only a small percentage of the district’s educators.  

""95 percent of the teachers and the principals are not implicated in the report at all,"" Franklin told reporter Jennifer Leslie on Saturday. ""There are 3,000 teachers and principals, and this report says that about 5 percent were involved in this.""

Only 5 percent? What about investigators’ conclusion that the cheating was ""widespread""?

PolitiFact Georgia hunted for answers.

The report, released July 5, found that cheating took place on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, a set of standardized tests administered across Georgia. Typically given in first through eighth grade, they’re designed to determine how well students meet state curriculum standards.

The report implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, in the cheating scandal. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined. Time magazine called it ""likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date.""

We contacted Franklin, who told us in a voice mail that the numbers she used in the TV interview were from news accounts, but did not give specifics.

The Truth-O-Meter soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia used an internal Atlanta Journal-Constitution database, state and federal data, and information from APS’ website to check Franklin’s claim.  

According to the AJC’s database and state and federal figures, there are some 4,000 educators in the district, which means that about 5 percent of the district’s educators were implicated.

Franklin’s arithmetic is correct, but we noticed some holes in her approach.  

Franklin’s calculation includes high school educators, but the CRCT is given only to students in grades 1 through 8. Also, Franklin’s number lumps teachers with principals and does not consider the number of schools involved.

We took these factors into account and made our own calculations. They led us to very different conclusions.

Cheating may have been limited among the rank and file, but the numbers show it was commonplace among school leadership.

Some 2,370 teachers handle students in grades 1 through 8, according to AJC’s database. The report implicated 140 of them, or about 6 percent.  

Principals are a different story. A recent APS list shows 70 of them at the district’s elementary and middle schools. Thirty-eight of them were implicated, or 54 percent.

Investigators found cheating in 44 out of 70 elementary and middle schools, which amounts to 63 percent.  

It’s also worth noting that a top cheating investigator warned Monday that the true percentage of educators involved is very likely higher than the numbers in the report suggest. A ""wall of silence"" among school employees made it difficult to identify all of those involved, former Attorney General Mike Bowers said.

This news makes Franklin’s claim that only a small percent of educators were implicated ""at all"" appear too clear-cut.

So, how do we rule?

The arithmetic behind the number Franklin uses in her claim that ""95 percent of teachers and principals are not implicated . . . at all"" is accurate.

But the impression she gives -- that if you put the cheating in perspective, only a small percent of the district is tainted -- ignores crucial context. More than half of the district’s middle and elementary school principals were implicated, and cheating took place at nearly two-thirds of APS schools.

These percentages may be lower than the true number of cheaters.

Franklin cherry-picked a number that supported her point, leaving out important details and taking things out of context. Her claim therefore meets PolitiFact’s definition of Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/jul/15/shirley-franklin/ex-mayor-franklin-says-small-percent-educators-nam/

PolitiFact Ohio thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, we’ll use his tweet.

The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ""saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.""  It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill’s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion.

The $278,000 per job figure doesn’t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000.

The blog item contends this statistic ""provides further evidence that President Obama’s ‘stimulus’ did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,"" and insists ""the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus’ and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead.""

After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were ""based on partial information and simply false analysis."" White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries ""that are critical to America’s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America’s working families.""

The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects.

Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure.

Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report’s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure.

Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A ""fact check"" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math ""satisfyingly simple but highly misleading.""

""Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped form a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,"" the 2009 Associated Press item noted.

The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually ""has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs."" It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now.

Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data.

""It’s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA’s help,"" Zandi told TPMDC. ""This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery.""

The day after the White House responded to the GOP’s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but ""rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000.""  

Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply ""cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus?""

So where does that leave Boehner’s tweet that said  ""POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job.""
  

  
On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Boehner’s tweet (and the subsequent variations of his claim) as False.

Eddie Rodriguez says Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from tax
","
Speaking to the tightened state budget passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez said outnumbered Democrats tried to illuminate tax loopholes and exemptions that, if closed, would yield badly needed state revenue.

The Austin Democrat told the Central Texas Democratic Forum on June 22: ""You all would be very, very surprised to know what we exempt in the state of Texas."" For example, he said, ""jet fuel is exempt. We are the only state, I think, that exempts that.""

For real?

Rodriguez’s chief of staff, Nate Walker, later said Rodriguez was referring to the fact Texas does not levy a motor fuels tax on jet fuel. Indeed, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the state comptroller’s office, pointed us to sections of the motor fuels tax code that exempt all gas for aircraft delivered into or sold from a storage facility of a licensed aviation fuel dealer from the state’s gas or motor fuels tax. A February report  by State Comptroller Susan Combs pegs the value of the gas tax exemption for aviation at $4.5 million for the fiscal year that ends Aug. 31. DeSilva said the value of the exemption for diesel fuel used in airplanes is not calculated. 
DeSilva said he didn’t know if Texas is the only state with such provisions.

Researching that aspect, we turned to the Washington-based Federation of Tax Administrators, which guided us to the Maryland-based Airline Owners and Pilots Association, which pointed us to a Phoenix expert on aviation costs.

Nel Stubbs of Conklin & de Decker, which describes itself as enabling customers to make more informed decisions when dealing with the purchase and operation of aircraft, told us by email that Texas and three other states — Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island — exempt jet fuel from their respective motor fuels taxes. Other states, she said, refund some or all of an airline’s motor fuels’ tax payments. Stubbs defined jet fuel as a type of aviation fuel designed for aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines.

Rodriguez’s office, which we alerted to Stubbs’ analysis, passed along a 2008 report by Stubbs illuminating variations in jet-fuel taxation. California, for instance, levies a jet-fuel tax of two cents per gallon, though airlines are exempt. Similarly, commercial aircraft may qualify for partial exemptions from Florida’s tax of 6.9 cents per gallon, according to the report, while airlines fueling in New York are entitled to refunds of their payments of 6.5 cents a gallon.

Stubbs, saying she’s tracked state-by-state differences since the late 1980s, added in an interview: ""We’re 50 little kingdoms out there. You can never say, ‘We’re the only state that does this,’ because you’d be wrong. You can never say, ‘All states do something (either).’ They’re all different."" Finally, she forwarded a chart showing variations in tax methods showing too that 11 states charge a sales tax, yet no motor fuels tax, on jet fuel.

We circled back to Rodriguez, who said he had assumed Texas was the only state that doesn’t levy the motor fuels tax on jet fuel because the exemption struck him as weird. Besides, he reminded, Texas still is one of the few states with the exemption.

We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/15/eddie-rodriguez/eddie-rodriguez-says-texas-only-state-exempts-jet-/

New Jersey Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver says studies show right-to-work laws don’t spur job growth
","
A pair of Republicans in the state Assembly recently introduced a bill that would make New Jersey the 23rd state where workers can opt against joining a union, setting off a debate over the economic impact of so-called ""right-to-work"" laws.

Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth/Middlesex), one of the bill’s sponsors, had claimed the move ""would quicken New Jersey’s economic revival."" But Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex/Passaic) said the legislation was ""dead on arrival.""

In a July 8 press release, Oliver explained how right-to-work laws represent bad economic policy.

""Numerous studies have shown that these so-called right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth,"" Oliver said in the press release. ""In fact, these laws have been found to suppress wages and have had no impact on employment and business growth.""

After looking at the research and talking to economic experts, PolitiFact New Jersey ended up with a mixed picture of the impact of right-to-work laws. Some experts argue that the influence of that single policy is difficult to pin down, but others said there is a connection between job creation and right-to-work laws.

First, let’s talk about job growth in those right-to-work states.

Patrick Semmens, a spokesman for the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, pointed out that right-to-work states are producing jobs at a faster rate than other states. A recent ruling from PolitiFact Georgia confirmed that trend.

Handlin argued that higher personal income and lower unemployment rates are examples of right-to-work leading to job growth. Semmens and Handlin both referred to the research done by Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder.

Vedder told us right-to-work laws were associated with job creation. Even accounting for other factors, right-to-work laws produce positive economic outcomes, he wrote in an email.

Yet some right-to-work states have no state income tax, which could make the relationship between right-to-work laws and income growth seem like a ""mirage,"" Vedder wrote.

Vedder acknowledged how job growth is greater in right-to-work states, but added ""that showing a statistical relationship does not necessarily imply causation.""

So, are right-to-work laws the reason for the job growth in those states?

Oliver’s spokesman, Tom Hester Jr., sent us an April study from the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, that supports the assemblywoman’s argument. That study claims that since both sets of states ""can foster booming job markets, then something in these states’ economies, demographics, or policies other than RTW must be driving their growth.""

Roland Zullo, a research scientist in labor and economic studies at the University of Michigan, said there’s no convincing research proving a link between right-to-work laws and job growth or decline. Other factors, such as tax packages, could explain what’s driving companies to right-to-work states, Zullo said. 
Another recent study by two economics professors reached a mixed conclusion on the subject. In terms of manufacturing employment, a right-to-work law had no significant impact in Oklahoma, but another right-to-work law increased the number of jobs in Idaho, according to an email from those professors, Serkan Ozbeklik and Ozkan Eren.

Right-to-work laws likely create jobs, but part of the job growth is probably the result of other business-friendly policies in right-to-work states, according to Ozbeklik and Eren.

W. Robert Reed, an economics professor in New Zealand, who had researched right-to-work laws while working in Oklahoma, wrote in a series of emails that right-to-work laws create jobs and increase wages. Right-to-work limits the ability of unions to negotiate benefits to the point of discouraging companies from hiring new employees, Reed wrote.

But Reed noted, as Vedder did earlier, that ""correlation does not prove causation.""

""Did wages grow faster in RTW states because of RTW legislation? Or because of other factors? That's virtually impossible to determine,"" Reed wrote. ""So many other factors could also have been responsible for job and wage growth in those states.""

It’s worth noting that the research is also divided on whether right-to-work laws reduce workers’ wages, as Oliver suggested.

Two studies from the Economic Policy Institute suggest workers in right-to-work states earn less than their counterparts in other states. Ozbeklik and Eren found that right-to-work led to reduced non-union wages in the private sector in Oklahoma. 
But Reed argued in a 2003 study that average wages are higher in right-to-work states, when factoring in state economic conditions at the time the right-to-work laws were adopted.

Let’s review:

Oliver claimed that studies show ""right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth."" According to different studies and economic experts, the evidence is mixed that right-to-work laws spur job growth.

Right-to-work states have seen greater job increases, but one economist pointed out that such a dynamic doesn’t prove right-to-work laws were the cause. Another professor who believes job growth results from right-to-work laws acknowledged that many other factors also could be responsible.

We rate Oliver’s statement Half True.

Crossroads GPS says Barack Obama wants to ""raise taxes and keep spending more""
","
Crossroads GPS -- a deep-pocketed conservative advocacy group -- unveiled an advertisement on July 8, 2011, that targets voters who may have supported Barack Obama in 2008 but have become disaffected by the direction of the economy during his tenure.

The group says the ad -- called ""Wake Up"" -- will be aired at a cost of $7 million on national cable channels as well as network television in 11 states and 10 key House districts. We saw it airing as recently as July 14, 2011.

A reader asked us to take a look at the ad, so we did.

The ad features a mother lying awake at night worrying about her family’s economic situation. She says she supported Obama initially ""because he spoke so beautifully, but since then things have gone from bad to much worse."" She says Obama’s stimulus didn’t improve the economy, and that the national debt worries her.

""Our country's got this huge debt,"" the ad says, ""and Obama says raise taxes and keep spending more? Doesn't Washington know we can't afford more taxes and debt? … There’s got to be a way to take away President Obama’s blank check.""

In this item, we’re focusing on the question of whether Obama’s approach is to ""raise taxes and keep spending more.""

We’ll start by acknowledging a challenge with rating this claim. The most important fiscal debate currently under way involves the raising of the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure to buy time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011.

While the negotiations have been high profile, they are fluid, and have largely been conducted in private. Instead of relying on official position papers, we are left with broadly worded public utterances by the participants and comments by unnamed aides reported in the media. And what is proposed one day may not remain operative the next.

That said, we do think there’s enough information on the Obama administration’s position on taxes and spending to enable us to judge whether the president has really said his approach is to ""raise taxes and keep spending more.""

First, taxes.

On this issue, the ad is on relatively safe ground. By all accounts, the biggest divide in the negotiations has been strong resistance among key Republicans, particularly House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., to raising any taxes as part of a final deal. Republicans in this camp want to see spending cuts alone.

Democrats, on the other hand, believe that whatever deal is reached needs to include some tax increases, rather than just spending cuts.

The White House portrays the tax increases it’s seeking as either targeted -- for instance, closing provisions it considers loopholes -- or aimed at the richest Americans, particularly by letting tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush lapse for the highest tax bracket.

Still, no matter how targeted, these policies would, as the ad says, ""raise taxes.""

Here’s how Obama explained his position on taxes in a July 11, 2011, press conference.

""What we have talked about is that starting in 2013, that we have gotten rid of some of these egregious loopholes that are benefiting corporate jet owners or oil companies at a time where they're making billions of dollars of profits,"" he said. ""What we have said is as part of a broader package, we should have revenues, and the best place to get those revenues are from folks like me who have been extraordinarily fortunate, and that millionaires and billionaires can afford to pay a little bit more -- going back to the Bush tax rates.

""And what I've also said to Republicans is, if you don't like that formulation, then I'm happy to work with you on tax reform that could potentially lower everybody's rates and broaden the base, as long as that package was sufficiently progressive so that we weren’t balancing the budget on the backs of middle-class families and working-class families, and we weren’t letting hedge fund managers or authors of best-selling books off the hook.""

So Obama does want a tax hike -- at least some specific tax hikes -- as part of a deal. Does he also want to ""keep spending more?"" As we analyzed this question, we assumed that ""spending more"" meant actually increasing levels of spending.

On this point, we think the ad is misleading.

At the same press conference, Obama said that he has ""agreed to a series of spending cuts that will make the government leaner, meaner, more effective, more efficient and give taxpayers a greater bang for their buck. That includes defense spending. That includes health spending. It includes some programs that I like very much, and we -- be nice to have but that we can’t afford right now. And if you look at this overall package, we could achieve a situation in which our deficits were at a manageable level and our debt levels were stabilized, and the economy as a whole I think would benefit from that.""

In his July 14, 2011, press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney offered additional specifics.

""We are now in a situation where our side, the White House, has made clear in a presentation yesterday that there are significant cuts -- $1.5 trillion in cuts that everybody can agree on, real and significant; an additional $200 billion in cuts that essentially we believe everybody can agree on,"" Carney said. ""That’s $1.7 trillion, significant in and of itself. The president wants more.""

Neither Obama nor Carney cited specific cuts he’d accept. (And the White House didn’t provide us with a list.) That’s not very surprising, since both sides are in the midst of a closed-doors negotiation.

Media coverage has provided a slightly more detailed picture.

Cantor himself indicated that the two sides had found some common ground on spending cuts. Referring to informal agreements from an earlier round of debt-ceiling talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, Cantor said that ""what the Biden group produced are areas where we believe we can come to an agreement,"" Dow Jones Newswire reported on July 11.

And Obama himself had sought larger cuts than the Biden-led negotiations had produced. Under a $4 trillion ""grand bargain"" proposed by the president but rejected by Republicans, ""Obama was poised to accept cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and possibly Social Security in exchange for $1 trillion in revenue, mostly from repealing President George W. Bush’s cuts for the wealthiest Americans after 2012,"" Bloomberg reported on July 14.

Crossroads GPS, spokesman Jonathan Collegio said it’s one thing for the White House to say it will accept a spending cut and another to actually accept it.

""Send me Obama’s ’proposed spending cuts.’ I’m not aware of any specific cuts he has officially proposed,"" Collegio said. ""The only actual proposal I’m aware of was his budget, which failed 97-0 in the Senate."" He added that as recently as June, Obama proposed a new round of construction loans.

""So there are all these specific spending increases and spending increase proposals, weighed against a number thrown around in the negotiations but without any specific cuts called for whatsoever,"" Collegio said.

We see his point -- we, too, wish we could see more details about concrete commitments to spending cuts by the administration. However, we think that what Obama and Carney have said -- and what has trickled out from comments by the negotiators, including the acknowledgement by Cantor of common ground on spending cuts -- undercuts the ad’s claim that Obama’s intention is to ""keep spending more.""

The ad is right about tax increases but incorrect about spending increases. On balance, we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/14/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-barack-obama-wants-raise-taxes/
"['National', 'Criminal Justice', 'History', 'Chain email']","
Chain e-mail claims a quote at the top of the redesigned Department of Justice website comes from a socialist who wanted to impose global common law
","
The latest socialist/communist plot to take over the world is insidiously (if innocuously) placed at the top of the Department of Justice's newly designed website.
At least, that's what a writer for the American Spectator and a number of chain e-mails would have you believe.

""What's black and white and 'red' all over? The Department of Justice's newly designed website. Gone are the standard red, white, and blue motifs, replaced by an all-black backdrop. And prominently placed on virtually every page of the site is a quote credited to a man who facilitated a greater role for socialists and communists at the U.N. and the global 'workers rights movement,' according to a July 16, 2010 column in the American Spectator, written by someone who goes under the pen name, the Washington Prowler. ""...Most jarring is the quote that appears on virtually every page of the website. 'The common law is the will of mankind issuing from the life of the people,' which, some DOJ staff say, is tied to a man who ushered in the socialist and communist theories that now permeate the United Nations.""

The quote is lifted from an inscription on the side of the Department of Justice Building. 
According to the Spectator: 
Some attorneys believed the quote is pulled or adapted from the writing of Sir William Blackstone, the 18th Century British jurist, who wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England, which influenced not only British law, but also the American constitutional and legal system. But other Department of Justice employees say the quote originates from British lawyer, C. Wilfred Jenks, who back in the late 1930s and after World War II was a leading figure in the 'international law' movement, which sought to impose a global, common law, and advocated for global workers rights. Jenks was a long-time member of the United Nation's International Labor Organization, and author of a number of globalist tracts, including a set of essays published back in 1958, entitled The Common Law of Mankind. 
Most telling: Jenks, as director of the ILO is credited with putting in place the first Soviet senior member of the UN organization, and also with creating an environment that allowed the ILO to give ""observer status"" to the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and to issue anti-Israeli statements, which precipitated efforts by the U.S. Congress to withdraw U.S. membership from the ILO. The U.S. actually did withdraw in the mid-1970s due to the organization's leftist leanings. 
""It was Jenks's efforts that helped make the ILO a tool of the socialist and communist movement,"" says one of the DOJ lawyers. 
So already we're dealing with speculation from some unnamed attorneys in the Department of Justice. But even with this flimsy evidence, the story grew wings among conservative bloggers on the web, and various versions of the claim circulated widely by chain e-mail. 
One of the chain e-mails we received repeats the quote now on the DOJ website, and then gets sarcastic: 
Catchy, huh? Just one tiny little (too small to be relevant obviously) point -- the quote is from C. Wilfred Jenks, who in the 1930's was a leading proponent of the ""international law"" movement, which had as its goal to impose a global common law and which backed 'global workers' rights.'

Call it Marxism, call it Progressivism, call it Socialism -- under any of those names, it definitely makes the DOJ look corrupt in their new website with Marxist accessories to match.

How very interesting that 'they' couldn't find a nice quote from one of our Founders. People, we have lost our Republic. This is an example of the slow, methodical misuse of power our current government is doing as they lead us to socialism, and destroying our republic as we have known it. 

As with most chain e-mails, it ends, ""Please, pass this on to people on your e-mail list. ASAP!"" 
The whole argument, of course, rests on the supposition that the quote came from a socialist leader. We bet you can see where this is headed, but we'll usher you through the unraveling. 
We first contacted the Department of Justice. Tracy J. Russo, a spokeswoman for the DOJ, confirmed the quote appears on the façade of the main Department of Justice building in Washington, D.C. 
""The building was completed in 1935, and this inscription is just one of many that circle the building’s exterior,"" Russo said via e-mail. ""It does appear on the eastern side of building, overlooking 9th Street NW. The full quote is: 'The common law derives from the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people, framed by mutual confidence, and sanctioned by the light of reason.'"" 
The quote was a favorite of former Attorney General Janet Reno, who dropped it into numerous speeches. For example, in a 2001 speech, Reno said, ""There is, on the wall of the 9th Street gate, a saying that I have come to rely on again and again. It says, 'The common law derives from the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people, framed by mutual confidence, and sanctioned by the light of reason.' Unless the law issues from all of the people, some of the people will feel left out. They will come to feel alienated. They will be angry. And this will not be a cohesive democracy. If you don't care about that, they will feel left out, alienated, and they will not have the opportunities that others have to skills, to jobs, to opportunity. That will only hurt America.""

Russo said the quote was chosen for the website when it was redesigned in October 2009 because the main Justice building was used as inspiration for the website design.

""We’ve heard various reports of its origin but have not found any definitive information regarding the source,"" Russo said. ""We don't actually know its origin."" 
So we reached out to the Library of Congress. And three weeks later, they got back to us ... and the socialist conspiracy theory came crashing down. 
It turns out, the quote did not come from C. Wilfred Jenks. 
Jennifer Gavin, a spokeswoman at the Library of Congress said she asked two reference librarians to research the issue and here's what they found: 
The inscription, ""The common law is the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people,"" is attributable to Hartley Burr Alexander, 1873-1939 - poet, philosopher, scholar, and architectural iconographer.
 
The chief sculptor of the U.S. Department of Justice building (1932-1934), C. Paul Hennewein, retained Dr. Alexander, then chairman of the philosophy department at the University of Nebraska, to assist with a unifying theme for the sculpture and inscriptions for the new building.
 
Dr. Alexander’s correspondence and photographs are archived in the Hartley Burr Alexander Projects Collection at Scripps College in Claremont, California, where he was invited to chair a professorship in philosophy. 
So was Hartley Burr Alexander some kind of Marxist? Nope. 
""He seemed to be something of a liberal, but not a communist,"" said Richard T. Hull, an emeritus professor at the University at Buffalo who wrote a brief biography of Alexander for the American Psychological Association. 
A native of Lincoln, Neb., Alexander was a writer, poet and professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska and later at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif. 
According to Hull's biographical sketch, Alexander ""was a famed lecturer and teacher. He wrote articles, editorials and poems for several newspapers. He wrote and presented a number of pageants and a light opera. In addition to his articles in philosophical journals, he did field work in the anthropology of the Native American, developing a special interest in the poetic and spiritual quality of Native American songs and rituals and the symbolism of Native American mythology."" 
The Department of Justice Building isn't the only one inscribed with his words. According to Hull's research, Alexander -- who was president of the American Philosophical Association in 1918-1919 -- was commissioned to design the decorative scheme, and write inscriptions for the Nebraska State Capitol building, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Building in Philadelphia and the Oregon State Capitol building. 
In other words, Alexander had a varied and illustrious career, none of which would suggest putting his words atop the DOJ website is any kind subliminal socialist message. 
This whole issue is much ado about nothing. The authors cooked up a conspiracy theory based on misinformation about who authored the quote on the DOJ website (and the side of the DOJ Building), and then they ran with it.

"['Medicare', 'Retirement', 'Wisconsin', 'Shelly Moore']","
Democratic candidate Shelly Moore says Sen. Sheila Harsdorf wants to “eliminate Medicare” as we know it
","
The high-stakes recall elections for Wisconsin Senate are starting to sound like congressional races, as Democratic challengers try to link Republicans to the Medicare funding plan offered by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Janesville.

Sometimes the link is clear: Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), for example, said she was ""standing with Ryan"" on Medicare reforms. Now she’s under attack for it as she tries to retain her seat.

Then there’s the claim from Democrat Shelly Moore, a teacher and union activist seeking to unseat Sen. Sheila Harsdorf (R-River Falls) in a northwestern Wisconsin district.

She sent out a direct-mail piece with this headline: ""Senator Harsdorf and Her Party Want to Eliminate Medicare As We Know It, Forcing Seniors to Pay Thousands More a Year for the Same Coverage.""

The cover illustration and message, featuring a resident in the 10th District, was even tougher: ""Lyda Haskins of River Falls Can’t Afford For Medicare to End. CAN YOU?""

We’ll return to that constituent later, but first a bit of background.

Democrats across the country are seeking political advantage by injecting Ryan and Medicare into local races.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. It does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for insurance, PolitiFact National has reported.

The Ryan plan leaves the government-run Medicare health insurance program in its current form for people now 55 and older. For those currently under 55, Ryan would end the guaranteed benefit in Medicare; it would pay directly for medical services instead of giving seniors a set amount, the Journal Sentinel reported. Critics call that a ""voucher"" plan but Ryan does not. He says more choices for Medicare participants would increase competition and drive down cost.

It is complex and far-reaching plan.

But has Harsdorf come out in favor of it?

When we asked Moore for backup, campaign aides cited two pieces of evidence.

One was a video of a brief, taped conversation Harsdorf had July 3, 2011, in Hudson with a woman who wanted to know her position on Ryan’s Medicare plan. But rather than voicing support, as Moore’s campaign claims, Harsdorf pointedly -- and repeatedly -- does not take a position.

""I’m really focused on state issues,"" Harsdorf offered -- a stance she repeated in an interview with us.

Gillian Morris, a Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesman involved in Moore’s campaign, said the video showed that Harsdorf was ""unwilling to stand against"" Ryan’s plan -- and may be a hint she supports it.

But the video doesn’t indicate support -- or even opposition -- so it’s not much backing at all for Moore’s claim.

The second piece the campaign pointed to was a vote cast by Harsdorf on June 16, 2011, against a Democratic amendment to restore a variety of social service cuts in the 2011-’13 state budget.

One line in the amendment sought to allow Wisconsin’s attorney general to sue over possible federal changes to Medicare and Medicaid.

Harsdorf joined other Republicans in killing the amendment.

We examined the Senate amendment and listened to the 40-minute floor debate in that chamber, as well as the debate in the Assembly over a similar amendment the day before.

The Senate version does not mention Ryan at all, but Democratic senators made it crystal clear during debate the amendment was aimed at Ryan’s Medicare plan.

In the Assembly, there was little doubt that Democrats were using the vote to put Republicans on the record in a way that could be used against them later. ""Are you going to stand with Wisconsin seniors or stand with Congressman Ryan?"" asked state Rep. Jon Richards (D-Milwaukee).

That gets at the purpose of the amendment, which included many other things, but what about the substance of the claim made by Moore?

During the Senate debate, Harsdorf said nothing about the amendment;  Republicans as a group largely were silent.

What about the guts of the amendment? Did a vote against it, as Moore contends, put someone on record in favor of Ryan’s plan to turn Medicare into what the amendment called ""vouchers""?

There are significant problems with that reasoning.

One, Harsdorf had 98 other possible reasons to vote against the amendment, which contained a total of 99 changes covering a range of issues such as Family Care, Senior Care and Badger Care. The Medicare amendment Moore refers to was No. 93 on the list.

Two, the amendment in question referred to giving the attorney general the ability to sue over changes not just to Medicare, but to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for low-income individuals.

We searched news accounts, speeches, TV ads and position papers and found no evidence of Harsdorf taking a public position on Ryan’s plan. Nor could Moore’s campaign produce any.

Harsdorf told us her vote against the Democratic amendment reflected only her support for the Republican-crafted state budget, which she helped mold as a member of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee.

Without that direct connection, the approach feels more like guilt by association. In the 2010 campaign, a liberal group sought to link GOP Assembly candidates to Ryan’s proposals on Social Security. We found the links were beyond thin, and the allegation of ""privatizing"" Social Security inaccurate, and we rated the claim Pants on Fire.

Before we close, there are two other problems with Moore’s campaign literature -- one of them a whopper.

For one, Moore plays loose in stating the impact of Ryan’s Medicare proposal. At one point, her flier says it would ""eliminate Medicare as we know it."" In another, it says the plan would ""end"" Medicare.

For those who turn 65 before 2022, the program would not change. And for the others, Medicare would change dramatically but it would still exist, PolitiFact Wisconsin noted in ruling False a MoveOn.org claim that Medicare would be abolished in 10 years.

And, last but not least, we called the woman pictured under the flier's headline:  ""Lyda Haskins of River Falls Can’t Afford For Medicare to End.""

Haskins, 85, told us that she would have no trouble without Medicare even if it were taken from her -- which it would not be, under the plan.

""It’s laughable that I wouldn’t be able to afford it,"" Haskins said. ""They should have not have done that.""

Haskins, whose daughter Alison Page ran unsuccessfully against Harsdorf in 2008, is well known in the area.

Haskins said she was not told her name would be used, and was not aware that Medicare would be an issue in the direct mail piece. She said she agreed, along with her grandchildren, only to be pictured generically as a Moore supporter.

""It was wrong to use my name. I think it was somebody’s error,"" said Haskins, who said she would still support Moore. 
Morris said Moore campaign officials were ""perplexed"" over Haskin's allegations, saying they fully explained to her the image would be used in a Medicare flier and that she understood. 
Let’s take stock.

Moore portrays Harsdorf as wanting to ""eliminate Medicare as we know it"" or to ""end"" Medicare for seniors.

But the video she points to as backup does not include an acknowledgment of support for Ryan’s Medicare plan and the opposition to the Senate amendment cited is not proof of support either. There were 99 points in that amendment and the Ryan-focused one was so vague that even as a separate item it would have provided no definitive proof of Harsdorf’s stance. We could find no backup at all in our own search of Harsdorf’s position, and she said simply she’s focused on state issues.

Indeed, the campaign literature highlights a woman who wouldn’t be affected -- and who herself disputes that she ""can’t afford"" for Medicare to end. It is incumbent on the person making a factual claim to be able to support it.

The flier’s claims are false, barring new information, and the misleading nature of the presentation pushes this into ridiculous territory.

Did controversial online charter school bill really receive zero public input?
 ","
In order for Gov. John Kitzhaber to get what he wanted on education reform this session -- a new investment board, for example -- legislators agreed to vote on a package of 14 education-related bills. One of those bills, House Bill 2301, will allow online charter schools to add more students and was vigorously opposed by the public teachers’ union, the Oregon Education Association.

Just before the Fourth of July holiday, the group submitted a guest column on Blue Oregon, pleading with the governor to veto House Bill 2301: ""What makes this whole debacle even more unpalatable is that the public was completely shut out of the backroom dealing. HB 2301 never had a public hearing. Parents, educators, and school leaders were never given the opportunity to weigh in and talk about how this will impact kids in the classroom.""

The sentiment is one that we’re bound to hear again. Democrats complained about the lack of process over the education bills, with then-House Democratic Leader Dave Hunt of Gladstone arguing that there were ""no public hearings, no vetting of amendments, no real fiscal analysis."" Rep. Sara Gelser, D-Corvallis, and co-chairwoman of the House Education Committee echoed his frustration.

But a fed-up Rep. Brian Clem, D-Salem, shot back that there had been hearings on the bill, back in February. (Clem also said, we can’t help but add, ""You're either going to be a mature adult and be at the big kids’ table and figure out how to make things work, or you're going to throw tantrums and write press releases and sit at the little kids' table. And I'm going to be at the big kids’ table."" Ouch.)

So what gives? Who’s right? Did House Bill 2301 get a public hearing?

Well, yes and no. A bill with that number was the subject of two public hearings Feb. 11 and 14, 2011, in the House Education Committee. But that wasn’t the bill that lawmakers approved in the final days of the Legislature.

The bill as introduced was 62 pages long, with parts stemming from a comprehensive State Board of Educationreport on virtual learning to the Legislature. Part of the reason why the bill is so long is that the board wanted to separate virtual school law from charter school law. The proposal also contained provisions to increase the enrollment cap and to establish funding per child since in Oregon, state money follows the student.

The final bill is six pages long. It contains two key elements important to virtual schools, not to the broad expanse of online education. One, the legislation states that at least 95 percent of instructional time be delivered by a state licensed teacher.

Two, the legislation also allows online charter schools to enroll as much as 3 percent of a school district's population without getting permission from the district. Currently, students need to get permission from their local school districts to enroll in an online school.

The teacher licensing requirement was not in the original bill. The 3 percent enrollment cap was in the original bill.

What happened is in legislative lingo called a ""gut and stuff."" Lawmakers take a bill already in process, ""gut"" the contents and ""stuff"" in a new bill under the old number. (Even the bill’s carrier on the floor, Rep. John Huffman, R-The Dalles, called the amended version ""a complete gut and stuff of the original bill."") Audio records of committee hearings show that the amended version cropped up days before the House floor vote and moved through two budget committees without discussion or debate because of the deal struck by Kitzhaber and Republicans.

So if the final bill bore little to no resemblance to the original bill, were there hearings on the issues in it? (Hint: Does a slice of pie look like a whole pie, especially when there’s a piece of cake frosting on top of the slice?)

We listened to those two public hearings in February. The public comments were broad, general. Fans of Oregon Connections Academy, a popular for-profit virtual school known as ORCA, testified on the benefits of online schooling and pleaded for more state money. An ORCA instructor said the school would have to drop advanced course offerings if teachers were required to acquire state teaching licenses and live in Oregon. There were some questions by committee legislators, including the issue of licensing.

Rep. Matt Wingard, R-Wilsonville, and the other co-chairman of the House Education Committee, said the issues included in the original legislation were aired in February, and the teachers’ union had plenty of time then and in months leading to the floor vote to pipe up. Wingard also says the final version of the bill was negotiated by both Democrats and Republicans.

PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t have a problem with legislative dealmaking. It happens. But we don’t agree with Wingard that public hearings on the original bill mean hearings on the version that passed.

There was no public discussion -- and there was no discussion among lawmakers in public -- on the details of how taxpayers should govern, encourage, monitor and pay for online education, including online schools. There was no negotiating in public the version put to legislators as part of a final deal. The bill that passed bypassed the comprehensive nature of the original House Bill 2301. Elements of the final bill were discussed, in passing, but the heart of it did not receive a public hearing. The claim that the legislation received no public hearing is Mostly True -- accurate but needing additional clarification.

State Sen. Kris Jordan says 'fracking' hasn't contaminated Ohio groundwater
","
As public debate across the country has bubbled up in recent months over environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing — or fracking as it’s becoming widely known — proponents of oil and gas drilling have come rushing to its defense.

The process involves pumping millions of gallons chemical-laced water and sand deep underground into horizontal wells under high pressure to crack open shale,  enabling natural gas extraction.

On June 15, 2011, state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Delaware Republican, defended the process in a floor speech on behalf of legislation that would throw open state parkland to oil and gas drilling.

During his speech, Jordan portrayed the growing concerns of the public — which have been fanned by ""Gasland,"" a controversial documentary on the environmental issues related to the fracking process — as overblown as he pointed to a long track record of safe fracking in Ohio.

""State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking,"" Jordan said.

With drilling likely coming soon to Eastern Ohio where the Utica and Marcellus shale formations await possible exploration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Jordan’s claim.

We started with Jordan, who stood by his statement.

""From what I understand, none of the cases has come from fracking itself being involved in contaminating any water,"" said Jordan. ""Any problems that have happened have been well construction issues.""

Jordan said he consulted with several people in Ohio’s oil and gas industry including Tom Stewart, a top official with the Ohio Oil and Gas Association for his information.

Stewart and other oil and gas supporters directed us to several recent statements from state and federal EPA officials such as one made recently by Lisa Jackson, President Barack Obama’s top federal Environmental Protection Agency administrator.

During a House committee hearing, Jackson said evidence was limited on whether hydraulic fracturing can affect water tables and aquifers.

""There is evidence it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself impacted water although there are investigations ongoing,"" she told lawmakers.

The U.S. EPA began a study in January 2011 of possible environmental problems caused by fracking. The first findings from that study aren’t expected until late 2012.

ODNR officials also said they haven’t seen water contamination from fracking in Ohio.

""ODNR’s Oil and Gas Program has not identified any instances of groundwater contamination related to hydraulic fracturing since the technology was first used here in the early 1950s,"" ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans said in an email.

When considering these statements, however, it’s important to understand exactly what they are saying—and also what they are not saying.

What they are saying is that there are no documented cases of groundwater contamination directly from the process of pumping the chemical-laced water and sand into the ground to break the rock apart.

They are not talking about the actual drilling of the hole that is fracked or the construction of the drilling well that is used for the fracking process.

""There is definitely a lot of misinformation out there,"" said Hetzel-Evans. ""I don’t think the general public understands that the drilling process isn’t fracking.""

And while there aren’t any groundwater problems due directly to fracking in Ohio, the drilling of wells to prepare for the fracking process has lead to water contamination in at least one case in Ohio. Meanwhile, the first study of its kind in the country is turning up similar evidence.

In December 2007, a home exploded in a residential neighborhood in Bainbridge Township in Geauga County, Ohio. A panel assembled by ODNR ultimately found that a poorly-constructed well casing — think of it as a cement seal around the drill hole -- allowed gas to migrate upwards along the edge of the casing and up the pipe. Ultimately, this gas seeped into the home in Bainbridge and caused the explosion.

Meanwhile, there is new evidence outside of Ohio that poorly constructed drilling wells used for fracking are leading to problems with groundwater.

Duke University researchers found that methane levels were 17 times higher in water wells within one kilometer of hydraulic fracking sites in New York and Pennsylvania than in water wells farther away. The methane levels in those wells showed the same characteristics as methane produced from fracking, as opposed to naturally-occurring methane.  

Robert Jackson, the professor of environmental sciences who headed up the research, said that the ""methane migration"" was likely caused by problems with the casing around the drill hole rather than from the methane migrating thousands of feet through the rock from the fracking zone.

But he wonders whether the new high-pressure water treatment used in fracking could be the cause.

""What I haven’t seen anyone address is whether hydraulic fracturing makes it more likely to cause well casings to leak,"" he said. ""It may be the high pressure involved in fracking makes leaks more common and bigger.""

Meanwhile, the gas exploration boom in Pennsylvania has begun turning up evidence that the shale gas exploration involving the fracking process could be contaminating groundwater supplies with methane.

The state’s Department of Environmental Protection ordered Houston-based Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. to provide and maintain potable water and gas mitigation for residents in Dimock, Pa., who sued over wells polluted in 2009 with methane gas and other contaminants.

Another group, from Lenox Township, Pa., sued Houston-driller Southwestern Energy Co. in 2010  claiming their wells were contaminated with fracking fluids.

Both suits are tied up in court.    

So where does that leave Jordan’s claim that ""state agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking.""

That statement squares with ODNR’s records.

But regulators in Ohio have linked water contamination problems in at least one incident to other aspects of drilling such as the construction of the drilling wells. That’s additional information that provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s statement grades out at Mostly True.

Newark Mayor Cory Booker says for the first time in the history of the United States, the government cut taxes during wartime
","
Newark Mayor Cory Booker said in a recent radio interview that one of the nation’s problems is ""sedentary agitation"": Americans get upset, but don’t do anything it.

The Democrat, further describing his point, told NPR host Michel Martin, ""I worry that we've gotten to the point in our history, and we see this with us involved in two wars, but yet for the first time ever we've gotten tax breaks during wartime. It's never happened in the history of our nation. But we seem to be expecting more but willing to sacrifice less.""

Have taxes ever been cut during wartime?

PolitiFact New Jersey found taxes have generally increased during war, but there are exceptions -- most notably in the last decade.

The mayor’s spokeswoman said Booker was ""referring to the tax cuts that were enacted during the tenure of President [George W.] Bush,"" specifically reductions in the federal income tax rate.

In summer 2001, Bush, a Republican, lowered federal income tax rates and enacted other tax breaks. In 2003, amid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Bush signed legislation that sped up the timeline for when those cuts took effect.  

So, taxes have been cut during wartime recently, but what about historically?

The national PolitiFact site researched a similar issue two years ago. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said ""if you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes.""  

Let’s review that article.

PolitiFact started with the Civil War and found that then, as well as during World Wars I and II, taxes increased.

Congress hasn’t officially declared war since World War II, but PolitiFact also looked at taxes during the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Iraq.  

During those wars, taxes were cut only once: President John F. Kennedy lowered the income tax rate in a bill that took effect in 1964. But experts dismissed the Kennedy tax cut because it was passed before the conflict in Vietnam seriously escalated -- and when the war intensified, taxes increased.

PolitiFact also noted that in 2009 President Barack Obama signed the economic stimulus package, a bill with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. But Krugman said Bush was the first president that ""took us into war"" and cut taxes, whereas Obama inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Krugman’s statement was rated Mostly True.

We need to note two differences between what Krugman said and Booker’s statement.

First, Krugman made his statement in 2009, before the Bush tax cuts were extended under Obama. And second, Booker did not make the distinction, as Krugman did, that Bush was the first president to take us into war and cut taxes.

Several experts we spoke with argued that in extending the Bush tax cuts, Obama maintained the status quo.

""If a tax rate is scheduled to go up and you don’t allow it to rise, is that a tax cut or the avoidance of a tax increase? I consider it the extension of current law,"" said Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group.

As for the stimulus plan, some experts argued that the tax breaks included in the package differ from the Bush tax cuts because of how they worked or because they intended to jumpstart a weak economy.

But, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said they’re still tax cuts

""I’m of the opinion that if it is in the tax system, and if it raises or lowers your taxes, it is either a tax cut or a tax increase,"" he said.

But the measures enacted by Obama came during the same wartime -- the ""war on terrorism"" -- when Bush first reduced taxes.

Let’s recap.

Booker claimed that ""for the first time ever we've gotten tax breaks during wartime.""

The national PolitiFact website rated a claim that Bush was the first president to lead us into war and cut taxes Mostly True. Booker’s spokeswoman told us the mayor was referring to the Bush tax cuts.

Though Booker didn’t make the same distinction Krugman did regarding Bush, we find his overall point sound. 

Taxes technically were cut in 1964. But as the war in Vietnam escalated, taxes increased.

Since the start of the ""war of terrorism,"" taxes have only gone down -- first under Bush, then under Obama.

We rate Booker’s statement Mostly True.

Barack Obama said Social Security and other federal checks may not go out on Aug. 3 if the debt ceiling is not increased
","
President Barack Obama and Congress are in intense discussions on raising the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow.  But the negotiations aren't going so well, leaving observers -- and some participants -- to consider whether there are Plan B's, Plan C's and Plan D's if the negotiators can't reach an agreement in time. 
After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure that bought time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. 
While most if not all federal accounts are affected in some way by the debt limit debate, the most urgent items for many ordinary Americans are direct transfer payments, most notably Social Security and veterans' benefits. 
Obama was asked about this in a July 12, 2011, interview with CBS News anchor Scott Pelley. Here's their exchange: 
Pelley: ""Can you tell the folks at home that, no matter what happens, the Social Security checks are going to go out on August the 3rd? There are about $20 billion worth of Social Security checks that have to go out the day after the government is supposedly going to go into default."" 
Obama: ""Well, this is not just a matter of Social Security checks. These are veterans' checks, these are folks on disability and their checks. There are about 70 million checks that go out each month."" 
Pelley: ""Can you guarantee, as president, that those checks will go out on August the 3rd?"" 
Obama: ""I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue, because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it."" 
We heard from a lot of readers who wanted us to check whether that statement was factually accurate or if Obama was using scare tactics. 
Back in February, we examined a similar statement by Obama -- that if there's a government shutdown, ""people don't get their Social Security checks."" We rated that Barely True. 
Social Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund, so Social Security benefits don't have to be formally approved by Congress every year. However, Social Security Administration employees are paid through appropriated funds. The real question about a government shutdown was whether those employees would be kept from going to work and if so, whether the checks would sit idle rather than arriving in mailboxes nationwide. The rules that cover government shutdowns provide some leeway for federal workers to carry out core Social Security functions. This flexibility allowed checks to go out during a 1995 shutdown, even as less-urgent agency functions lagged. 
However, the two scenarios -- a government shutdown caused by the absence of funding approved by Congress and a debt ceiling impasse that prevents new borrowing -- are different. So the consequences of one do not necessarily match the consequences of the other. 
The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, put it this way: ""Failing to raise the debt ceiling would not bring the government to a screeching halt the way that not passing appropriations bills would. Employees would not be sent home, and checks would continue to be issued. If the Treasury was low on cash, however, there could be delays in honoring checks and disruptions in the normal flow of government services."" 
This is because the government receives both cash, including tax revenue, and bills at irregular intervals. So it doesn't always have enough cash on hand to pay all its debts at any given moment. (Families and businesses will recognize this as the always-dreaded ""cash flow problem."") 
The Treasury Department has argued that failure to raise the debt limit actually would have more dramatic consequences than a government shutdown. ""If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, the government would have to stop, limit, or delay payments on a broad range of legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and many other commitments,"" the department said in a statement. 
How broad would the impact be? The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached. 
When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion. 
With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments, and we'll say more on that later -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion), and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion. 
But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion), and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion). 
If the government could prioritize payments to creditors it deemed most important -- bondholders, say, or Social Security beneficiaries -- it could be a viable stopgap, at least for the favored creditors. But does the government have the power to prioritize whom it pays? 
The answer is somewhat in dispute. Here's how CRS describes it: 
""Some have argued that prioritization of payments can be used by Treasury to avoid a default on federal obligations by paying interest on outstanding debt before other obligations,"" CRS wrote in a study published earlier this year. ""Treasury officials have maintained that the department lacks formal legal authority to establish priorities to pay obligations, asserting, in effect, that each law obligating funds and authorizing expenditures stands on an equal footing. In other words, Treasury would have to make payments on obligations as they come due."" 
But CRS added that this view contrasts with one expressed by the Government Accountability Office in 1985 (when the office, the auditing arm of Congress, was known as the General Accounting Office). The GAO found ""no requirement"" that Treasury pay its bills in a first-in, first-out fashion. ""Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States,"" the GAO concluded. 
Even if the government has the authority to prioritize payments such as Social Security checks, doing so would still entail some downsides, and some of these might be considered politically or practically untenable. 
Doing so merely kicks certain payments down the road, where they may accrue additional interest charges, worsening an already difficult fiscal climate. ""A backlog of unpaid bills would continue to grow until the government collects more revenues or other sources of cash than its outlays,"" CRS wrote. ""In some cases, delaying federal payments incurs interest penalties under some statutes such as the Prompt Payment Act, which directs the government to pay interest penalties to contractors if it does not pay them by the required payment date, and the Internal Revenue Code, which requires the government to pay interest penalties if tax refunds are delayed beyond a certain date."" 
Even if payments to bondholders were prioritized, the bond market may still be spooked by the delays in other federal payments, risking harm to the nation's creditworthiness. ""If the federal government were to prioritize payments on debt obligations above other obligations, it is not clear whether financial markets would find this distinction to be significant when deciding whether and how to invest in federal government Treasury securities,"" CRS wrote. CRS added, ""if creditors lost this confidence, the federal government’s interest costs would likely increase substantially, and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets."" 
Delaying certain payments, even while making others, could ripple through the economy and drag down already weak economic growth. ""Removing a portion of government spending from the economy would leave behind significant economic effects and would have an effect on"" gross domestic product, CRS wrote. 
There are also some specific technical challenges for shifting funding into and out of the Social Security Trust Fund, which our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker column looked into here. 
Most of the experts we interviewed agreed that the federal government, if push came to shove, could probably find a way to prioritize Social Security or other payments, though none expressed absolute certainty. However, most of the experts also acknowledged practical challenges of using such tactics. 
While he thinks the GAO's green light for payment prioritization carries significant weight, Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute added that ""with so much being borrowed, it is hard simply to pick on a few programs"" to continue in the face of a debt ceiling impasse. 
Ronald M. Levin, a professor at the Washington University School of Law said, ""I interpret the president to be saying, 'Stopping Social Security checks would be hugely costly, but other curtailments would also be hugely costly. ... Something will have to give, and I cannot responsibly guarantee that it won’t be Social Security.' That is not quite what he said, but to my mind it’s close."" 
Where does this leave us? The critics likely have a point when they say Obama is playing up the risk to the most sympathetic potential victims -- Social Security recipients, 23 percent of whom live in households that depend on the retirement system for 90 percent or more of their income. While it's not a certainty that the Obama administration could prioritize cutting checks to seniors, there's a reasonable shot that the administration could do it. 
On the other hand, doing so would likely cause a lot of collateral damage to other American creditors, federal workers, students, Pentagon vendors and countless others -- and could also hamper the broader economy at a particularly sensitive time. The president is probably justified in saying that the possibility of an un-raised debt ceiling jeopardizes Social Security checks -- after all, it hasn't happened before, so no one knows for sure. But we also think the president probably has tools at his disposal to avoid the worst-case scenario for seniors that he expresses concern about. Acknowledging that there are a lot of uncertainties, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-social-security-and-other-federa/
"['Health Care', 'Legal Issues', 'States', 'Florida', 'Mike Haridopolos']","
Mike Haridopolos says Florida law could allow state to 'opt out' of federal health care plan
","
One of Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos’ first acts in the 2011 legislative session was to sponsor and shepherd through a proposed constitutional amendment targeting the federal health care law.

Sponsorship of the resolution is useful for Haridopolos -- a Republican from Merritt Island who is running for the U.S. Senate -- when talk turns to what Republicans derisively call ""ObamaCare.""

He touted that work recently on Twitter, tweeting on June 29: ""Proud to support this amendment that will allow Floridians to opt out of Obama’s govt. takeover of healthcare!""

Whether or not the federal health care legislation is a ""govt. takeover of healthcare!"" is the subject of a previous fact-check that earned a Pants on Fire ruling and was PolitiFact's Lie of the Year in 2010.

But we did wonder: If 60 percent of Florida voters support Haridopolos’ amendment when it appears on the ballot in November 2012 and the Health Care Freedom Act becomes part of Florida’s Constitution, what effect will it have on implementation of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the state?

Would it really ""allow Floridians to opt out"" of it?

To answer the question, we went to the American Legislative Exchange Council, which publishes ""A Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare."" ALEC also crafted the model legislation that is the foundation of Haridopolos’ amendment.

At least 42 states have passed or are considering similar laws, according to ALEC.

But the organization says that the state laws and constitutional amendments have no immediate impact on implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. They only pave the way for a court battle, should the law ultimately be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.

""Does it allow Floridians to opt out if it’s successful? Yes,"" said Christie Herrara, director of ALEC’s health task force. ""A lawsuit would have to be filed.""

The ""opt out,"" in that case, would come as the result of a legal challenge by states that would argue their constitutions prohibit the implementation of the federal health care law.

But it’s a long shot any federal court would side with the states’ argument.

""There is a whole body of case law that is very consistent,"" said Barry Richard, a Tallahassee-based constitutional law attorney who represented George W. Bush in the 2000 vote recount. ""This is not a close call.""

Lawyers and legal scholars say the states’ challenge would be tossed aside because of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, and a paragraph known as the supremacy clause.

Specifically, the clause states that the U.S. Constitution, and federal treaties and laws are the ""supreme Law of the Land."" It requires state judges to follow federal law in any conflict with state laws or constitutions.

In this situation, the federal law requires that people have health insurance, a provision commonly called the ""individual mandate.""

Haridopolos’ amendment to the Florida Constitution would prohibit laws that compel people to have health care coverage.

""This is precisely what the supremacy clause was meant to deal with, when you have the federal government saying one thing and the state saying something else,"" said Mike Allen, a constitutional law professor at Stetson University in Gulfport.

It would be impossible to comply with both laws at once, he said. And in such instances, he said, the federal law almost always wins.

That’s necessary, says Steve Valdeck, a law professor at American University, to preserve the structure of the U.S. government.

""I think we have settled the question that the Constitution makes the federal government supreme over the states. If one state could decide on its own they want to withdraw from a federal law, there’s nothing to stop other states from doing it,"" Valdeck said. ""Pretty soon you’ve destroyed the central premise on which our country is founded, which is a central federal government.""

Now there is one scenario in which Haridopolos’ amendment could protect Floridians from an individual mandate.

If the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately rules in favor of the 26 states suing to stop implementation of the individual mandate, Florida’s constitutional amendment would be moot as far as federal health care reform is concerned.

But, the state constitutional amendment would prohibit future state Legislatures from enacting an individual mandate if they ever decide to put forward their own health care plan, as Massachusetts did.

But Haridopolos didn’t mention protecting Floridians from a state law. He referred specifically to Obama and the federal law.

Bottom line: All the state constitutional amendment guarantees is standing for a lawsuit against the federal government. Floridians could only ""opt out"" of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate if the U.S. Supreme Court rules against the supremacy of the federal law.

That’s a major, gigantic if. There’s at least a remote enough chance that the court would rule in favor of Florida in a lawsuit, so Haridopolos’ statement doesn’t warrant a Pants On Fire ruling. However, it’s clearly False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/13/mike-haridopolos/mike-haridopolos-says-florida-law-could-allow-stat/

Marco Rubio says the United States will pay Russia $50 million per astronaut
","
The July 8, 2011, launch of space shuttle Atlantis from Kennedy Space Center in Florida marked the end of NASA's shuttle program after three decades. 

On CBS the day before the launch, Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio voiced concerns about letting the shuttle program lapse, and made a point about the cost the United States will incur while the program is dormant.

""From now on, we are going to have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station. And we have no plans to have anything in place to replace the shuttle any time before 2016,"" Rubio said. ""For Washington, it should be ashamed that it took so long to deal with this, and that something's not in place. But it's important for America moving forward, because other countries are, China, India, are investing heavily in their space programs. We cannot afford as Americans to lose space supremacy.""

We were curious about what sounded like an astronomical cost to hitch a ride into space. $50 million a round-trip ticket? (Can you at least check bags for free?)

The root of the claim comes from contract modifications the United States signed with the Russian Federal Space Agency for crew transportation, rescue and related services. The idea of having contracts with Russia isn't new, but these contract modifications were crafted to offset the end of NASA's shuttle program.

An April 6, 2010 a NASA press release stated that NASA had signed a modification to a contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency for crew transportation in 2013 and 2014. The additional cost -- $335 million -- would cover training, preparation and landing for six crew members. That math works out to about $55.8 million per astronaut.

Then in March 2011, NASA modified the contract with the Russians again to provide six seats a year in 2014 and 2015 for $752 million, or about $62.7 million per astronaut, per trip, said NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz. The increase reflects inflation in Russia, she said.

Rubio used the updated figure of $63 million in an op-ed piece published July 9, 2011 in the Tallahassee Democrat.

As we noted, contracts with the Russians started long before the shuttle shutdown. The United States has had a contract with the Russians for spaceflight support and services since 1993. During the 1990s, American astronauts traveled to the Russian space station Mir several times. The first U.S. astronaut to fly to the International Space Station on a Soyuz was Bill Shepherd on Oct. 31, 2000.

""The idea is that if we purchase services to the International Space Station -- whether through the Russian Soyuz or when commercial providers come on line -- eventually it frees up money for NASA to invest in developing a transportation system that will take us beyond low-earth orbit,"" Schierholz said.

NASA already has contracts with private companies to provide remotely piloted flights and several are competing for NASA funds to develop flights to carry astronauts, according to Space.com. 

A note about the costs. While $50 million or $63 million sounds awfully expensive, it is obviously less costly to taxpayers than if the United States continued its space shuttle program. 

With the shuttle program ending, NASA's space operations budget will shrink from $6.1 billion in fiscal year 2010 to $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2012. The space operations budget is broken into three categories: the space shuttle, International Space Station and Space and Flight support. The space shuttle line item is expected to dwindle during the next few years -- from $664.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to less than $1 million in 2016. NASA will pay for the contract with the Russians out of the line item for the International Space Station -- and that part of the budget is expected to rise from about $2.8 billion in 2012 to $3.2 billion in 2016.

(For the record, most of the costs associated with the shuttle program are fixed -- meaning NASA would pay out hundreds of millions of dollars for salaries and for parts whether the shuttle flew 1 time a year or 12. Schierholz said the marginal cost -- the additional cost associated with each individual shuttle launch is around $100 million, primarily for the external tank and two solid rocket boosters.)

Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the overall cost wasn't Rubio's point. The crux of the comment was to illustrate that the United States now has to rely on Russia to get into space. ""The main point is that, whereas once the U.S. led the way in space travel, we’re now beholden to another country – Russia – to get to space and to the space station,"" he said in an e-mail. 
Back to Rubio's original comment. He said, ""From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station."" In an op-ed piece a few days later he noted that the contract had risen to $63 million -- which is the current figure. That's a lot of money per astronaut -- but there are two caveats worth mentioning. First, NASA has had a contract to pay the Russians to send someone to the International Space Station for more than a decade. And second, the overall space operations part of NASA's budget is dramatically declining so while $50 million or $63 million sounds outrageous -- it's something of a bargain.

Tim Pawlenty says scientists are “in dispute” over whether being gay is a choice
","
During a July 10, 2011, appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty about the origins of homosexuality. Here’s their exchange:

Gregory: ""Let me ask you about social policy. You've notably said that you're a big fan of Lady Gaga and even the song Born This Way. There's a lot of debate about a gay marriage pledge in Iowa. And related to that, I wonder, do you agree with some of those who are behind that, that being gay is a choice?""

Pawlenty: ""Well, I have two teenage daughters who listen to Lady Gaga, so I'm subjected to it. And it has some good qualities to it. But as to, as to gay marriage, I'm in support of traditional marriage as between a man and a woman. I have not supported the issues of allowing gay couples to have the same benefits … as traditional couples. And so this is an issue in Iowa and across the whole country. But I've stood in favor of traditional marriage and traditional relationships in that regard.

Gregory: ""Is being gay a choice?""

Pawlenty: ""Well, the science in that regard is in dispute. I mean, the scientists work on that and try to figure out if it's behavioral...""

Gregory: ""Right.""

Pawlenty: ""...or if it's partly genetic.""

Gregory:""What do you think?""

Pawlenty: ""Well, I defer to the scientists in that regard.""

Gregory: ""So you, you think it's not a choice.""

Pawlenty: ""Well, there is no....""

Gregory: ""That you are, as Lady Gaga says, you're ‘born that way.’""

Pawlenty: ""There's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic. We don't know that. So we don't know to what extent, you know, it's behavioral, and that's something that's been debated by scientists for a long time. But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic.""

We decided to rate two of Pawlenty’s statements separately. In another item, we’ll look at his claim that ""there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic."" In this item, we’ll look at the first part of the exchange. We're not fact checking whether being gay is a choice, but whether scientists are ""in dispute"" over whether it is or is not.

We’ll start out by noting an important difference -- the difference between sexual orientation and sexual behavior.

Scientists don’t doubt that it’s possible for someone who’s gay to choose, through sheer willpower, to ignore their impulses and abstain from homosexual activity. Both gay and straight people have been going celibate by choice since time immemorial. But scientists add that for such people, sexual impulses don’t go away.

So, scientists argue, even if sexual behavior is a choice, sexual orientation -- the state of being gay, and the impulses one feels -- is not a choice.

""We only choose to act, and our actions are influenced by desires,"" said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who specializes in the origins of homosexuality. ""So I think that in an ordinary understanding of ‘choice,’ sexual orientation -- i.e., increased sexual desire for one type of person -- is not chosen, but sexual behavior is.""

Both the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association -- the two leading organizations for their professions -- reject the idea that the driving factor in determining one’s sexual orientation is personal choice.

A spokeswoman for the American Psychiatric Association -- which has about 36,000 members out of roughly 48,000 psychiatrists nationwide --  didn’t recall any significant internal dissension in recent years over the question of whether sexual orientation is a choice. Meanwhile, the American Psychological Association, which has 150,000 members, also considers it a ""settled question"" that homosexuality isn’t a choice, said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office.

Interestingly, we found less division than we’d expected between gay-rights advocates and social conservatives.

Michael Cole-Schwartz -- a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay advocacy group -- said that ""there is significant agreement that one does not choose one’s sexual orientation.""

Meanwhile, Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council -- a leading think tank for social conservatives -- agreed with the distinction between orientation and behavior. He suggested that fuzzy definitions of ""sexual orientation"" explain why the two camps sometimes talk past each other.

""Part of the problem is that the term ‘sexual orientation’ is somewhat ambiguous,"" Sprigg said. He suggests that it is sometimes used to cover three separate elements -- attractions, behaviors and self-identification.

""What I generally say is that I don‘t believe that same-sex attractions are a choice, but behaviors and self-identification are,"" he said. ""If Pawlenty had wanted to be more subtle, he could have asked Gregory what he meant"" by being gay.

In fact, Sprigg articulated his somewhat nuanced view on the Family Research Council website in 2010, in a document titled ""The Top Ten Myths About Homosexuality."" In it, he reviewed some of the studies on this topic and concluded that ""if it was not clear in the 1990’s, it certainly is now—no one is ‘born gay.’"" Yet he went on to write that ""homosexual attractions are clearly not a ‘choice’ in the vast majority of cases.""

In an interview, Sprigg said he didn’t see the two statements as contradictory.

""When I say it’s clear that no one is born gay, I don’t think any of those three factors"" -- attractions, behaviors and self-identification -- ""are fixed and determined at birth. Just because it’s not a choice doesn’t mean it’s present at birth. It could be the result of developmental factors in childhood. Sometime between the time you’re born and the time you begin to experience sexual attraction, things can happen that can affect your development.""

He even pointed to an American Psychological Association statement that ""although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors.""

The scientists we spoke to freely acknowledged that much is unknown about what determines sexual orientation. (More on that in our accompanying item.) But what scientists do know pretty much rules out the idea that homosexuality is simply a choice.

At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research on that question has been much less extensive.

We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception to the scientific consensus on homosexuality. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings.

So where does this leave us?

Pawlenty said that scientists are ""in dispute"" about whether being gay is a choice or not. We think most people would interpret that to mean sexual orientation -- that is, attractions and impulses -- rather than sexual behavior. And on that question, it seems that the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Human Rights Campaign and even the Family Research Council are in agreement. So we rate Pawlenty’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/13/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-scientists-are-dispute-over-whet/

But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic.""

We decided to rate two of Pawlenty’s statements separately. In another item, we’ll look at whether scientists are ""in dispute"" about whether being gay is a choice. In this item, we’ll look at Pawlenty’s claim that ""there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic.""

Pawlenty’s word choice -- ""genetic"" -- is pivotal for rating the accuracy of his claim. The way he phrased it, he’s pretty close to accurate. But if he’d said instead that ""there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is biological,"" he would have been incorrect.

Since the significance of this distinction may not be obvious at first glance, we’ll explain it in detail here.

If a trait is ""genetic,"" it means that it comes from the genes encoded in your DNA. Furthermore, arguing that something is genetic suggests that there’s a single, or at least a well-defined, genetic source -- what has sometimes been called a ""gay gene.""

By contrast, if a trait is ""biological"" in origin, it means that it can stem from any number of factors, such as hormone levels or how a fetus develops in the uterus. It would not, however, originate primarily from environmental factors such as childhood experiences -- what one might call the ""nurture"" part of the nature/nurture divide.

The typical way of figuring out whether something is caused by genes is through twin studies. Since identical twins share 100 percent of their DNA, any observed differences in traits would be presumed to be influenced by environment rather than genetics. So if being gay was truly, and exclusively, a genetic trait, every set of identical twins should either be both straight, or both gay.

In fact, that’s not the case. Even the studies with the strongest linkage show about a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins. Other studies have shown lower rates. Based on these findings, scientists agree that being gay is not caused exclusively by genes.

However, being gay does appear to have a genetic component -- just a weaker one. The same study that showed roughly a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins also showed weaker correlations for fraternal twins, who share only 50 percent of their genes on average. That’s pretty much what you’d expect to see if genetics played a role, but not a dominant one.

""Pawlenty is surely right that a genetic explanation has not been proven, and indeed genetics is likely a modest influence on sexual orientation,"" said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who undertook the twin study that showed a 50 percent correlation, as well as another that showed lower correlations.

But if being gay is not primarily determined by genes, it doesn’t mean that its origin isn’t biological.

Bailey and others find some of the most convincing evidence of the inherent nature of sexual orientation in long-term studies of the rare cases in which hormonally normal boys are reared as girls due to either accidents or certain medical conditions that have left them less obviously male. He said there have been six published cases of hormonally normal males reassigned early as females, and invariably, their sexual orientation was toward females. That’s consistent with their prenatal gender, not with their rearing as girls.

The point of these studies is that sexual orientation -- one’s attractions and impulses -- runs very deep and is resistant to social and environmental factors.

""If you can't make a male attracted to other males by cutting off his penis, castrating him, and rearing him as a girl, how likely is any social explanation of male homosexuality?"" Bailey asks.

Scientists freely acknowledge that the precise pathways for imparting sexual orientation are not yet understood. ""Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors,"" the American Psychological Association has put it.

However, just because scientists don’t know the specific mechanisms that cause sexual orientation doesn’t mean that they aren’t confident that they are biological in nature.

""We do not really know in any definitive way the mix between biological and other explanations, but the evidence for biological contributions is as good or better than for any other factor,"" said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office. ""Some have suggested that it’s how you were reared or a failure in bonding to the same-sex parent. But the research to support that is abysmal.""

Jack Drescher, a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, added that ""you’d be hard-pressed to find a reputable scientist who would exclude some aspect of biology"" from the causes of homosexuality. Drescher is a member of the working group on sexual and gender-identity disorders for the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM 5-- the authoritative reference work in the field.

At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research has been much less extensive.

We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings.

So where does this leave us?

Pawlenty said ""there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic."" On that specific question, we found broad agreement that Pawlenty was correct. Scientists told us that genetics may play a role in determining sexual orientation, but the current evidence suggests that it’s not the dominant factor and may ultimately be shown to play just a modest role.

But a modest role is still different from no role. And we also think that viewers of the interview might be led to believe that because homosexuality is not primarily caused by genes, there’s no biological cause. In reality, most scientists do believe that sexual orientation is caused by biology, rather than by choice. On balance, we rate Pawlenty’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/13/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-theres-no-scientific-conclusion-/
