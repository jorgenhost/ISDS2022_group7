McCain never talked about the bill
","
As Congress worked through the details of a $700-billion bailout of the financial system, the presidential candidates zeroed in on the issue of executive pay and skirmished over who could rightly take credit for sounding an alarm about highly compensated CEOs at troubled financial firms.

 

Appearing in Dunedin, Fla., on Sept. 24, Barack Obama depicted John McCain as a recent convert on the issue of corporate accountability, and took credit for introducing legislation last year that would have imposed some formal restraint on big bonuses and severance payments that corporations routinely award top executives.

 

""In the last few days, my opponent has decided to start talking tough about CEO pay. He’s suddenly a hard-charging populist. And that’s all well and good,"" Obama said. ""But I sure wish he was talking the same way over a year ago, when I introduced a bill that would’ve helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out the door. Because he opposed that idea.""

 

Obama also lamented that McCain didn't join him in demanding accountability from troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose former chief executives received pay and bonus packages worth a combined $24-million.


Obama was trying to tap into mounting public frustration over the prospect of CEOs exiting their posts with lavish pay and benefit packages while taxpayers cover the cost of saving their former firms. The Bush administration yielded this week to demands from congressional critics in both parties that the proposed bailout package include a provision to limit the pay packages of those executives whose companies would benefit from the bailout.

 

But is Obama’s populist attack grounded in facts?

 

We’ve already dealt with McCain’s response to the problems at Fannie and Freddie

here

(he called for a vigorous response to a 2006 report detailing shady accounting at Fannie) and his position on the bailout of the giant insurer American International Group in

this item

(he said management and speculators who created the mess shouldn’t be bailed out).

 

It’s true that Obama wrote a bill that would have changed federal securities law to require shareholders of publicly traded companies to hold nonbinding votes on executive compensation packages. The measure, introduced on April 20, 2007, was one of a number of proposals circulating in Congress at the time that attempted to apply limits to executive compensation. But Obama's proposal has never come up for a hearing or a vote in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

 

As for Obama’s contention that McCain opposed the measure, we reviewed McCain’s public statements and found nothing in his press releases or in the Congressional Record expressing opposition or support for Obama’s bill.
 
We asked Obama’s campaign for evidence that McCain was against the proposal. They provided a copy of remarks McCain senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin made to the

Wall Street Journal

in April 2008 that the Arizona senator opposes legislative or regulatory fixes for executive pay problems, preferring private-sector intervention.

 

But as early as 2002 McCain criticized excessive executive pay packages in the wake of the accounting scandal at energy giant Enron Corp. In a July 11, 2002, appearance at the National Press Club, McCain outlined a series of steps to ""restore public confidence in corporate America"" that included forcing executives to return any compensation directly received from their proven misconduct and preventing them from selling holdings of company stock while serving in that company.
 
So Obama can legitimately take credit for introducing legislation that took aim at executive pay practices that have aroused tremendous public ire in the wake of the proposed financial bailout. But there's simply no evidence to support Obama's contention that McCain ""opposed that idea.""
 
We can find no record that McCain ever uttered an opinion on Obama's proposal, and in fact it's clear that McCain has criticized excessive executive payouts in the past.
 
The only thing the Obama campaign has to support its contention that McCain opposed Obama's executive pay bill is a remark in a news story from one of his to advisers about McCain's general preference for private-sector remedies — a remark made a full year after the Obama bill was introduced.
 
It's not unreasonable to think McCain might have preferred a different approach to what Obama proposed, but that's just not enough to support what Obama is saying. We rate this attack Barely True.

Iran ain't Miami Beach, but beatings and killings for immodesty? No
","
In arguing for a hard line against Iran, Gov. Sarah Palin invoked not just that country's uranium-enrichment efforts and attitude toward Israel, but also its treatment of women.
 
""It is said that the measure of a country is the treatment of its most vulnerable citizens,"" Palin wrote in a Sept. 22, 2008, opinion piece in the

New York Sun

. ""By that standard, the Iranian government is both oppressive and barbaric. Under (President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad's rule, Iranian women are some of the most vulnerable citizens. If an Iranian woman shows too much hair in public, she risks being beaten or killed.""
 
We've looked

elsewhere

at how candidates from both parties have strayed from the truth in their tough rhetoric about Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons. Now let's check Palin's grasp of the consequences of improper head-covering.
 
Restrictions in Iran go back centuries, but the strength of enforcement has varied. Modesty has been a component of Islam since the Prophet Mohammed revealed purported advice on the subject from God in the seventh century. It has been interpreted differently among and within Muslim cultures around the world, including Iran. In 1936, Iran's largely secular ruler Reza Shah Pahlavi, intent on modernizing the country, banned the practice of wearing the veil, known in the Muslim world as hejab.
 
That law was rescinded after Pahlavi was forced to relinquish power in 1941, but the policy of discouraging and disparaging hejab remained, said Ziba Mir-Hosseini, an Iranian anthropologist and a visiting professor at the New York University School of Law.
 
In the 1960s, many women did not go to college because they would be forced to remove their hejab, Mir-Hosseini said.
 
""They were caught between tradition and resistance on the one hand and education and modernity on the other,"" she said. ""Many women took up hejab in the early 1970s as a sign of protest.""
 
An Islamic revolution overthrew Pahlavi's son in 1979 and instituted a 180-degree turn with respect to hejab, mandating it in 1983. The punishment for breaking that law was imprisonment or 70 lashes of flogging. The penalty was changed in 1988 to a fine and imprisonment of one to two months.
 
""It has been really rare that it has been applied,"" Mir-Hosseini said. ""It goes so much against people's sense of justice and public order in Iran. But at the same time the radicals, the hard-liners, the hejab is so central to them. It is not only religious, it is anti-Western.""
 
Hejab remains mandatory today. The custom has evolved under the influence of modern fashion, though. Some Iranian women still wear the

chador

, a full-length garment, often black, that fully covers their hair and drapes over their entire body. But many might wear colorful, tight-fitting overcoats, long boots, and a light scarf that covers only a token amount of their hair.
 
The government has periodically cracked down on dress it does not consider conservative enough, typically for a month or so as the weather warms in the summer. In recent years, though, the crackdown has persisted, as hard-liners such as Ahmadinejad have gained influence. Generally, women who are stopped are told to cover up, or asked to sign an agreement to cover up more in the future, or perhaps fined or even arrested. There have been regular reports of confrontations between the police and women who resent being hassled for alleged immodesty.
 
And yes, there have been accounts of brutality by police against some women after such stops. In defending Palin's statement, the McCain campaign pointed us to three such accounts, one from the

Asia Times

, one from the U.S.-funded Radio Farda, and a third from the

Economist

of Aug. 25, 2007.
 
The latter said: ""Much of the police action has been accompanied by complaints of brutality, and in many cases by documentary evidence such as graphic footage of beatings, posted on dissident Web sites.""
 
There's an important caveat to make here, though. The beatings are not administered by the government as punishment for an improper hejab — that was outlawed in 1988. Rather they are imposed in the course of an arrest and are generally due to resistance, according to the vast majority of news accounts we read and our interviews with experts on Iran. (Similarly, plenty of protesters in the United States are arrested, but it would be innaccurate to say they're arrested for protesting — in fact they're arrested for other offenses, such as ignoring police requirements about where to protest, or disrupting traffic.)
 
""For some of the younger people, this (defying modesty rules) is a way of protesting. They get away with it as long as they can. But usually the punishment for that is just paying fines,"" said Faegheh Shirazi, an Iranian women's rights advocate, professor of Middle-Eastern Studies at the University of Texas and author of the forthcoming book,

Velvet


Jihad: Muslim Women's Quiet Resistance to Islamic Fundamentalism.

""When the police come, you have to abide by what they say. I'm sure if the woman resists and starts backfiring, there would be some struggle.""
 
To the extent that there are beatings, they are extrajudicial, said Elizabeth Rubin, an expert on Middle Eastern culture at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""If you are showing too much hair you may be asked to fix your scarf,"" she said. ""You would not generally be beaten or killed except by a crazy zealot outside the law.""
 
To be sure, Iran has been widely criticized by human-rights organizations for harsh restrictions on dissent and personal behavior. Adultery is punishable by death. Abortion is illegal, and punishable by blood money. Gay people have been subject to arbitrary arrests and harassment . And the government regularly tries to quash dissent, holding political activists without charge and denying them access to counsel.
 
But in this instance Palin overstated the case. The McCain campaign did not provide any account — nor could we find any — of an Iranian woman being killed for improper hejab. If there are any such instances they are extremely isolated.
 
So it was misleading for Palin to suggest beatings are punishment for immodesty in Iran. More to the point, the restrictions related to modesty are routinely flouted without consequence. And her claim that killing was a possible consequence of immodesty pushed her statement into the realm of outright falsehood.

An attack ad from Barack Obama looks at a trip John McCain made to Bermuda last year.
 
""Bermuda. It’s more than just a vacation destination for John McCain,"" the ad says over jaunty, Caribbean-style steel drum music. ""McCain went to Bermuda, and while he was there pledged to protect tax breaks for American corporations that hide their profits offshore. And grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists who benefit from the tax scheme gave McCain $50,000.""
 
Bermuda, a British territory with significant autonomy, is home to many international companies seeking to avoid taxes. In 2006, there were 14,267 international companies registered in Bermuda, many of them American-owned, according to the U.S. State Department. A 2004 GAO report also listed Bermuda as a tax haven.
 
McCain visited Bermuda in August 2007, when he was still competing for the Republican nomination. The only account we could find about the trip appeared in a Bermuda newspaper called the

Royal Gazette

. The Obama ad shows a copy of the newspaper while it makes its claim that McCain pledged to protect overseas tax breaks for American companies.
 
You can read the entire

Royal Gazette

report online; here's the part where McCain talks about tax laws:
 
""The Arizona senator, who spent three days on the island this week meeting business and political leaders, said he understood the concerns of the insurance and reinsurance sectors about draft legislation proposing a clampdown on U.S. business operations in so-called tax havens. He told the Royal Gazette: 'The industry, the reinsurance that's had such phenomenal success has been good for both nations. I would oppose any measures that would upset that.'""
 
The McCain campaign responded to the Obama ad by pointing out that the Obama campaign rents office space from Accenture, which is based in Bermuda. The

Chicago Sun-Times

reported in 2007 that the Obama campaign was leasing the 11th floor of an office tower for its headquarters from Accenture. The company is based in Bermuda.
 
Insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda are a high-profile issue, with U.S.-based insurance companies seeking to reverse a treaty with Bermuda that they say puts them at a disadvantage compared with their Bermuda-based competitors.
 
The Obama campaign phrases McCain's comments in a negative light, but gets the substance largely correct. McCain said he would oppose attempts to change current law in regards to Bermuda, though he singled out the insurance and reinsurance industries for protection rather than all types of industries. We rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

Obama ad distorts McCain's stem cell position
","


 
 
 
Competing radio ads from the McCain and Obama campaigns in the last week may have left voters confused about where Sen. John McCain stands on stem cell research.
 
First, you had a

McCain campaign ad

highlighting McCain’s support for stem cell research. Then you had an

Obama campaign ad

that portrayed McCain as an opponent of stem cell research. Which one is wrong? For the most part, that dubious honor goes to the Obama ad.
 
Here’s what the Obama ad says:
 
""Stem cell research could unlock cures for diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s too. But John McCain has stood in the way...he’s opposed stem cell research...picked a running mate who’s against it...and he’s running on a platform even more extreme than George Bush’s on this vital research.
 
""John McCain doesn’t understand that medical research benefiting millions shouldn’t be held hostage by the political views of a few.""
 
At one time, McCain did oppose embryonic stem cell research. In February, 2000, McCain joined 19 other senators in asking the National Institutes of Health to withdraw its new proposals to fund federal embryonic-cell research. But then McCain changed his mind.
 
McCain explained why in an interview with Tim Russert on

Meet the Press

on July 15, 2001.
 
""I’ve looked at the issue more carefully,"" McCain said. ""I have talked with numerous scientific experts. I believe that under stringent safeguards and under the most rigorous kinds of procedures, that this can help in finding the cure for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other serious diseases. I had supported, in the past, fetal tissue research, and this is an earlier stage, as you know, of the process. So, I think it’s an issue that I was educated on.""
 
In June 2004, McCain was among 58 U.S. senators — most of them Democrats — who signed a

letter

urging President Bush to change his position and allow federal funding for scientific research on embryonic stem cells.
 
McCain has backed up that position with votes in the U.S. Senate, putting him in the distinct minority among his Republican colleagues.
 
On July 18, 2006, and again on April 11, 2007, McCain voted in favor of a bill that would allow the use of federal funds in research on embryonic stem cell lines derived from surplus embryos at in-vitro fertilization clinics. In both cases, McCain ran counter to the majority of Republicans, although both bills passed with overwhelming support from Democrats.
 
Republican U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, who also voted for the bills, noted that it was a position unpopular in Republican circles.
 
""The fact is John McCain has been a champion for stem cell research, which holds the promise of curing devastating diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease,"" Specter said in a statement released on Sept. 23, 2008. ""John McCain bucked the majority of our party in standing strong with me in urging the Bush administration to lift restrictions on stem cell research, and last year voted to overturn the Bush policy.""
 
So how does the Obama campaign back up its claim that McCain has stood in the way of — and opposed — stem cell research?
 
First, the Obama campaign accuses McCain of pandering to social conservatives at a private meeting in Ohio in June. The campaign cites a

Los Angeles Times


article

which states that McCain ""told the small assembly that he was open to learning more about their opposition to embryonic stem cell research despite his past disagreements with them on the issue.""
 
But the article also notes that ""several participants said McCain did not offer any indication he would change his mind, but they said they were impressed that he appeared open to"" points made by one of the country’s leading opponents of using embryonic stem cells.
 
The Obama campaign also notes that the recently adopted

GOP platform

calls for ""a major expansion"" of adult stem cell research but also ""a ban on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos for research purposes."" Again, however, this is a position at odds with McCain’s.
 
The Obama campaign also notes that McCain selected a vice presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who opposes embryonic stem cell research.
 
That’s accurate. In a 2006 Alaska gubernatorial

debate

, Palin said stem cell research ran counter to her prolife position. ""Stem cell research that would ultimately end in destruction of life,"" she said, ""I couldn’t support.""
 
In an interview that aired Sept. 12, ABC’s Charles Gibson asked Palin about embryonic stem cell research, given McCain’s support.
 
""You know, when you’re running for office, your life is an open book and you do owe it to Americans to talk about your personal opinion, which may end up being different than what the policy in an administration would be,"" Palin said. ""My personal opinion is we should not create human life, create an embryo and then destroy it for research, if there are other options out there. And thankfully, again, not only are there other options, but we’re getting closer and closer to finding a tremendous amount more of options, like, as I mentioned, the adult stem cell research.""
 
Palin’s clear opposition to embryonic research is actually our biggest problem with McCain’s ad on stem cell research, which begins by calling McCain and Palin ""the original mavericks.""
 
The ad states: ""John McCain will lead his congressional allies to improve America’s health. Stem cell research to unlock the mystery of cancer, diabetes, heart disease. Stem cell research to help free families from the fear and devastation of illness. Stem cell research to help doctors repair spinal cord damage, knee injuries, serious burns. Stem cell research to help stroke victims. And, John McCain and his congressional allies will invest millions more in new NIH medical research to prevent disease. Medical breakthroughs to help you get better, faster. Change is coming. McCain-Palin and congressional allies. The leadership and experience to really change Washington and improve your health.""
 
By including Palin in the ad, it suggests she is in step with his position. And as we have noted, she is not. But it should be noted that when asked about the issue directly, Palin made clear that while her ""personal opinion"" would be in disagreement with a policy supporting embryonic stem cell research, she would respect a McCain-led administration's right to set such a policy.
 
Ultimately, the McCain ad is substantially more accurate than the one from the Obama camp.
 
We get that it may make some stem cell proponents nervous when McCain tells hard-line opponents to embryonic stem cell research that he is open to listening to their arguments; or that he chose a running mate who opposes embryonic stem cell research; or that the GOP platform calls for a ban on experimentation on human embryos for research purposes.
 
But McCain has not backed away from his position.
 
Asked in a Republican debate in California on May 3, 2007, what he thought about federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, McCain was unequivocal.
 
""I believe that we need to fund this,"" McCain said. ""This is a tough issue for those of us in the prolife community. I would remind you that these stem cells are either going to be discarded or perpetually frozen.
 
""We need to do what we can to relieve human suffering. It’s a tough issue. I support federal funding.""
 
And McCain has backed up his words with his vote twice in recent years, even when it meant challenging President Bush and a majority of his fellow Senate Republicans. That’s not standing in the way of, or opposing, stem cell research. We rate the Obama ad False.

McCain did get money from Bermuda-connected sources
","
An attack ad from Barack Obama looks at a trip John McCain made to Bermuda last year.
 
""Bermuda. It’s more than just a vacation destination for John McCain,"" the ad says over jaunty, Caribbean-style steel drum music. ""McCain went to Bermuda, and while he was there pledged to protect tax breaks for American corporations that hide their profits offshore. And grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists who benefit from the tax scheme gave McCain $50,000.""
 
We looked in detail at

McCain's visit in this statement

. Here we'll look at the campaign contributions angle.
 
Bermuda, a British territory with significant autonomy, is home to many international companies seeking to avoid taxes. In 2006, there were 14,267 international companies registered in Bermuda, many of them American owned, according to the U.S. State Department. A 2004 GAO report also listed Bermuda as a tax haven.
 
To come up with its $50,000 number, the Obama campaign compiled a list of 30 people and one political action committee connected to insurance and reinsurance companies based in Bermuda. We obtained a copy of the list from the campaign and cross-checked with Federal Election Commission records and found it to be accurate.
 
It seems likely that the Obama campaign's numbers undercounted contributions from lobbyists connected to Bermuda-based insurance companies. We were able to independently document another $8,150 in contributions to McCain.
 
And finally, among the Bermuda-connected contributors, we found four donors also gave a combined total of $8,200 to Obama.
 
The timeline seems to be that McCain visited Bermuda in August 2007, a fundraiser for him was held in October (which he did not attend) and contributions were reported to the Federal Election Commission in November 2007 and afterward.
 
The ad stops short of saying there was a quid pro quo at work, though we get the feeling the Obama campaign wouldn't mind if you assumed there was. A story in the

Royal Gazette's

sister newspaper

Mid Ocean News

noted that McCain's 2007 comments were at odds with comments he made in 2002 deploring companies moving overseas. McCain said then, ""More and more U.S. companies are using this highly profitable accounting scheme that allows a company to move its legal residence to offshore tax havens such as Bermuda, where there is no corporate income tax, and shield its profits from taxes. I applaud efforts to discourage this practice.""
 
The McCain campaign responded to the Obama ad by pointing out that the Obama campaign rents office space from Accenture, which is based in Bermuda. The

Chicago Sun-Times

reported in 2007 that the Obama campaign was leasing the 11th floor of an office tower for its headquarters from Accenture. The company is based in Bermuda.
 
The ad states that McCain got $50,000 from people connected to Bermuda-based companies, and we find this accurately portrays the contributions received. We rate Obama's statement True.

Turning the tables on Obama
","
They say the best defense is good offense. Which probably explains the latest tack by John McCain's campaign on the Bridge to Nowhere backlash.
 
For weeks, the media has castigated Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for her repeated claim ""I told the Congress ‘thanks, but no thanks,’ on that Bridge to Nowhere."" In our

analysis

, we noted that while Palin formally put an end to the project, it was nearly dead anyway, and Alaska still kept the money for other transportation projects. We also noted that Palin

flip-flopped

, having supported the bridge project during her run to become governor.
 
Recently, the McCain campaign has tried to turn the tables. According to several recent campaign press releases: ""Barack Obama has the longest track record of any candidate in this election in support of the 'Bridge To Nowhere.' ""
 
We’re betting if you’re on this Web site, you’re enough of a political junkie to know what the Bridge to Nowhere is. But just in case, it was a plan to build a nearly $400-million Alaska bridge to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.
 
As Exhibit A to show Obama’s longtime support, the McCain campaign notes that Obama voted in 2005 for the conference report on the Highway Reauthorization Bill, which included $225-milion for the Gravina Island bridge.
 
The conference report passed 91-4. And yes, McCain was among the four who voted against it. In a floor statement explaining his opposition, McCain specifically referenced the Gravina Island bridge among his many concerns with the bill.
 
But does Obama’s vote for the bill equal support for the Bidge to Nowhere? Let’s put this in some perspective. The bill included $286.5-billion though 2009 for highway, mass transit, safety and research programs. The Alaska bridge was less than a tenth of 1 percent of the spending in the bill.
 
""So they’re saying that because Obama was among the 91 senators who voted for the highway funding bill, that makes him a supporter of the bridge? That’s laughable,"" Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor told PolitiFact.
 
We agree.
 
The bill included more than $1.3-billion for transportation projects in Illinois, which also could explain Obama's vote.
 
""This gets so goofy,"" said Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ashdown is the guy who saddled the Gravina Island project with the dubious moniker, ""Bridge to Nowhere,"" a catchy name that helped the project become a national poster child for wasteful government spending.
 
""He (Obama) voted for the bill that would have made the Bridge to Nowhere a reality,"" Ashdown said. ""But I don’t know if that means he supported it. I don’t think that’s true.""
 
But there’s some more to consider.
 
With the Bridge to Nowhere a national laughingstock, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., in October 2005 proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125-million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina.
 
Obama voted against the amendment, which failed. McCain was not present and didn’t vote.
 
On Nov. 15, the

Chicago Tribune

printed a commentary from Obama which, in part, explained his decision.
 
""Others intent on cutting spending have pointed to Alaska’s ‘Bridge to Nowhere’ as a wasteful project,"" Obama wrote. ""I agree and believe that it represents the first type of project we should cut. But it’s wrong to single out one state’s pork project. If we’re serious about shared responsibility, let’s eliminate all pork projects in all states.""
 
Due to uproar over the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project, a congressional committee directed the $225-million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation. So Alaska would keep the money, but it would no longer be tied to the Bridge to Nowhere. Alaska could decide how to spend the money as it saw fit. They could even decide to spend it on the bridge.
 
By way of timeline, it was a year later — in the fall of 2006 — that Palin, then a candidate for governor of Alaska, assured the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce she was all for the bridge, and told the

Anchorage Daily News

""the window is now — while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist.""
 
It was a view she changed when she became governor. Early in 2007, she did not include funding for the bridge in her budget. And faced with a project whose pricetag had ballooned to $400-million, the fact that much of the federal money for the project had been spent on other transportation projects, and little prospect that the federal government would throw any more money at the unpopular project, she formally pulled the plug. Palin’s role has been well-reported in the media.
 
But back to Obama. Yes, he voted in favor of the massive transportation bill that included funds for the Bridge to Nowhere. But we don’t think that translates to support for the project.
 
Some might argue that the Coburn amendment gave Obama a clear opportunity to kill the Bridge to Nowhere — where it was not lumped in with other projects — but Obama chose not to. But again, does that equate to support for the project? In his commentary, Obama made clear he did not support the project, but didn't think it was right to single out one specific earmark from one state. The original bill inlcuded literally thousands of projects, with a little something for every state. And it passed with a resounding 91 senators in favor.
 
We think it’s a stretch to claim that Obama supported the Bridge to Nowhere. Certainly not the way Palin once did when she was running for governor of Alaska. Voting for a $236-billion spending bill that included the Alaska bridge is hardly support for it. But because Obama could have voted to kill the project with the Coburn Amendment, we’ll give it a Barely True.

Fuzzy stand in '96 does not amount to a plan
","
In a hard-hitting direct-mail piece to its members, the National Rifle Association detailed an alleged plan by Sen. Barack Obama to transform gun-ownership regulations.
 
Obama's ""plan"" appeared on a section of

the mailer

designed to be cut out and carried around in a wallet. The front of the wallet card said, ""Barack Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment."" The reverse listed the 10 parts of the alleged plan, including:
 
""3) Ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.""
 
We examined item No. 1

here

, and found it to be Pants on Fire wrong.
 
Some of the other items sound just as dubious, such as: ""4) Close down 90 percent of the gun shops in America."" And ""6) Increase federal taxes on guns and ammunition by 500 percent.""
 
But let's stick to No. 3 for now.
 
An NRA spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the direct mail piece, which first appeared in early August 2008. She would not delve into the details of how the organization supported its charges, but we're pretty sure we know where the NRA is coming from on this one.
 
In 1996, as a candidate for the Illinois state Senate, Obama filled out a questionnaire for a community group called Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization. It asked if the candidate supported state legislation to “ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.” Obama’s answer: “Yes.”
 
The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who “unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position” on gun control and other issues, even though Obama's writing was on another part of the questionnaire. (Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama’s campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, “He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn’t change the fact that some answers didn’t reflect his views.”)
 
But let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Obama approved of what was on the questionnaire. There are still serious problems with using that to justify a claim that Obama has a plan to ""ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.""
 
For one thing, the question was about a state law. The NRA claims without qualification that Obama wants to ban handguns, implying that he intends to do so on a national level. Obama says frequently that gun regulation should be tailored to different geographical areas.
 
For another thing, Obama's answer on the questionnaire was a long time ago. On a more recent questionnaire, he said, ""A complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable,"" but reasonable restrictions should be imposed, according to

the Associated Press

.
 
At the Democratic presidential debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said: ""I have never favored an all-out ban on handguns."" His vote in 2004, for a bill that authorized the Illinois State Police to issue concealed weapon permits to retired police officers and military police officers, supports that claim. Furthermore, as a state legislator and U.S. senator, Obama has had plenty of opportunity to propose a ban on handguns, and has never done so.
 
Obama's alleged endorsement of a proposed state law in 1996 does not add up to a plan to ban handguns, particularly in light of evidence to the contrary that has accumulated since then. We find the NRA's claim to be False.

He said it was patriotic to pay higher taxes
","
Joe Biden may never live down his Sept. 18, 2008, comment on ABC's

Good Morning America

that wealthy Americans should act patriotically by paying more taxes.
 
The Delaware senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee's remarks have proved a useful rallying cry for Republican nominee John McCain in painting Barack Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal.
 
But that doesn't mean it's okay to distort the record, which is what McCain did during a Sept. 22 campaign rally in Reading, Pa., when he told an audience of supporters that ""last week Senator Obama's running mate said, get this, 'Raising taxes is patriotic.' ""
 
Let's go to the transcript. Kate Snow, the ABC reporter conducting the interview with Biden, starts out discussing Obama's plan to roll back the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, effectively raising taxes on families making more than $250,000.
 
Snow begins: ""Anyone making over $250,000…"" Biden finishes her thought: ""… is going to pay more. It's time to be patriotic, time to jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut.""
 
Biden made the same point at a Sept. 3 town hall in Sarasota, Fla. One woman wondered what to tell friends who worry that an Obama-Biden victory will mean higher taxes.
 
""It's time to be patriotic. That's what you say to them,"" Biden answered.
 
It's a debatable argument Biden makes, but clearly he is not praising Obama's patriotism for planning to raise taxes. Rather he's invoking the patriotism of those wealthy taxpayers footing the bill.
 
Still, McCain's twisting of Biden's words isn't totally off base, given that Biden brought up patriotism while justifying Obama's plan to raise taxes on some wealthy Americans. We rule McCain's claim Barely True.

Yes, and outlaw apple pie as well
","
(Published Sept. 23, 2008)
 
In a hard-hitting direct-mail piece to its members, the National Rifle Association detailed an alleged plan by Sen. Barack Obama to transform gun-ownership regulations.
 
Obama's ""plan"" appeared on a section of

the mailer

designed to be cut out and carried around in a wallet. The front of the wallet card said, ""Barack Obama's Ten Point Plan to 'Change' the Second Amendment."" The reverse listed the 10 parts of the alleged plan, starting with, ""Ban use of firearms for home defense.""
 
An NRA spokeswoman confirmed the authenticity of the mailer, which first appeared in early August 2008, but would not provide details of what its claims were based on. For that, she referred us to various NRA Web sites.
 
We could find no support on any of them for the allegation that Obama has a plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense. What we did find, and what we suspect is the root of this allegation, was information about a vote Obama cast as an Illinois state senator in May 2004. (See

this essay

by NRA executive vice president officer Wayne LaPierre.)
 
The bill in question was a response to the case of Hale DeMar, a Wilmette, Ill., man who shot and wounded a burglar in his home in December 2003. Prosecutors did not charge him for the shooting, since they determined that he acted in self-defense, but they did fine him $750 for violating the local handgun ordinance. An outcry of sympathy for DeMar prompted the state legislature to take up a bill that would let people claim a self-defense protection for using a gun in their homes in violation of local weapons bans.
 
Obama voted against the measure. The legislature passed it, and later overrode the veto of Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich.
 
Like Blagojevich, Obama framed that debate as a home-rule issue. He told the Associated Press at the time that he voted against the measure out of respect for local governments' authority to set gun policy.
 
Here's what LaPierre wrote about the vote: ""When Obama turned thumbs down on the bill, he voted against the most basic element of the Second Amendment — the right of defense of self and family — the reason that millions of Americans own firearms.""
 
That's a bit of a leap. In concrete terms, Obama's thumbs-down was a vote against the state legislature tweaking a local gun ban. In any event, there's no fair way to interpret it as evidence that Obama has a future plan to ban the use of firearms for home defense.
 
Moreover, there's ample evidence to the contrary. Here's Obama speaking at a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008: ""I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it’s important for us to recognize that we’ve got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people — law-abiding citizens use it for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for

protecting their families

(emphasis added). We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage…We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respect the Second Amendment and people’s traditions.”
 
That doesn't sound to us like someone planning to ""ban use of firearms for home defense."" Quite the opposite, actually.
 
Ignoring that sort of evidence, and instead extrapolating from one vote on a jurisdictional debate in Illinois a broad-ranging plan to ban guns for home defense, is not just misleading, it's intentionally dishonest. That is, Pants on Fire wrong.

"['National', 'Crime', 'Bloggers']","
Wasilla had the policy, but Palin didn't comment on it
","
As bloggers have scrutinized every aspect of Sarah Palin’s record as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, many of them have criticized a city policy that sought reimbursement for forensic exams from victims of sexual assaults. The bloggers contend Palin supported the policy and have criticized her for allegedly being insensitive toward rape victims.
 
To check out their allegations, we examined documents from the city and the Alaska Legislature and interviewed people in Wasilla, advocates for sexual assault victims and a former state legislator. We found the truth is murky. Although Wasilla had such a “rape kit” policy while Palin was mayor, there is no evidence that she explicitly endorsed the policy. But nor have we found any evidence that she opposed it.
 
The policy sought to have rape victims’ health insurance companies reimburse the city for the $500 to $1,200 cost of a forensic exam that is conducted after a sexual assault. Presumably, some of the cost might have been passed along to the victim through requirements for deductibles or co-payments, although victim advocates say they don’t know of anyone in the small town who had to pay such a fee.
 
The policy generated little if any controversy during the first four years after Palin became mayor in 1996. Anne Kilkenny, a civic activist in Wasilla who has written a widely circulated e-mail criticizing Palin, told PolitiFact she does not recall that the issue ever came up.
 
The policy came to light briefly in 2000 when the Alaska Legislature passed a law that required state and local law enforcement agencies pay the full cost of the exams.
 
“We would never bill the victim of a burglary for fingerprinting and photographing the crime scene, or for the cost of gathering other evidence,” then-Gov. Tony Knowles said when he signed the bill into law. “Nor should we bill rape victims just because the crime scene happens to be their bodies.”
 
Legislators and activists have said the law was prompted by Wasilla and several other communities with a similar policy.
 
But a search of the committee minutes for the bill found no mention of Wasilla or Palin. Nor could we find any indication that city officials spoke up about the bill until after it was passed, when Police Chief Charlie Fannon was quoted in the local newspaper

The Frontiersman

saying he opposed it.
 
“In the past we’ve charged the cost of exams to the victims’ insurance company when possible,” he told the newspaper. “I just don’t want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer.” He estimated the new law would cost his department $5,000 to $14,000 per year.
 
His comments suggest the city sought the money more from insurance companies than the victims themselves. The paper quoted him as saying that ""ultimately, it is the criminal who should bear the burden of the added costs.”
 
Fannon could not be reached for comment. His phone number has been disconnected. City officials, who have been swamped with calls and public records requests about Palin, referred PolitiFact to items on the city Web site. (They've gotten so many requests they created a page of


Questions & Answers Concerning Former Mayor Palin


. But those documents provide an incomplete picture because some don’t include details prior to 2000, when Wasilla had the policy.
 
There’s no evidence that Palin ever commented on the rape kit policy. Bloggers and other critics contend that she must have known about it because she approved the city budget.
 
“If she was against charging for the rape kit, as mayor she could have made the decision not to charge for the rape kit,” Andrew Halcro, a Republican who co-sponsored the bill when he was a state legislator, said in an interview. He ran for governor as an independent in 2006 but was defeated by Palin.
 
City documents are inconclusive. The budget documents we reviewed were signed by Palin but don’t explicitly mention the policy.
 
In response to recent criticism, the McCain-Palin campaign said in a statement that Palin “does not believe, nor has she ever believed, that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence gathering test.""
 
Yet the campaign has not provided any evidence that Palin ever opposed the policy.
 
So where does that leave us?
 
Wasilla clearly had the policy. Bloggers have portrayed it as a heartless rule seeking money from rape victims, but they have neglected to mention that the policy seems to have been aimed more at getting money from insurance companies than from victims.
 
We can’t find that Palin ever commented on the policy, pro or con. But as mayor, she indirectly endorsed it by approving city budgets that relied on the revenue. So we find the bloggers' charge to be Half True.

Obama overstates McCain's plan, whatever that is
","
With the stock market on a roller coaster last week, Sen. Barack Obama decided it was a good time to take a shot at Sen. John McCain on Social Security. McCain has, in the past, supported plans that would allow workers, if they want, to have a portion of their Social Security put into personal retirement accounts that allow investment in the stock market.
 
""And I’ll protect Social Security, while John McCain wants to privatize it,"" Obama said in a speech in Daytona Beach, Fla., on Sept. 20, 2008. ""Without Social Security half of elderly women would be living in poverty — half. But if my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would’ve had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week. Millions would’ve watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes. Millions of families would’ve been scrambling to figure out how to give their mothers and fathers, their grandmothers and grandfathers, the secure retirement that every American deserves. So I know Senator McCain is talking about a 'casino culture' on Wall Street — but the fact is, he’s the one who wants to gamble with your life savings.""
 
To be sure, it was a volatile week on Wall Street. Down 504 points Monday; up 141 Tuesday; down again, 449 points Wednesday; then back up again 410 points Thursday; and up another 319 Friday.
 
The market ended up down just 34 points for the week. But whew, there was certainly a lot of angst.
 
But there are a couple problems with Obama’s attack on McCain’s plans for Social Security. First and foremost is that McCain hasn’t actually laid out his plan for Social Security.
 
In July, McCain was asked it. ""I cannot tell you what I would do, except to put everything on the table,"" he told reporters. A few weeks later, he was asked about new taxes to shore up Social Security. ""There is nothing that’s off the table. I have my positions, and I’ll articulate them. But nothing’s off the table,"" McCain said. ""I don’t want tax increases. But that doesn’t mean that anything is off the table.""
 
We’re still waiting to hear McCain articulate his positions.
 
""No one really knows what his plan is, including him,"" said John Rother, policy director at AARP. McCain’s statements on Social Security so far have been ""too contradictory or too vague,"" to pin down, he said. To make any statements about McCain’s plan going forward would require a bit of mind-reading, Rother said.
 
In lieu of that, we think it’s fair for Obama to take aim at McCain’s previous support for personal retirement accounts.
 
In 1998, McCain voted in favor of a budget amendment to express ""the sense of Senate"" that any budget surplus should be used to reduce Social Security payroll tax and to establish personal retirement accounts. The vote — 50-48 in favor — largely came down along partisan lines.
 
And in 2005, McCain supported President George W. Bush’s push to allow workers to divert a portion of the program’s payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. McCain supported Bush’s plan, going so far as to accompany the president on a series of town hall meetings in March 2005. The plan fizzled, though, and the initiative went down as one of Bush’s biggest defeats in domestic policy.
 
McCain has since modified his stance.
 
When we

wrote

about McCain’s plan back in April, McCain’s campaign Web site stated that McCain ""supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts — but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. John McCain will reach across the aisle, but if the Democrats do not act, he will."" That’s no longer on the Web site, and the McCain campaign did not respond to an e-mail seeking to clarify his position on Social Security.
 
We’re not inclined to give McCain a pass just because he has failed to articulate his plan. But Obama’s statement is misleading, even when judged against McCain’s earlier support for Bush’s plan.
 
First, Obama seems to be suggesting that today’s retirees would have had their Social Security tied up in the volatile stock market this week.
 
The Bush plan for personal investment accounts would not have applied to those retirees currently getting Social Security. No one born before 1950 would have been eligible to participate in the investment plan; so only people 58 or younger.
 
McCain stressed that point in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on June 12, 2008.
 
""I will not privatize Social Security, and it’s not true when I’m accused of that,"" McCain said. ""But I would like for younger workers, younger workers only, to have an opportunity to take a few of their tax dollars, and maybe put it into an account with their name on it. That’s their money. ... And we will make sure that present-day retirees, I will commit, have the benefits that they have earned.""
 
We also think Obama may have been guilty of using some scare tactics here. For one, participation in the Bush program would have been entirely voluntary. Second, without signing a waiver, upon turning 47, the accounts would have been invested in a ""life cycle portfolio,"" shifting from higher risk growth funds to secure bonds as people neared retirement (and thereby protecting near-retirees from sudden market swings).
 
And last, people would have been able to set aside in their investment accounts only up to 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes (currently 12.4 percent), so only a little over a quarter of one’s Social Security taxes could have been invested. In short, it would have been impossible to see one’s entire nest egg disappear in a down market. And people would have been allowed to choose only from a small number of diversified index funds, preventing people from putting large portions of their retirement savings in just a few stocks.
 
Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor told PolitiFact that Obama wasn’t necessarily talking about current retirees.
 
""You don’t have to be retired to rely on Social Security,"" Vietor said. ""Millions of people who will one day retire rely on Social Security as they plan their futures. Senator Obama’s bottom line is absolutely true. If McCain got his way and we had private accounts (a position he started articulating as early as 1998), people who are relying on that money for their retirement would be in a very difficult situation.""
 
There is a legitimate point to be made that to the extent that a person's Social Security plan is tied up in investment accounts, it is certainly subject to the vagaries of the stock market. But we are of the opinion that when Obama talked about ""the millions of Floridians who rely on it"" he was talking about current retirees.
 
While McCain has remained vague about his plans for Social Security, he has never expressed support for a plan that would allow current retirees to invest a portion of their Social Security in stocks, and neither did the Bush plan McCain once backed. We rule Obama's statement False.

Forecasting another market collapse?
","


 
The recent meltdown in the financial markets, and the massive government-led bailout it inspired, has made deregulation almost a dirty word. Seizing on the spirit of the times, Barack Obama is accusing John McCain of preparing to eliminate regulations governing the sale of health insurance, in a continuation of what Obama contends are the too-hands-off regulatory policies of the Bush administration.
 
""We’ve seen what Bush/McCain policies have done to our economy. Now, John McCain wants to do the same to our health care,"" an announcer intones in a new Obama campaign ad, called ""Article,"" that was unveiled Sept. 22, 2008. ""McCain just published an article praising Wall Street deregulation, said he’d reduce oversight of the health insurance industry, too. Just as we have done over the last decade in banking. Increasing costs and threatening coverage.""
 
The magazine article mentioned in the ad is an opinion piece McCain wrote in the September/October edition of

Contingencies

, a magazine published by the American Academy of Actuaries devoted to insurance and financial service issues. Obama wrote an accompanying piece in the same issue.
 
We’ve already dealt with the McCain camp’s views on financial regulation in

this item about former McCain adviser Phil Gramm

, and

this story that examined McCain's position on the bailout of insurance giant AIG.

 
On the issue of health insurance, the Obama ad focuses on a section of the McCain article dealing with expanding consumer choice in health care. McCain advocates allowing individuals to purchase health insurance from companies across state lines. Currently, states oversee the health care insurance market within their borders, a system of regulation that McCain and others say limits consumer choices and inflates prices.
 
""Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation,"" McCain wrote. ""You should be able to buy your insurance from any willing provider – the state bureaucracies are no better than national ones.""
 
McCain is adapting a health care proposal long championed by conservatives in Congress and by the Bush administration that would allow insurers to bypass state-imposed coverage mandates for certain types of treatments and procedures, such as diabetes care and cancer screenings. The theory behind these proposals is that by eliminating the need to comply with a tangle of state regulations, small businesses and consumers would be more likely to band together and better able to negotiate lower prices, and thus reduce the number of uninsured Americans. Several bills that would have permitted this passed the U.S. House when the GOP controlled the chamber, but they died in the more closely divided Senate.
 
Critics of such regulatory streamlining worry that it would destroy state-mandated consumer protections that include limiting how much and how often an employer can raise premiums when an employee gets sick, and eliminate state requirements on mental health and screenings such as those for cervical and breast cancers, leaving consumers at the mercy of insurers. (Health insurance generally is regulated by states, not the federal government, but the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, does outline some requirements for employee benefit plans.)
 
So, there are two elements here.
 
First is the question of whether or not McCain wants to ""reduce oversight of the health care industry."" The answer largely hinges on how McCain would license insurance carriers to operate across state lines, and whether he would retain some of the existing rules while streamlining state regulations – complex but important details his campaign hasn’t provided. One scenario that Republicans considered in the Senate in 2006 would have allowed insurers to bypass state coverage mandates if they met certain minimum standards. Insurers who chose to offer such plans would have been required to offer at least one plan that matches the benefits offered to state employees of one of the five most populous states — California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. Democrats blocked the proposal from being considered, so it’s unclear how McCain would have voted.
 
Experts say without more details, it’s difficult to predict an answer to the second element, which is whether or not such changes would ""increase costs and threaten coverage."" Cori Uccello, the American Academy of Actuaries’ senior health fellow, says if new cross-country insurance rules were made more favorable to people in poor health, for example,  sicker individuals would migrate to those interstate plans and gradually force premiums to rise. The opposite could occur if the new market’s rules had less generous coverage requirements and primarily attracted healthier individuals. Uccello says applying the same rules to all interstate plans could avoid such disparities.
 
So it’s impossible to tell whether McCain’s plan would really drive up costs and threaten coverage, never mind unleash a calamity on the scale of what is currently sweeping through the financial sector. McCain certainly is on record supporting less state regulation of health insurance, which would reduce coverage mandates and put more of an onus on consumers to shop for the best deals. Whether this would result in more choice and lower prices, as McCain contends, depends on what kind of rules his administration would draft, and how insurers would respond. But lacking such details and the knowledge of how the market would react, it’s a stretch for Obama to suggest McCain is intent on taking a hands-off approach to health insurance. We rule his claim Half True.

Their employees have donated
","
During a campaign speech in Green Bay, Wis.,  John McCain called for reforms on Wall Street oversight and blasted his Democratic opponent Barack Obama.
 
Among his prime targets: the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 
""While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Senator Obama was taking their money,"" McCain said. ""He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. And while Fannie Mae was betraying the public trust, somehow its former CEO had managed to gain my opponent's trust to the point that Senator Obama actually put him in charge of his vice presidential search.""
 
It's true that Obama selected Jim Johnson, the chaiman and CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, to advise him on his vice presidential choice. But Johnson resigned the unpaid position on June 11, 2008, months before veep nominee Joe Biden was chosen, amid criticism of compensation and favorable mortgage terms Johnson received.
 
Here we'll look at McCain's statement that Obama received the second-most campaign contributions from Fannie Mae.
 
The source for this data is the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which has compiled a list of which political leaders received the most money from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Obama's campaign cites this source to back up its claim that John McCain has received

more than $2-million from big oil

.
 
On the Freddie and Fannie question, it as McCain said: Obama is No. 2 on the list, with $126,349, right after Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who had $165,400.
 
But the list requires a few notes of explanation.
 
Corporations cannot give to candidates, so the center's list adds up contributions from Fannie and Freddie employees and their families. Obama has received a lot of money during his presidential campaign, though, and Fannie and Freddie don't make his list of top 20 companies. (The top three companies with employees donating to Obama are Goldman Sachs, University of California, and Citigroup, according to the center.)
 
The

New York Times

looked at contributions from Fannie and Freddie's boards of directors and lobbyists, who are technically not employees.  That analysis found Fannie and Freddie-related contributors gave $169,000 to John McCain and his related committees, compared with $16,000 to Obama and his related committees.
 
Nevertheless, the center's information does reflect which candidates are getting the most money from Fannie and Freddie employees. There are other ways to parse the campaign finance numbers, but McCain is correct when he says Obama got the second-most money on a list compiled by a respected, nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog. He would have been more accurate if he would have noted that he was talking about Fannie and Freddie employees. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Hillary Clinton says women earned twice as many computer science degrees in the 1980s as today
","In a public appearance during her not-yet-announced presidential campaign, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke before an audience in Silicon Valley to beta-test some economic messages. At one point, Clinton mentioned the challenges facing women in the historically male-dominated field of computing. She capped this reference with a surprising statistic: ""You had more women getting computer sciences degrees in the '80s by a factor of 2-plus than you do now. … Why aren't more girls and women going into this field? What was different about being a high school or college student in the '80s than it is today? I think we need to unpack that."" Is it really true that the mid 1980s were a golden age for women in computing, and that it’s been all downhill since then? What the numbers show When we contacted Clinton’s staff, a spokesman declined to comment. But we were able to find some official data tracking these trends, thanks to Randy Olson, a Ph.D. candidate in Michigan State University's computer science program who had blogged about this topic. First, let’s look at a graph Olson assembled that shows the percentage of bachelor’s degrees conferred to women in the United States between 1970 and 2012, separated out by major. The second-to-lowest category on the chart, in a shade of light gray, is computer science.      The graph makes it easy to see the general trend for women in computer science. The percentage of all computer-science degrees that went to women rose from less than 5 percent in 1970 to nearly 40 percent in the early-to-mid 1980s. Then, it began falling steadily, sinking to below 20 percent in the most recent data a few years ago. So Clinton has captured the general trend correctly. But after looking at the original data source for Olson’s chart -- a table from the federal Department of Education -- Clinton's numbers are a bit off. Here’s a summary for the relevant years:   Academic year Number of women receiving computer science bachelor’s degrees Percent of all computer science bachelor’s degrees granted to women 1980-81          4,919 32.5 1981-82     7,049      34.8 1982-83             8,924 36.3 1983-84          12,023 37.1 1984-85          14,384 36.8 1985-86 15,129      35.7   1986-87          13,805 34.7 1987-88          11,237 32.4 1988-89          9,417 30.8 1989-90          8,188 29.9 2011-12          8,611 18.2   If you use the raw numbers of women earning bachelor’s degrees in computer science, the ratio from the 1980s to today never quite reaches goes above 2-to-1, as Clinton said it did. The highest it gets is 1.76-to-1. That said, 1.76-to-1 is not that far off from 2-to-1. Clinton is slightly more accurate when using the percentage of all computer-science bachelor's degrees going to women. Using that statistic, she's correct for two years out of the 10 that decade, and she’s pretty close for several of the other eight years. In one sense, though, Clinton underestimates how much ground women lost in computer-science bachelor’s degrees over this period. Since 1983-84, the number of women earning bachelor’s degrees in any field almost doubled. So in 1983-84, computer science degrees accounted for 2.4 percent of all bachelor’s degrees conferred to women. By 2011-12, that had shrunk to less than 1 percent. This is an especially notable trend because it runs counter to what’s been happening in other scientific fields. As Olson’s chart shows, the share of degrees granted to women in biology has risen from just under 50 percent to just under 60 percent over the same period. In the physical sciences, it has gone up from just under 30 percent to about 40 percent. And in engineering, it has risen from about 14 percent to 18 percent. Why has the number of women earning computer science degrees tumbled? So the decline in computer science is atypical. But why? Experts we checked with offered some informed speculation. Universities haven’t expanded computer-science programs quickly enough to meet the surge in student interest, an imbalance in supply and demand that persists to this day, said Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington and author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. ""There are not enough seats in upper-level computer-science courses to meet demand,"" she said. ""So introductory courses become weed-out courses that turn students off if they don’t already have a fierce passion for the discipline."" This ended up favoring men. The home-based personal computer arrived in the mid 1980s, and it was marketed ""almost entirely to men and boys,"" NPR noted last year. And the popularization of the ""hacker"" persona reinforced it further. ""Hackers were almost uniformly white, adolescent, middle-class males,"" said Nathan Ensmenger, associate professor of informatics at Indiana University. This pattern continued into the workplace. Many companies had ""a 'frat boy' atmosphere,"" said Ed Lazowska, the Bill & Melinda Gates chair in computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. ""They simply weren't welcoming places for women. And stereotypes are hard to stamp out, even if and when behavior actually changes."" Ironically, it wasn’t always this way. In the 1940s and 1950s, computer work was seen as something akin to being a telephone operator -- a rote technical skill that women had traditionally handled. So the first electronic supercomputer -- ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania -- had an entirely female programming staff, O’Mara said. Similarly, in the 1950s, IBM had ""systems service girls,"" who were sent out to fix your computer if it got buggy. ""But as computing became big business, the startup culture, and its unstable life and all-consuming hours, ruled,"" O’Mara said. "" Women got edged further and further out of the picture."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""You had more women getting computer-sciences degrees in the '80s by a factor of 2-plus than you do now.""  The difference in raw numbers never quite hit the 2-to-1 ratio she cited, but it did get pretty close. She is correct that the share of computer science degrees earned by women peaked in the mid 1980s and has fallen since then. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771E240>],/factchecks/2015/mar/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-women-earned-twice-many-compu/

Anti-vax measles claim misinterprets data
","The current measles outbreak has prompted some scientific-sounding claims about the dangers of vaccines. PolitiFact Georgia already ruled Pants On Fire to an outlandish statement reviving the threat of ""mercury"" in childhood vaccines, particularly the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella. Some readers challenged that conclusion, citing the experts in our backyard, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The gist of the argument comes from a headline over a story from the same alternative-health site as our first claim, NaturalNews.com. ""Measles vaccines kill more people than measles, CDC data proves,"" the headline reads. The story gives precise numbers: The CDC, it says, has reported no deaths from the virus in a decade, while ""at least 108 deaths"" have been linked to measles vaccines according to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It would be front-page news – not to mention a flood of ""I told you so"" Facebook posts – if, in fact, children were more than 100 times more likely to die from measles vaccines than the disease itself. The reason it isn’t? No grand conspiracy. Just a misreading of data. First, let’s agree that the data should only include cases or deaths in the United States. After all, measles remains among the leading causes of death for young children worldwide, killing 145,700 in 2013, according to the World Health Organization. The fate of children and adults in the United States is much better. The CDC’s National Vital Statistics Report data show measles as the cause of death five times between 2004 and 2010, the last year information is available. That breaks down to two cases each in 2009 and 2010, and one in 2005. And, according to the data, only the 2005 death was that of a child. However, even that low number might be an overstatement. A spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said those tallies sometimes report underlying causes, which do not always represent deaths associated with acute measles infection. Officially, the CDC shows the last verifiable deaths in the U.S. from acute measles were in 2003, when a 13-year-old boy and a 75-year-old man died, according to spokesman Mike Sennett. So that puts the half of the claim in line with the CDC’s stance. The other half – about more than 100 deaths from the four different measles vaccines – is the problem. Those figures come from searches of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), an online database co-sponsored by the CDC, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Significantly, anyone can file a report with VAERS: doctors, patients, family members, friends, ""even if the reporter cannot be certain that the event was caused by the vaccine."" That is important to know when running a search of the VAERS database for the past decade. That data reveal 105 deaths following one of the four measles vaccines. From the most common MMR vaccine, the count is 96. But remember, the system is designed to capture as much information as possible. Tallying a death that happened after a measles vaccine is not the same as confirming that the shot was the cause. (When available, causes of death after the measles vaccines range from existing heart conditions to co-sleeping to drowning.) Researchers want that information to review and study for patterns, said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, a pediatrician and associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center who spent 16 years as the head of the CDC’s national immunization program. Government researchers constantly examine every report, on an ongoing basis. They turn over anything suspicious to outside groups, such as the Institute of Medicine, for deeper analysis. ""There is a very comprehensive review to look at vaccine safety,"" Orenstein said. ""After all, we give our own children these vaccines."" The review on the measles vaccines is clear: There have been no deaths attributed to the shots. In fact, none of the measles vaccines have prompted concern. Others have, most notably a rotovirus vaccine that VAERS data suggested increased risk for bowel blockages. That vaccine was pulled from the market in 1999. It has since been replaced by two similar vaccines that more effectively keep children from being hospitalized with severe diarrhea – though the blockages called intussusception remain a slight risk. ""The policy comes in, as weighing the risks and benefits of a vaccine,"" said Dr. Frank DeStefano, the director of the Immunization Safety Office the CDC. That is to say, the research allows for informed decision making when recommending vaccines. For the MMR vaccine, and others, there are known complications. Most common, DeStefano said, is anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that will affect one out of every 1 million to 2 million children. Those children are usually allergic to components of the vaccine, such as gelatin or egg proteins, not the viral antigen itself. The complications from measles, meanwhile, are far more common. According to the book ""Vaccines"" by Peter M. Strebel, pneumonia occurs in 1 to 6 percent of cases, ear infections occur 7 to 9 percent of the time and diarrhea occurs in about in about 8 percent of cases. Encephalitis, a potentially deadly brain swelling, occurs in 1 out of every 1,000 to 2,000 kids with the disease. An almost always lethal form of encephalitis occurs years after an infection in 1 to 3 kids for every 1,000 cases. To scientists, those complications make it clear that the vaccine's benefits far outweigh its risks, and certainly outweigh the risks of a highly contagious disease. The NaturalNews site claims that at least 108 children have died from the measles vaccine in the past decade, while none have died of the disease itself. That’s wildly inaccurate. There have been reports of death in children following the vaccine, but that does not equal deaths caused by the vaccine. There are no confirmed deaths caused by the measles vaccines. The more accurate comparison, DeStefano suggests, is that big fat zero versus the 300-400 children who died annually in the United States before the vaccine was available in the 1960s. We agree. The article misreads data, to suggest that the measles vaccine is a greater threat to children than the disease. Experts, and data, show that measles is far more dangerous than the vaccine, even if some kids do have a reaction to the shot. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3AD80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/03/naturalnewscom/vaccine-claim-misinterprets-data/

Perry says U.S. is No. 1 producer of oil and gas
","Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry headlined a fundraising dinner for the Republican Party of Virginia with a speech that, among other things, called for greater U.S. energy production. Perry was miffed by President Barack Obama’s recent veto of legislation that would have authorized construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would allow oil to flow from Canadian tar sands to U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. Perry stepped down as governor in January and is exploring a bid for the GOP presidential nomination. ""One of the fastest ways to create growth and opportunity is to tap into this great energy opportunity, the great energy resources that we have in this country,"" Perry told the crowd at the Richmond Marriott on Feb. 24. ""With the advent of new technology, new innovation, it’s allowed energy companies to access shale formations. America produces more oil and gas than any other nation in the world -- more than Russia, more than Saudi Arabia."" We took a look at Perry’s contention that the U.S. is No. 1 in oil and gas production. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National examined a similar claim made in January by the very person Perry was criticizing -- Obama. Perry’s camp did not respond to four requests for back-up information. So we turned to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which compiles data on overall oil production, a category that includes not just crude oil, but also biofuels like ethanol, natural gas liquids and other liquids. Under that comprehensive measure, the U.S. produced 14.275 million barrels of oil a day in the third quarter of last year -- the most current figures available. That was tops in the world,  ahead No. 2 producer Saudi Arabia, which tapped 11.6 million barrels a day. Russia was No. 3, producing 10.8 million barrels a day during the quarter. The U.S. has led Saudi Arabia in daily oil production since the last three months of 2012.   If you look at a narrower field of oil production -- just crude oil without the biofuels and other liquids included -- then the U.S. ranked third, behind Russia and Saudi Arabia. When comparing U.S. oil production to Saudi Arabia, there’s some important context to keep in mind. Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project, told PolitiFact National that Saudi Arabia has a higher production capacity than the U.S. but chooses not to use it all to avoid glutting the global market. ""In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,"" Maugeri said. Now, let’s turn to natural gas. In 2012, the most current EIA figures, the U.S. produced 29.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The only nation that came close was Russia, which produced 23 trillion cubic feet. The U.S., which has seen a boost in natural gas from domestic shale production, has been the leader in producing that resource since 1993, when it surpassed Russia. Our ruling Perry said the U.S. produces more oil and natural gas than any other country in the world. EIA figures show he’s correct. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFA100>],/factchecks/2015/mar/02/rick-perry/perry-says-us-no-1-producer-oil-and-gas/
"['Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Income', 'Population', 'Wealth', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says most of the 10 richest counties are around Washington, D.C.
","Speaking at an event to mark Ronald Reagan’s birthday, Gov. Scott Walker complained about, of all things, income inequality. It's not like the Wisconsin Republican was about to Occupy anything. He was making a larger, Reagan-like argument -- that there is too much power concentrated in Washington, D.C. During his remarks, given Feb. 6, 2015 at the late president’s alma mater, Eureka College in Eureka, Ill., Walker said: ""In fact, if you have any doubt, if you looked last year, the numbers that we saw put out showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America -- six of the top 10 wealthiest communities in America, by county, according to median income -- are in and around the Washington, D.C., area,"" Walker said. ""That tell you anything about where we're growing the economy in this nation?"" The governor made the same six-in-10 claim a week earlier, in another speech -- in Washington. And again in remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington.  Let's see if it's true. The numbers We’ll note at the top that Walker was careful to make his claim about counties and median income. Nothing wrong with that. The median divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the households falling below the median income and one-half above the median. But it's worth noting that you'd get a different picture if you picked variables such as cities or average income. For median household income, the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures for counties are estimates for 2013. The figures were released in December 2014. As Walker stated, six of the top 10 counties are in Washington suburbs, either in Virginia or Maryland. 
  County Name                       Median Household Income Estimate for 2013  Loudoun County, VA                                $117,680 Falls Church city, VA                             $117,452 Los Alamos County, NM                             $110,930 Fairfax County, VA                                $110,658 Howard County, MD                                 $108,503 Hunterdon County, NJ                              $107,203 Douglas County, CO                                $105,192 Arlington County, VA                              $101,533 Morris County, NJ                                 $99,950 Montgomery County, MD                             $97,873   (Technically, Falls Church is an ""independent city"" but is treated as a county by the Census Bureau.) As we noted, the top 10 look much different if you consider average income. That's because super-rich residents can skew the data much higher. Indeed, in July 2014, Money published a list, based on IRS figures from individual tax returns, for the 2012 tax year. No suburban county around D.C. made the top 10. The highest average income was $296,778 in Teton County, Wyo. Three of the top 10 counties were in Texas. Salim Furth, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, told us the D.C. area ranks high in median income because of its ""high-paying jobs in and around government, and high real estate prices which nudge out retirees and people with low incomes."" David Egan-Robertson, a demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Applied Population Laboratory, said many federal jobs, as well as private-sector positions in the D.C. region under federal contract, require high levels of expertise. And ""to attract and retain this high level of expertise requires higher levels of compensation."" One footnote: In early 2013, our colleagues rated two claims similar to Walker's. Also made by Republican politicians, those claims relied on data slightly older than what Walker cited. Both U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin had said seven of the nation's 10 richest counties were in suburban Washington. PolitiFact Ohio and PolitiFact National, respectively, rated both claims True. Our rating Walker said six of the 10 wealthiest counties, ""according to median income, are in and around the Washington, D.C. area."" The latest U.S. census estimates for median household income, for 2013, bear that out. Six of the top 10 counties were in D.C. suburbs in Maryland or Virginia. We rate Walker's statement True.

R.I. Bishop Thomas Tobin says abortions make up 94% of Planned Parent services for pregnant women
","Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas J. Tobin is an ardent and outspoken abortion opponent. He voiced his opposition recently in the Jan. 22, 2015 edition of The Rhode Island Catholic newspaper in a column entitled ""The ‘Throwaway Culture’ Has Arrived at Our Doorstep."" In it, he faulted Planned Parenthood as a ""destructive, immoral"" organization that should not be supported by federal tax dollars. He cited figures to support his position, including that ""... Abortions account for 94 percent of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood."" In the column, Bishop Tobin identified the source of the information as the Susan B. Anthony List, a Washington, D.C.-based organization whose mission is to help elect anti-abortion candidates and pursue policies that will reduce and ultimately end abortion. We reached out to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, which Bishop Tobin leads, to see whether the bishop had additional information to back up his statement. Carolyn E. Cronin, director of communications for the diocese, referred us to a fact sheet put out by the Susan B. Anthony List -- which included the 94-percent figure -- as well as statistics from another anti-abortion organization, Life Issues Institute Inc. Mallory E. Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, referred us to numbers taken from page 18 of  Planned Parenthood’s 2013-2014 annual report. ""There are 3 options/responses to pregnancy for Planned Parenthood,"" Quigley said in an email. Abortion services: 327,653 Prenatal referrals: 18,684 Adoption Services: 1,880 Quigley said the sum of those three numbers -- 348,217 -- represents ""total pregnancy services."" She  said the total number of abortions -- 327,653 -- is  94 percent of that total. When we contacted Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which encompasses Rhode Island, Susan Yolen, the vice president for public policy and advocacy, faulted that calculation -- and Bishop Tobin’s conclusion -- as misleading. Planned Parenthood health centers do not compile the pregnancy status of all their female patients, she said. Nor do they tally the number of pregnant women staff refers to outside obstetricians or other health-care providers, she said. In other words, the number of women receiving ""pregnancy services"" is not simply the sum of those getting abortions or receiving adoption or prenatal services. Other figures on page 18 of Planned Parenthood’s annual report show that the agency conducted 1.1 million pregnancy tests and another 3.7 million tests for sexually transmitted diseases (for both men and women). Presumably, there were pregnant women in each of those groups who aren’t represented in the Susan B. Anthony lists’ tally. It’s also important to note that the number cited by the Susan B. Anthony List for ""total pregnancy services"" does not appear in the Planned Parenthood report. Eric Ferrero, vice president for communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, also rebutted Tobin’s numbers. ""This meaningless and false claim is part of a campaign to spread misinformation by a group whose sole purpose is to end access to abortion in America,"" Ferrero wrote in an email. Ferrero cited figures to support his position. ""One in five women in America relies on Planned Parenthood at some point in her life for the full range of reproductive health care,"" he said. ""In 2013, Planned Parenthood health centers provided more than 2 million birth control appointments, 1 million pregnancy tests, and 900,000 cancer screenings."" In addition, the agency informed us that in 2013, only 9 of Planned Parenthood’s 64 affiliates provided prenatal services at 45 health centers nationwide. Additionally, 14 health centers provided childbirth classes. In other words, the 18,684 cited by the Susan B. Anthony List as receiving ""prenatal referrals"" reflect only the numbers from those 45 health centers. We asked the Susan B. Anthony List about Planned Parenthood’s response. ""The fact that Planned Parenthood refers pregnant women to ob-gyns and other health care centers just underscores our point that they don’t actually provide care for pregnant women and their babies,"" Quigley said. ""They could track that number if they chose, just like they track adoption referrals. Perhaps they will someday."" Quigley is right that Planned Parenthood could track the number of pregnant patients it sees, if it chose. Planned Parenthood told us that its records would not indicate a patient’s pregnancy status unless it was specified as the reason for the visit. Also worth considering is that Planned Parenthood’s numbers are self-reported, as PolitiFact affiliates have noted in previous fact-checks on similar claims. (In 2011, PolitiFact Ohio ruled False on a claim that 32 of every 33 pregnant women who visit Planned Parenthood get abortions. That same year, PolitiFact Florida ruled False on a claim that abortion services are ""well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does"".) Without knowing how many pregnant women Planned Parenthood sees at all its clinics, it is impossible to calculate what percentage abortions make up of the overall services to expectant mothers. But that’s what exactly what the Susan B. Anthony List did, reaching a flawed conclusion. Our ruling Bishop Thomas Tobin said that  ""... Abortions account for 94 percent  of the services provided for pregnant women by Planned Parenthood."" He cited as his source the Susan B. Anthony List, which arrived at that percentage using numbers that don’t represent all services provided to pregnant women by Planned Parenthood. Because Planned Parenthood says it doesn’t track that number, we don’t know what percentage of pregnant women seen by the agency receive abortions. But neither does the Susan B. Anthony -- nor Bishop Tobin. We rate his claim False.

"['Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Dave Brat']","
Brat: U.S. school spending up 375 percent over 30 years but test score remain flat
","U.S. Rep. Dave Brat wants to rein in federal funding for public education. Brat, R-7th, backs the Student Success Act, a GOP bill that would scale back Uncle Sam’s role in overseeing public schools and consolidate dozens of federal education programs. On Feb. 11, he introduced a successful amendment in the House Education and Workforce Committee that would require the U.S. Department of Education to issue annual reports recommending ways to save on school spending. Brat, a former college professor, expressed his thoughts in classical terms: ""The greatest thinkers of Western Civ. were not products of education policy,"" he said. ""Socrates trained Plato on a rock and then Plato trained Aristotle, roughly speaking, on a rock. So huge education funding is not necessary to achieve the greatest minds and the greatest intellects in history."" Five days later, Brat took to Facebook and posted his view in modern terms. ""Our own government statistics show that over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375%, but test scores have remained flat,"" he wrote. ""That proves that just throwing more money at education is not the solution."" We wondered whether Brat’s Facebook post is accurate, both in terms of the 30-year growth percentage for federal education funding and his characterization of test scores as ""flat."" Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Bratt, said the congressman’s statement was based on July 2012 testimony by Neal McCluskey before a U.S. Senate education subcommittee. McCluskey, is director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He said that federal education cuts mandated under sequestration -- Congress’s 2011 agreement to chop domestic and defense spending in return for raising the nation’s borrowing limit -- ""are both necessary and overdue."" McCluskey argued that increasing school funding has not improved student performance. Let’s take a closer look. Funding levels A reading of McCluskey’s testimony instantly turns up an inaccuracy in Brat’s statement.  McCluskey said the 375 percent increase, adjusted for inflation, occurred over a 40-year period from 1970 to 2010. Brat posted that the increase occurred over 30 years and didn’t offer dates. McCluskey cited White House figures showing federal outlays for elementary, secondary and vocational education were $2.9 billion in 1970 and rose to $73.3 billion in 2010. When adjusted for inflation, that comes to about a 375 percent increase. But there’s an issue with using 2010 as the end date for measuring the growth. U.S. education spending hit a record high in 2010, bolstered by more than $30 billion in special stimulus money Washington sent states in the wake of the Great Recession to help pay for schools. The stimulus program has stopped and during the last budget year -- ending Sept. 30, 2014 -- the U.S. spent $40.8 billion on education. Going back 30 years, as Brat did, puts us in 1984 when federal spending on schools was $6.5 billion. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 176 percent increase -- less than half of the congressman’s figure. Now, let’s throw in another factor: the number of students in publicly-funded schools across the nation increased from 39.2 million in 1984 to a projected 50 million in 2014. Federal spending per student rose from $165 in 1984 to about $816 in 2014. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 117 percent increase -- less than one-third of Brat’s figure. We should note that when we queried Brat’s office about the Feb. 16 Facebook post, spokesman Gottstein sent us a Feb. 11 news release in which the congressmen correctly said that the 375 increase in education spending took place over 40 years -- from 1970 to 2010.  The public, however, doesn’t have access to this detail. Brat’s congressional website doesn’t contain a copy of the release, but it does link to his Facebook post, which says ""over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent..."" We just used an ellipsis. So let’s look at the second part of Brat’s statement. Test scores Brat’s claim that test scores ""have been flat"" again comes from McCluskey’s 2012 Senate testimony. McCluskey said that between 1970 and 2010, math and reading scores on  National Assessment of Educational Progress tests, ""have been almost stagnant for 17-year-olds, the final product of our elementary and secondary system."" The NAEP, frequently called ""The Nation’s Report Card,"" refers to a variety of tests given every four years to fourth, eighth and twelfth graders in a sampling of states. McCluskey focused on the ""long-term trend"" test for 17-year-olds, which since the early 1970s has measured achievement on an unchanged set of math and reading skills. On the first NAEP reading test, in 1971, 17-year-olds had an average score of 285 on a scale of 500. On the most recent test, in 2012, the average was 287. On the first math test, in 1973, the average was 304 and that inched to 306 in 2012. The scores don’t change much if you measure them over the 30 years Brat mentions on Facebook. The average math score in 1982 was 298 and rose by eight points over the next three decades. The average reading score in 1984 -- the reading test wasn’t given in 1982 -- was 289 and fell by two points in 2012. Brat is hardly the first to call the results for 17-year-olds ""flat."" Education Week, a nationally-circulated periodical, used the same term in a 2009 headline to describe the history of NAEP scores for the age group. The chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee that year -- Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. -- called it ""deeply troubling"" that high schoolers were not making ""meaningful gains"" on the tests. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in 2014 that NAEP results underscore a need to ""reject educational stagnation in our high schools."" Many educators say the focus on average test results for all 17-year-olds overlooks significant gains by other groups and subgroups taking the NAEP. For example, from 1982-2012: Average math scores of 17-year-old blacks rose 16 points Average math scores of 17-year-old Hispanics rose 17 points Average math scores of all nine-year-olds rose 25 points Average math scores for all 13-year-olds rose 16 points. Our ruling Brat says that ""over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent, but test scores remain flat."" The inflation-adjusted figure Brat uses to describe what he sees as runaway federal spending on education over 30 years is overblown. You can only get near a 375 percent increase if you start in 1970 and end in 2010, when U.S. school funding was nearly doubled with stimulus money and stood at an all-time high of $73.3 billion. Uncle Sam spent $40.8 billion on public schools last year. When you divide that by enrollment, it comes to $816 a student. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 117 percent increase in federal spending per student over 30 years ago. That said, the increase in per-student spending is still significant and Brat has valid point on the test results. Average NAEP scores for 17-year-olds have barely budged during the last 30 years of testing. So we rate the totality of Brat’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974EB640>],/factchecks/2015/mar/02/dave-brat/brat-us-school-spending-375-percent-over-30-years-/

Graves right on the number, off on Keystone jobs context
","President Barack Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline killed ""42,000 jobs."" U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia in a press release on Tuesday, February 24th, 2015 President Barack Obama carried through with his threat to veto a bill approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline almost as soon as it hit his desk last week, and project supporters were equally quick to pounce. Among those criticizing the veto was U.S. Rep Tom Graves of Ranger, who accused Obama of ""putting partisan politics in front of all the families who would benefit from the good paying jobs"" resulting from the pipeline project. ""The president’s veto of 42,000 jobs is appalling,"" Graves said in a press release issued Tuesday, Feb. 24, the same day as the veto. Keystone XL supporters have long said thousands of new jobs would be created by the controversial project that has been in the works since 2008 and that could allow 800,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sand fields of Alberta, Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. PolitiFact has checked several pipeline-related jobs claims, rating at least three, including one from President Obama, as ""False"" on the Truth-O-Meter. We decided to check Graves’ statement as well . In January 2014, the State Department issued a report estimating that the pipeline project would support 42,000 jobs, most lasting no more than a year or two, while the pipeline was under construction. It also forecast that no more than 50 permanent jobs would be required to maintain the completed pipeline. In November 2014, we fact-checked a statement by Russ Girling, CEO of TransCanada, the company that wants to build the pipeline. Girling told a Sunday morning television talk show audience that the 42,000 jobs would be ""ongoing and enduring,"" a statement that earned him a False rating. A few months earlier, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner received a False rating for saying that the then-six-year delay in the project’s approval had cost Americans 100,000 jobs. He was citing a study that experts said was ""flawed"" and the company in charge of the project, TransCanada, said was ""no longer relevant."" The jobs comment that snagged the president came  in 2013. Obama told The New York Times that the ""most realistic estimates"" showed that the pipeline project would create ""maybe 2,000 jobs""  during construction. That statement was rated False, in part, because the White House did not provide any supporting evidence. In addition, the administration’s own State Department predicted the construction process would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said. For our fact-check of Graves’ statement, we reached out to his spokesman, Garrett Hawkins. We asked if it was fair to suggest that the pipeline bill is an issue of jobs for Americans if the outcome is, based on the State Department’s report, mostly short-term jobs and at best 50 permanent jobs. We also asked if Graves had evidence to suggest otherwise. We received a quick response back from Hawkins, saying; ""It is indisputable that President Obama’s own State Department said the Keystone XL pipeline will support more than 42,000 jobs."" He said Graves is ""pro-jobs, whether it’s one year of employment or a permanent position."" ""For the Americans who have suffered under President Obama’s economy and are desperate for work, a short-term job would likely be an answer to prayer and a springboard to another opportunity down the road,"" Hawkins said. ""It’s both strange and sad to see the far left belittle these jobs."" We should point out that in the past it’s been reported that about 10,000 of those jobs could last only four to eight months. We also should point out that Graves wasn’t the only member of Congress this week to issue a statement on the veto referencing the 42,000 jobs. We saw a statement from U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida's 27th congressional district, saying the pipeline had multiple good points: bringing the U.S. closer to total energy independence; advancing the country’s national security interests; creating around 42,000 jobs and adding more than $2 billion to the national economy. U.S. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik, a Republican from New York, issued a statement saying she was ‘incredibly disappointed’ in the presidential veto of a project that, she said, ""would create as many as 42,000 jobs and help lower energy prices for hard-working"" families in her district. So where does this leave us? Graves is correct when he says that Americans who are unemployed would jump at the chance at any job -- even one one that would last a year or two at best. Who is to say that job couldn’t be the springboard to another. But when the average person hears that a project has an $8 billion impact and will add 42,000 jobs -- they’re likely thinking that more than 50 of those jobs will be long-term. Yet that’s the State Department estimate -- no more than 50 of these 42,000 jobs will be needed once the pipeline is built. That’s a lot of context that readers are missing in Graves’ statement. Both Democrats and Republicans have spun the numbers on this issue to their advantage. And Graves continues to do that with his statement. Graves statement is accurate and misleading at the same time. He gets very close to a Mostly True on this one, but we thought enough context was missing to take it down a notch. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB5880>],/factchecks/2015/mar/02/tom-graves/graves-right-number-bit-keystone-jobs-context/

Boehner: Obama said '22 times' that he couldn't do immigration executive action
","Republican House leaders fanned out on the Sunday shows to defend a stop-gap measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security in their ongoing fight against President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration. They did not stray from talking points. TV audiences Sunday heard one specific number several times as hosts pressed the GOP lawmakers to justify the chaos over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. ""The president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did,"" House Speaker John Boehner said on CBS’ Face the Nation. Both Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise repeated the ""22 times"" talking point on NBC’s Meet the Press and Fox News Sunday, respectively. Even Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, one of 52 Republicans who opposed a three-week funding plan, used the figure to defend his House Freedom Caucus’ actions on CNN’s State of the Union. PolitiFact wanted to see where the number comes from and just how accurate it is. What we’re talking about The controversy stems from Obama’s Nov. 20, 2014, announcement that he would delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the country for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. More than 4 million people could qualify. An applicant could qualify for a work permit and avoid being deported for three years at a time if he or she can pass a background check and pay a fee. The decision is bound for higher court battles after a Texas federal judge issued a temporary injunction on the action, saying it may have violated procedural rules for using executive power. This action came on top of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012, an executive action to protect ""dreamers,"" or people brought here illegally as children and have not committed crimes. That move, too, was viewed by critics as an abuse of power, but supporters said it helped provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of residents. After Obama’s post-midterm elections announcement on immigration, Boehner’s office unleashed a Buzzfeed-style blog post detailing ""22 Times President Obama Said He Couldn’t Ignore or Create His Own Immigration Law."" What’s on Boehner’s list Our PolitiFact Texas colleagues dissected Boehner’s list for similar fact-checks of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the legal challenge of Obama’s actions when he was still attorney general. PolitiFact Texas tracked down each of the citations in Boehner’s post, comparing what they said Obama said with transcripts and news stories. In a nutshell, the majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we’ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren’t specific to immigration. We won’t go through every quote that supports Boehner’s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas: In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that ""as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,"" as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner’s list.) At a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: ""What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?"" Obama said: ""I've done everything that I can on my own."" (No. 14 on Boehner’s list.) In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. ""I’m not a king,"" Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. ""You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law."" (No. 16 on Boehner’s list.) So clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn’t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That’s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama’s claim that ""my position hasn’t changed"" as False. What should not be counted But also included on Boehner’s list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner’s list. In two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized ""signing statements"" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, ""I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there,"" in response to a question about ""don’t ask, don’t tell.""  (Nos. 1, 2 and 5.) In September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don’t have legal residency. But he hinted that there might be room within his authority, saying, ""what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources."" (No. 12 on Boehner’s list.) Obama’s July 2013 Univision interview hit similar notes when he was asked if he could grant amnesty to the undocumented population. He called for a legislative solution and said ""probably not,"" adding, ""I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus."" (No. 18 on Boehner’s list.) In August 2014, Obama told reporters he may ""scour our authorities to try to make progress"" without congressional cooperation. Obama said, ""We’re going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don’t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done."" (No. 22 on Boehner’s list.) Asked why Boehner continues to cite 22 examples, spokesman Michael Steel told PolitiFact ""we obviously stand by"" the count. Pressed to explain why, he said, ""Obviously, we're just going to agree to disagree about the ‘22 times’ figure, which we feel is accurate."" The bigger picture Whether the real number is 22, 15 or something less than that is more complicated by the specifics of Boehner’s claim. Boehner's claim is Obama said he couldn’t do ""what he eventually did."" Experts we talked to noted that Obama was not always so specific in the comments Boehner and his team cited. Boehner’s count factors in both instances of Obama talking about how he could not legalize or deport the entire undocumented population as well as more limited executive actions to relieve smaller populations. ""It gives me a headache,"" said Anna O. Law, a CUNY Brooklyn College political science professor, of the post, ""because they’re playing semantics."" Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration analyst, said he did not know what to make of the ""very political"" claim. Ultimately, much of it depends on your specific interpretation of each quote. Our ruling Boehner said, ""The president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did."" Boehner's broader point -- that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another -- is accurate. But he should refrain from the rhetorical flourish of saying Obama said it 22 times. We rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This item was updated on March 2, 2015, to better explain the ruling of a federal judge in Texas.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D6F5C0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/01/john-boehner/boehner-obama-said-22-times-he-couldnt-do-immigrat/

Boehner: Obama has taken unilateral action on health care '38 times'
","In making the case that President Barack Obama overstepped his bounds on immigration, House Speaker John Boehner pointed to another sore spot: Obamacare. ""It’s the president of the United States overreaching, and that’s just not on immigration. You know 38 times he made unilateral changes to Obamacare,"" Boehner said on CBS’ Face the Nation March 1. ""Many of these, I believe, far beyond his constitutional authority to do so."" PolitiFact looked into a similar claim about Obama’s actions on the Affordable Care Act in 2013, when Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., said Obama had made 19 changes to the health care legislation since it became law in 2010. We rated that claim Half True. So we wondered where Boehner got the 38 ""unilateral changes"" figure. Boehner’s staff pointed us to the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market principles in health care. A Feb. 25 article lists 48 changes to the Affordable Care Act, but they aren’t all unilateral -- meaning that weren’t made by the Obama administration without the input of the other branches of government. The Galen Institute’s list includes: Two changes because of Supreme Court decisions; 17 changes as the result of congressional action; 29 changes by the Obama administration. Among the unilateral actions by the administration, according to Galen: delays on insurance provider transparency requirements, choosing which mandates apply to U.S. territories, and delaying the policy sign-up deadline. Galen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner told PolitiFact that the think tank will soon update its unilateral action count to 30, with the administration’s recent decision to reduce cost-sharing. The law originally called for out-of-pocket maximums to be lowered for those between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, but the administration changed this provision to only apply to those between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty level. She added that the administration repeated three of the unilateral actions, bringing the count up to 33. And an August 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan government program, included five additional examples. All of these combined adds up to 38, Turner said. It’s worth noting, though, that the Congressional Research Service report does not count every single administrative change to the Affordable Care Act. Instead, it selectively chose the ""more significant actions that have been the subject of debate among health policy analysts and, in some instances, the target of criticism by opponents of the ACA."" So according to the report, there have been 12 significant ""delays, extensions"" or ""other actions taken by the administration."" The report says that the most controversial action has been the 2013 decision to delay enforcement of the employer mandate -- the requirement that employers with 50 or more employees must offer full-time workers affordable health insurance or pay a penalty -- to 2015. Larry Jacobs, chair of political studies at the University of Minnesota, said that in addition to the employer mandate delay, the most significant actions have been abandoning the long-term care program (CLASS) and the small employer program (SHOP). Of Galen’s more comprehensive list, most are technical changes, rather than policy changes, said James Thurber, director of American University’s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies. ""Most are insignificant administrative actions by (Health and Human Services),"" Thurber wrote in an email to PolitiFact. ""This is common under all presidents."" Our previous fact-check on this subject noted that Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit passed under President George W. Bush, was changed several times after its initial passage. For example, the Bush administration chose to extend the deadline and waive penalty fees for Medicare Part D enrollees. ""Presidents always use administration to find feasible, workable paths and to work their agenda,"" Jacobs said. ""Since Nixon and then Reagan, an ‘administrative presidency’ has emerged where presidents use their large administrative staff, agencies and departments to work their way."" Our ruling Boehner said Obama made ""unilateral changes"" to Obamacare ""38 times."" Boehner’s staff sent us a link to 29 unilateral actions, and it takes some creative picking and choosing to get the count up to 38 -- including counting two delays of the same regulation as separate actions. Further, the Congressional Research Service only considers 12 of these actions to be significant policy changes. Lastly, experts said administrative changes are a routine part of the lawmaking process and have occurred ""under all presidents."" Boehner’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708A900>],/factchecks/2015/mar/01/john-boehner/boehner-obama-has-taken-unilateral-action-health-c/

Texas Democrats say Rick Perry left more than 1 million Texans without affordable health care
","By not teaming with legislators, Rick Perry left many Texans without reasonable health care, a Democratic group says. The Texas Democratic Party popped this claim a day after the former governor and 2016 Republican presidential prospect told New Hampshire residents: ""People criticize us for having a large number of uninsured. That’s what Texans decided they wanted. They did not want government forcing everyone to buy insurance."" According to a Dallas Morning News blog post datelined Bedford, N.H., Perry was referring to Texas’ refusal, under his leadership, to create an insurance marketplace--leaving it to the federal government to do so--or to expand Medicaid as permitted under the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Javier Gamboa, the Democratic Party’s spokesman, reacted in a Feb. 12, 2015, press release: ""Perry should be ashamed of himself for saying that the people of Texas did not want increased coverage and expanded access to healthcare. More than one million hardworking Texans are living without affordable care because of his failure to partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap."" Is all of this so? Perry and legislators Perry won his last term as governor in 2010, the year the then-Democratic-controlled Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to mandate health coverage for most Americans. The law also permitted states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering related costs for three years. But Perry was adamant about Texas not expanding; in July 2012, he rejected the deal, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. And in 2013, the Republican-led Legislature, in accord with Perry, ""shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid,"" according to a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story. Texans in the 'coverage gap' So what is this ""coverage gap"" and how many Texans fall into it? In 2014, uninsured Texans earning 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level began to be offered subsidies to help buy insurance on an online healthcare exchange or marketplace. However, as the Statesman story said, Texas adults living below the poverty line—then $11,170 for an individual, $19,090 for a family of three—won no change in access. Some 947,000 uninsured Texas adults were living below the poverty line at the time, the story said. Varied estimates Mindful that figure is years old, we hunted fresh data. Replying to our requests for elaboration, the Democratic spokesman, Gamboa, pointed out news stories, including a January 2015 Associated Press news story stating: ""Texas leads the nation in uninsured, with nearly a quarter of the state’s population—6.4 million people—lacking health insurance."" That story said the Obamacare law ""mandates expanding Medicaid to residents with incomes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but a Supreme Court ruling left expansion up to each state and Texas said no. ""That created a ‘coverage gap’ of more than 1 million Texans who aren’t poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,"" the story said, ""but don’t earn enough to receive the law’s new subsidized health insurance."" But there also are other estimates. In particular, Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income residents, initially nudged by email that according to the center’s interactive Health & Wealth County Checkup website, nearly 1.2 million to nearly 1.3 million Texans fit the coverage gap. Drawing on an October 2013 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, itself rooted in Census Bureau surveys asking whether respondents had health insurance, the center reached a rough estimate of 1,151,410 to 1,208,090 Texans in the coverage gap. The foundation is a nonpartisan health policy research group, Also, the center notes, a February 2014 report by the Urban Institute, limited to estimates for major urban counties, supports the estimate of 1,293,100 Texans in the coverage gap. A November 2014 analysis Most recently, a November 2014 Kaiser report said that in states that do not expand Medicaid, many adults fall into a ‘coverage gap’ of having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits,"" meaning the Obamacare subsidies. The report, starting from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey results for 2014, offered this illustration of its estimated nearly 4 million citizens in the gap--one quarter of them, or 948,000, living in Texas--who would have been newly eligible for Medicaid if their state had expanded coverage: Source: Report, ""The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid – An Update,"" Kaiser Family Foundation, Nov. 12, 2014 (accessed Feb. 24, 2105) By email, Kaiser spokesman Chris Lee told us the 948,000 figure was the organization’s latest estimate of Texans lacking insurance who would be eligible for Medicaid if Texas agreed to expand access. Experts told us there is one other  way to use Census Bureau surveys to estimate Texans in the coverage gap. By email, a bureau demographer, Carla Medalia, guided us to results from the 2013 American Community Survey indicating that nearly 1.4 million Texans aged 18 through 64 were uninsured and living below the poverty level--meaning they weren’t eligible either for Medicaid in Texas or for Obamacare subsidies; they’re potential gappers. Dunkelberg cautioned, though, that the bureau figures don’t filter out residents living in the country without legal authorization or legal immigrants here less than five years; members of both subgroups would be ineligible for Medicaid. On balance of late, Dunkelberg said, she’s been saying around 1 million Texans fall into the gap. Affordable care? Next, we wondered if individuals in the gap live without affordable care, as the Democrats said. Nationally, the Kaiser report offered its read of what kinds of Americans fit the coverage gap. ""While nearly half of people in the coverage gap report that their health is excellent or very good, nearly a fifth (18%) report that they are in fair or poor health,"" the report said. ""These individuals have known health problems that likely require medical attention."" The report also recapped whether individuals in the gap otherwise reported having access to coverage, perhaps through a family member’s job. ""The work status of people in the coverage gap indicates that there are limited coverage options available for people in this situation,"" the report said. ""Two-thirds (66%) of people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker, and 54% are working themselves,"" the report said. ""While workers could potentially have an offer of coverage through their employer, the majority of workers in the coverage gap (51%) work for small firms (<50 employees) that will not be subject to ACA penalties for not offering coverage. Further, many firms do not offer coverage to part-time workers. A majority of workers in the coverage gap also work in industries with historically low insurance rates, such as the agriculture and service industries. More than a third (34%) of adults in the coverage gap are in a family with no workers."" Our ruling The Democratic Party said more than 1 million Texans live without affordable health care because Perry failed to ""partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap."" Per the latest estimates, it’s safe to say around a million Texas adults fall into the coverage gap for making too little money to qualify for insurance subsidies and also remaining ineligible for Medicaid unless Texas expands access as encouraged by the Obamacare law and rejected by Perry and the state’s ruling Republicans. Less certain is what kind of care is available to those people in the gap and how affordable it might be for them. We rate this statement, which lacked clarification, Mostly True.

Gov. Gina Raimondo says Rhode Island invests less in economic development than four of its neighbors
 ","Sometimes, when it comes to Rhode Island's economy, it seems as though the state's motto should be, ""There's nowhere to go but up!"" Gov. Gina Raimondo emphasized the state's economic problems during a Feb. 18 presentation where she focused on some ""alarming"" economic numbers reflecting Rhode Island's troubled economy. Many of the statistics were all too familiar. The Ocean State has one of the highest unemployment rates in the United States, some of the slowest job growth in the country, and one in six people on food stamps. But the 10th slide in her PowerPoint presentation caught our attention. The headline asserts: ""We haven't invested strategically in areas that spur job creation."" The numbers she cites show that Rhode Island is last compared with Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey in statewide tourism spending, the size of our economic development agency budget and the number of economic development agency personnel. Rhode Island is the nation’s smallest state in area,  but not in population. We wondered if the ranking would look different if Raimondo had taken that into consideration. We found that it did. We’ll look at each category separately. TOURISM: According to Raimondo, Rhode Island spent just $470,000 on tourism. New Jersey, which spends the least of those other states, spent $9 million. Massachusetts and Connecticut spend $15 million and $13 million respectively, she said. Based on those numbers and the latest state-by-state census data, that's 45 cents per Rhode Island resident. That would be less than half of what New Jersey spends ($1.01) and much less than Massachusetts ($2.24), New York ($3.05) and Connecticut ($3.62). The $470,000 number comes from a Dec. 2, 2014 report from the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, which said Rhode Island spent $468,230 on statewide tourism promotion during the 2014 fiscal year. But that amount fails to include the $6.5 million from Rhode Island's hotel room tax that went to the state's six regional tourism organizations, including $2.5 million to Discover Newport and $1.9 million to the Providence-Warwick Convention and Visitor's Bureau. Smaller amounts, based on their hotel occupancy, go to South County, Blackstone Valley and Block Island. (Similarly, the Massachusetts total given by Raimondo's office fails to include the additional $6 million spent for regional tourism.) If you fold in that money -- and it's all supposed to go toward promoting tourism in at least some portion of the state -- Rhode Island actually spends $6.63 per person on tourism, more than Massachusetts ($3.27) and Connecticut ($3.56). Among the other New England states, only Maine spends more, at $6.98 per resident. The report doesn't contain comparable data for New York and New Jersey, the other two states used in the Raimondo comparison. When we asked Raimondo's office why those regional tourism expenses were ignored, Raimondo spokeswoman Marie Aberger said ""spending money promoting South County or Blackstone Valley does not build a brand for Rhode Island in the same way as spending money promoting Rhode Island. We have tourism assets throughout the state (beaches, restaurants, vineyards, historical sites, art museums) and should be attracting people to visit Rhode Island through a smart, coordinated, statewide approach."" ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY: Aberger cautioned in an email that ""comparisons among state economic development entities are difficult because every state organizes its economic development apparatus differently. Rhode Island currently has one major economic development organization—the RI Commerce Corporation—while other states have multiple major entities."" For the sake of argument, we'll stick with the numbers the governor's office chose to use. New Jersey, according to Raimondo, had a $29-million economic development agency budget, the lowest of the four states she compared us with. That's still seven times more than Rhode Island, at $4 million. Massachusetts spent $80 million. But, once again, adjusting for population tells a very different story. When you factor population into the mix, Raimondo's statistic looks very different. Rhode Island spent $3.80 per person, which was more than New Jersey ($3.26) and New York ($3.56) but less than Connecticut ($11.40) or Massachusetts ($11.95). ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYEES: Finally, if you look at the number of people working on economic development in those various state agencies, Rhode Island has 33 employees per million residents, more than the other four states. (Connecticut has 28 per million, Massachusetts and New Jersey have 22 each and New York has 16. It turns out that the total number of New Jersey employees -- 200 -- is a guesstimate. According to New Jersey's website, 257 worked for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, but 87 are in the Office of Recovery, part of the effort to disburse aid from Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Aberger said the estimate came from ""an expert who served in a leadership role"" at the agency, whom she did not name. Finally, when we asked Raimondo's office why the governor's statistics were not adjusted for population size, spokeswoman Aberger sent us this statement: ""There are certain baseline costs and functions required to run an effective development agency whether a state is big or small (for example, you would not compare the size of staff in the Governor’s Office in Rhode Island to the size of the Governor’s Office in California adjusted for population size because there are certain baseline positions needed regardless of the size of the state).  Because these numbers should not be compared 1 to 1, overall numbers were presented. While it is fair to suggest larger states should have larger staffs and budgets, we certainly shouldn’t be as far behind as we are. In addition, Massachusetts and Connecticut are our neighbors – so we need to compete regardless of the population size."" Our ruling Governor Raimondo said that compared with Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, Rhode Island has invested less in tourism, economic development and economic development personnel. That's true in terms of the raw numbers. But if you include all tourism spending and adjust for population size, Rhode Island isn't at the bottom of the pack at all. If you look at economic development, the state has more employees per capita than any of those four other states. It's spending more money on economic development per capita than New Jersey and New York. And its total tourism budget, based on the report Raimondo's office supplied us, is higher than Massachusetts and Connecticut. It's only when you look at funds devoted to promoting Rhode Island as a state and exclude the much larger sums to promote Newport, Providence and other areas that we come in last per capita. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Erpenbach, who opposes a Wisconsin right-to-work bill introduced earlier the same day, did a Facebook posting that raised this question: Would the bill -- the object of scorn among some employee unions but almost certain to become law -- affect the beloved Green Bay Packers? As we found in an analysis of polling on right to work, there is a general lack of knowledge among the public about right-to-work laws, which block companies and workers from signing labor contracts that require employees to pay union dues. Of course, in contrast, most folks in Wisconsin know an awful lot about, and have plenty of passion for, the Packers. Indeed, one of the Capitol protesters carried a sign that read: ""R-T-W Kills The Green Bay Packers Union."" So, is Erpenbach right? Let's start by noting that players for the Green Bay Packers and the other National Football League teams must join the NFL Players Association. (Although, like members of similar unions, they can request refunds for the portion of their dues that are used for political purposes, as opposed to the cost of operating the union.) Under Wisconsin’s right-to-work bill, which Gov. Scott Walker has said he would sign, the Packers players could opt not to join the union. Erpenbach's Facebook posting was a two-paragraph memo written by an attorney with the Wisconsin Legislative Council about the Republican-backed right to work bill. The council is a nonpartisan state agency that responds to legal and policy research questions from lawmakers. ""Sen. Erpenbach asked whether these provisions of the bill apply to employees of professional sports teams in Wisconsin, such as the Green Bay Packers, and the labor organizations representing those employees,"" the memo concluded. ""In general, it appears that the provisions likely apply to such employees and labor organizations."" The author of the memo, Jessica Karls-Ruplinger, confirmed to us that that was her conclusion. And Marquette University law professor Paul Secunda, who directs the law school’s labor and employment law program, told us he agrees that the bill would apply to pro athletes and their unions. But Secunda, a self-described vocal opponent of right to work and an avid sports fan, said he believes the Wisconsin measure would hurt many Wisconsin workers. But it is ""likely not to have impact on professional sport unions,"" he said. That's true for several reasons, he said: Those unions are small and their solidarity is strong; union dues are a tiny percentage of player salaries; the unions have won many things for players, such as pensions and minimum salaries; Moreover, even in long-term right-to-work states such as Georgia, there have never been instances of players on a wide scale opting not to pay union dues. A spokesman for the NFL Players Association, which is part of the AFL-CIO, didn’t respond to our calls. The union did issue a statement opposing the bill, saying ""devoted food and commercial workers who spend their Sundays servicing our players and fans at Lambeau Field will have their well-being and livelihood jeopardized by right to work."" And in an interview with the Capital Times of Madison, the union’s executive director, DeMaurice Smith, also didn’t raise such concerns. Twelve of the NFL's 32 teams are in states that have right-to-work laws, which means players in those states can't be compelled to pay union dues to keep their job, the article said. But Smith said that hasn't been a significant issue for the union, according to the article. (Unions representing Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League each issued statements that echoed the views of the NFLPA. But like the NFLPA statement, neither expressed concerns for the players unions themselves.) Erpenbach, meanwhile, told us he requested the memo because most of the discussion about Wisconsin’s right to work bill had centered on trade unions and he wondered if it would apply to pro athletes. But the lawmaker acknowledged he didn't know whether the bill would have any practical effects on the Packers players or their union. Our rating Erpenbach said: ""In general, it appears"" Wisconsin’s right to work bill would ""likely apply to"" the Green Bay Packers players and their union. The nonpartisan state Legislative Council arrived at that conclusion -- though, as a practical matter, it’s not clear the bill would have any noticeable effect on the players union. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

"['Labor', 'Wisconsin', 'Kurt Bauer']","
Business leader says 95 percent of union-worker training money comes from employers
","Listening to supporters and opponents of right to work laws talk about worker training -- and who pays for it -- can be a mind-bending experience. They talk right past each other. That was the case at a Feb. 10, 2015, discussion about right to work sponsored by the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. The panel featured Kurt Bauer, leader of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby, and Steve Lyons, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Contractor Coalition. Bauer and his group back right to work. Lyons and his group, which includes about 400 firms in construction contracting, are opposed. Lyons noted that many skilled trades such as carpenters, plumbers and operating engineers provide training to their members at union-run centers across the state -- and argued such training would be hurt if the state passes a right-to-work law. Union members ""gave $30 million to these facilities,"" last year, Lyons said. ""From the training perspective, it’s great that some of these unions do train -- not all of them do -- the trades do,"" Bauer countered. ""But it’s paid for by employers. That won’t change -- 95 percent comes from employers."" Bauer then added: ""That’s one for PolitiFact."" Lyons replied: ""Absolutely. Bring it on."" We are here to serve. Is Bauer right that 95 percent of the money used for union-operated worker training centers comes from employers? More about the programs This is all tied into the right to work debate because worker training, particularly in the trades areas, is expensive. It’s also important to ensure that quality and safety standards are met and maintained. These are the folks building houses and highways, for instance. And much of the training is done at union-operated worker training centers around the state. Since trades workers are typically the ones affected by this provision, understanding how those unions work is key to this issue. Picture a construction project that requires iron workers. Contractors on the project may tap a union to provide iron workers for the job, but those workers are not permanent employees of the contractor. They may work on a building project one day, and switch to a bridge project the next. Thus, training programs have grown up around the unions. A right to work law would mean workers no longer would be required to pay dues to a union. The concern, as cited by Lyons, is that over time this could mean fewer union members and therefore less money available for training. He takes it a step further and notes the training would then have to be done by the state’s taxpayer-supported technical colleges. Bauer’s claim is that this is largely irrelevant, since nearly all the money for training comes not from unions, but employers. The reality is more complicated. Unions decide each year how to allocate the training money deducted from their paychecks. Think of it in terms of a payroll deduction for, say, a flexible spending account, parking or some other item. It may be handled administratively by the employer, but the money is the employee’s to spend. ""The money is held by the companies and then given to the various union training funds,"" said Tim Peterson, vice president of James Peterson Sons Inc., a fourth-generation highway construction contractor based in Medford. ""However, active members of the trade unions allocate money out of their negotiated pay to fund the training trust funds."" A member of the Contractor Coalition, Peterson agreed that the money starts with the employers, usually as a set amount per hour of pay. But the workers decide how the money is used, he said, adding: ""If employees elect to reduce or stop directing money to the training funds, those dollars will go to increase the employees’ wages and will not be redirected to the employers."" End of story? Not quite. Scott Manley, vice president of governmental relations for WMC, said the best evidence the training money comes from employers is the tax returns filed by the nonprofit entities that the unions use to manage the training money. ""According to tax forms filed by unions with the IRS, businesses pay about 95% of the operating cost for union training programs,"" Manley said in an email. ""Although the amount paid may be negotiated with the unions who do the training … it is businesses that actually make the payment."" Manley added: ""Employers pay to have workers trained because it is in their best interest to have skilled employees."" Right to work laws, he added, ""will not change employers’ need for skilled labor or their willingness to pay for it."" Howard H. Simon, an accountant with the Chicago-based Calibre CPA Group, the company that prepared the tax returns for the job training fund, took a different view of the tax documents. He provided a list of about three dozen state-based training funds, and the sources of the money. One example: The Appleton-Oshkosh Electrical Workers Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. The list ""demonstrates that employees of the various trade organizations listed contributed over $31 million to their training funds (in a one-year period),"" Simon said in a memo to Lyons.   ""It’s a private contract…between the private sector business and the private sector union,"" Lyons said. ""And it’s a voluntary contract. And in those contracts ... the individual employees determine how much they’re going to give."" Our rating Bauer says that employers pay 95 percent of the cost of union workers to receive training. That may be true in a technical sense, and on an IRS form, but it’s not that simple. The money in question belongs to the workers -- it’s part of their compensation. And they decide how to allocate it each year. The statement contains some element of truth but leaves out important information that would lead to a different impression. In our book, that’s Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A8E40>],/factchecks/2015/feb/27/kurt-bauer/business-leader-says-95-percent-union-worker-train/
"['Georgia', 'Public Health', 'Veterans', 'Johnny Isakson']","
Rate, not just number, helps explain vet suicide risk
","Georgia’s senior U.S. senator took control of the U.S. Senate Veteran Affairs Committee in January, and within a month, had bipartisan support for a bill aimed at improving mental health care for veterans. Johnny Isakson noted the broad support for the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention For American Veterans Act in an Associated Press article just days before it cleared the Senate and headed to President Barack Obama’s desk. ""When you have 8,000 veterans a year committing suicide, then you have a serious problem,"" Isakson said. That statistic – based on the math that an average of 22 military veterans take their lives every day – is often repeated by the same broad groups. The AP story that quotes Isakson also cites it. But just how accurate is the figure? PolitiFact Georgia already tackled the problems with the figure in a fact check about ""solider suicides"" made by Democratic Congressman David Scott, who represents part of metro Atlanta. Now that the bill is law, the government will repay student loans for psychiatrists who join the Department of Veterans Affairs and also will develop peer support groups and community outreach with veterans’ service groups. So what about those veterans? The figures in question come from a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs report released in 2013, based on the most extensive data the agency has collected on veterans’ suicide. The study examined death certificates in 21 states, to conclude that veterans accounted for 22 percent of suicides. Applying that percentage to about 38,000 suicides in the United States annually that translates to about 8,300 veteran suicides, or 22 a day. However, it’s important to acknowledge the study looked only at 21 states. Georgia was not among them. The death certificates themselves also were imprecise. The report itself acknowledges that about 5 percent of a sub-group of the sample were misidentified as veterans or non-veterans, when checked against VA records. In other words, the figures are an estimate. Although the study was the first analysis of its kind, it does not offer an actual count of the number of veterans who take their own lives. A study published this month does finally offer a specific number, at least for recent veterans. The study published in the February issue of Annals of Epidemiology matched military records of nearly 1.3 million active-duty veterans who served between 2001 and 2007 with the National Death Index. It found 1,868 suicides through the end of 2009. That translates into a rate of one suicide per day for that specific group of recent veterans. So which is accurate -- estimates of 22 suicides daily among all veterans or 1 a day for recent vets? Most likely, both, said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist who specializes in military suicides at the National Institute of Mental Health. Not that either number matters, without a frame of reference. And that’s where it gets tricky. Schoenbaum points out 22 or 1 are simply numbers. Their significance is meaningless, until they are applied to how they stack up against comparable non-veterans suicides. There, the data is far more clear. Suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in the United States, with a rate of 12.6 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Both studies, the estimate for all veterans and the actual count of recent veterans, show a much higher rate for veterans. The VA study shows a rate that is 20 percent higher than the civilian population. The most recent study is even more alarming, showing a 50 percent higher rate, with 29.5 deaths per 100,000 veterans. ""To say 22 veterans a day, 8,000 veterans a year, commit suicide, it’s a defensible statistic,"" Schoenbaum said. ""When people ask me about suicide risk in veterans, I don’t talk about that. I talk about rates,"" he continued. ""The general insight there is yes, there is something about the veteran population that is leading them to have higher rates of suicide than other people. And I believe we have a national obligation to help them."" Isakson said he knew of ""shortcomings"" in the VA data but said the estimates were the best available when he spoke during committee hearings. He made the issue a priority when he took over the committee, he said, because of the need for more attention and information on the issue. ""The intent is to have a number that can reflect that this is an alarming rate, and we must address it, given our obligation to all veterans,"" Isakson said. The $22 million in funding is designed to pay that debt, as federal agencies work to compile more accurate data. The VA is working with the Department of Defense, to assemble the Suicide Data Repository, Schoenbaum said. Like the latest study, it will pair death records to military and healthcare records, but for all veterans. ""The reason to do these calculations, to track this data, is to first see if there is a problem. Now we know, there is,"" he said. ""The next step is to process where it is. Who is at risk? Why? That requires more data that we don’t yet have."" And the information we do have? Isakson said 8,000 veterans are taking their own lives every year. The number comes from a VA study that is statistically reliable, if somewhat lacking context. It is the context that matters here. The number fails to impart the fact that research shows veterans commit suicide at a higher, perhaps much higher, rate than their civilian counterparts. Isakson was correct on the numbers. But there is a bit of context missing in what those numbers mean. We rate Isakson's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809660B580>],/factchecks/2015/feb/27/johnny-isakson/rate-not-just-number-helps-explain-vet-suicide-ris/

Mother Jones reporter at center of Bill O'Reilly story: O'Reilly 'often' praised me
","Mother Jones writer David Corn finds himself in the crosshairs of Bill O’Reilly after Corn and Daniel Schulman wrote that O’Reilly embellished his personal experiences covering the Falklands War in Argentina. Corn's initial story said O'Reilly claimed he reported in a ""war zone"" when he was not. O'Reilly disputed the story and called Corn ""an irresponsible guttersnipe."" We’ll leave it to you to decide who to believe in that he-said, he-said. But we were struck by something Corn said during an appearance on the Feb. 25, 2015, Rachel Maddow Show. Apparently, Corn once worked for Fox News, and he and O’Reilly were something of pals. Here’s how Corn put it: ""I’ve watched Bill O’Reilly over the years. In fact I used to work there from 2001 to 2008, and was often on Bill’s show and often was praised by Bill, not as a liar but as a good reporter. But that was then. This is now."" Corn said. That’s an interesting little nugget in this media story that we thought was worth verifying. As it turns out, when Corn was the Washington editor of The Nation, a long standing left-of-center publication, he had a contract with Fox News and played the role of arch liberal against the network’s roster of conservative voices. We went to the Nexis transcript database to see how many times Corn appeared and what O’Reilly said about him. Corn appeared on Fox News at least 60 times. Six of those appearances came on O’Reilly’s The O’Reilly Factor (May 3, 2002; Nov. 18, 2002; Jan. 15, 2003; March 4, 2003; April 7, 2003; and April 20, 2007). Six appearances over five years is hardly often, but what did O’Reilly have to say about Corn? We found one occasion when O’Reilly explicitly praised Corn’s reporting. In November 2002, a few months before the Iraq War, Corn wrote that a small socialist group called the Worker’s World Party had played a key role in organizing a large anti-war demonstration. O’Reilly clearly valued journalism that revealed a tie between the protest march and a group that O’Reilly called ""hardcore commies."" ""All right, Mr. Corn, good reporting,"" O’Reilly said. ""Nobody else reported that. And we appreciate it."" That was as effusive as O’Reilly ever got with Corn. The two men always sparred aggressively, transcripts show. A couple of weeks before the start of the Iraq War, Corn argued that the evidence was thin that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that the United States was ill prepared for the aftermath of an invasion. O’Reilly said an invasion was worth the risk, but at the end, appreciated Corn for his feistiness. ""Mr. Corn, we appreciate your point of view. Thanks for coming in, and standing up,"" he said. After the war began, Corn appeared again to challenge O’Reilly’s belief that papers like the New York Times slanted their headlines to make the fight look tougher for American forces than it actually was. As the segment clock ran down, O’Reilly threw it back to Corn. ""David, because we like you as a guest, give you the last word. You've got 15 seconds. Go,"" O’Reilly said. On one occasion O’Reilly called Corn ""a left-wing, liberal, pinko communist,"" a remark that Corn took in good humor. Once, O’Reilly accused Corn of intellectual dishonesty. O’Reilly also described Corn and journalist Robert Scheer in 2006 as ""bomb throwers"" and ""very far-left individuals."" We spoke to the Mother Jones public affairs director, shared the results of our Nexis search and asked if there were any other details we should know. We did not hear back and will post an update if we do. Our ruling Corn said that before this current brouhaha with O’Reilly, he appeared often on O’Reilly’s show and was often praised by the Fox News host. Corn’s use of the word ""often"" wouldn’t pass the eye test of most fact-checkers. While Corn was a guest on Fox News programs many times, he had just six appearances with O’Reilly between 2001 and 2008, transcripts show. And as for praise, O’Reilly explicitly did so once. A few other times O’Reilly expressed his satisfaction with Corn as a spokesman for a liberal perspective. But he also described him as bomb thrower and very far-left individual. Corn’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Conservative group claims Hillary Clinton's foundation took millions from foreign governments
","A group founded by Karl Rove launched one of the first salvos of the 2016 presidential election cycle with a Web video attacking presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. American Crossroads released a video Feb. 23 that features audio of a speech from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat from the party’s progressive wing, warning that ""powerful interests have tried to capture Washington and rig the system in their favor."" The video shows photos of Clinton meeting with various foreign delegates and leaders. Text on the screen alleges that ""the Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments"" including ""up to $5 million"" from the United Arab Emirates and ""up to $25 million"" from Saudi Arabia. We should note off the bat that Warren's remarks were ripped from two separate speeches aimed at limiting money from corporations and Super PACs in politics, and they were merged together and cut in such a way to eliminate those references. They certainly weren't about Clinton or foundations or foreign governments. Still, we wanted to check whether Bill and Hillary Clinton's foundation has indeed received large sums of money from foreign governments. Former President Bill Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001 as a nonprofit philanthropy for global development. The organization partners with government, non-government organizations and businesses to tackle quality-of-life issues, such as AIDS, poverty and climate change. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. According to a memorandum of understanding, the foundation could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If contributions from those countries increased significantly or a new foreign government wanted to make a donation, the State Department would have to first approve (more on that in a bit). We should emphasize there is nothing illegal about the contributions. Candidates for office are prohibited by law from accepting campaign contributions from foreign governments, but foundations have no such restriction. The main issue is that the foundation presented ethical quandaries when Clinton was a candidate for president in 2008 and when she was Secretary of State. But at this time, the foundation was her husband’s project, not hers. That changed when Clinton left the State Department. In 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising. Throughout the years, donors have included celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz, businesses like eBay and Pepsi, and other nonprofits, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And, yes, some governments. So which countries and foreign governments have donated to her organization? Not just Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it turns out. We pulled the information from the Clinton Foundation website, which tracks donors by contribution range. As it is, we don’t have exact amount for each donation, nor do we know when the contribution was made — except donations made in 2014, which were marked on the site. Here’s what we found. Due to search constraints on the Clinton Foundation’s website and the vast number of small donations, we’re only including contributions larger than $25,000. Foreign government Amount Tenerife Island government $25,000 to $50,000 Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah $25,000 to $50,000 Government of Jamaica $50,000 to $100,000 Kingdom of Bahrain $50,000 to $100,000 Federal Republic of Germany $100,000 to $250,000 Embassy of Algeria $250,000 to $500,000 Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada $250,000 to $500,000 Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office $500,000 to $1,000,000 State of Qatar $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 Government of Brunei Darussalam $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 Sultanate of Oman $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 United Arab Emirates $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 UK Department for International Development $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 Commonwealth of Australia $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 Government of the Netherlands $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 State of Kuwait $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 Australian Agency for International Development $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 Government of Norway $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 Kingdom of Saudi Arabia $10,000,000 to $25,000,000   Of the 25 donors that have contributed more than $5 million to the Clinton Foundation throughout the years, six are foreign governments. Six of the 19 countries listed above made donations to the Clinton Foundation in 2014: Germany, Canada, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Australia and Saudi Arabia. It’s not clear whether those governments had donated previously, and if so, how much of their donation came last year. So the assertion at the center of the ad is accurate: the Clinton Foundation did, in fact, take millions from foreign governments. Additionally, the ad singled out two countries — the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia — that have donated to the foundation since Hillary Clinton officially joined her family’s foundation. Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said most of the money from foreign countries is earmarked for specific projects and grants, like AIDS relief. Minassian said that the ad implied nefarious dealings, and that isn’t the case. ""I just have a problem with the premise of the ad,"" Minassian said. ""It’s the same premise when people say we’re the same as a Super PAC. We’re not; we’re philanthropy. This is what NGOs do."" Readers can decide for themselves how they feel about the charge. We’re just checking the fact behind the ad. American Crossroads did not respond to a voicemail and emails. We should note that since the ad came out, and while we were reporting this story, the Washington Post reported that the contribution from Algeria, that had never donated previously, came while Clinton was Secretary of State and was not approved by the State Department. Minassian said the donation from Algeria was related to Haiti relief efforts, and that, per the agreement with the White House, ""the State Department should have been formally informed."" ""As the Clinton Foundation did with all donations it received for earthquake relief, the entire amount of Algeria's contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti,"" Minassian said. ""This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since."" Our ruling An American Crossroads web ad claimed, ""the Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments"" including ""up to $5 million"" from the United Arab Emirates and ""up to $25 million"" from Saudi Arabia. As we noted, it doesn’t violate campaign rules for a nonprofit philanthropy to accept donations from foreign governments. Over the years, the Clinton Foundation has taken millions of dollars from foreign governments. This includes between $1 million and $5 million from the United Arab Emirates and between $10 million and $25 million from Saudi Arabia. At least a portion of those donations came in 2014, after Clinton left the State Department and formally joined the family’s foundation that had previously been in her husband’s name alone.

"['New Hampshire', 'Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Ann McLane Kuster']","
Did Kuster flip flop when voting for 'CRomnibus'?
","Evoking the old cliche about lawmaking and sausage, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster faces questions about whether she changed her stance on two votes, going one way when faced with a pair of stand-alone bills and the other way after those measures were wrapped in a much larger package. The dispute involves two policy measures tacked onto a massive spending bill known as the ""CRomnibus."" That bill, passed in December 2014 by the outgoing Congress, approved enough money to keep the federal government in operation through September 2015. One of the ""riders"" – that is, unrelated amendments – rolled back some of the protections enacted after the Wall Street bailouts in 2008 by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The other amended the Federal Election Campaign Act to increase the amount of money that individual donors can contribute to national political party committees. The White House urged Congress to approve the bill despite continued objection to those two provisions. The two U.S. House members from New Hampshire split their votes on the bill. Then-Rep. Carol Shea Porter, a Democrat, voted against the spending measure, while Ann Kuster, also a Democrat, voted for it. In an interview with the Concord Monitor in January, Kuster said she didn’t agree with the riders but felt it was her duty as a member of Congress to keep the government running. She said it was bad form to make such policy changes in an appropriations bill, and she wished she’d been given the chance to vote against them without risking a government shutdown in the process, she said. ""As standalone bills, I would be opposed,"" she said. We wondered: Has Kuster ever had the opportunity to vote on those issues outside the context of a spending bill? On the campaign finance issue, Kuster co-sponsored a bill in the days after the interview to undo the changes adopted in the spending bill that increased the amount of money a single donor can give to national party committees each year. (The spending bill raised the limits from $97,200 to as much as $777,600.) So while she hasn’t voted contrary to the campaign-finance rider in the past, she acted almost immediately to undo what was passed in the spending bill. This gives her claim a ring of truth. On bolstering the provisions of Dodd-Frank, however, Kuster’s record is mixed. Recently, she’s defended the law, but in earlier votes, she supported softening some of its provisions. In October 2013, for instance, Kuster voted in favor of a bill to repeal a provision of Dodd-Frank that would require banks to keep risky investments away from holdings that receive government backing through federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve discount window lending. The legislation, called the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act and co-sponsored by Reps. Randy Hultgren, an Illinois Republican, and Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat (and former vice president of Goldman Sachs), would have eliminated a prohibition against certain types federal assistance to swaps entities. The measure passed the House Financial Services Committee in February 2012 and made it to the House Agriculture committee – on which Kuster sits – in March 2013. (The bill went before the agriculture committee because the risk involved in loans to farmers is often mitigated through commodity-based derivatives.) Kuster was among the 31 representatives on the committee to vote for the bill in committee, while 14 lawmakers disagreed. Then, the bill came before the full house as H.R. 992 in October 2013. Kuster was among 70 Democrats who joined 222 Republicans to pass the bill. All told, 119 Democrats – including Shea-Porter – and three Republicans opposed the measure on the floor. This bill was never heard in the Senate, but much of its substance was eventually folded into the CRomnibus. In addition, Kuster was among a minority of Democrats last September who supported a bill to exempt a segment of the market for derivatives from Dodd-Frank’s new rules. Only after the November election, in which Democrats lost seats, did Kuster join all but 29 Democrats in January when she voted against the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. The legislation was essentially the same as the September bill, along with a two-year delay of a provision that would restrict banks from  making certain kinds of speculative investments. Kuster and other Democrats proposed 14 amendments to that bill – hers was to strike the delay altogether – but House rules, which heavily favor the majority, didn’t allow them to be taken up on the floor. Kuster’s camp acknowledged she voted for the swaps amendment and other measures related to Dodd-Frank. ""She has voted in the past, through standard House procedure, for bills that would improve the Dodd-Frank law by addressing parts of the law that could unintentionally harm middle class families and main street small businesses,"" Kuster spokeswoman Rosie Hilmer said. It’s worth noting that the securities and investment industry was one of the most prominent contributors to Kuster’s campaign in 2014, according to the nonpartisan campaign-finance clearinghouse OpenSecrets.com. With $143,041 in donations from that sector, she trumped her opponent, Marilinda Garcia, by nearly three times over. She also raised more than three times as much from that sector as Shea-Porter, the Democrat running for New Hampshire’s other House seat, and Republican Frank Guinta, who beat Shea-Porter to win that seat. Kuster raised $90,000 more from the securities and investment industry in her 2014 campaign than she did in her 2012 campaign. Our ruling Kuster says she has opposed measures to weaken campaign-finance restrictions and financial-services protections when they were offered as stand-alone bills. She can make a plausible case on campaign finance, but her record on financial-services protections is more mixed. Early on, she voted for several measures that would weaken the Dodd-Frank act; only recently has she taken a firm stance against efforts to ease provisions of Dodd-Frank. Her statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate Kuster’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C0C400>],/factchecks/2015/feb/26/ann-mclane-kuster/did-kuster-flip-flop-when-voting-cromnibus/
