Do hunters contribute more than $500 million to West Virginia's economy?
","In a tweet that preceded West Virginia’s buck firearm season, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice encouraged West Virginians to purchase a hunting license. In the tweet, he offered an economic rationale -- that hunting is an economic engine for the state. In the Nov. 5 tweet, Justice wrote, ""I've said it before and I'll say it again, hunting is really something that can help our economy grow! Hunters contribute more than $500 million to our state each year and help support a lot of jobs. Get a license today at http://wvhunt.com . #WV #WVHunt."" I've said it before and I'll say it again, hunting is really something that can help our economy grow! Hunters contribute more than $500 million to our state each year and help support a lot of jobs. Get a license today at https://t.co/burilhQECG. #WV #WVHunt pic.twitter.com/btBNdz4TR6 State offices have thrown around the figure more than once. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources sent a tweet on Nov. 24 that used the same dollar figure, adding that deer hunters in particular ""spend an estimated $230 million in West Virginia, much of it in the rural areas of the state."" We wondered: Do bucks, and other game, really bring the state 500 million bucks? When we contacted Justice’s office, Jordan Damron, the governor’s assistant legal counsel and digital director, cited it to the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. A Nov. 14 press release from the division includes the $500 million figure and said that ""hunting is estimated to be responsible for 5,400 jobs and $35 million in sales taxes on goods and services spent in West Virginia."" The news release said the numbers came from Southwick Associates, a research firm focusing on outdoor markets. The Southwick Associates report said that there had been $421,819,113 in retail sales in West Virginia, with a ""multiplier effect"" raising that amount to $552,085,233. The multiplier was used  to estimate ""the total amount of spending that occurs in the economy as a result of hunters’ spending."" The report also said that 5,377 jobs were created through hunting and $35,544,522 in state and local taxes were gathered due to hunting. The amount spent on deer hunting alone was $291,972,745. So the numbers cited by Justice exist. But we’ll offer a few caveats. First, the report is from 2012 and the data is from 2011. Though Justice offered a specific-sounding figure, the actual figure might have grown or shrunk in the subsequent seven-plus years. Second, multiplier effects are estimates and are highly dependent on the assumptions used. Different assumptions will lead to different results. Using the retail sales figure without the multiplier adjustment might have been a more defensible approach. Finally, the report says it ""was funded by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and produced in partnership with the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies."" The association represents government officials who oversee hunting, but the National Shooting Sports Foundation bills itself as the ""firearms industry trade association."" This means that the NSSF is an advocacy group that has a vested interest in promoting hunting. As with any advocacy group, its data should be understood in this context. Justice said that ""hunters contribute more than $500 million"" to West Virginia. This statistic comes from a comprehensive, 50-state report, but it’s worth noting that the data is more than seven years old, that it uses an estimate of economic impact beyond just retail sales, and that the report was funded by an industry trade group. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Jim Justice, tweet, Nov. 5, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/WVGovernor/status/1059430294594445317'), ('West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, tweet, Nov. 24, 2018', 'No link'), ('West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Regulation Summary 2018-2019,', 'https://twitter.com/wvdnr/status/1066391071314378752'), ('West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, press release, Nov. 14, 2018', 'No link'), ('Charleston Gazette-Mail, ""Bucks from bucks: WV hunters create half-billion-dollar impact on state\'s economy,"" Oct. 25, 2018', 'http://www.wvdnr.gov/hunting/Regs1819/2018-19_Hunting_Regs.pdf'), ('Southwick Associates, ""Hunting in America,"" 2012', 'No link'), ('National Shooting Sports Foundation, website, accessed Dec. 7, 2018', 'http://www.wvdnr.gov/2018news/18news107.shtm')]",/factchecks/2018/dec/10/jim-justice/do-hunters-contribute-more-500-million-west-virgin/

Does West Virginia have the nation's fourth-worst poverty rate?
","In a Nov. 8 op-ed in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Democratic state Sen. Mike Romano expressed concern about the state of the West Virginia economy. ""Our poverty rate, which has not declined since the Great Recession, was 19.1 percent, the fourth-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,"" Romano wrote. Are Romano’s statistics about West Virginia poverty accurate? We took a closer look. We turned to official U.S. Census Bureau data for poverty by state and looked at 2017, the most recent year for which data was available. While there are two main Census Bureau sources for poverty statistics -- the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey -- experts we consulted with agreed that the American Community Survey data was better for a statewide statistic because it has a much larger sample size. Romano was correct that West Virginia had the fourth-highest poverty rate of any state in 2017, at 19.1 percent. Here are the five states with the highest poverty rates that year: 1. Mississippi: 19.8 percent 2. Louisiana: 19.7 percent 3. New Mexico: 19.7 percent 4. West Virginia: 19.1 percent 5.

Burlington is using less electricity now than in 1989, but it’s not quite that simple
","In the wake of a national climate report predicting serious economic and human health impacts in the United States in the century to come, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger joined the growing movement in support of carbon pricing. Weinberger announced at a conference on Dec. 1 that he has put together a coalition of Northeast mayors who are calling on state lawmakers to enact a ""carbon pollution fee"". During his speech unveiling the proposal, he spoke of Burlington and other cities’ efforts to act on climate change. ""Cities, too, have been a source of climate progress, as Burlington’s environmental track record over the last 30 years makes clear,"" Weinberger said. ""As a city, we currently use about four percent less electricity today than we used in 1989, saving Burlingtonians millions of dollars annually in avoided retail power costs,"" he added.  Could Burlington really be using less electricity during a time when the population increased by  12.5 percent and development has been a constant? We decided to find out if Burlington’s electricity usage has really gone down over the past three decades. Asked about the claim, Weinberger’s office pointed us to the Burlington Electric Department’s 2017 Energy Efficiency Annual Report. ""Overall electricity use in 2017 was about 4.0% lower than in 1989,"" the report says.   The annual report actually relied on electricity use in 2016, said Mike Kanarick, manager of communications for Burlington Electric Department.   He said 1989 was the first year Burlington began investing in energy efficiency. In 1990, the city passed an $11.3 million bond for efficiency projects. In 1989, BED sold 353,562,840 kilowatt hours of electricity, while in 2016, the utility sold 340,281,192 kWh — a decrease of 3.76 percent. The actual figure from 2017 is even lower, Kanarick noted. Since publication of the report, utility staff calculated that BED sold 332,090,724 wWh in 2017, which is 6.07 percent less than in 1989, he said. However, it hasn’t been a steady downward trend over the past three decades. It’s been up and down. Burlington’s electricity use was actually higher in 2016 than it was during 12 years since 1989. The lowest electricity consumption during that time was in 1996. Our data analysis shows that the general trend in Burlington’s total electricity usage has actually been slightly upward, although per capita usage has been going down. Weinberger’s statement is correct -- the city’s electricity consumption was about 4 percent lower in 2016 than in 1989. But that statistic is not reflective of the general trend in Burlington’s energy usage, which has been on a slight upward trajectory during that time. What the mayor said is technically true, but it might give the wrong impression. We rate this Mostly True.","[('Burlington Electric Department, 2017 Energy Efficiency Annual Report', 'https://www.burlingtonelectric.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/2017%20BED%20DSM%20Annual%20Report.pdf'), ('Email interview with Mike Kanarick, Burlington Electric Department’s Manager of Customer Care and Communications, Dec. 5, 2018. \u200b', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/dec/08/miro-weinberger/burlington-using-less-electricity-now-1989-its-not/
"['Corporations', 'Taxes', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
Cuomo said treatment for Amazon no different
","The news that Amazon will bring some of its operations to Long Island City in Queens, with a promise of creating 25,000 jobs, brought pushback from some politicians and neighborhood advocates. They are concerned about how Long Island City will change and question the amount of financial incentives offered to Amazon. In the face of opposition to the deal, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued statements and participated in a round of media interviews to talk about Amazon’s decision. During an interview on WNYC, host Brian Lehrer asked Cuomo about what kind of public oversight will be in place before Amazon’s plans are finalized. Cuomo’s answer addressed the project’s approval process, as well as financial incentives offered to Amazon. ""There is nothing that we have done on Amazon that we have not done with hundreds of other projects,"" Cuomo said. ""There are hundreds of businesses in New York that receive these types of tax credits and capital grants, because, competitively we have to work hard to get people to come here because of our tax structure."" So Amazon’s deal with New York state is not unique? The state offered Amazon up to $1.7 billion in benefits and New York City offered up to $1.8 billion, according to an analysis from Citizens Budget Commission. In general, the value of the benefits grow with the number of jobs created by Amazon.  The state is offering up to $1.2 billion in tax credits from the Excelsior Jobs Program and a capital grant of up to $505 million, according to the state Division of Budget. The Excelsior credits are tied to Amazon’s commitment to create 25,000 jobs and invest $2.3 billion. The capital grant is tied to that initial commitment and also further milestones: up to 40,000 jobs and $3.6 billion in total investment. The types of incentives offered to Amazon have been offered to many companies. The Excelsior Jobs Program is ""the state’s primary economic development vehicle,"" and as of a June 30 quarterly update, the program had admitted 571 businesses engaged in 600 projects, said Budget Division spokesman Morris Peters.  The capital grant, while discretionary, has been offered to ""thousands"" of other companies, Peters said. The state spent $750 million in taxpayer money to build and equip the RiverBend factory in Buffalo and provided $70 million for Regeneron in the Capital District. The state and city have been criticized by some who say that a wealthy company like Amazon does not need $3 billion in subsidies.  Peters said a reasonable analysis would recognize that Amazon’s investments and job creation commitments are higher than other projects the state, therefore the incentives are higher. But James Parrott, who was the chief economist for New York City’s economic development initiatives in the early 1990s, said a reasonable analysis would put the incentives in the context of New York’s attractiveness to the technology sector, including a skilled workforce, as well as the city’s brisk economy. ""How can you justify this level of subsidy in that context?"" asked Parrott, who is now director of economic and fiscal policy at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School. Circumventing the City Council So who's providing oversight on the Amazon deal? Cuomo said during the WNYC interview that the Public Authorities Control Board does not have to approve the capital grant, but that the state Empire State Development Corp. will draft a general project plan. That plan will be submitted to the control board for approval. General project plans have been used for projects such as Atlantic Yards, Brooklyn Bridge Park and Times Square redevelopment, according to Citizens Budget Commission. They require environmental impact statements and public input is solicited, but there is no local control of the approval process. While the project's neighbors and local elected officials might be upset about this, this top-down approach can be more appealing for companies. Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a radio interview that if the city used its typical process, ""there’s a very good likelihood these jobs would not have come here."" One reason advocates for Long Island City are opposed to the Amazon plan is that it avoids the city’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, and circumvents the City Council. ""It is not business as usual,"" said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development in New York City, an affordable housing advocacy organization. However, Peters, the spokesman for the state Division of Budget, part of Cuomo’s executive branch, said projects with capital construction grants use the general project plan process, and there have been thousands of them all over the state. Since it is unclear whether Cuomo’s ""we"" referred to state negotiators or state and city negotiators - attempts to reach a spokesman for the governor were unsuccessful - we will discuss the city incentives, but set them aside when evaluating the truthfulness of Cuomo's statement. De Blasio has said that ""overwhelmingly"" the incentives the city offered Amazon would be available to any eligible company, and that other incentives the city has offered in the past were not offered to Amazon. These include mortgage recording tax examptions, sales tax exemptions, more significant property tax exemptions, and city income tax breaks, according to James Patchett, president and CEO of New York City Economic Development Corporation.  Two of the major city incentives offered to Amazon, known as as-of-right incentives, are available to the company under existing state statutes. The city expects Amazon to benefit from a property tax abatement of $386 million from a program that promotes growth in certain areas, known as Industrial and Commercial Abatement Program, or ICAP. Amazon was also offered between $900 million and $1.44 billion in incentives, depending on whether Amazon creates 25,000 or 40,000 jobs, from a program for companies that relocate from outside the city to certain areas, known as Relocation and Expansion Abatement Program, or REAP.  The deal also calls for a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes, or PILOT, agreement between the city and Amazon, in which Amazon pays the same amount to the city as they would in property taxes, according to Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen. One of the most unpopular incentives from the city, and the most unusual, is the promise to help Amazon establish a helipad at the site, or nearby. Reinvent Albany, which advocates for transparency in government, opposes these types of tax incentives. But the group’s executive director said Cuomo’s statement is correct. ""It’s totally accurate on his part, unfortunately,"" said Reinvent Albany Executive Director John Kaehny. ""This is only big because of the scale of it.""   David Friedfel, director of state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, said the nature of the incentives offered to Amazon are similar to those offered to other companies. Another expert, from the Rockefeller Institute for Government, called the Amazon deal large, but not out of line with other deals the state has done. Laura Schultz, director of fiscal analysis and senior economist at the Rockefeller Institute, a think tank affiliated with the State University of New York, said that the state offered more incentives on a per-job basis in 2009 to Global Foundries in Malta and in 2014 to Solar City, later purchased by Tesla, in Buffalo. Global Foundries was offered a capital construction grant of $665 million, and Tesla, at the time called Solar City, was offered a capital construction grant of up to $750 million, she said. With tax incentives and capital grants combined, Global Foundries was offered $931,741 per job, and Tesla was offered incentives equal to $150,000 per job, Schultz said. If Amazon creates 40,000 jobs and receives the maximum amount of incentives New York state is offering, the per-job cost for the state will be $42,625. That figure changes under different hiring scenarios and when city incentives are included. Because the Excelsior tax credits are tied to salaries, and the Amazon salaries are promised to be $150,000 on average, Schultz said the incentives are higher. ""So while Amazon will be receiving the largest total tax credit ever offered by the program, this is due to the large number and the high salaries of the expected jobs,"" she said. ""The amount per job is higher than average, but not the highest offered by the state."" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that the incentives offered to Amazon are the same as those offered to ""hundreds"" of other companies. We looked at the state subsidies, and found that other companies have been offered the types of subsidies offered to Amazon. However, the scale of the subsidies is larger, including a discretionary capital grant, than many prior projects the state has done. The general project plan process, which has been criticized because it does not require approval from City Council, has also been used on hundreds of statewide projects that have been awarded capital construction grants. We rate Cuomo’s statement True.    ","[('Interview with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, The Brian Lehrer Show, WNYC, Nov. 19, 2018.

Complex tale involving Hillary Clinton, uranium and Russia resurfaces
","A controversial tale involving Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, uranium and Russia continues to rear its ugly head years after it came out. We previously reported on what we know about the Uranium One deal and to this day the details remain murky. The charge: That Hillary Clinton sold roughly 20 percent of America’s uranium supply to Russia in exchange for $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. A recent social media post that takes the accusation a bit further by lumping in former FBI Director Robert Mueller, special counsel in the continuing special counsel investigation. The post has a picture of Hillary Clinton with text saying, ""I sold 20 percent of America’s uranium to Russia. Then the Russian government gave $145 million to Clinton Foundation."" Underneath is a picture of Mueller, with text saying, ""I delivered it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As secretary of state, Clinton did serve on a government board that ultimately approved a transfer of uranium, but she wasn’t the deciding vote. And the Clinton Foundation did receive $145 million from parties involved in the transaction — but the dates of a large share of the donations and the deal don’t add up to suggest a quid pro quo. Mueller was the FBI director at the time, and the FBI was investigating corruption by the Russian company involved in the deal before the transfer was approved. But he played no role in delivering anything that we could find. The story stems back to the 2015 book Clinton Cash, an investigation by Breitbart News editor-at-large Peter Schweizer. A chapter in the book suggest a pay-for-play scheme between the Clintons and Russia, accusing them of transferring uranium in exchange for donation money. According to our previous story, in 2007, a Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his company UrAsia, to another — Uranium One — and unloaded his personal stake in it. The merged company kept Uranium One as its name and was based out of Toronto. Though it was based in Canada, Uranium One has mines, mills and land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of the U.S. uranium production capacity. It’s actual production, though, is actually a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the U.S., at 11 percent in 2014, according to Oilprice.com. Under the terms of the deal, UrAsia shareholders kept a 60 percent stake in the new company until June 2010, when Russia’s nuclear agency, Rosatom, completed purchase of a 51 percent stake. But the deal had to be approved by multiple U.S. agencies first, including the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS — on which the U.S. Secretary of State sits. The committee approved the proposal, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100 percent ownership of the company and renamed it Uranium One Holding. The deal, however, was not Clinton’s to approve alone. The CFIUS panel also includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, as well as the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The claim makes it seem like Clinton had the power of vetoing or approving the deal, which she did not. Clinton has said that she was not personally involved and, in a New York Times article, then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez, who represented the State Department on the panel, said Clinton ""never intervened"" in CFIUS matters. It is accurate that nine individuals related to the company donated to the Clinton Foundation but the bulk of the money —$131 million — came from Giustra. And Giustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state. We couldn’t independently verify Giustra’s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly — from $145 million to $4 million. Of the remaining individuals connected with Uranium One, the only one found to have donated to the Clinton Foundation during the deal’s time frame was Ian Telfer. Telfer was an investor who the New York Times found contributed between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the foundation during and after the review process for the deal. So while it isn’t wrong to question links between foundation donors and their ties to Uranium One, this specific charge was exaggerated. A 2017 report by The Hill revealed that Rosatom’s main executive, Vadim Mikerin, orchestrated ""a racketeering plot involving kickbacks, bribes and extortion designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States."" This was revealed by an undercover FBI informant who had infiltrated Uranium One in 2009 – a year before the deal was approved by CFIUS. At the time, Mueller was the director of the FBI, and one would assume he would have been aware of the ongoing investigation. But in the Hill article, Assistant FBI Director Ronald Hosko was quoted saying he did not recall ever being briefed on the case. ""‘I had no idea this case was being conducted,’ a surprised Hosko said in an interview,"" the article reported. Again, it's somewhat unclear what the post means when it says Mueller ""delivered it,"" but there is no evidence Mueller played a role in the Uranium One transaction. The other implication is that Clinton either did know or should have known about problems with the Russian bid for Uranium One before deciding whether to let it go forward. Same goes for President Barack Obama, who had the power to veto the transfer. For now at least, we aren’t aware of any evidence that Clinton knew anything about the FBI investigation. If anything, the Hill’s reporting suggests the opposite. If the assistant FBI director at the time knew nothing of the investigation, then Clinton -- someone in a different department and several rungs higher in the organizational chart -- might not have known about it. A Facebook post claims that Hillary Clinton transferred uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. It also says Robert Mueller was involved. The claim makes it seem like Clinton bears responsibility for the deal when a panel of several departments and agencies were part of its approval.

Did West Virginia rank 50th in household income in 2017? Yes
","In a Nov. 8 op-ed in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Mike Romano, a Democratic West Virginia state senator, said West Virginia’s median household income was nearly $17,000 below the national average.

How low does West Virginia rank in teacher pay?
","Less than a year after West Virginia experienced a major teachers’ strike, Republican state Del. Paul Espinosa touted GOP efforts to raise teacher salaries — and attacked Democrats for causing the problem of low pay in the first place. On Oct. 9, Espinosa, who chairs the House Committee on Education, tweeted, ""From 1990 to 2015 under democrat control, W. Va. teacher pay rank plummeted from 30th in the nation to 48th. Our GOP led legislature is committed to reversing that decline through passage of the largest aggregate pay raises in our state’s history. #ResultsNotResistance #wvgop18"" From 1990 to 2015 under democrat control, W. Va. teacher pay rank plummeted from 30th in the nation to 48th. Our GOP led legislature is committed to reversing that decline through passage of the largest aggregate pay raises in our state’s history. #ResultsNotResistance #wvgop18 Espinosa said he was citing numbers originally provided by the governor’s office, but we decided to take a look at the original data. The numbers vary a bit from measurement to measurement, but there’s no question that West Virginia currently ranks near the bottom of the 50 states in teacher pay. A CNN article published around the time of the teacher strike, on March 5, 2018, pegged the state at 48th in the nation -- consistent with Espinosa’s second figure. The article cited data collected by National Education Association, a prominent teachers union. We were able to find a more recent figure from the NEA, covering 2017, and by then, West Virginia’s ranking had grown even worse. It fell for the second year in a row, to 49th. Meanwhile, we located data from earlier NEA surveys and found that West Virginia hasn’t ranked higher than 44th since 2004. However, we weren’t able to find NEA data online prior to 2003, so we turned instead to data collected by the federal Education Department. This data set goes back to the late 1960s. Here’s a chart comparing West Virginia and national teacher salaries at various intervals since the 1969-70 school year. It shows that West Virginia pay has trailed national pay by a fairly consistent margin since at least 2000. It also shows that teacher pay hasn’t kept up with inflation during the last decade.   As for West Virginia’s ranking nationally, it fell precipitously between about 1970 and 1990, then spiked upward before starting to decline again around 2000.   This tracks with contemporary news coverage of the 1990 West Virginia teachers’ strike, which came when teacher pay was almost at the bottom of the rankings, according to Education Week. In the 1989-90 school year, the period of the previous strike, West Virginia ranked 48th. To find the state rating roughly 30th in the nation, you have to go back all the way to the late 1960s. So Espinosa has a point that West Virginia teacher pay had sunk to a couple places from the bottom by 2015 — but he’s exaggerated the heights from which it fell. This is more of a mixed picture than Espinosa lets on. First off, the time period is cherry-picked. The legislature had been controlled by the Democrats for decades until the GOP won control in the 2014 elections. By ending his time frame at 2015, Espinosa  overlooks the period when the GOP controlled the Legislature -- a period in which the state’s teacher pay ranking has fallen, according to the annual NEA data. In addition, the 1990-to-2015 time frame cuts out the governorship of Republican Arch Moore (who served three non-consecutive terms, from 1969 to 1977 and from 1985 to 1989). It also cuts out the current governorship of Jim Justice, who was elected as a Democrat but later switched to the GOP. Currently, Republicans control the governorship as well as both chambers of the legislature. As it happens, the greatest increase in the teacher pay rankings during the period Espinosa cited came between about 1990 and 2000. During most of that period, the state had a Democratic governor, Gaston Caperton. A couple years of that time span were under a Republican governor, Cecil Underwood. Ultimately, then, the partisan blame does not accrue exclusively to the Democrats. Espinosa said, ""From 1990 to 2015 under (Democratic) control, W. Va. teacher pay rank plummeted from 30th in the nation to 48th."" There’s no question that West Virginia teacher pay currently ranks near the bottom of the 50 states, but he exaggerated how far those rankings had fallen since 1990. In addition, the biggest rise in pay during that period came during the tenure of a Democratic governor, which undercuts the argument that the Democrats are entirely to blame.

GOP governor asked predecessor to hold lame-duck action, now he's making major lame-duck moves
","In the lame-duck period after Republican Scott Walker was elected governor in November 2010, he had strong thoughts on what actions were appropriate for the outgoing governor. In short: The exiting governor should not do much. And nothing that would tie his hands in January 2011, when he took office. Now Walker is preparing to leave office, and Democrat Tony Evers is about to take over. And a host of measures have cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature and been sent to Walker, many of which are aimed at limiting the power of Evers. It seemed like a good time to return to our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether an individual has been consistent in their position. We’re not judging if it is good politics or good policy, just whether a position has changed. Let’s take a look at Walker and his views on taking major actions in a lame-duck session. Walker in 2010 On Nov. 10, 2010, Walker delivered a letter to Doyle’s administration with five requests: 1.       Delay implementation of the new Affordable Care Act in light of Walker’s plans to challenge it in court 2.       Suspend negotiations with the state employee unions so they could be considered in the context of the upcoming budget 3.       Don’t finalize any permanent civil service personnel because these appointees ""should be required to go through the same application process as any other civil servants."" 4.       Pursue shifting a power plant’s fuel from bio-fuel to natural gas 5.       Delay implementing any new administrative rules — Walker added, ""I feel strongly that if new or updated rules were urgently needed, they would have been completed prior to now."" At the time, Walker released a statement on the contracts, noting how they would inhibit his ability to act as the state’s newly-elected leader. ""Governor-elect Scott Walker is opposed to the lame duck Legislature approving public employee union contracts,"" reads the Nov. 30, 2010, news release. ""If approved, the contracts will tie the hands of the Governor and the newly-elected Legislature as they work to balance the state budget."" If three of those subjects sound familiar, it’s because they are. The ACA, appointments and administrative rules are all in the headlines. In any case, Walker urged restraint when it came to major actions before he took office. Walker in 2018 With Walker on the way out, the GOP-controlled Legislature passed numerous initiatives to weaken the power of Evers and incoming Attorney General Josh Kaul, also a Democrat. ""I actually think if you look at much of what they're talking about is codifying practice,"" Walker said on Dec. 3, 2018. ""Members of the Legislature were elected not on a term that ended on Election Day, they were elected in a term that ends in January, just like my term ends in January."" The Legislature went on to pass a series of bills that, among other things, would limit early voting to two weeks, put lawmakers in charge of the ACA litigation and give Republicans more control over the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the state jobs agency. Meanwhile, Walker has taken other actions on a variety of fronts since the election. On a single day, he submitted 82 names for membership on various boards, authorities and councils. They included naming named Administration Secretary Ellen Nowak to head the Public Service Commission, which oversees state utilities. Similar to Walker in 2010, Evers wrote Walker a letter saying the appointees should not be ""jammed through without transparency and time for full consideration."" ""Given the rushed timing and the fact that many of these appointments have gone unfilled for extended periods of time, I must request that you withdraw this slate of names to allow ample time for full review,"" Evers wrote. The Senate approved all 82 appointees. Since the election, Walker has also appointed district attorneys in Burnett and Columbia counties and judges in Racine and Waukesha counties. The new Waukesha County judge is Attorney General Brad Schimel, who just lost the election to Kaul. Walker also announced Nov. 30 he is seeking applicants for a judicial vacancy in St. Croix. County. Amy Hasenberg, a spokeswoman for Walker's office, has said the governor is simply dealing with unfinished business. Our rating As he prepared to take office, Walker asked the lame-duck administration to hold off on a series of major actions. As he prepares to leave office, Walker has made numerous appointments -- in some cases to positions that had been open for months -- and signalled his support for changes passed by the GOP Legislature that will curtail the power of his successor. That’s a full reversal. And a Full Flop.

Does CEO Mary Barra earn 295 times average GM worker?
","West Virginia Democrat Richard Ojeda -- who lost a U.S. House race in 2018 but is considering a run for president in 2020 -- shot a video clip at General Motors’ Detroit headquarters to call out the company’s announcement that it was closing five plants and laying off more than 14,000 employees in late November. He shared the video in a Nov. 27 tweet, adding this commentary in the body of the tweet: ""I'm in Detroit at General Motors HQ. We bailed you out. We gave you tax breaks. Your workers are the reason your CEO took home almost 22 MILLION DOLLARS last year alone (295x your company's average employee). And this is how you repay them? #CorporateGreed.""

Your workers are the reason your CEO took home almost 22 MILLION DOLLARS last year alone (295x your company's average employee).And this is how you repay them? #CorporateGreed pic.twitter.com/VUwjUROmZv We wondered whether Ojeda was correct that the company’s CEO, Mary Barra, took home almost $22 million last year, a sum that was 295 times the company's average employee, at about $74,000. Stephanie Rice, GM’s assistant manager of finance communications, confirmed to PolitiFact that Barra was paid a total compensation package of $21.96 million last year and that it was about 295 times as much as GM’s median employee. These figures must be reported publicly to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and they have drawn some media attention. The amount Barra was paid represented a drop from her 2016 compensation of $22.58 million. While 295 times larger seems like a lot, it’s far from the only such ratio among major U.S. companies -- or even among the highest. The 2017 CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 312-to-1, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-aligned think tank. (The metric the group used is not apples-to-apples with the number GM reported to the government, so a direct comparison is not possible.) This ratio, covering 350 large companies, ""was far greater than the 20-to-1 ratio in 1965 and more than five times greater than the 58-to-1 ratio in 1989, although it was lower than the peak ratio of 344-to-1, reached in 2000,"" the institute wrote. The following chart shows the ratio since the mid-1960s, measured two different ways. One minor quibble with Ojeda’s language: He used the term ""average"" employee. Many readers might follow common usage and assume that ""average"" as the mean salary. In fact, the SEC data uses the median salary, which is technically a type of average but is not often referred to that way. Ojeda did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Ojeda said that Barra ""took home almost 22 MILLION DOLLARS last year alone (295x your company's average employee).""

Does the U.S. spend more on potato chips than energy research?
","U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., said in a recent tweet that ""our country spends more on potato chips than we do on ALL energy R&D,"" or research and development. Research in fostering clean energy development is critical for America’s national security and creates jobs. Our country spends more on potato chips than we do on ALL energy R&D; less than 1/2% of energy expenditures compared to nearly 15% R&D with pharmaceuticals. That struck us as a creative comparison. But is it correct? We took a closer look. (McKinley's office did not respond to an inquiry.) Odd pairing or not, we discovered that the comparison has been circulating for almost a decade, appearing in a 2010 report published by the National Academy of Sciences. The report said, ""United States consumers spend significantly more on potato chips than the government devotes to energy R&D."" It cited a 2009 U.S. potato chip sales figure of $7.1 billion and federal government spending on energy R&D totaling $5.1 billion. We wondered whether the data was roughly the same today. For potato chip sales we located a study by the market research publisher Packaged Facts that pegged U.S. potato chip sales in 2015 at $7.5 billion. As for research funding, the amount allocated to the U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Science in fiscal year 2018 was $5.4 billion. And not all that amount was for energy research specifically; some went for nuclear physics and computing technology. So potato chip sales in the United States almost certainly continues to exceed what the federal government spends on energy research.

Missouri statehouse had more Democratic millennial candidates than other states
","Crystal Quade won an easy re-election campaign to serve two more years representing Missouri House District 132. Two days after the election, she was selected by her peers to serve as minority floor leader. Quade spoke with reporters after the selection. She said she ""read an article that we had the largest amount of millennial Democrats running than any other state in the country."" At 33, Quade is a millennial herself. Because she has taken over an important leadership role in the Missouri House, we decided to check out her claim to see if Missouri really did have more millennial Democrats run for state legislature positions than any other state. When we reached out to Quade, she pointed us to a Facebook post and an article from the progressive PAC Run for Something, whose mission is to support millennial Democrats running for state legislature. The article links to a study conducted by Run for Something and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which looks into the number of millennials running for state offices across the United States. The committee’s communications director, Mara Sloan, said millennials were defined as candidates 18-34 years old and based on candidate filing information. The start and end points of generations aren’t exact and rather are determined by researchers as tools for analysis. The Pew Research Center currently defines millennials as those aged 22 to 37 this year. But it acknowledges that many others ""have offered well-reasoned arguments for drawing that line a few years earlier or later than where we have."" So it looks like the legislative campaign committee’s numbers are in the same ballpark. The study presents a state-by-state breakdown of numbers of millennial Democrats who ran for state legislatures in 46 states, excluding Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia, which don’t hold state legislature elections in general election years. According to the data, Missouri had 31 millennial Democrats run for state office, of which 12 would go on to win their elections. Missouri barely edged out Pennsylvania, which had 30, while Nevada and Wyoming had the least, with two millennial Democrats running for office in each state. We could not find any similar data on number of Republican millennials running for state legislature, either in Missouri or nationwide. Morley Winograd, a millennial politics expert and senior fellow at the University of Southern California, said the reason that there was such large variance in the number of Democrat millennials running in some states over others was likely caused ""by the issues being debated in those state legislatures and the organizing motivation it provided for recruiting candidates of this type in those states."" Liberal-leaning issues on the Missouri ballot in November, such as medical marijuana and the minimum wage raise, likely contributed to this. Quade said that she ""read an article that we had the largest amount of millennial Democrats running than any other state in the country."" Quade referenced an October study from the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and the group Run For Something. While the study excluded four states, it found that Missouri had the most millennial Democrats run for office, and we didn’t find any data or expert opinion to the contrary of their numbers. For these reasons, we rate her statement True.","[('St. Louis Public Radio Website,\xa0""Two St. Louis lawmakers elected to legislative leadership posts,""Nov. 8', 'http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/two-st-louis-lawmakers-elected-legislative-leadership-posts#stream/0'), ('Run for Something Website,\xa0""Hot off the press: DLCC and RFS report on Millennials running for state leg,""\xa0Oct. 17', 'No link'), ('DLCC Website,\xa0""Empowering Democratic Millennial Candidates in 2018,""\xa0Oct. 17', 'https://medium.com/@runforsomething/hot-off-the-press-dlcc-and-rfs-report-on-millennials-running-for-state-leg-d834ffb0a7f'), ('2018 State Legislature Democrats Millennial Candidates Data, DLCC', 'No link'), ('Ballotpedia,\xa0""Crystal Quade""', 'https://www.dlcc.org/press/empowering-democratic-millennial-candidates-2018'), ('Run for Something Facebook Post, Oct. 17', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Missouri State Rep.

Does West Virginia spend half its budget on K-12 education?
","Is almost half of West Virginia’s state budget devoted to K-12 education? That’s what West Virginia state Senate Minority Leader Roman Prezioso, a Democrat, said. ""Fifty percent of our (West Virginia) budget was for lower education,"" Prezioso said during a panel discussion at West Virginia University on Nov. 29, 2018. We looked at the most recent budget report released by the state to determine whether Prezioso was accurate. According to the most recent West Virginia executive budget document, the state spent $1.919 billion on ""education"" in fiscal year 2017, the most recent year for which actual expenditures are currently available. (This category does not include university spending. Expenditures for ""higher education"" totaled $392.9 million.) Total expenditures for fiscal year 2017 were about $4.2 billion. That means K-12 education accounted for about 46 percent of the budget. As for the recommendations for fiscal year 2019, education spending would account for 44.26 percent of overall spending. After the panel, PolitiFact West Virginia asked Prezioso to clarify what he had meant, and he said that the 50 percent figure was an approximation. At the panel, Prezioso said that ""50 percent of our (West Virginia) budget was for lower education."" We found that it was 46 percent for 2017 and a recommended 44 percent for 2019.

Does a proposed Portland teacher contract include more restrictive rules?
","
  
Contract negotiations are always a tense time, but the battle between the Portland Association of Teachers and the Portland Public School Board is getting particularly heated. Teachers say they're simply trying to outline their responsibilities as clearly as possible, while board members say the contract could negatively impact children's education.

In an opinion piece published in The Oregonian June 5, board members argued that the proposal currently floated by the teachers' association ""would layer on more restrictive rules.""

In the piece, they say the proposed contract does this by:

""Prohibiting increases in instructional time in any school above the amount currently in place.""

""Preventing teachers from being required to communicate with parents or post grades online, unless 30 minutes of time is set aside to do so during the school day.""

""Prohibiting principals from having teachers make up parent-teacher conferences with families who miss their regularly scheduled meetings.""

Then, the board members really hammer it home: ""Students and families deserve better. These demands exemplify much of what is already wrong with Portland's teacher contract.""

The analysis: PolitiFact Oregon was curious about whether the contract was really such a game changer, so we pulled up a copy of the contract and found the passages that the board members were talking about. Let's take these one by one.

First up: Prohibiting an increase in instructional time.

On Page 89 of the proposed contract, which is still undergoing tweaks, it specifically states that ""Instructional minutes and/or student contact minutes shall not increase in any building above what is in effect during the 2012-2013 school year.""

Second: Preventing teachers from being required to post grades online or communicate with parents unless they're given specific time during the workday to do this.

Page 94 of the contract has passages that address both of these issues. The proposed contract notes that ""professional educators recognize the value and importance of communication with parents and the community, and may volunteer to do so using print, electronic or digital communication products.""

The key here, though, is requiring the teachers to do this -- and the proposed contract specifically says that should not occur: ""Principals/supervisors shall not require such parent communication unless adequate additional time is allowed during the workday … Principals/supervisors may not require parent newsletters or more frequent progress reporting unless adequate additional parent communication time of at least thirty (30) minutes daily is allowed during the workday to complete these tasks.""

The same page has a similar note about grading: ""The electronic posting of assignments, grading rubrics, support materials, and lesson plans on electronic student information systems … is recognized as beneficial; however it shall not be required unless adequate additional parent communication time of at least thirty (30) minutes daily is allowed during the workday to complete these tasks.""

Third: Will principals be barred from requiring teachers to make up parent-teacher conferences with families that miss their meetings?

This, too, is stated pretty explicitly in the proposed contract. The teachers association notes that ""professional educators shall make arrangements as may be necessary to meet with students and parents at reasonable times during the normal workday."" But it then goes on to say, directly, that, ""principals shall not require professional educators to schedule make up appointments for parents who miss regularly scheduled parent conferences.""

Given that all of this language seems to fit with what was in the opinion piece, we were inclined to wrap this one up, but we did want to chat with Marty Pavlik,  the Portland Association of Teachers' chief contract negotiator.

Pavlik gave detailed defenses of each piece of the contract, noting some of it still had not been completely worked out. While we found much of his reasoning behind the provisions to be reasonable, none of it much changed that these clauses were indeed in the contact.

There was one exception however. Pavlik said that the first issue, the one dealing with no increased instructional time, was actually not a new provision. In fact, he said, it was already covered by the contract's Maintenance of Standard Clause, which essentially keeps instructional minutes the same from year to year.

This added line, he said, was simply there to clarify that time would not be added. ""In our opinion,"" he said, ""it is not a change.""

On that one, we agree.

But ultimately we come back to the school board's statement, which is that this contract proposal would ""layer on more restrictive rules.""

We also, with due diligence in mind, spoke with Portland Public School's chief spokesman, Robb Cowie. He said one thing that stuck with us: ""In terms of accuracy, the board's statements in this (piece) are absolutely accurate and hew to the language that is in the proposal.""

The issues they cite are clearly based on pieces of the proposed contract. What's more, those pieces do serve to create more restrictive rules. Now, whether that's a bad thing depends on your position in the broader debate. And teachers would argue they need the rules to protect their time in the face of growing district mandates. But we're not ruling on that -- PolitiFact doesn't delve into opinions, positions or predictions. We're just ruling on whether the proposed contract creates more restrictive rules for these specific situations.

Clearly it does. We rate this statement True.","[('\nPortland Association of Teachers, initial contract proposal, April 18, 2013', 'http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/laborrelations/PAT_Initial_Proposal_4-18-13.pdf'), ('\nInterview with Marty Pavlik, chief contract negotiator for Portland Association of Teachers, June 21, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with Robb Cowie, Portland Public School chief spokesman, June 25, 2013', 'http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/06/theres_still_work_to_do_on_the.html#incart_river'), ('\nPortland School Board members, ""There’s still work to do on the Portland Public School teachers’ contract,"" June 5, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/25/portland-public-schools/does-proposed-portland-teacher-contract-include-mo/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Gov. Rick Scott said state offered nothing special to lure Deutsche Bank jobs
","
Companies are practically tripping over each other to relocate to Florida because of its alluring beaches and business-friendly approach. At least that’s the picture Gov. Rick Scott painted during a June 24, 2013, interview on Fox News. 
""That’s why companies like just today, Deutsche Bank, added 300 jobs right here in Florida,"" Scott told host Stuart Varney on Your World with Neil Cavuto. ""Last week, I was with the Paris Air Show. We have companies from France, companies from Virginia moving to Florida. So it’s clearly working in our state. And I hope you’ll buy a one-way ticket and do your show down here."" 
Varney chuckled, then pressed for more details. ""That’s an invitation I might just take up. Quickly though, Deutsche Bank, they’re bringing 300 jobs to Florida, I think they’re going to Jacksonville. Can you tell me, did you offer them something special? Did you say, I’ll build you an exit off the freeway? No property taxes for a time? Did you do anything like that at all to get them in?"" 
Scott dismissed the notion. ""No, what we do is we make sure we have an educated workforce. You know, you can’t have a lower income tax than zero. Our business taxes are going down every year, so that’s happening. I cut the, I got rid of the sales tax on machinery and equipment for our manufacturers. So every year, we’re trying to make our state a state that no one can compete with because we like jobs. We like businesses. I want to make sure we’re the No. 1 state for your family to get a job, get a great education and afford to live."" 
We wondered whether Florida nabbed a big jobs deal without offering ""something special,"" as Varney put it. 
In a statement tied to the jobs announcement, the managing director of Deutsche Bank Jacksonville hailed the ""tremendous support from the state of Florida and the City of Jacksonville,"" which he said ""played a large part in our decision to increase our footprint at this location."" 
What kind of support? The state wouldn’t tell us, saying that information is shielded from public records laws, but a look at news clips and city council legislation filled in the blanks well enough. 
The short answer: money. 
Deutsche Bank has received a bevy of state and local tax incentives since starting a Jacksonvillle campus in 2008. That year, Deutsche Bank chose Jacksonville over Nashville, Tenn., and Charlotte, N.C., as the site for expanding two subsidiary companies, according to the Florida Times-Union. The expansion came with the promise of $4.8 million in state and local incentives for creating 1,000 jobs and doing capital investment. 
In the summer of 2012, state and local governments offered another $1.45 million to create 260 jobs. 
Fast forward to the most recent expansion, which Scott highlighted in his comments. In April, the Jacksonville City Council agreed to partner with the state to offer $2.08 million in tax incentives to Deutsche Bank in exchange for adding 300 jobs over three years. 
The jobs would pay about $62,000 a year on average and bring the total Jacksonville workforce to 1,600 by 2016, according to city records. 
Under the plan, Deutsche Bank would receive up to $1.8 million in tax refunds through the Qualified Target Industry program, with Jacksonville paying 20 percent ($360,000) and the state paying the rest. 
The bank could also recover $140,000 in property taxes based on a pledge to spend $10 million in renovations to its office space and buy new furniture and technology. 
Separately, Jacksonville’s Office of Economic Development said Scott has agreed to contribute an additional $140,000 from a pot of incentive money used largely at the governor’s discretion to close deals. Scott's state Department of Economic Opportunity would not confirm whether that is the case, saying only that Deutsche Bank had not yet received any money for the project. 
That’s normal, however. State incentives typically are offered on jobs that are actually created, not just promised. 
""It’s absolutely worth the investment,"" said state Rep. Daniel Davis, a Republican who leads the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. ""You have a little investment up front to invest in the long haul."" 
A Deutsche Bank spokesman downplayed the role of incentives in the company’s decision, saying ""there were numerous factors that led to this announcement of new jobs at our Jacksonville location."" 
Our ruling 
We are not evaluating whether Deutsche Bank finds several things about Florida attractive for expanding its company: the weather, the lack of income tax, etc. We are looking at Scott’s response to a pointed question in his Fox News interview: Did Florida offer ""something special"" to Deutsche Bank in exchange for 300 jobs? 
Scott could have acknowledged that economic incentives were used in the deal. Instead he said they were not. 
That's incorrect. 
Records show the company is ready to receive up to $2.08 million in state and local incentives if it hits its job targets. We rate Scott's claim Pants on Fire.","[('\nFox News video, ""Gov.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Stephen Nodine']","
Can a convicted felon run for Congress from jail?
","
By day, Stephen Nodine works at a law office in Bay Minette, Ala. By night, he is an inmate at the Baldwin County Jail where he is serving a two-year sentence for perjury. This would be of little interest except Nodine says he might want to run for Congress and represent Alabama’s 1st Congressional District. 
Nodine notified the media of his interest last week, and in an email to PolitiFact, he said, ""I can run, but it seems some party leaders don't want me to."" 
Nodine is right that Republican officials in Alabama have not embraced his candidacy -- more on that in a bit. But we thought we should take a moment and ask, is Nodine correct when he says he can run for office? 
Nodine is not the first man behind bars to seek the chance to serve the public while serving time. In 2002, former Rep. James Traficant, I-Ohio, took 15 percent of the vote even though he had just started an eight-year sentence for bribery, racketeering and other crimes. Going farther back in history, Matthew Lyon was successful in 1798. He had been convicted of libel, ran for Congress from prison and won. 
The Constitution lists three conditions one must meet to be a candidate for the House of Representatives -- you must be at least 25 years old, have been a citizen for at least seven years and live in the state you hope to represent. These are all that are required, and states may not add to them, for example, by prohibiting a felon from running for office. According to a 2002 Congressional Research Service report, these conditions ""are fixed and may not be supplemented by Congress nor by any State unilaterally."" 
States have more leeway when it comes to setting rules for who may hold state level office, but they have none at the federal level. The Supreme Court, in a case involving term limits, made it clear that states may not interfere. In U.S. Term Limits, Inc. vs. Thornton, the court struck down an amendment to the Arkansas constitution that limited those elected to Congress to three terms in the House and two in the Senate. 
The court explained in its decision that not only states but even Congress itself could not ""impose additional qualifications (that) would violate that ‘fundamental principle of our representative democracy . . . that the people should choose whom they please to govern them,’"" according to an analysis in the Brigham Young University Law Review. 
So when Nodine says he can run, he’s right. But getting his name on the ballot is a different matter. 
The Republican primary hurdle 
Nodine is no stranger to politics. He was a county commissioner in Mobile County. His emailed announcement of his interest in running came with photos of him and President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Nodine’s fall from grace came in 2010 when he was indicted in connection with the death of a long-time mistress. In a deal with prosecutors, Nodine pleaded guilty to felony perjury, and a charge of criminally negligent homicide was dropped. He now says he had a moral failing but was ""wrongfully accused."" (Read an overview of the case from the Mobile Press-Register.) 
Nodine is an ardent Republican and should he run, he plans to compete in the GOP primary in a special election to fill the seat of Rep. Jo Bonner, R- Ala., who will resign in mid August. Nodine isn't slated for release until more than a year after that. 
But the Alabama Republican Party chairman, Bill Armistead, vowed that Nodine won’t get very far. 
""I can tell you that as chair, I see no circumstances where I would support a convicted felon being a candidate for the Republican Party,"" Armistead said. 
The state GOP has its own rules for qualifying candidates. To run as a Republican, a person must affirm, ""I have not been convicted of a felony under the laws of the United States or of another state."" Nodine unambiguously falls short. 
""This would be stopped at the time of an attempt to qualify,"" Armistead said. 
Armistead said he’s confident that the party has the right to determine who may participate in its own primary. He said when Democrats tried to run as Republicans, party leaders blocked them with no challenge. On the other hand, he said he’s never faced this exact situation before. 
The issue is whether a state party could exclude a person who would otherwise pass muster by federal standards. We asked a few experts in election law for their opinions, and while their views vary, Nodine clearly has his work cut out for him 
Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News, said Nodine might well prevail should the court find that the party plays a vital role in the electoral process. 
""I just re-read U.S. Term Limits vs. Thornton,"" Winger said, ""I now feel confident that the Alabama Republican Party can't exclude the candidate. The U.S. Supreme Court said that indirect attempts (to exclude) are just as unlawful as direct attempts."" 
But Winger said Nodine can expect a fight. 
""There is no real clarity in the law, because obviously parties can ban candidates from their primary ballot for Congress if the candidates aren't members of the party. It's possible the Alabama state courts would let the party exclude the person, but if the person appeals to federal court I believe he will win."" 
David Schultz, a law professor at Hamline University, said this is an area of contested law. 
""There is a big debate over how far parties can go in terms of governing internal affairs,"" Schultz said. ""Could they pick their own dates for conventions, how they select their officers? Yes. But once it gets to primaries run by the state and to general elections, then the choices parties make are subject to more regulation."" 
Schultz’s summary on whether the Alabama GOP has the legal right to block Nodine? ""This is a cool issue -- right at the edge of the law."" 
But Justin Levitt, professor at Loyola Law School, has more discouraging news for Nodine. 
""Nodine is right that federal law protects his right to run,"" Levitt said, ""But it doesn't likely protect his right to run as a Republican, or even to run for the right to run as a Republican standard-bearer."" 
So long as parties don’t discriminate in ways banned by the Constitution -- on the basis of race or religion for example -- then they can do much as they please, Levitt said. 
To be clear, this dispute centers on the primary, not the general election. For a general election, there are two ways to get on the ballot -- as the nominee of a party or by getting enough Alabama voters to sign a petition. Nothing would prevent Nodine from running as an independent in a general election; nothing except the need to gather the signatures of 5,938 voters who live in the 1st Congressional District, the minimum number required under Alabama law. 
A final irony 
The Constitution might affirm Nodine’s right to run for office, but it grants states broad authority over deciding who may vote. Alabama law disenfranchises anyone who is behind bars, on probation or on parole. 
Nodine is definitely still in jail. This leads to the potentially paradoxical situation that should he get on the ballot, he wouldn’t be able to vote for himself. Interestingly, his inability to vote also further hamstrings any plans for a primary bid. The Alabama GOP requires that a candidate declare that ""I am not subject to disqualification from registering and voting."" 
Our ruling 
Nodine claimed that he ""can run"" for office. As a legal matter, he is correct. The Constitution enshrines the idea that the people get to decide who shall represent them, and the only limits are age, citizenship and residency. In terms of federal law, Nodine can indeed run. 
His desire to run as a Republican puts him in murkier waters. Political parties enjoy a certain independence. The opinions of the legal experts we reached ranged from thumbs up to thumbs down on Nodine’s chances in court. But even on the more optimistic end, the court battles would be decided long after the election Nodine cares about is over. 
In the broadest sense, Nodine has the legal right to run for office from jail, but significant barriers lie between that right and his name appearing on the ballot. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('\nEmail interview with Stephen Nodine, June 21, 2013', 'http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/06/stephen_nodine_to_run_for_alab.html'), ('\nAL.com, ""Stephen Nodine eyes congressional bid from jail"", June 19, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nFederal Judicial Center, The Sedition Act trials - Matthew Lyon', 'http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_sedbio_lyon.html'), ('\nBrigham Young University Law Review, ""The prisoner’s campaign: Felony disenfranchisement laws and the right to hold public office"", May 31, 2003', 'No link'), ('\nFactcheck.org, ""Felons in elected office"", November 17, 2008', 'http://www.lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2003/2/STE.pdf'), ('\nCongressional Research Service, Congressional Candidacy, Incarceration, and the Constitution’s Inhabitancy Qualification, 12 Aug. 2002', 'No link'), ('\nNonprofit Vote, voting as an ex-offender', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2008/11/felons-in-office/'), ('\nInterview with staff of Elections Division, Alabama Secretary of State, June 25, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with Bill Armistead, chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, June 24, 2013', 'https://opencrs.com/document/RL31532/'), ('\nWKRG News, Nodine indicted on criminally negligent homicide and perjury charge, August 23, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nAL.com, ""The prosecution (or persecution) of Stephen Nodine: How a suicide became murder"", March 15, 2013', 'http://www.wkrg.com/story/21586385/nodine-indicted-on-criminally-neglient-homicide-perjury-charges'), ('\nEmail interview with David Schultz, law professor at Hamline University, June 21, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, June 21, 2013', 'http://blog.al.com/live/2013/03/the_prosecution_or_persecution.html'), ('\nEmail interview with Justin Levitt, law professor at Loyola Law School, June 24, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Rick Hasen, Election Law Blog, University of California Irvine, June 21, 2013', 'http://law.hamline.edu/david_schultz.html'), ('\nEmail interview with Samuel Issacharoff, law professor at New York University Law School, June 21, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/25/stephen-nodine/can-convicted-felon-run-congress-jail/

Pete Gallego says 97 percent of food stamp benefits reach eligible Americans in appropriate amounts
","
Opposing Republican-proposed cuts in food stamps, U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego suggested the program doesn’t waste money.

After airing qualms about cutting ""things that work well"" during a May 15, 2013, meeting of the House Agriculture Committee, the Alpine Democrat said some government programs have high error rates, but error rates for food stamps, meaning the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, ""are only 3 percent... Ninety seven percent of SNAP benefits are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible.""

Food stamps, which help beneficiaries buy groceries, often stir strong claims. In March 2013, PolitiFact in Washington rated Pants on Fire the declaration that 70 percent of the program’s funding went to its employees. The broadest calculation of SNAP administrative costs topped out at 5 percent of its costs.

In December 2012, PolitiFact Ohio rated as True a claim that growth in food stamp participation had trailed increases in unemployment, while in August 2012, we rated as True a claim that one in seven American families is on food stamps. According to the Agriculture Department, a record 46.6 million residents participated in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, up from 44.7 million the year before and 40.3 million in fiscal 2010.

As of March 2013, more than 1.6 million Texas households were enrolled.

Fraud concerns 
Food stamp fraud occasionally draws attention, too. A Feb. 6, 2012, Reuters news story quoted Kevin Concannon, U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, as saying that fraud at that time accounted for 1 percent of food stamp benefits, while costing the government $750 million a year. ""This is $750 million that isn't being used to provide food to individuals and families, and that issue isn't lost on us,"" Concannon said.

The story said the program's ""biggest step forward in fraud prevention came in 2004, when the government replaced paper coupons with plastic cards that are loaded electronically like debit cards."" Concannon also said the program was adding high-tech strategies to its enforcement quiver, the story said, among them plans to work with social media firms and a data mining company to root out abuse. The agency has a website to solicit food-stamp fraud tips.

""While administrators work to reduce payment errors,"" the story said, ""the USDA is collaborating with state agencies to investigate recipients suspected of committing fraud or misusing benefits. It also will seek tougher penalties for stores engaged in trafficking. Trafficking generally takes the form of users ‘selling’ their benefits for roughly 50 cents on the dollar to brick-and-mortar retailers or to individuals found via websites like eBay or Facebook.""

Basis of claim 
Gallego’s claim did not speak directly to trafficking scams. But are 97 percent of food stamp benefits paid in proper amounts to eligible residents, as he said?

By email, Gallego spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña attributed the percentage to research by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. In a blog post revised May 16, 2013, the center said the House committee-approved version of the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, which Gallego and committee members were discussing when he spoke, would cut SNAP by almost $21 billion over the next decade, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, mostly working families with children and senior citizens.

The center said in a May 10, 2013, blog post: ""Only 3 percent of SNAP benefits represent overpayments, meaning they either went to ineligible households or went to eligible households but in excessive amounts. SNAP achieved its lowest error rate on record in fiscal year 2011, with a national overpayment rate of just 2.99 percent (see graph). The underpayment rate that year was 0.81 percent. Thus, the net loss to the federal government — the amounts lost through over­payments minus those saved by underpayments — was only 2.2 percent."" An accompanying graph, which we show below, was headlined: ""SNAP Error Rates Are at an All-Time Low.""

Also, the center said, relatively ""few payment errors reflect dishonesty or fraud. The overwhelming majority result from honest mistakes by recipients, eligibility workers, data entry clerks, or computer programmers. States report that almost 60 percent of the dollar value of overpayments and almost 90 percent of the dollar value of underpayments were their fault, not recipients’. Much of the rest of the overpayments resulted from innocent errors by households that had trouble navigating SNAP’s complex rules."" 
Government data

Information posted online by the Agriculture Department tracks with the center’s blog post, stating that in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, 2.99 percent of SNAP benefits were overpayments and 0.81 percent were underpayments. Wyoming had the highest share of overpayments that year, at 7.63 percent, and Alaska had the lowest, 0.53 percent, while 2.63 percent of SNAP payments in Texas were overpayments, according to the information.

Overpayments were more prevalent in previous years, annual department reports indicate, though the incidence dropped each year after fiscal 2006, when overpayments accounted for 4.82 percent of benefits. In fiscal 2000, in contrast, SNAP overpayments accounted for 6.51 percent of its benefits.

By email, Agriculture Department spokeswoman Elena Gaona told us information on overpayments of SNAP benefits in fiscal 2012 are due to be released by the end of June 2013.

An independent analysis 
Separately, we contacted Kay Brown, an analyst who has studied the food stamp program for the General Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Brown said by telephone that she has ""no problem"" with Gallego’s wording in that the government does assess whether the proper amounts are paid to eligible recipients.

Brown also said told us improper payments caused by participants’ failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, don’t necessarily indicate attempts to cheat, though for a May 5, 2005 GAO report, ""we could not determine the percentage of payment errors that involve participants intentionally withholding information."" Nationally in 2003, the report said, ""about 5 percent of all payment errors were referred for fraud investigation. Data are not available, however, to determine what percentage of these error cases resulted in disqualifying participants because of fraud.""  

The report said that almost two-thirds of food stamp payment errors were caused by government caseworkers, usually when they failed to keep up with reported changes or make mistakes applying program rules. Some one-third of payment errors were caused by participants’ failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, the report said.

Our ruling

Gallego said 97 percent of food stamp benefits ""are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible.""

We are mindful this claim did not speak to misdeeds that can occur once someone receives food stamps. Setting that aside, nearly 3 percent of such payments were overpayments in fiscal 2011, the latest year of available data, and nearly 1 percent were underpayments, according to the government. That’s a total of about 96 percent.

Gallego’s statement comes close enough. We rate it as True.","[('\nEmail (excerpted), Rebecca Acuña, communications director, U.S. Rep.

UPDATED: Jodie Laubenberg says Texas rape kit is like dilation and curettage procedure

","
The lead House sponsor of legislation pitched by advocates as improving the safety of abortion clinics and restricting certain late-term abortions described kits used after sexual assaults as akin to a procedure that scrapes out tissue lining the uterus.

In floor debate that would extend hours past midnight June 23, 2013, Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, mentioned ""rape kits"" after Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, presented an amendment to Senate Bill 5 to exempt victims of rape and incest from limits on abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. A day later, the GOP-majority House advanced the measure to the Senate for possible action before a 30-day special session was to end June 25.

Laubenberg, responding to questions from Democratic Reps. Joseph Moody of El Paso and Dawnna Dukes of Austin, framed her refusal to accept Thompson’s amendment by implying that rape kits used in hospitals can prevent unwanted pregnancy. Laubenberg said that currently, in ""the emergency rooms they have what’s called rape kits, that the woman can get cleaned out, basically like a D and C"" -- dilation and curettage surgery, often performed after miscarriages.

We looked into whether the representative was correct that a rape kit is akin to dilation and curettage surgery, ultimately finding no common ground or any factual basis for this claim.

Dilation and curettage, according to a fact sheet on the website of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is a surgical procedure that removes tissue from the lining of the uterus; it is often performed after a miscarriage. A woman’s cervix is dilated, or widened, to permit the use of instruments such as a curette, a thin metal tool with a scoop or ring on one end that is used to scrape the interior of the uterus. 
The doctors’ group put us in touch with Dr. Bonnie Dattel, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School, who said by phone that a D&C is sometimes performed after a miscarriage to remove material left from the pregnancy that could cause infection or excessive bleeding if left in place. 
In contrast, a rape kit typically consists of tools, storage containers and paperwork related to collecting evidence in the first days after a possible sexual assault, according to Texas experts we reached and information posted online by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization.

The network says: ""Following a sexual assault, the victim has the option to go to the hospital to have a forensic examination by a trained professional. During a forensic medical exam, a sexual assault evidence collection kit may or may not be used. The evidence kit affords the opportunity to collect any DNA that may have been left by the suspect.""

The network’s web page makes no mention of surgical procedures, instead saying a kit may contain instructions, bags and sheets for evidence collection, swabs, a comb, envelopes, blood collection devices and documentation forms.

An exam using the kit ""will most likely begin with the examiner obtaining a complete and thorough medical history from the victim. The medical forensic exam also involves a head-to-toe physical examination, which includes the genital area,"" the network says. The exam may also involve the collection of blood, urine, hair and other body secretion samples; photo documentation; the collection of the victim’s clothing, especially undergarments; and the collection of any possible physical evidence that may have transferred onto the victim from the rape scene, the network says.

""Once the examination is completed and all specimens are collected,"" the network says, ""they are carefully packaged and stored to assure that they are not contaminated.""

In interviews, representatives of the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, which says it’s committed to ending sexual violence in Texas, and the Collin County-based Turning Point Rape Crisis Center, which counsels rape survivors, elaborated on what a rape kit is and isn’t.

TAASA spokesman Rick Gipprich said by telephone that certified sexual assault nurse examiners typically use the kits to gather information and collect relevant samples.

Sometimes a pregnancy test is administered, Gipprich said, but that is solely to see if a survivor might have been pregnant before the assault. Also, he said, the pregnancy test is not part of the kit. In addition, Gipprich said, a survivor may be offered high-dose antibiotics to ward off sexually transmitted diseases as well as a ""morning after"" pill to prevent impregnation, though such drugs and those offers are not part of the kit, he said.

Jennifer Spugnardi, director of the Turning Point center, said by telephone that a rape kit is ""really papers and envelopes,"" reflecting the nurse examiner’s responsibility to document an incident. Spugnardi said the kits are sometimes called ""Sirchie kits,"" referring to a forensics supplies company that sells the kits. Online, we found a photo of a $15 Sirchie kit designed to meet criteria for a kit as spelled out in a publication from the Texas attorney general’s office. Sirchie describes the kit as containing legal and medical forms, oral swabs and hair combs and containers to separately hold clothing or biological samples.

Like Gipprich, Spugnardi said any prescribed medicines are not part of a rape kit. She also pointed out that a kit can be used for a female or male victim. Regardless, she said, a kit is not equivalent to the D and C surgery or related to it.

Spugnardi called the legislator’s statement ""a very poor choice of words.""

By email and telephone, we asked Laubenberg how she reached her conclusion. She didn’t immediately respond. After this article posted, however, Laubenberg said by telephone that she knows a rape kit does not include the D and C procedure and that a kit does not cause abortions. In the floor debate, Laubenberg said, she also was trying to say that a rape survivor who goes to a hospital might be offered the morning-after pill to ward off pregnancy, though she said that she is aware that the pill is not part of a rape kit.

In the debate, Laubenberg said, her point may have been muddled. ""You’re trying to get your thoughts out as fast as you can,"" she said. 
Our ruling

Laubenberg said a rape kit is equivalent to dilation and curettage surgery.

A rape kit consists of items a medical specialist employs to gather evidence related to a possible sexual assault. It is not the same as the D and C procedure, which removes the lining of the uterus.

We find this unsupported claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

Vos says study shows defendants skip court appearances more frequently in Wisconsin than in other states
","
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) says his support for a private bail system and bounty hunters in Wisconsin is a fiscal matter. 
The whole point of bond, Vos told a group of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors June 10, 2013, is to guarantee that defendants show up for court. 
""Anything that increases the ability of people to show up for court is a good thing because a smaller number of no-shows means more effective and efficient courts and hopefully a smaller cost for taxpayers,"" he said. 
Vos added: ""There was a study done by WPRI that showed that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. We’re one of only two or four states that doesn’t have bail bonds right now."" 
With Vos and his Republican colleagues in charge of the Legislature, their move to include a private bail measure in the state budget made its enactment a strong possibility. As it stands, only Wisconsin, Illinois, Oregon and Kentucky bar private bail. 
Gov. Scott Walker vetoed a broader provision in 2011, but Vos has narrowed the plan this time to a five-county experiment (Dane, Kenosha, Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha) of the type Walker signalled he could support. 
Under the proposed system, defendants would pay a bail agent 10 percent of the full bail amount. The company must pay 3 percent of the bail amount to the court. If the defendant fails to appear in court, the bonding company is liable for the full amount. 
But a bail agent usually has an opportunity to recover a no-show defendant -- often using bounty hunters. 
Bail companies say their work needs no taxpayer funding and enhances public safety by lowering the number of no-shows. Critics say it’s an unfair monetary burden on lower-income people and that elected judges should have primary say over who is held or walks free before trial. 
With that in mind, we wondered if Vos was on the mark claiming a study shows that Wisconsin court defendants fail to appear more often than in other states. 
Digging deeper 
Vos cited a March 2013 report (""Should Wisconsin Allow Commercial Bail in Pretrial Release?) by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute (WPRI), a conservative think-tank based in Hartland. 
For the report, which reviewed various studies on bail, the group hired Kate Lind, a Madison lawyer who is Walker’s campaign treasurer and was controller for the state Republican Party. She runs a political consulting firm that helps Republicans comply with campaign finance laws. Lind did an earlier study for WPRI on probation and parole. 
Her report concluded that bringing private bail back to Wisconsin, if integrated with pretrial assessments and services, would create a ""valuable option to prevent failure to appear while protecting the financial and public safety interests of Wisconsin."" 
We read Lind’s report and found no state-by-state comparisons of no-show rates, and no data for Wisconsin’s statewide no-show rate. 
Lind confirmed she never found any statistics showing that Wisconsin lags behind other states and that it’s probably impossible to do such a comparison due to the lack of data here and elsewhere. Criminal courts typically are county-based, so statewide figures are elusive. 
Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer agreed the study does not make the case on Wisconsin versus other states. 
Beyer said Vos believes you can infer a disadvantage for Wisconsin because government and academic studies of data from large U.S. counties (including Milwaukee County) have found a lower no-show rate on private bail bonds than on personal-recognizance bonds or most other forms of non-financial release. 
Those studies have limitations but do show that disparity, as we reported in rating False a claim by Democratic state Sen. Lena Taylor of Milwaukee that ""no statistical evidence"" exists that bail bonds increase the likelihood that defendants appear for scheduled hearings. 
Most significantly for evaluating Vos’ claim, those studies are not statewide and rely on data from 1998 and earlier in Milwaukee County, where judges say a 2012 internal study found their felony no-show rate is 16 percent. That is below the national average for large counties cited in various studies. 
Milwaukee County uses a system of methodically assessing criminal defendants’ risk of flight, and judges there say that would protect public safety better than a commercial bail system. 
Our rating 
Vos said a study of private bail bond systems ""showed that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states"" of defendants skipping court appearances. 
The study doesn’t compare states, and doesn’t include a Wisconsin figure. And while various studies of local municipalities show lower no-show rates for private bail and therefore suggest the same advantage would hold for Wisconsin, Vos spoke as if the question is settled. 
We rate his claim False.","[('\nMilwaukee Courier, ""Legislatively Speaking -- Sausage Making,"" op-ed by Senator Lena Taylor, June 7, 2013', 'http://milwaukeecourieronline.com/index.php/interests/lena-taylor/'), ('\nInterview with Kit Beyer, spokeswoman, Speaker Robin Vos, June 17, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail exchange with Eric Peterson, chief of staff, State Sen.

Social media post says U.K. has far higher violent crime rate than U.S. does
","The debate over gun policy has inspired a blizzard of messages on social media, from both supporters and opponents of gun control. We’ve checked some of these posts (often called ""memes"") in the past, but a reader recently sent us one we hadn’t seen, so we decided to take a look. The meme said: ""There are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K., making it the most violent place in Europe. Austria is second, with a rate of 1,677 per 100,000 people, followed by Sweden, Belgium, Finland and Holland. By comparison, America has an estimated rate of 466 violent crimes per 100,000. … So hey, Europe, how ‘bout you shut the #%[email protected] up about gun control?"" The meme includes a lot of figures, so we started out by looking at the United Kingdom and the United States. As we were conducting our research, we stumbled across a thoughtful critique of this claim on a blog called the Skeptical Libertarian that was written by Daniel Bier, a master’s degree candidate in economics at Rutgers University. (Bier fact-checked a claim that’s similar, though with slightly different wording than the meme we’re checking.) Bier’s primary concern about comparing crime rates in the United Kingdom and the United States is that the definitions of crimes in each country are significantly different. This was not reflected in news coverage in British newspapers that appear to have been the source of the meme. This oversight produced a misleading comparison. As Bier put it, ""The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports defines a ‘violent crime’ as one of four specific offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault."" By contrast, ""the British definition includes all ‘crimes against the person,’ including simple assaults, all robberies, and all ‘sexual offenses,’ as opposed to the FBI, which only counts aggravated assaults and ‘forcible rapes.’ "" Once you know this, Bier wrote, ""it becomes clear how misleading it is to compare rates of violent crime in the U.S. and the U.K. You’re simply comparing two different sets of crimes."" We thought Bier’s points were reasonable, so we tried to replicate his approach. We looked at the raw violent crime numbers for each country, using statistics for England and Wales for 2012 and for the United States for 2011, in a way that sought to compare apples to apples. (We should note that the United Kingdom includes Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the numbers in the meme appear to be based only on crime in England and Wales, which are calculated separately.) For England and Wales, we added together three crime categories: ""violence against the person, with injury,"" ""most serious sexual crime,"" and ""robbery."" This produced a rate of 775 violent crimes per 100,000 people. For the United States, we used the FBI’s four standard categories for violent crime that Bier cited. We came up with a rate of 383 violent crimes per 100,000 people. This calculation suggests that there is a higher rate of crime in England and Wales, but the discrepancy is not anywhere near as wide as the one cited in the meme. However, before we put too much credibility on these calculations, we should note that criminologists say there is actually no good way to compare violent crime rates in these two countries. Our rough effort to equalize the definitions improved the quality of the comparison, but what we did is not enough to fix the comparison entirely, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ""Once you get away from clearly defined terms like homicides, all kinds of problems come in,"" Fox said. ""You have to take comparisons not just with a grain of salt but with the entire shaker."" For instance, the vast majority of violent crimes are aggravated assaults, and this is a category that isn’t as well defined as homicides, rapes and robberies. Many aggravated assaults don’t result in an injury, Fox said, and even police in the same country don’t always use the same standard in counting this particular crime. Another problem is that aggravated assaults, rapes and robberies are victim-reported crimes, so whether the crime gets reported varies widely, depending on such factors as the victim’s trust in the police. This difference shows up in comparisons of FBI crime data, which consists of crimes reported to police, and the far higher rates of crime victimization found in a survey of Americans by the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. The survey counts all crimes that respondents say they have experienced, not just those they reported to police. The International Crime Victims Survey, conducted by an arm of the United Nations most recently in 2005, shows the difference between reported crime and all crimes committed by conducting polls that ask people if they've been victims of specific crimes. Polling data showed that England and Wales had 2,600 cases of robbery per 100,000 population and 8,100 cases of ""assaults and threats"" per 100,000. While those figures are even higher than the meme suggested, the U.S levels are also much higher -- 1,100 cases of robbery and 8,300 cases of assaults and threats per 100,000. And the rate of sexual assault is actually about 50 percent higher in the United States than it is in England and Wales. So this data set doesn’t support the thrust of the meme, either. ""Recorded crime data are problematic due to definitional issues, reporting rates and other concerns,"" said Shane D. Johnson, a professor in the University College of London Department of Security and Crime Science. ""There may also be considerable variation across counties, or states."" When we presented the Skeptical Libertarian blog post and our own research to the source of the meme -- Adam Kokesh, a libertarian activist -- an aide to Kokesh sent us the original link from the Daily Telegraph and said, ""We appreciate the close eye on that post and all the research."" Our ruling The meme said ""there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K.,"" compared to ""466 violent crimes per 100,000"" in the United States. Our preliminary attempt to make an apples-to-apples comparison shows a much smaller difference in violent crime rates between the two countries, but criminologists say differences in how the statistics are collected make it impossible to produce a truly valid comparison. We rate the claim False.

Mark Herring reverses position on gay marriage
","
Democrat Mark Herring stressed his differences with Republican Mark Obenshain during a recent debate between the attorney general candidates. 
But Herring said Obenshain was right on one point -- a charge that Herring had switched his stance on gay marriage. We rolled out the Flip-O-Meter to examine the extent of Herring’s change. Let’s journey back in time. 
In 2003, Herring unsuccessfully ran for the state Senate. He said marriage should be between a man and a woman, according to an Oct. 17 article that year in The Winchester Star. 
On Feb. 2, 2006, Herring was sworn in as a state senator after winning a special election in Loudoun County. Fifteen days later, he supported a resolution allowing Virginia voters to decide whether there should be a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Virginia law already defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But many referendum backers said the added constitutional amendment would shield the traditional marriage law from judicial tampering. 
Herring reiterated his support for the amendment during a Sept. 20, 2006, interview with Leesburg Today, saying it was consistent with Virginia’s existing marriage law. In November, the amendment was approved by 57 percent of voters. 
Herring sang a different tune this spring during his successful Democratic primary campaign for attorney general. 
On April 5, he released an ""Equality Agenda"" that said, ""Mark Herring believes that civil marriage is a fundamental right, and he supports marriage equality for same-gender couples."" Herring pledged to work ""to change the current law prohibiting such marriages."" 
Obenshain, a state senator from Harrisonburg since 2004, has been outspoken in his opposition to gay marriage. During a debate this June 15 with Herring, Obenshain said, ""I believe marriage is an institution to be entered into between a man and a woman. That’s an issue upon which Mark and I, until at least a few years ago, agreed."" 
Herring acknowledged that ""almost eight years ago"" he ""didn’t really feel comfortable"" about gay marriage. 
""But since that time, I’ve done a lot of thinking about it,"" he said. ""I’ve talked to my friends, my constituents. I talked to co-workers; I talked to my family, including my children. And like millions of Americans and a lot of Virginians, I don’t believe that way anymore and I think it’s wrong. 
""I don’t believe anybody should be treated as a second-class citizen and I don’t believe that the state should decide who you can and cannot marry. So I support marriage equality and as we work towards marriage equality, there are very specific things I, as attorney general, can do to help protect the rights of gay and lesbian Virginians.""

State Rep. Ron Hood links abortion and breast cancer in legislation
","A group of Ohio House Republicans has introduced legislation aimed at reducing abortions through an extensive list of restrictions and requirements. Rep. Ron Hood, R-Ashville, the sponsor of the legislation, House Bill 200, said he drafted it based on talks with the National Pro-Life Alliance. He said it was intended to make women more aware of what they are doing to ""make an informed choice."" Among its provisions, the bill would require abortion providers to tell patients about ""the increased risk of breast cancer"" from abortion. PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know more about that warning. We called to ask Hood for the source. His legislative aide referred us to the website of the Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer, an advocacy group that asserts there has been a ""cover-up"" of a link between abortion and breast cancer. A review of the website shows that the group's case for a link is supported largely by the work of Dr. Joel Brind, a member of the group's advisory board, who is a professor of biochemistry at Baruch College in New York City and is recognized as the leading proponent of an abortion-breast cancer link; and Dr. Angela Lanfranchi, a breast cancer surgeon in New Jersey who, with Brind, co-founded the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute to help publicize what is sometimes called the ABC (for abortion-breast cancer) link. A review of the history shows their work is a significant part of what has been called ""abortion politics."" Research on a possible connection had been going on for decades when Brind published an analysis in the 1990s that suggested a link between induced abortion (the deliberate ending of a pregnancy) and an increased risk of breast cancer. But the analysis was based on studies that relied on survey interviews of women, which were widely questioned because of factors including ""response bias"" --  the inaccurate self-reporting of medical history information by participants. Subsequent studies using larger groups and data not subject to bias found no link, according to sources including the National Cancer Institute. In 2003, largely because of political questions raised over the ""ABC link,"" the NCI convened a three-day conference of experts on abortion and cancer. Based on a review of population-based, clinical and animal studies, they concluded that having an abortion or miscarriage does not increase a woman’s subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. Hood also pointed specifically to a 2009 paper by Lanfranchi about the mechanisms of cancer. It asserted that a prematurely ended pregnancy leaves a woman with more cancer-susceptible breast tissue than when the pregnancy began. Also in 2009, however, the Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that ""more rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk."" PolitiFact does not do medical or scientific analysis. We rely, as we do in other areas, on the most reliable and independent sources available. The World Health Organization says that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer. Britain’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer. The American Cancer Society says: ""scientific research studies have not found a cause-and-effect relationship between abortion and breast cancer."" The Susan. G. Komen Foundation says there is no link. The National Cancer Institute gives its highest strength-of-evidence ratings to the statements that: Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Recognized spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Women who have had an induced abortion have the same risk of breast cancer as other women. Women who have had a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) have the same risk of breast cancer as other women. Cancers other than breast cancer also appear to be unrelated to a history of induced or spontaneous abortion. The credible research overwhelmingly contradicts the statement in Hood’s legislation. It’s a ridiculous claim, and even more ridiculous to force doctors to spread this misinformation to patients.

Billed as being for police and fire, Wisconsin phone fee does nothing for them, lawmaker says
","
If PolitiFact Wisconsin had a Truth-O-Meter rating called False But Revealing, we might give it to state Rep. Andre Jacque for a claim about what he described as the state’s ""radically misnamed"" police and fire protection fee. 
The DePere Republican went too far in decrying the 75-cent fee, which appears on Wisconsin phone bills every month and brings in some $50 million per year. 
Speaking with the conservative MacIver Institute on May 15, 2013, he said: 
""What does it do to support police and fire? Nothin.’"" 
But even though Jacque exaggerates the situation, his claim is revealing for anyone with a landline or wireless phone who pays what, in fact, is the misleadingly labeled ""police and fire protection fee."" 
The fee -- and a bill 
The fee was created in the 2009-11 state budget, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was in office and Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature. 
Phone service providers don’t have to itemize the fee on their bills. But if they do, they must -- by law -- identify it as a ""police and fire protection fee."" 
Back in 2009, the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, which retools the governor’s budget request before it goes to the full Legislature, initially proposed the fee to fund 911 system enhancements around the state. 
But later in the budget process, faced with projections of declining revenues, the committee redirected the phone fee funds. Rather than being dedicated to 911, the money would instead go toward ""shared revenue"" payments the state makes to counties, towns, villages and cities. 
Shared revenue is general, unrestricted aid to local governments. Typically, it is ""commingled with the local government's other revenues and is not directly tied to any specific function,"" the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau notes. 
In other words, shared revenue -- which ranks among the largest general fund state appropriations -- can be used toward a wide variety of local government operations, like parks, planning, roads, snow plowing, garbage collection, not just police and fire. 
Redirecting the money was supposed to last only two years. But Doyle vetoed that provision, which meant the money would continue to be used toward shared revenue payments. 
Republican Gov. Scott Walker kept the same arrangement in his 2011-13 budget and is not proposing to change it in his 2013-15 budget. 
Upset with the whole thing, Jacque has introduced a bill to eliminate the fee, which is projected to bring in $53 million per year during the 2013-15 budget cycle. 
Jacque’s argument 
Jacque defended his statement to us by saying that because phone fee revenue goes to the state’s general fund, it does nothing to support police and fire protection. 
But that overstates what is happening. 
While the roughly $50 million per year in phone fee money might technically go to the state’s general fund, it is earmarked for shared revenue and thus ends up with local governments. 
So, indirectly, the phone fee helps support police and fire, given that a county sheriff’s department, or a city police or fire department, are among the largest expenses in local government. 
Our rating 
Jacque said a 75 cents-per-month ""police and fire protection fee"" on Wisconsin phone bills does nothing to support police and fire. 
The $50 million per year in phone fee revenue isn’t dedicated to police and fire protection. But the money does support those services indirectly, in that it goes to local governments, which spend a large portion of their budgets on police and fire services.   
We give a nod to Jacque for highlighting the misleading nature of the police and fire phone fee, but we rate his claim False.","[('\nYouTube, MacIver Institute ""Andre Jacque proposes bill"" video, May 15, 2013', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVXD5JQO920&feature=youtu.be'), ('\nEmail interview, Rep.

Georgia Power customers pay lower rates than most, official says
","
So, do Georgia Power customers pay less for their services than people in other parts of the country? 
The answer is yes, a company official said at a June 10 community meeting. 
How much less? Ten percent to 15 percent below the national average, said Ron Shipman, the company’s vice president of environmental affairs. 
PolitiFact Georgia heard about the claim and decided to do some research. Georgia Power has nearly 2.4 million customers. That’s about one out of every three adults in this state. 
The Partnership for Southern Equity, an organization that tries to help the working poor in metro Atlanta, put together the meeting. 
  
The crux of the meeting was that there ends up being a lot of inequity in the communities when it comes to utility bills. Some low-income Atlanta-area residents live in older homes that are not energy-efficient, thus, their utility bills are super high. 
Company officials at the meeting stressed that there are programs to help those people. In general, the company contended at the meeting, their service is less expensive in comparison to other parts of the country. We found the company has been below the national average, but by how much? 
Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., is regulated by the state’s Public Service Commission. It gets 47 percent of its fuel from natural gas; 35 percent from coal; 18 percent from nuclear; and a small amount from hydropower and other renewable sources. As a regulated monopoly, Georgia Power must provide electricity to all customers in its territory. It is allowed to recoup the costs of providing that power plus a profit. The average bill was expected to increase by 44 cents a month in January. 
Georgia Power credits programs such as free in-home energy audits for residential customers plus others that assist commercial customers in installing energy-efficient equipment in their facilities for lower costs than most utilities. The company also recently introduced My Power Usage – an online program that allows residential customers to track their daily energy costs, view their projected bill, set up email notifications about their usage and more, company spokesman Jacob Hawkins said. 
Georgia Power bases its claim on how much it charges customers for its services, Hawkins said. In 2012, Georgia Power customers paid about 9 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average, he said, was 10.13 cents per kilowatt hours. The difference was about 11 percent. 
The federal government has an agency that keeps track of how much money Americans pay for energy use, the U.S. Energy Information Administration. EIA data are used by other organizations, such as the Edison Electric Institute, an 80-year-old organization of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies. The EIA figures we found for Georgia Power customers in 2012 were nearly identical to what the company sent us. The national average in 2012 was slightly lower, 9.865 cents per kilowatt hour. Thus, Georgia Power customers paid 8.7 percent less than the national average, according to our analysis of 2012 data. In 2011, we found Georgia Power customers paid 2.9 percent below the national average. 
Before 2011, Georgia Power customers paid 10 percent less than the national average eight consecutive years. They paid more than 15 percent below the national average in five of those years. 
Georgia Power officials sent us their own figures, saying it’s not an ""apples to apples"" comparison to include every utility company in the nation. The company shared a comparison that focused solely on investor-owned utilities. Georgia Power’s numbers showed its customers paid 10 percent or more below the national average in nine of the past 10 years. In 2011, Georgia Power customers paid 5.1 percent below the national average. 
To sum up, Georgia Power official Ron Shipman said the company’s customers pay 10 percent to 15 percent below the national average. Our findings showed Shipman’s numbers were off the past two years but on point for the prior eight years. Georgia Power’s research was fairly similar. 
Since he was slightly off for 2012, but right for eight of the nine years before that, we rate Shipman’s claim as Mostly True.","[('\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""Standing pat.

Taylor says alleged advantage to bail bonds is not backed by any evidence
","
Unaccountable, armed bounty hunters breaking down doors in Milwaukee, profiting on the criminal justice system. 
State Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) raised that specter after a last-minute Republican budget action on June 5, 2013 that would authorize private bail agents to work in five Wisconsin counties at a judge’s discretion -- Milwaukee, Waukesha, Racine, Kenosha and Dane. 
""Bail Bonds are back,"" Taylor wrote in a June 7, 2013 opinion piece in the Milwaukee Courier, a weekly newspaper. ""Since the early 1970’s private bail bondsmen and bounty hunters have been illegal in Wisconsin. In the 2011 budget, Republicans tried to introduce them back to Wisconsin, but Governor Walker wisely vetoed them out of the budget."" 
Taylor then took on one of the key talking points used by bonding companies in favor of the GOP plan. 
""There is no statistical evidence that bail bonds increase the likelihood of those awaiting trial returning to court for their scheduled hearings, etc.,"" Taylor wrote. ""In fact, this provision is widely opposed by almost everyone in the criminal justice system in Wisconsin, especially in Milwaukee."" 
Wisconsin hasn't had a commercial bail bonds system since 1979, and many leaders within the state's justice system want to keep it that way. 
A key issue in the debate is whether use of a bail bondsman gets more defendants to show up for court, so we wondered about Taylor’s claim that ""no statistical evidence"" supports the notion that bail bonds bring that about. 
How bail bonds work 
National research suggests that about 60 percent of felony defendants in large counties are released while their cases are pending; the figure was 75 percent in Milwaukee County during a period studied in 2012. Studies focus on felony cases. 
Under the proposed bail bonds system, defendants would pay a bail agent 10 percent of the full cash bail amount. The company must pay 3 percent of the bail amount to the court. If the defendant fails to appear in court, the bonding company is liable for the full amount. But a bail agent usually has an opportunity to recover a no-show defendant using bounty hunters. 
These ""private bail bonds"" or ""surety"" bonds are in use in 46 states and long have been the most common form of pretrial release. 
Types of financial release include full cash bond, and in some states but not Wisconsin, ""deposit bonds"" with a partial bail paid to the court. The most common types of non-financial release are personal recognizance and conditional release, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics said in a 2010 report. 
In Milwaukee County, for example, 60% of felons in the 2012 study were released on personal recognizance bonds, meaning they aren’t liable to pay unless they fail to appear. The other 40% had to pay cash -- or stay in jail before trial. 
Bail companies say their work needs no taxpayer funding and enhances public safety. 
Critics say it’s an unfair monetary burden on lower-income people, and Milwaukee County judges say they are in a better position, using sophisticated risk analyses of defendants, to judge whether the accused should be held or walk free while their cases are in process. Milwaukee County’s no-show rate in that 2012 study period was 16 percent in felony cases. 
Taylor’s claim 
Asked for backup, Taylor’s office pointed us to a widely cited Bureau of Justice Statistics report issued in 2007. The arm of the Justice Department examined the pretrial releases of 71,000 state-court defendants in eight years from 1990 to 2004 in the 75 largest U.S. counties, including some Milwaukee County cases. 
But that report cites an advantage for bail bonds, undercutting Taylor’s claim rather than bolstering it. 
That study said the no-show rate for those on bail bonds was 18 percent, vs. 30 percent for those released on unsecured bond. The no-show rate was lowest for defendants who pledged property equal to the value of their bail. 
In 2008, one of the authors of that study, Thomas H. Cohen, published a narrower follow-up study using the same county-based federal data. 
He found that no-show rates were twice as high in five U.S. counties that make little use of private bail bonds, compared to five counties that use the approach a lot. No Wisconsin counties were included in that study. 
Surveying the research as a whole on the topic, Cohen wrote: ""Various studies conducted at both the academic and non-academic levels have also found that surety agents outperform other kinds of pretrial release at preventing court skips."" 
Case closed? 
Not quite. 
Researchers on both sides say a key question is whether this correlation between bail bonds and a lower no-show rate means that the type of bond causes the disparity. To gauge that, local differences in bail-setting practices must be accounted for. 
The Bureau of Justice Statistics itself issued an advisory to researchers and the media in 2010 warning that its data ""are insufficient to explain causal associations between the patterns reported, such as the efficacy of one form of pretrial release over another."" 
The advisory said factors associated with a defendant’s pre-trial misconduct also would have to be considered -- things like a defendant’s community ties, employment status, income, educational background, drug abuse history, and mental health status. 
Various studies have tried to determine what causes the bail-bond advantage by comparing similarly situated defendants and controlling for other factors. 
Perhaps the most widely cited study of that kind was published in 2004 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Law and Economics. It was authored by Alexander Tabarrok and Eric Helland, economists at George Mason University and Claremont McKenna College, respectively. 
The study suggested that defendants released on private bail bonds are 28 percent less likely to fail to appear than similar defendants released on their own recognizance (no money bail). It also found that if defendants released on bail bonds do no-show, they are 53 percent less likely to remain a fugitive for extended periods. 
Tabarrok is the Bartley J. Madden Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank at George Mason that has received major funding from lightning-rod conservative industrialist Charles Koch, a Mercatus director. Tabarrok is also research director at the Independent Institute. 
Helland is an economist at Claremont McKenna, a former economic adviser to the George W. Bush administration and is currently a researcher at the  RAND Institute for Civil Justice, a non-profit research organization that seeks a more efficient and more equitable justice system. 
Critics of private bail bonds, including the Pretrial Justice Institute, point to the Bureau of Justice Statistics own advisory and say that only local studies can draw hard conclusions on the reasons for varying no-show rates. 
The institute, funded mainly by the Justice Department and the liberal Public Welfare Foundation, advocates to reduce pre-trial detention when assessments predict that defendants pose no threat and will return for court appearances. It cites other factors necessary to judge the value of different release methods. 
""For example, do we want potentially dangerous defendants to buy their way out of jail? Do we want low risk indigent defendants to take up expensive jail space because they cannot afford the services of a bail bondsman?""  the group asked in a 2010 paper. 
Our rating 
Taylor said ""there is no statistical evidence that bail bonds increase the likelihood of those awaiting trial returning to court for their scheduled hearings."" 
There’s no definitive evidence, to be sure, but various statistical studies have shown that bail bonds are associated with, and may be a cause of, lower no-show rates. 
The studies are not without their limitations, and don’t settle the broad policy argument over bail bonds, but Taylor’s blanket assertion is off base.

Steve Sweeney claims Chris Christie doesn't support a minimum wage hike, gay marriage or women's health care
","
  
When it comes to rallying support for minimum wage, marriage equality and women’s health care, Gov. Chris Christie is very far apart from Democrats on those key issues, according to state Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester). 
Sweeney emphasized the divide in a recent interview during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron’ on NJTV. 
""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care,"" Sweeney said. ""There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."" Sweeney last week endorsed Barbara Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, in November’s gubernatorial contest with Christie. 
For this fact check we’re looking only at the claim that Christie doesn’t support these issues -- concerns that PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed previously. What we have determined is that while Christie sees these issues differently than Democrats, it’s not quite true that he doesn’t support them at all. 
Let’s look back at claims on each topic, starting with minimum wage. 
In January Christie vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. So he didn’t support the Democrat proposal -- but he offered an alternative that Democrats reject: phase in a $1 increase over three years and eliminate automatic hikes. 
Next, marriage equality. 
Christie, a Catholic, has said repeatedly that same-sex marriage goes against his beliefs, but has said he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples. Back in February, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested a referendum on gay marriage for the Nov. 5 general election. 
That suggestion drew fire after several lawmakers, including Sweeney, said same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and doesn’t belong on a ballot. 
Finally, let’s look at where Christie stands on women’s health care. 
State Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) in May 2011 claimed that six of New Jersey’s 58 family planning centers closed after Christie stripped $7.5 million in funding for the centers from his first budget for fiscal year 2011. 
Representatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures. 
Christie has since rejected at least three efforts by the Legislature to restore the family planning funding that he cut, noting on several occasions that New Jersey residents have access to ""comprehensive reproductive health care services"" at other sites and the state can’t afford to ""provide duplicative funding for family planning centers."" The centers that closed were in rural parts of South Jersey. 
To recap, the governor proposed an alternative to the Democrats’ proposal on minimum wage that would mean a smaller hike for low-income earners; opposes same-sex marriage personally but suggested it be a matter for public referendum; and cut funding for women’s health care, saying family planning services were available elsewhere. 
""That’s 100 percent accurate in terms of the distortions and outright misrepresentations of the Governor’s positions that have been repeated over and over by the Buono campaign and its allies,"" Christie for Governor campaign spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. ""Unfortunately it’s not a surprising tactic from an increasingly desperate campaign that continues to fall further and further behind."" 
Senate Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly could not be reached for comment. 
Our ruling 
Sweeney said, ""People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care,"" Sweeney said during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ ""There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."" 
We’ve determined that Christie appears to support a minimum-wage hike, albeit one that is quite a bit smaller than the one supported by Democrats; opposes gay marriage, but supports civil unions and letting voters decide the matter via referendum; and cut funding for that women’s health care that closed six family planning centers in the state. 
We rate Sweeney’s claim Mostly True.

John Loughlin says Rhode Island's General Assembly is one of the most expensive in the U.S.
","
Everybody wants lower taxes and one way to get them is to have the government spend less. One suggestion for cutting the Rhode Island budget was made June 7, when Republican John Loughlin, a former state representative from Tiverton and unsuccessful candidate for Congress, was a guest host on WPRO talk radio. 
""We have one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country,"" he said. ""In fact, we're right behind Alaska. And the reason Alaska is so expensive is 'cause those guys have to fly in airplanes to attend General Assembly meetings. But we pay per capita more than the state of New York [and] more than the state of California per capita for their General Assemblies."" 
On the air, he invited PolitiFact Rhode Island to check his assertion that Rhode Island's General Assembly is one of the most expensive and, because it sounded interesting, we gave him a call to ask for his evidence. 
Loughlin sent us a one-page chart that gave a state-by-state breakdown of legislative expenses and state budgets for the 2010-2011 fiscal year, along with U.S. Census data needed for a per capita calculation. 
According to that chart, which was developed in March by the National Conference of State Legislatures based on Census data, Rhode Island doesn't just have ONE of the most expensive legislatures. It was the second-most expensive, behind Alaska. 
While most Americans spent, on average, $9.13 per person on the legislative branch of their state governments, Rhode Islanders spent nearly three times as much -- $26.00 per capita. 
Alaska ranked first, at $71.27; Pennsylvania was third, at $23.67; Hawaii was fourth, at $22.46; and North Dakota was fifth, at $19.83. New York, which Loughlin also mentioned, was 20th at $11.41 per person and California was 32nd at $8.53 per capita. 
Connecticut, which ranked seventh, had the second-most expensive legislature in New England. Its per-capita cost was $15.91, 39 percent less than Rhode Island's. The cost in Massachusetts, which has a full time legislature instead of a part-time body like Rhode Island's, was $8.57 per person; the Bay State ranked 31st. 
Why is Rhode Island's ranking so high? 
Larry Berman, the spokesman for House Speaker Gordon Fox, said, ""When it comes to state legislatures, it is very difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison because of so many variables."" 
He noted that Montana ranks sixth even though it meets for only 90 days every other year and North Dakota, ranked fifth, meets for no more than 80 days during odd-numbered years. 
Also, Rhode Island's legislative budget includes some expenses that other states list under other categories, Berman said. 
In 2011, Berman said, ""$4,634,000 of the General Assembly’s budget was earmarked that year for the auditor general’s office . . . [which has] 44 employees [who] work independently of the legislature to evaluate programs throughout state government."" Other states don't include audit expenses in the legislative budget, he said. 
Also, ""the budget that year contained $1,298,000 for the operation of our own Capitol Television channel.  In other states, the television production may be operated by public television or contained within another part of the state budget,"" he said. 
In addition, Berman said the 2011 fiscal year was the year the budget ""included $1.5 million for the once-every-10-year function of redistricting. While every state is mandated federally to conduct this process, it does significantly increase our state’s legislative budget for that year only."" 
But when we looked at rankings for the previous five years, when redistricting wasn't done, Rhode Island again ranked second in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It dropped to third place, behind Pennsylvania, in 2009 and 2010. In all six years, per capita costs ranged from $25.01 to $26.78. 
The expenses cited by Fox's office amounted to about $7.4 million. That's out of a total budget of $27.3 million. Even when we pulled out that money, Rhode Island still ranked near the top, with $19.03 spent by the Assembly for every man, woman and child, putting us in fifth place instead of second. 
And if you look at what percent of the total state budget goes to the legislature when these expenses are subtracted, instead of 0.43 percent, the ratio dropped to 0.31 percent, putting us in a three-way tie for fourth place. 
John Simmons, executive director of the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, said because of its smaller size -- only seven other states have fewer people -- Rhode Island doesn't have as many people to share the basic costs of government. 
""Anytime you're in the top 10 it's a cause for concern, but then when you look at the size of Rhode Island and the economies of scale, most of the smaller-population states are higher ranked"" than average, he said. 
Our ruling 
John Loughlin said Rhode Island has ""one of the most expensive General Assemblies, per capita, in the entire country."" 
The National Conference of State Legislatures has consistently ranked Rhode Island as second or third in the United States. The amount paid to run the legislature -- more than $27 million in the 2011 fiscal year -- translates to $26.00 per resident. 
Even if you remove more than $7 million in expenses that, according to House Speaker Gordon Fox's office, aren't usually in a legislative budget, Rhode Island's ranking only drops to about fifth. 
Because that still makes Rhode Island's legislative budget ""one of the most expensive,"" we rate Loughlin's statement as True.

Does TriMet spend $10 million a year for transit police to respond to non-transit calls?
","
The Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 757, took to newspaper outlets this month, berating TriMet for causing its own financial troubles. The union represents bus drivers, mechanics and support staff for the Portland-area’s public transit system. The two sides are in contract negotiations. 
The union’s large-size ad, which appeared in The Oregonian and other publications, takes aim at TriMet for what union leaders describe as squandered spending. For example, the ad says TriMet spends $10.3 million a year for transit police who are rarely around. 
""We love our transit police officers. They are competent and caring. But we seldom see them. This is because they must respond to non-transit calls. When we ask what these 56 officers do for $10 million per year, TriMet’s response is that it doesn’t audit performance under the contracts,"" reads the ad, titled ""TriMet Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?""  
We haven’t the faintest idea who handles security on MAX and buses, or how duties are allocated. So we were game to check it out. Does TriMet pay $10 million a year for 56 transit officers who respond to non-transit calls and aren’t around much? 
TriMet’s public affairs department says the assertions are inaccurate. It issued a point-by-point rebukethat you can read on its website. The transit agency says that the Transit Police Division has 62 sworn law enforcement officers on contract, led by a Portland Police commander. In 2011-12, TriMet budgeted $8.64 million -- of which $8.15 million was spent on salaries, benefits, insurance and vehicles. 
While waiting for Bruce Hansen, union president, to return our calls and emails, we decided to take a look-see into the TriMet budget adopted for 2013-14. Because we’re not really sure why TriMet cites 2011-12 numbers in response to a claim made in June 2013. 
We scrolled through the budget and found on page SS-5, $10.2 million for police security contracts. A follow-up conversation with TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch illuminated that the security contract costs are even higher -- there’s just over $500,000 for the canine unit -- for a total of $10.7 million. 
So, the transit union appears to be pretty spot on with the dollar amount. TriMet says the number of officers is 62, not 56, as stated in the ads. 
Hansen said that they relied on information received from TriMet through public records requests. He’s not sure why TriMet is using 2011-12 figures either. TriMet says that’s what the union requested. We’ll leave that alone. 
Now, what about the union’s assertion that transit police have to respond to non-transit calls? 
TriMet has policing contracts with 17 law enforcement agencies in the region. Each agency contributes a set number of officers who make up the Transit Police Division. The number may change based on officer availability, but Portland Police provides the largest number of officers. 
Transit police is a contracted service, but it’s not unlike other police divisions. Officers apply for a post. They serve multi-year terms. Members are expected to patrol vehicles and stations and enforce TriMet ordinances, such as not smoking at shelters and at MAX platforms. 
The union suggests that the public is not getting enough value for the amount of money spent on transit police. We have no idea if that’s a fair accusation, although TriMet says transit police spend at least 70 percent of their contracted time on transit related matters. 
TriMet has been much in the news. The Oregonian has reported on sleepy drivers behind the wheel, sneakily distributed pay raises for executives and managers and historic fare increases and service cutbacks. In other words, we’re sure TriMet has way more problems to worry about than a mere $10 million transit police contract, out of a $485 million operating budget for Fiscal Year 2014, which starts July 1. 
Let’s go to the ruling. The agency has budgeted $10.2 million for police contracts. The budgeted amount is $10.7 million if you include the canine program. We think those numbers are pretty close to the $10.3 million cited by the union. The number of officers is 62 according to TriMet, which again, we don’t see as being that significantly different from 56. 
Are transit police seldom seen? That’s not something we can rule on. We suppose that is in the eye of the beholder. Must transit police respond to non-transit related calls? Yes, that’s because they are sworn officers who must respond to whatever calls roll in, just like any law enforcement officer on the job. 
The statement is accurate but needs clarification as to number of officers and why they’re not dedicated solely to TriMet. We rule the statement Mostly True.","[('\nAmalgamated Transit Union, Local 757 (accessed June 17, 2013)', 'http://www.atu757.org/'), ('\nTransitVoice.org, ""TriMet Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?""', 'No link'), ('\nTriMet, ""Fact Check: ""TriMet Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?""

"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says the 2014-15 Texas budget increases spending by less than the rate of inflation and population growth.
","
Texas would go the way of California, a Wall Street Journal editorial warned June 7, 2013, if Gov. Rick Perry didn’t veto the state’s ""biggest spending spree in memory"" -- a 26 percent surge, it said. 
Them’s fighting words. Responding to a June 10, 2013, question about the editorial, Perry said, ""I’m not sure that those who are making that criticism have a really good handle on the Texas budget process.""   
Perry said, ""When you back out the supplemental from the 2013 budget cycle and then you take into account the growth, it is less than population and inflation combined."" 
Let’s unpack that. Lawmakers approved a 2014-15 budget totaling $94.6 billion in general revenue, as in state, spending. But they also adopted so-called supplemental spending measures: House Bill 10, shoring up the budget that runs through August 2013, and House Bill 1025, which likewise allocates money to be spent during the 2013 fiscal year but also contains appropriations for fiscal 2014 and ’15. Perry signed all three measures into law. 
Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle told us via email that the governor’s comment on the editorial meant the budget would not outpace inflation and population growth if HB 10 and the 2013 portion of HB 1025 were counted as part of the 2012-13 budget. 
Three close observers of the state budget told us they would do the same as Perry in assigning the 2013 supplemental money to the 2012-13 budget. In contrast, the Journal cited calculations by the conservative, Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation based on comparing all state funds appropriated by the 2011 Legislature to all such funds appropriated by the 2013 Legislature, foundation official Bill Peacock told us by email. 
Given that Perry focused on the 2014-15 budget, we looked at whether that spending is expected to outpace inflation and population growth. 
For years, Perry has unsuccessfully urged lawmakers to send voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit state spending increases to the projected rate of population/inflation growth. But current law caps state spending based on the expected growth of Texans’ personal income. 
According to a Nov. 14, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, population and inflation had increased an average of 9 percent per budget biennium since the mid-1990s, compared to a 12 percent growth rate in personal income. 
State law directs the Legislative Budget Board to come up with the personal income rate, and at a Nov. 15, 2012, meeting, the board voted to adopt State Comptroller Susan Combs’ predicted rate of 10.71 percent as the spending cap for the 2014-15 biennium. 
The board isn’t required to estimate population/inflation growth, but board staff spokesman John Barton told us by phone that before that meeting, board staff members had collected three research firms’ October 2012 predictions of Texas’s 2014-15 population/inflation increase. 
New York-based Moody’s Analytics predicted a rate of 8.9 percent and Colorado-based IHS Global Insight projected a 7.22 percent rate, Barton said. A Waco-based economic research firm, the Perryman Group, used a Texas-specific inflation rate to forecast 9.85 percent growth, Barton said. 
Staffers didn’t circulate those estimates to the board members, Barton said. However, at the board meeting, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst asked board staff director Ursula Parks for an estimate of likely population/inflation growth in the 2014-15 budget period. Parks gave the Perryman Group’s prediction of 9.85 percent growth. 
Dewhurst replied: ""Bet you lunch it’s less. A little less."" He and Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, then pledged to bring in a 2014-15 budget increasing state spending less than 9.85 percent. 
Barton told us the 9.85 percent rate was reached by compounding Perryman’s estimates of 3.65 percent population growth and 5.98 percent inflation growth for Texas. 
Another inflation-population projection emerged in January 2013, Barton said, when the comptroller, who advises lawmakers on incoming revenues, predicted a two-year inflation/population increase of 6.56 percent. Also, in May 2013, Moody’s updated its projection to 7.82 percent, Barton said. That was about a percentage point lower than what it provided in late 2012. 
By email, fiscal analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities told us she arrived at a 6.6 percent projected population/inflation increase by adding predicted Texas population and U.S. Consumer Price Index growth rates published by the comptroller Jan. 7, 2013. However, DeLuna said, that ""seems very low by historical standards"" and unlikely to happen. 
""If actual population and inflation growth turns out to be closer to... what it’s been since the 1990s, then these appropriated levels won’t keep up with that,"" she said. 
Four categories of money make up Texas’ budgets: general revenue, general revenue that’s dedicated to a specific purpose, federal funds and ""other funds."" 
General revenue tends to get the most attention because it’s directly under the Legislature’s control -- it comes from taxes and fees set by the state, not the federal government, and how it is spent is not controlled by dedications in the Texas Constitution. 
The 2012-13 budget, advanced by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry in 2011, contained $81.3 billion in general revenue spending, according to the budget board’s January 2012 ""Fiscal Size-Up"" report. In a January 2013 report, the board issued an adjusted, final 2012-13 total of $87.4 billion that anticipated the amounts the 2013 Legislature would later add in the supplemental bills. Those included emergency costs such as wildfire expenses and payments of more than $4.5 billion to cover Medicaid and children’s health care shortfalls not covered in 2011. 
The 2014-15 budget that lawmakers sent to Perry on June 5, 2013, contained $94.6 billion in general revenue spending, according to the budget committee’s final report, dated May 23, 2013. 
That indicates state spending in the adopted 2014-15 budget alone -- not counting supplementals -- was up 16.4 percent from what legislators approved in 2011. 
All spending, counting federal and other monies, rose 3.7 percent, according to a chart emailed to us by Barton, totaling $197 billion for 2014-15. 
But we still have to account for the supplemental spending measures of 2013. 
The supplemental measures added $5.4 billion in general revenue to the 2012-13 budget and $387 million general revenue plus $3.9 billion in ""rainy day"" fund money to the 2014-15 budget -- although $2 billion of the rainy day money won’t be withdrawn if voters turn down a November 2013 proposed constitutional amendment to authorize a water infrastructure bank. 
Those supplemental amounts (counting the $2 billion water money) increase state spending in the 2012-13 budget to $87.4 billion and elevate state spending in 2014-15 to $95 billion. 
So with the supplementals factored in, we calculate that state spending is expected to rise 8.7 percent. 
In all-funds spending that included the supplements, the budget board chart showed a 4.9 percent increase from $190.7 billion to $200.1 billion. 
And what do other analysts say about the increase in state spending compared to the 9.85 percent projected increase in population/inflation? 
DeLuna, Williams spokesman Gary Scharrer and Dale Craymer, president of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, each emailed us analyses. All three used adjusted general-revenue totals very close to what we drew from budget documents, counting supplemental money appropriated for 2013 as part of the 2012-13 budget. 
Their estimates of the budget’s growth from 2012-13 to 2014-15 ranged from 8 percent to 8.7 percent. 
In contrast, the Texas foundation cited by the Journal said $106 billion in general revenue and ""rainy day"" fund money was appropriated ""in 2013,"" according to Peacock’s explanation. Using rounded figures, the foundation reached $106 billion by starting with $95 billion of general revenue spending in the 2014-15 budget, then adding amounts from HB 10 and HB 1025: $7 billion in general revenue and $4 billion in rainy day money. 
Estimating that the Legislature appropriated $84 billion ""during the 2011 session"" yielded the increase of 26 percent. 
The foundation’s explanation says, ""Now, this discussion of session spending is different than the traditional method of looking at spending on a biennial basis. … Both are accurate. They simply provide two different views."" 
Upshot: Williams’ office and two outside groups compared all the money scheduled to be spent during fiscal 2012 and ’13 with all the money scheduled to be spent during fiscal 2014 and ’15. The foundation compared all the money in bills passed by the 2011 Legislature with all the money in bills passed by the 2013 Legislature. 
  
Our ruling 
Perry said the 2014-15 Texas budget that legislators approved would keep spending increases below combined changes in population and inflation. 
Setting aside the foundation’s analysis, which split expenditures by when they were authorized and not which budget they belonged to, we found that state spending rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. 
That falls below the 9.85 percent population/inflation rate embraced by legislators last fall, which is also in line with recent biennial average increases of 9 percent. Then again, the spending could exceed other predictions for that rate. 
On balance, we rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.","[('\nWall Street Journal editorial, ""Texas Goes Sacramento,"" June 7, 2013', 'https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324299104578527193464764384.html'), ('\nAustin American-Statesman news story, ""Perry heads to New York, Connecticut to drum up business for Texas,"" June 10, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nTexas Legislative Budget Board web page, ""83rd Spending Appropriations,"" accessed online June 20, 2013', 'http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/perry-heads-to-new-york-connecticut-to-drum-up-bus/nYHQt/'), ('\nEmail interviews, excerpted, with Allison Castle, director of communications, Office of Gov.

Food stamp cuts would deny aid to millions and deny school lunch aid to thousands, says Barbara Lee
","
When the House of Representatives voted down the 2013 food bill, cuts in the food stamp program played a central role. 
The bill as a whole aimed to reduce spending by about $40 billion, with about half of the total coming from a range of nutrition programs. Democrats vigorously opposed the plan. ""The price of a farm bill should not be making more people hungry in America,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during Thursday’s debate. 
One claim about what the cuts would do to families came earlier in the week from Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. In an interview on MSNBC, Lee said the cuts would mean ""2 million less people on food stamps. 210,000 children will not receive school lunches or breakfasts."" 
Judging by the House vote, 234 opposed versus 195 in favor, that sort of argument was persuasive, although some of the opposition also came from conservatives who thought the farm bill as a whole was too expensive. We thought the claim about the impact on families would bear a closer look. 
Lee’s office pointed us to a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group that generally favors government aid to society’s less fortunate members. That report highlighted a couple of key changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. Among the most significant, the House measure would eliminate something called ""categorical eligibility.""   
Categorical eligibility allows states to use one set of criteria for its welfare programs, a move that reduces red tape but also has the effect of granting food stamps to people with incomes or assets slightly above the federal cutoff. 
The CBPP report cited a 2012 Congressional Budget Office study that said getting rid of categorical eligibility would reduce the program rolls by about 1.8 million people. (About 47.7 million people are currently in the program.) The CBO is the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress. Its analysts also wrote that the change would likely ""increase the time required to verify information on SNAP applications, which would probably result in more errors and greater administrative costs."" 
Analysts who think Congress ought to do away with categorical eligibility don’t challenge the CBO numbers. Rachel Sheffield with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, opposes a broad approach to eligibility, as well as a measure called Heat and Eat, which allows states to make what she says are unrealistic allowances for a family’s utility bills. 
""Loopholes like broad-based categorical eligibility and Heat & Eat have allowed the rolls to swell and should be eliminated,"" Sheffield said. 
But that is a matter of policy, not the numbers in the CBO estimate. Sheffield agrees that the number of SNAP participants would decline and in her view, that would be better. 
In some states, there is a direct connection between food stamps, which go to a household, and free and reduced-price school meals, which go to the children. Basically, in those states, if a family gets food stamps, the children automatically qualify for a break on the price of breakfast and lunch at school. 
In an analysis of the latest bill, the CBO estimated that reducing the food stamp rolls would mean that about 210,000 children would lose automatic eligibility for the school meals program. However, they might still qualify; they would need to apply separately. So to say that all 210,000 would no longer be able to participate goes beyond the CBO analysis. 
Our ruling 
Lee said that cuts in the House farm bill would leave 2 million people without food stamps and remove 210,000 children from the school breakfast and lunch program. Ultimately, both numbers go back to the Congressional Budget Office, which is generally seen as impartial. The CBO analysis largely supports the food stamp rolls reduction, but there is more uncertainty regarding school meal subsidies. She is off a little bit on the 2 million number; it's actually 1.8 million. And, with school lunches, it's uncertain that all 210,000 would no longer qualify. It's possible some might still be able to receive free or reduced cost lunches by applying separately. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('\nMSNBC, Interview with Rep.
