Obama radio ad says Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher
","
The buzz among Floridians these days isn’t the start of college football. It’s Medicare, says President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.

""In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher,"" begins a new radio ad from Obama’s campaign.

The ad moves at a slow pace, featuring a back-and-forth between soothing male and female voices that say things such as the ""Ryan Medicare Plan"" would affect future retirees, and the ""Romney-Ryan plan"" would raise health care costs. They decry Romney’s VP pick because Ryan wanted to ""change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security.""

""What does that really say about Mitt Romney and whether he really understands Florida, the folks who live here, or what matters to our future?""

PolitiFact Florida wanted to analyze the statement that ""the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher.""

What is the Ryan-Romney plan?

The ""Ryan-Romney"" or ""Romney-Ryan"" Medicare plan isn’t a written-out plan, but Romney’s statements of support for previous Medicare proposals.

Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, has released several ideas since 2011 to overhaul the government-run health insurance program mainly for seniors. After Romney selected Ryan as his running mate, he said he and Ryan were on the same page for changes to Medicare.

""Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical,"" he said in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview with a Wisconsin TV station.

Romney was referring to Ryan’s most recent plan, released earlier this year, which would rewrite how Medicare works for people who are under age 55. Instead of paying for seniors’ health care bills, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans.

Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available.

We don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan’s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details.

Does this approach ""end Medicare""?

No. Even when discussing Ryan’s earliest Medicare overhaul, which would have moved the program entirely to private insurers,  PolitiFact has said repeatedly the proposal would not ""end,"" ""destroy"" or ""abolish"" Medicare.

While Medicare under the original Ryan plan would have been essentially privatized, and many seniors would have had to pay more than they do now as health care costs increase, government-supported health insurance coverage for seniors would not have gone away away.  

Now, under Ryan and Romney’s proposals, a traditional Medicare plan would remain an option.

 Would Medicare be replaced with a voucher?

Pretty much. PolitiFact visited the semantics of the ""voucher"" issue in an Aug. 16, 2012, story, dissecting the linguistic differences between calling the Republicans’ Medicare vision a ""voucher"" system versus their preferred terminology, ""premium support."" After consulting experts in health care and language, PolitiFact rated Obama’s characterization of Romney and Ryan wanting ""to turn Medicare into a voucher system"" Mostly True.

We should note, though, the government would continue to regulate Medicare plans. Also, the plan does not literally provide people with a paper voucher, but it does give them a credit to buy their own insurance. We think that’s voucher-like.

Our ruling

A radio ad from the Obama campaign says, ""In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher.""

None of the plans presented by these candidates will ""end"" Medicare. Instead, Romney and Ryan support substantial changes to Medicare for people under 55. Depending on their income, future beneficiaries will receive a ""premium support payment"" to help offset the cost of a plan purchased through a competitive marketplace or for a traditional Medicare plan. We rate the Obama campaign’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977A4B40>],/factchecks/2012/aug/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-ryan-romney-plan-will-end-medica/

Group blames Obama for linking CIA to a Pakistani doctor
","
Some former special forces soldiers and CIA officers have produced a video that accuses President Barack Obama of trying to score political points by leaking sensitive intelligence information.

The 20-minute video from the group Special Operations OPSEC (short for Operations Security) focuses on the administration’s actions surrounding the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The group claims it isn't favoring a candidate, but it's clear Obama is being targeted.

The video makes many points, including one about the arrest by Pakistan of a local doctor recruited by the CIA.

""With wanton disregard,"" OPSEC member Jamie Williamson, a retired Special Forces colonel, says in the video, ""this administration leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden.""

Retired Maj. Gen Paul Valley follows up. ""I’m not sure we have anybody in senior leadership today that understands the propriety and how risky it is on leaks,"" he says.

Former CIA officer Fred Rustman delivers the final summation. ""What was done was stupid,"" Rustman says. ""But it was more than stupid. It was done with malice aforethought. It was done for a political purpose. And that’s what I find terrible.""

We are checking several claims from the video. We've previously examined the claim that the Obama administration invited filmmakers to the White House and revealed intelligence sources and methods. We ruled that Mostly False.

In this item, we'll check the claim that the Obama administration leaked the doctor's name.

We got no reply to several requests to the OPSEC group for facts that support their claim about the Pakistani doctor. From what we can tell, there aren’t any.

Raid details emerge

In the weeks after the raid, U.S. officials shared many action-packed details of the operation. The public learned about the number and type of helicopters used and the crash landing that endangered the entire mission. The administration released diagrams of the bin Laden compound where gun battles took place and the room where bin Laden was killed.

The OPSEC video suggests that the administration went even further, releasing information that led to the identification and imprisonment of the Pakistani doctor.

Early on, U.S. officials said that a bin Laden courier led intelligence officials to bin Laden’s house. What the U.S. did with that information was left vague. Citing an unnamed government source, the Boston Globe reported two days after the raid that ""They began monitoring the site day and night with pilotless surveillance aircraft and other tools.""

By June, the public knew the name of the bin Laden courier and that the CIA had set up a safe-house near the bin Laden compound. The details were sketchy but it was clear that the CIA had established an operation in Abbottabad.

Pakistan responds and finds a nurse

The raid chilled relations with Pakistan, a key U.S. ally, because U.S. officials suspected that some Pakistani officials had been less than forthcoming in helping the U.S. track down bin Laden.

Pakistan’s Directorate for Inter-Service Intelligence, often called the ISI, is the country’s FBI and CIA rolled up in one. The bin Laden raid was something of an embarrassment for the agency and top Pakistani officials.

According to Saeed Shah, a reporter for McClatchy and the British newspaper the Guardian in Abbottabad, the ISI moved quickly to track down people who might have helped American intelligence agencies keep an eye on the bin Laden compound.

""The ISI arrested anyone associated with the house,"" Shah told PolitiFact.

One person they arrested was a nurse.

""She boasted about having been inside the OBL house,"" Shah said, adding that the boast ""made its way through the community and eventually to me.""

The ISI questioned and released the woman. It turned out she had been working for Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who was later arrested and jailed. The nurse likely led the ISI to Afridi, but it's also possible they would have been tipped off due the odd nature of a project Afridi was running.

To help the CIA, Afridi had set up a fake vaccination program as a ruse to get DNA samples from the bin Laden household. A close match with a son or grandchild of bin Laden would show that family members lived in the house. Bin Laden was known to keep his family with him so if they were there, chances were good that bin Laden was too. Shah reported that Pakistan had connected Afridi with the CIA and had arrested him. 
Shah said he learned about Afridi from the nurse and residents of Abbotabad who knew about the vaccination program.

""There was no U.S. leak on Afridi,"" Shah told us.

To the contrary, he says, ""the U.S. administration tried to stop me publishing the story, both the CIA and the State Dept, by approaching my editors at McClatchy,"" Shah said, ""and also by appealing to me directly by telling me that it would put Afridi's life at risk."" 
Although news reports after Shah's initial story cited a U.S. government official for confirmation, the evidence indicates that Shah's reporting came from Pakistani sources and residents. 
CNN’s national security analyst Peter Bergen reached the same conclusion. ""It is obvious that this information was leaked not by the Americans but the Pakistanis who have done their own investigation of the bin Laden raid,"" Bergen wrote in a CNN opinion piece. 
According to Pakistan’s report on Afridi, right after the raid, his CIA handler advised him and gave him the means to leave the country. Afridi thought he didn’t need to. He is now serving a 33-year sentence -- not for helping the CIA, but for shady dealings with some local tribesmen.

Our ruling

The Special Operations - OPSEC Education Fund said, ""This administration leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden.""

The OPSEC group provides no evidence to support its claim, and journalists close to the scene in Abbottabad say it was the Pakistanis, not the Americans, who identified the doctor. The bin Laden raid triggered the ISI investigation, not anything said by U.S. officials.

In fact, the CIA had urged the doctor to leave the country and when Pakistan provided the name of the doctor, US officials tried to prevent it being published.

We see no evidence that it was the Obama administration that leaked the name. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973ACD40>],/factchecks/2012/aug/22/special-operations-opsec-education-fund/group-blames-obama-linking-cia-pakistani-doctor/
"['Abortion', 'New Jersey', 'John Wisniewski']","
Paul Ryan and Todd Akin co-sponsored bill limiting federal funding for abortions to victims of “forcible rape,” New Jersey Democratic leader says
","
Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, have tried to distance themselves in recent days from comments made by a Missouri congressman about pregnancies being rare in cases of ""legitimate rape.""

But the chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party claimed Tuesday that Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, and Missouri Republican Todd Akin have both backed a bill limiting federal funding for abortions to victims of ""forcible rape.""

""While Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan rushed to throw Congressman Akin under the bus following his repugnant comments, we know that in reality, Republicans share many of Akin’s most offensive views on the issue of choice,"" John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, said in a news release.

""Ryan co-sponsored legislation with Akin to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape’ - as if there is any other kind of rape?""

Wisniewski is correct that Ryan and Akin co-sponsored legislation in July 2010 and January 2011 that, as originally written, limited federal funding for abortions to pregnancies resulting from ""forcible rape"" and certain other circumstances. 
But the party chairman failed to mention that the term ""forcible"" was later removed from the bill before its passage in the House. 
In a statement, Wisniewski argued that the congressmen became co-sponsors when the legislation still contained the phrase ""forcible rape."" 
""While the term was removed after significant public outcry, it is telling that the phrase did not raise any red flags for either Ryan or Akin in July 2010 or January 2011 when they signed on as original co-sponsors,"" Wisniewski said. 
Let’s explain the bill’s history.

The legislation -- known as the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act -- was first introduced on July 29, 2010 by New Jersey Congressman Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.). Ryan and Akin signed on as co-sponsors at the time of the bill’s introduction.

That version of the bill prohibited federal funding for abortions, except in certain cases -- including ""forcible rape."" 
But with Democrats still in control of the House, the bill didn't move forward. 
After the GOP took control of the House, Smith re-introduced the bill on Jan. 20, 2011. Again, at the time of introduction, Ryan and Akin became co-sponsors, and the legislation still contained the phrase ""forcible rape.""

Yet that term ignited an outcry among various critics, who said the phrase would exclude victims of statutory rape or rapes involving drugs. 
By early February 2011, Smith had agreed to remove the term ""forcible"" from the legislation. When the House passed the bill in a 251-175 vote on May 4, 2011, the legislation allowed federal funding for abortions in all cases of rape.

The final version of the bill said such funding was permissible if ""(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.""

Ryan and Akin voted for the bill, along with Smith and the other five GOP congressmen from New Jersey. Seven House Democrats from New Jersey voted against the bill.

The U.S. Senate never voted on the legislation.

Our ruling

In a news release, Wisniewski claimed Ryan and Akin co-sponsored legislation ""to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape.’""

It’s accurate that the two congressmen co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, first in July 2010 and again in January 2011. Both original versions of the bill limited federal funding for abortions to pregnancies resulting from ""forcible rape"" and certain other circumstances.

The term ""forcible"" was later removed from the bill, allowing federal funding for abortions in all cases of rape. But when Ryan and Akin originally signed on, the legislation included the phrase ""forcible rape."" 
We rate the statement True.

"['Federal Budget', 'Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Military', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Tammy Baldwin Dem Senate candidate ""led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy engines from us""
","As the primary election for an open Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat approached, most TV ads were aired by Tommy Thompson and the three candidates he defeated for the Republican nomination.

But U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, who won the Democratic nomination without opposition, didn’t sit out completely.

Eyeing the fall campaign, Baldwin released an ad July 30, 2012 that, she said, highlights her efforts to strengthen Wisconsin manufacturing.

""Coast Guard cutters: built in America, but powered by engines manufactured overseas, even though you can’t buy a better engine than the ones made right here in Wisconsin,"" Baldwin declared.

""That’s why I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies.""

As she spoke, a message on the screen said: ""Tammy Baldwin sponsored BUY American bill.""

We don’t recall any major political battles over Coast Guard engines during Baldwin’s nearly 14 years in Congress.

But by saying ""I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy"" Wisconsin-made engines, Baldwin suggests she was successful in her fight and that such a requirement is in place. Moreover, the ""sponsored a buy American bill"" message suggests the fight she led affected more than just Wisconsin manufacturers.

Let’s see what happened.

Baldwin’s engine amendments

We didn’t find any news stories in the Nexis database about any congressional battles over Coast Guard engines, but Baldwin did introduce amendments on the matter three different times.

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited those amendments as evidence to back her claim.

June 2003: The amendment would have prohibited buying new Coast Guard cutters unless their engines were made in the United States ""by a domestically operated entity.""

Kraus said that would have ruled out engines provided by Detroit Diesel, which was owned by German-based Daimler-Chrysler, ""leaving only one possible source for diesel engines: Wisconsin-based Fairbanks Morse.""

Fairbanks Morse Engine is in Beloit, in Baldwin’s district.

So, Baldwin’s first amendment focused on getting more business for one Wisconsin company, not American manufacturers generally.

No vote was taken on Baldwin’s amendment, a Library of Congress record shows. It was ruled out of order because it proposed ""to change existing law and constituted legislation in an appropriations bill.""

November 2003: Baldwin introduced a slightly different amendment. It would have required that engines purchased for the Coast Guard’s new fleet of ships be made in America, according to a transcript of House proceedings.

Kraus pointed out that this amendment didn’t prohibit engines being made in the U.S. by a foreign-operated company.
.
(Interestingly, we found that Baldwin introduced this amendment with U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R.-Wis., the running mate of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan argued that many defense contracts had made-in-America requirements, which he said help national security by ensuring that needed goods are available in the U.S.)

The amendment was rejected on a voice vote.

June 2011: Baldwin’s third amendment used language similar to the first. And like the first amendment, it was ruled out of order and didn’t come up for a vote.

We asked Kraus about the message on the screen in the ad -- which said Baldwin sponsored a ""BUY American bill"" -- since that sounded like it might be a separate legislation, not merely an amendment. There have been various bills requiring the purchase of American-made goods over the years.

But Kraus said the message on the screen was merely another reference to the three amendments that Baldwin introduced.

Our rating

Baldwin said: ""I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies.""

Although there isn’t evidence of much of a fight, her statement contains an element of truth in that she introduced three amendments aimed at benefiting a Wisconsin manufacturer. But the ad is misleading in suggesting that her fight was successful, when none of the measures she introduced became law. What’s more, it suggests it was part of a broader ""Buy American"" push, not measures aimed at helping a company in her district.

We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097007800>],/factchecks/2012/aug/22/tammy-baldwin/wisconsin-rep-tammy-baldwin-dem-us-senate-candidat/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Clayton County Schools']","
Clayton schools claim high status
","
It’s the beginning of a new school year, and for one local school district, that meant time to do some bragging.

Clayton County officials recently sent out a press release with a claim that a PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to read and grade.

""Clayton County Public Schools recently achieved a milestone that has eluded other
metropolitan districts across the state,"" it read. ""When school opens on August 13, Clayton County will have a 100 percent Highly Qualified Staff.""

The school district has had some rough times in recent years. Its accreditation was revoked in 2008, thanks to infighting among school board members. It was fully restored in May 2011.

The district’s teachers had little to do with those problems, but PolitiFact Georgia and others still wondered about the accuracy of this claim. It’s pretty tough to get 100 percent on any exam. How about claiming all of its estimated 3,300 teachers are highly qualified? Another question we had is whether this distinction has eluded other districts.

First, what does it mean to be a Highly Qualified teacher?

As part of the No Child Left Behind education regulations that became law during the administration of President George W. Bush, the states were asked to have their teachers meet certain guidelines that show they are highly qualified to be in the classroom.

To be deemed highly qualified, teachers must:

1) have a bachelor's degree
2) have full state certification or licensure
3) prove that they know each subject they teach

The first criteria for Highly Qualified status, a bachelor’s degree, appears standard these days. In fact, the bar seems to be what percentage of teachers have a master’s degree. In 1999, virtually all public school teachers had at least a bachelor's degree, and 42 percent had a master’s degree, according to the National Science Board. In 2011, New York City reported that at least 75 percent of its eighth-grade teachers have a master’s degree. 

The percentage of Georgia public school teachers not fully certified in 2010-2011 was 9 percent in math and 9.7 percent in science, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011, citing the Georgia Professional Standards Commission. It seems, though, many teachers have trouble passing the test, which some say is not meant to be rigorous. Channel 2 Action News reported last year that 12,455 teachers failed at least one part of the Georgia Assessment for the Certification of Educators test, 708 people failed five times or more and 56 had failed 10 times or more. One teacher failed 18 times. Some Georgia teaching advocates counter that the percentage of failures is small.

The Highly Qualified status has not been so highly regarded in some parts of the country. In 2011, a federal circuit court ruled that California illegally classified thousands of teachers in training as ""highly qualified"" in violation of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, The Associated Press reported. The lawsuit, filed by some civil rights activists, claimed more than 100,000 intern teachers nationwide are classified as ""highly qualified.""

Clayton district spokesman David Waller said teacher interns are not a part of its Highly Qualified staff.

Clayton school district officials have been trying to have all of their teachers meet the guidelines since 2002 and began to aggressively recruit teachers who meet the Highly Qualified standards about five years ago.

The Georgia Professional Standards Commission tracks which school districts have met the Highly Qualified criteria. During the 2010-11 school year, which was the most recent year available, 99.56 of Clayton’s teachers and paraprofessionals met all three criteria, the state said. Clayton officials forwarded us an email sent earlier this month from a commission official congratulating the district for reaching the 100 percent plateau for the 2011-12 school year.

Clayton is not the first metro Atlanta school district to reach 100 percent Highly Qualified status. In the 2010-11 school year, the others were Forsyth County Schools, Decatur City Schools and Marietta City Schools. Clayton, with nearly 51,000 students, has more students than the others. Other districts in metro Atlanta area were close, said Anne Marie Fenton, the state agency’s assessment program director. 

Gwinnett County Schools, which has more students than any district in the state, had 99.84 percent of its teachers and paraprofessionals who met the Highly Qualified status. Cobb County also came real close, at 99.41 percent, the state said.

While pleased with the ranking, Waller said the press release certainly wasn’t intended to disparage other districts. Waller said he was aware that there have been other districts that have met the guidelines.

""It was not intended to imply no one else has done this,"" he said.

Clayton did meet the 100 percent threshold for this school year, as the press release said. There are other metro districts that have come very, very close, but have not reached that mark yet. 

We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A299400>],/factchecks/2012/aug/22/clayton-county-schools/clayton-schools-claim-high-status/
"['Government Regulation', 'Regulation', 'Florida', 'Connie Mack']","
Connie Mack says a business in Florida needs 31 permits to expand
","
It’s one of U.S. Rep. Connie Mack’s favorite stories for the campaign trail.

Owners of a Cape Coral-based boat building company want to expand and hire new people. But a long list of government-imposed permits and fees threaten to capsize their plans.

""There’s a small business in my district. They wanted to expand their business,"" Mack said during a recent visit to Sayler’s Suncoast Water in Pinellas Park. ""It took 31 different permits and fees just to be able to expand their business. This is a government that is out of control.""

Republicans frequently rail against burdensome regulations that stifle job growth. And Mack’s story of job-killing regulations anchors his platform as he strives to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, who’s seeking his third term.

Mack’s story surfaces so frequently, we fact-checkers couldn’t help but dive in. Here, we’re checking if it takes 31 different permits to expand a business.  

We launched our research with Bob Long, owner of the business Mack was referring to, Marine Concepts, which manufactures fiberglass and boats.

This check won’t include the details of Long’s expansion, since plans are still tentative and under wraps.  We’ll just say he’s shopping for property to open a new location, and that’s enough information to estimate how many permits he’ll need.

In an impromptu phone interview, Long shot off his list of legal obligations. They check out.

""You’ve got to have occupancy permits, site permits, parking permits, waste disposal permits, wide load permits, fire permits, the ocean regulations and what they require, landscaping permits, immigration checks and reports, air permits from the Department of Environmental Protection,"" he said, later emailing a list 32 notches long.

He added another list of 26 tax and insurance requirements, which could also be considered fees.

""I’d rather be able to hire more people and have more space. I’ve got to have people full time working these permits and fees and so on. It costs money,"" he said.

Many permits and fees, such as those that protect the environment, are worthwhile, he said. But, in many cases, he said, complying with regulations requires more work and money than necessary.  

""The landscaping permits tell me what kind of trees I can put in and how big and where,"" he said. ""Some of these things are a bit much.""

Marine Concepts is required to get more permits than most businesses because the company manufactures fiberglass, uses chemicals and pollutes, said Susan Noe, business assistance director at Fort Myers Regional Partnership and the  Lee County Office of Economic Development,who checked Long’s list and verified the permits.

Her office pointed to at least nine Marine Concepts permits that are industry-specific, from wide-load permits and boat tag licenses to air emission reports.

""They have to make sure they have the necessary protections in place to protect the environment, the health and safety of employees, in addition to the surrounding businesses,"" she said. ""Do they have to file for these things? Yes....it’s because of the type of business they’re in.""

Mack’s stump speeches (at least the ones we’ve seen) describe a mindset, and don’t outright claim he will initiate regulation reform.

That’s the tricky part, said John Hudak, a fellow with the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington.

For one, many permits and fees are imposed by state and local governments. Sometimes federal lawmakers can use their status to pressure state politicians and get things done. But, in Florida, which is ruled by a Republican super majority, lawmakers have already stripped away most regulations they can, Hudak said.

If elected, Mack’s ideas could garner traction under a Mitt Romney administration. But Mack would be a junior senator and U.S. Senate newcomers are not likely to be appointed as chairs to the powerful committees that oversee federal regulations, Hudak said. 
Our ruling 
Mack was on target in describing the number of permits and fees required of Marine Concepts. He might have even underestimated. 
But Marine Concepts is in a highly regulated industry, so it’s not an example of the typical amount of permits a company would have to get to expand. Many other types of businesses would require less permitting, a business liaison told PolitiFact Florida.

"['Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Virginia', 'U.S. Chamber of Commerce']","
U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Tim Kaine supported higher energy costs for families
","When it comes to economic policies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, is on the wrong track.

A television ad by the Chamber puts the viewer on the front of a train, roaring past billboards proclaiming Kaine’s shortcomings. Among its claims: that Kaine, as governor, supported ""higher energy costs for families.""

As proof, the chamber sent us Kaine’s testimony before a U.S. Senate hearing on climate change and the Chesapeake Bay in 2007. Kaine warned that rising temperatures and sea levels would damage the bay and the Hampton Roads region, and he urged the Senate to take action.

""I support legislation that includes a cap-and-trade program for emissions of all greenhouse gases, imposes economy-wide controls rather than singling out a particular sector, and accounts for state efforts to standardize methodologies to record and measure greenhouse gas emissions through the Climate Registry,"" he said.

Soon after his testimony, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, at the time a Democrat from Connecticut, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., introduced a bill to implement a cap-and-trade system. Previous cap-and-trade bills were introduced in 2003 and 2005. Kaine did not say that he specifically supported a particular bill.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who introduced the legislation in 2003, said when the 2007 bill was put in the hopper, ""The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies. Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life.""

Under cap and trade, the government would limit the allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, such as electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or obtain credits from the government - either given or sold through an auction - to exceed limits.

The government could use the revenues in any number of ways, including paying for general expenses, developing new energy-efficiency programs and giving rebates to ratepayers. In the 2007 bill, the national cap on carbon dioxide declined gradually from 5,775 million metric tons in 2012 to 1,732 million metric tons in 2050.

The cost to consumers was analyzed by several government and non-government entities.

The Energy Information Administration concluded that the 2007 legislation would cause gas prices to go up by 22 to 49 cents a gallon in 2020. And that would increase to 41 to 101 cents per gallon higher in 2030.

Meanwhile, depending on the development of technology to capture and store carbon emissions, the average annual cost of household energy bills would increase by between $30 to $325 in 2020, and between $76 to $723 in 2030. Although the EIA does not make estimates beyond 2030, it says the costs would continue to escalate.

The Environmental Protection Agency ran its own numbers. It said mandates to manufacture cleaner fuels would cause gas prices to rise by 53 cents a gallon in 2030 and by $1.40 a gallon in 2050. The EPA also projected that electricity prices would increase 44 percent in 2030 and 26 percent in 2050.

Kaine spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said  that equating support for cap-and-trade legislation with support for ""higher energy prices for families"" is ""ludicrous."" She said Kaine supports cap and trade as part of a ""package of larger reforms"" that would ""reduce our dependence on carbon-heavy energy sources and encourage the development of alternative energy and conservation.""

She noted that some cap-and-trade proposals would have funneled proceeds from auctions back to consumers in rebates. Under a 2009 bill backed by President Barack Obama, the CBO said those in the lowest 20 percent of earners would save about $40 in 2020, a statistic Hoffine cited. But the CBO also said other households would pay more for electricity, averaging $175 more and up to about $340 more, because they would receive smaller rebates and use more electricity than low-income families.

Hoffine also pointed to a study about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state compact for a cap and trade system. The system was put into place in 2009 and was evaluated after three years. The Analysis Group found that consumers saved a net of $1.1 billion compared to what the grid systems would have been without the cap-and-trade system, primarily because the states put auction proceeds toward energy efficiency programs. But ratepayers actually spent about 0.7 percent more for electricity up front.

""In general, it is true that controlling carbon emissions or other pollution from energy will raise the cost of energy relative to not controlling that pollution,"" Adele Morris, fellow and policy director in climate and energy economics at The Brookings Institution, said in an email. But ""the cap and trade approach is a substitute for other, more costly, ways to regulate greenhouse gases.  Right now, because cap-and-trade didn't pass, the EPA is pursuing regulation of those emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority, which means command and control approaches to regulation.""

The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the successor to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, has  issued fact sheets on several proposals for cap-and-trade legislation and programs.

""Others have claimed that the bill will have no cost impact, but this ignores the very real economic costs of shifting to a clean energy economy,"" the center said of the 2009 bill.

The Lieberman-Warner bill in 2007 proposed to auction some of the credits to pay for renewable technologies, workforce training and low-income energy assistance, while giving the rest to states and other recipients.

The legislation was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate that year.

Our ruling

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says in a TV ad that Kaine supported ""higher energy costs for families.""

It’s clear, as the Chamber notes in small print, that Kaine backs the concept of cap-and-trade legislation, but there’s no record of his support for a specific bill or proposal. Analyses of two measures that have been before in Congress in recent years concluded that cap-and-trade carries a cost for most consumers.

At least one cap-and-trade program in place has resulted in an average lower cost for consumers through energy efficiency and rebates. And cap-and-trade legislation is one of the least expensive options for controlling greenhouse gases, experts said.

So the assertion that cap and trade leads to higher energy prices is reasonable but depends on the specifics of a plan. The chamber cannot point to an instance where Kaine directly supported a particular measure that would raise energy bills, which is necessary context.

There is an element of truth and a great deal of hyperbole in the chamber’s claim that Kaine supported higher energy bills for families. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966D9E80>],/factchecks/2012/aug/21/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-commerce-says-tim-kaine-supported-highe/

Challenger's claim on Rep. Petrarca's voting on auto body bills Mostly True
","One of the issues that sparked outrage around the State House in June was the last-minute lawmaking on behalf of the auto body shop industry. Around 3 a.m. on June 13, lawmakers approved a bill giving auto body shops the right to sue insurance companies if they couldn't agree on the cost of car repairs. The legislation was pushed by John Petrarca, president of Providence Auto Body, and his daughter, Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, spokeswoman for the Auto Body Association of  Rhode Island. They are the father and sister, respectively, of Rep. Peter J. Petrarca, D-Lincoln, who did not vote on the bill. But insurance company representatives said Representative Petrarca, the House senior deputy majority leader, had lobbied hard for the legislation. Governor Chafee  vetoed the bill days later, saying it would hurt consumers by generating lawsuits that ultimately would increase insurance premiums and interfere with customers' contracts with their insurance companies. But Petrarca's challenger in the House District 44 Democratic primary, Gregory J. Costantino, sought to keep Petrarca in the cross hairs of criticism when the two men appeared on ""Newsmakers"" on Channel 12 (WPRI) on Aug. 12. Costantino said that while Petrarca might not have voted on this most recent legislation, he had voted on auto shop bills in the past, which Costantino described as a clear conflict of interest. As an example, Costantino referred vaguely to a bill in 2003 and another one in 2010. He gave no specifics about either piece of legislation. In response, Petrarca said: ""I don't know what they do. I don't know what they are."" And then he launched into an unrelated line of incriminations against Costantino. We were curious what legislation Costantino was referring to and whether he was correct in saying that Petrarca - whose law firm represents Providence Auto Body and the Auto Body Association of  Rhode Island - had indeed voted for them. In a telephone interview, Costantino identified the two bills in question, amended pieces of legislation that had passed between the House and Senate: 2003 Senate bill 0022 and 2010 Senate bill 2508. The 2003 bill specifies standards for when ""aftermarket"" parts - those that come from a company other than the car manufacturer - can be used in repairs. For instance, it states that if an insurance company orders an auto body shop to use an aftermarket part, the insurance company is responsible for any cost a shop incurs trying to fit that part into place. It also requires the shop to notify the appraiser if the aftermarket part does not restore the car to its original condition. The 2010 bill would make it an unfair claims practice if an insurance company failed to use an independent appraiser -unaffiliated with the repair shop - when vehicle damage exceeded $2,500. We called the State House Library to check the House Journal for the votes of those two bills. The records do indeed show Petrarca voting on both occasions - each time in favor of the bills, which passed. When we called Petrarca, he said he still didn't know what bills his opponent had been talking about, and so we brought him up to speed with what we learned. He was unapologetic. ""Those two bills, those pieces of legislation, do not benefit body shops,"" he said. ""They benefit the consumer."" With the 2003 bill, he said, ""If the shop can prove that the aftermarket part doesn't fit, they [insurance company] have to pay for a new part. ""There is no conflict [of interest] because it doesn't affect body shops. He [Costantino] should get his facts right."" Our ruling Gregory Costantino said during a recent ""Newsmakers"" broadcast that Rep. Peter Petrarca had in the past voted for two pieces of auto body shop legislation and therefore his actions amounted to a conflict of interest. The official legislative record shows Petrarca voted on the bills. And considering Petrarca's professional and personal connections to the auto body shop industry, his vote on them posed at least an appearance of conflict of interest. But whether the bills actually help body shops or consumers is debatable. Therefore we rate Costantino's claim: Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096712140>],/factchecks/2012/aug/21/gregory-j-costantino/challengers-claim-rep-petrarcas-voting-auto-body-b/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'John Carter']","
John Carter says unaccountable board created by health care overhaul will have ability to come between ""you and your doctor"" in determining best treatment options
","
Saying he’s committed to repealing Obamacare, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, told constituents: ""You may not be aware of one of the most frightening provisions in the president’s healthcare plan -- the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board.""

Carter’s July 31, 2012, letter continues: ""This board, comprised of 15 unelected, unaccountable people hand-picked by the president, will have the ability to come between you and your doctor in determining the best treatment options for you!""

After readers asked us to look into Carter’s claim about the board’s intrusive powers, we emailed Carter’s office for backup information -- and didn’t hear back.

The board mentioned in the 2010 law has been singled out before, having figured into several Truth-O-Meter articles including a July 2012 False rating of Mitt Romney’s claim that the law ""puts the federal government between you and your doctor."" Romney offered no evidence for his claim; PolitiFact concluded that the law leaves intact the private sector delivery of health care.

The board mentioned by Carter, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, is to focus on reducing the rate of growth in per-capita Medicare spending, but it is prohibited under the law from suggesting anything that leads to rationing or reductions in either benefits or eligibility. Generally, in contrast, the board might recommend that every discharged hospital patient get guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water. They might find that surgery to install certain medical devices – like hip replacements – should not be done on Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 105. The goal is cost-savings, not micro-managing patient care.

Also, Congress has the power to overrule the panel’s recommendations.

In February 2012, U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a press release: ""Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the president and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.""

That’s False, PolitiFact Tennessee said, because the board would not control decisions made at the individual patient level.

With Carter’s wording in mind, we read the relevant portion of the law.

Section 3403 indeed states that the board is to include 15 members appointed by the president. Each appointee also would face Senate confirmation.

As far as we can tell, the law does not give the board the power, or permission, to regulate any individual’s treatment options.

For an August 2011 Truth-O-Meter article, PolitiFact Georgia asked four health experts about a congressman’s claim that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" would ""decide whether you get care."" All four said that’s incorrect.

A scholar at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank usually at odds with Democratic positions, said the assertion that the board would be controlling patients’ health-care decisions is ""not even close to correct."" Cato scholar Michael Tanne said the board ""has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals.""

Betty Sutton says Republicans spent $50 million on Obamacare repeal votes
","Members of Congress can send messages in a lot of different ways. One that is almost certain not to be ignored is taking a vote.

That, in effect, is what happened in the House of Representatives in July, when its members voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The 244-185 vote, which had five Democrats siding with the entire Republican caucus, was the 33rd time the House voted to repeal all or part of President Obama's health care law.

The Republican-led House knew the repeal would not pass the Democratic-led Senate, and would be vetoed by Obama if it reached his desk.

But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said the vote was taken ""so we may all be on record in order to show that the house rejects 'Obamacare,' and we are committed to taking this flawed law off the books.""

Republicans also wanted to tie Democrats to what they see as an unpopular law.

The vote was, in other words, a message to voters -- ""symbolic but powerful,"" according to the coverage by Politico.

To Democrats like Rep. Betty Sutton, who is facing GOP Rep. Jim Renacci in Ohio’s newly redrawn 16th congressional district, the vote represented something else:

""Thirty-three votes. $50 million wasted,"" said an email from her campaign. ""According to CBS News, that’s the record GOP Rep. Jim Renacci has helped the Republican Majority in Congress achieve when it comes to their never-ending crusade to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.""

Thirty-three votes cost $50 million? That caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention.

The source of the figure, linked in the Sutton email, was a story that ran July 11 on ""CBS Evening News."" The story said a CBS tally showed that the effort to repeal the health care law has consumed at least 80 hours, or two workweeks, on the House floor since early 2011.

""We wondered how much it costs taxpayers for the House to repeal the law again and again,"" anchor Scott Pelley said. ""You can't be exact about these things, but the Congressional Research Service tells us that the House of Representatives costs us $24 million a week. So with two weeks spent repealing the law, that comes to a little under $50 million.""

PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know more. We were especially intrigued because the Congressional Research Service doesn't directly tell anything to the public or to the media, including us. CRS is a nonpartisan think tank that works exclusively for Congress. Its reports, which are authoritative models of research and analysis, are made available only through members of Congress who release them to public domain.

We were unable to find a report putting a price tag on congressional activity. Sutton's office provided a CRS report on legislative expenditures as the basis for the $50 million.
The report, though, doesn’t measure the cost of a vote. It showed overall appropriations for the House in the current fiscal year totaling $1.226 billion.

And while CBS’ report gave a weekly total for operating the House -- Divide the $1.226 billion by 52 and you get to roughly $24 million a week, or a bit under $50 million for two weeks, that calculation isn’t in the CRS report.

But another report on the same subject ran the same day as the CBS story, on ""Marketplace,"" the American Public Media radio program.

""It’s really hard to break down the cost of a vote in Congress,"" it said. ""In fact, none of the congressional watchdog groups in Washington have done it. So we had to do our own, back-of-the envelope calculation.

""We figured out how much we spend per day on salaries and office costs for members of the House of Representatives and their staffs. The grand total? Almost $2 million every day.""

That totals $20 million for two workweeks -- less than half the total in the other story.

American Public Media also cited the Congressional Research Service. In this case, the specific source was a CRS report on congressional salaries and allowances.

Both of the stories wisely put qualifiers on their cost estimates.

In trying to put a figure on the cost of congressional activity -- specifically, on voting -- both of them took on a task with insurmountable problems.

Calculating the per-week cost of running the House from overall House appropriations, for example, takes in fixed costs and the cost of congressional business that is unrelated to activity on the House floor -- while not accounting  for related costs that are included in appropriations for the legislative branch but not designated specifically for the House.

Calculating the cost based on salaries does not account for the fact that many staff duties are unrelated to floor activity or legislation under debate, and that they continue regardless of whether the House is even in session.

The point is not to criticize the two stories, which tried, with some transparency, to come up with a cost estimate not otherwise available. The point is that two reputable news services came up with figures for House expenditures (the ""Marketplace"" story even shows its calculations online) that still vary more than 100 percent in their conclusions  because of the expenditures they factored in.

The difference underlines the impracticality, or the impossibility, of trying to isolate the cost of a congressional vote.

CRS -- which has not attempted to make that calculation itself -- made that specific point when it issued a memorandum to congressional offices last December addressing ""potential challenges for estimating the cost of congressional activities.""

A congressional office made the memo available to PolitiFact Ohio while we were doing our review.

CRS said the memo followed requests ""to estimate the cost of various congressional activities, including: House and Senate chamber operations; a day or hour of congressional debate; the consideration of a piece of legislation; a committee hearing or investigation; a special session; and in-session as compared to out-of-session costs.""

The three-page memo provided no cost estimates but gave an overview of the obstacles to such estimates.

""Calculating costs for various congressional activities is methodologically impossible for many reasons,"" the memo said in its conclusion. ""The choice of appropriations levels or actual expenditures as the source of the data, the offices or activities selected for inclusion, and the treatment or interpretation of fixed and variable costs, could result in multiple, different cost estimates for any congressional activity.""

So where does that leave Sutton’s statement?

First, Sutton’s campaign describes the money as wasted, which is an opinion that PolitiFact Ohio cannot rate.

Beyond that, the claim is not accurate. Her campaign applies the $50 million figure from the CBS report to something that CRS specifically warned was ""methodologically impossible.""  And as a member of Congress, she would have access to the CRS report from December which made that warning.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the Sutton campaign’s claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A0180>],/factchecks/2012/aug/21/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-republicans-spent-50-million-oba/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'John Barge']","
Ga superintendent's statement draws flip-flop charge
","
Many charter school supporters, including the governor, felt they were double-crossed last week when Georgia School Superintendent John Barge announced his opposition to a constitutional amendment aimed at creating more charter schools.

The amendment would reinstate the Georgia Charter Schools Commission, a body that can approve charter schools that local boards reject. The state Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional. 

Gov. Nathan Deal released a statement that said Barge ""no longer believes parents should have public school options for their children."" 

""His new position doesn’t change mine,"" Deal said. ""I stand with two-thirds of the General Assembly and will uphold the promises I made when I ran for office."" 

Others claimed Barge had flip-flopped.

""[T]his is a flip-flop for the record books,"" said Bert Brantley, who was the communications director when Sonny Perdue was governor and is working with charter school supporters for the referendum.

Barge’s spokesman said he has not switched his position at all. 

""It was the same then as it is now,"" Matt Cardoza said.

Some political observers assumed Barge was completely committed to the amendment after he endorsed state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, one of the chief supporters of school choice, in the lawmaker’s tough re-election bid.

PolitiFact Georgia did some homework to find out whether Barge changed his opinion. 

The commission was created by House Bill 881, which was passed by the state Legislature and signed into law by Perdue in 2008.

The legislation covered a range of issues, from the commission’s power to how the schools it created would be funded. 

The Supreme Court struck down the commission in a 4-3 decision. Its 2011 opinion said that state lawmakers do not have the power to grant the state authority to approve and fund charter schools over the objection of local school boards. 

The proposed amendment would make the charter school commission constitutional. 

Barge’s opponents say proof of his flip-flop lies in his answers to a 2010 campaign questionnaire by the Georgia Charter Schools Association, an advocacy group. 

It asked whether Barge agreed with the statement ""I support House Bill 881."" His answer: ""Strongly agree.""

But this doesn’t prove Barge flip-flopped, Cardoza said.  

The 130-word lead-up to the question asked for the candidate’s stance on funding for commission-approved charter schools, not the bill as a whole. It explained that under HB 881, if a student attends this kind of charter school, the per-pupil amount of local tax revenue that would have gone to the district for his or her education goes to the charter school instead.

Barge’s response to a separate question showed he had reservations about the commission. 

It asked whether Barge supported ""non-district authorizers,"" or entities such as the commission that have the power to approve and monitor charters without local school board interference. 

Barge’s answer: ""Agree."" But he found it ""greatly disappointing that we need another administrative body to do something that the local, and ultimately, the state board of education should be able to do."" 

Barge’s response gave the clear impression that he supported the commission’s creation, although he held reservations about the extra level of bureaucracy it created.  

""While the opponents of his position want you to focus on the HB 881 question, it’s hard to not see how he clearly felt based on his answer to the more important question regarding having a third authorizer to do what the local boards and state board can already do,"" Cardoza said. 

Cardoza stressed Barge is still a strong supporter of charter schools.

Barge’s announcement Tuesday restated this concern. He said the commission ""unnecessarily duplicates the good work already being done by local districts, the Georgia Department of Education, and the state Board of Education."" 

Another point in Barge’s favor is that he filled out the questionnaire in 2010. It’s poor proof that he changed his stance on an issue that didn’t exist until 2011.  

We found no evidence that before Tuesday’s announcement Barge had taken a public stance for reinstating the commission. 

In fact, he gave the impression he’d avoid taking one. 

Atlanta Journal-Constitution political columnist Jim Galloway described Barge’s position in a July 25 story:

""Asked whether he would campaign for the charter school question, state School Superintendent John Barge expressed a fondness for charter schools in an email, but added this: ‘We will, of course, respect the will of the citizens of Georgia regarding how charter schools are authorized.’""

If Barge’s opinion changed on anything, it’s over whether to campaign on the issue, not the amendment itself. 

Barge broke ranks with other charter school supporters when he decided to oppose the amendment, but he did not quite flip-flop. 

Barge expressed support for creating the commission before it was declared unconstitutional. We found no evidence that Barge spoke for or against an amendment that would reinstate it until his announcement Tuesday.  

Barge did shift his approach. And he’s no longer holding his tongue. For this, he earns a Half Flip. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB1380>],/factchecks/2012/aug/21/john-barge/ga-superintendents-statement-draws-flip-flop-charg/
"['Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Tampa Bay 10 News', 'Florida', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says Obama 'cuts' $716B from Medicare to pay for Obamacare
","
Florida has become the battleground where Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are dueling over Medicare.

Romney’s favorite attack line: Obama took $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare.

Romney made the claim in an Aug. 15, 2012, one-on-one interview with Tampa Bay’s WTSP 10 News.

""Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare,"" Romney said. ""I think this is something that people are just now focused on and find it very, very difficult to understand why he would cut Medicare for our current seniors.""

Romney’s been repeating that number a lot lately. Is it accurate? And was the money moved to pay for the national health care law?

Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program.

What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.

Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.

Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Romney has said he will repeal the health care law and institute a new overhaul of Medicare that brings more private insurers into a competitive marketplace. Beneficiaries would receive ""premium support,"" a voucher-like credit, to buy their own plan.

We should point out that the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.

If you’ve been following the Medicare debate for awhile, you may have heard previous claims that Obama cut Medicare by $500 billion. How did that become $700 billion? Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. And, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion.
   
The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. Ina more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.
   
So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare.

Romney also send that the spending reduction "" takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare.""

Romney has a point here, but it’s not about money being moved from one account to another. Let us explain.

At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. Some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs.

More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending.

We should note that the health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That too offsets the new spending.

Our ruling

Romney said, ""Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare."" This wording isn't as troublesome as other statements we've seen on this topic, including from Romney himself. 
Still, Romney's most-recent attempt at this claim needs significantly more explanation. 
In this instance, Romney’s claim gives the impression that the law takes money that was already allocated to Medicare and funds the new health care law with it.

In fact, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Those savings are then used to offset costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. We rate his statement Half True.

Group says Obama revealed secret information to Hollywood filmmakers
","
A new group of former special forces soldiers and CIA officers has produced a video that accuses Barack Obama of revealing sensitive intelligence information for cheap political gain. Calling itself Special Operations OPSEC (short for Operations Security), the group’s 20-minute video spends a great deal of time on the administration’s actions after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The group says it favors no candidate, but the frequent images of Obama (each time they say the word 'politician') leave no doubt that he is the target.

At one point, a voice says, ""The politicians turned that victory into an intelligence disaster."" Among other failings, the video says the release of operational details of the raid would tip off the enemy and make future missions more risky.

Fred Rustman, a retired CIA officer, voices particular disdain for the access granted to filmmakers who moved quickly to turn the raid into a movie.

""Days after the raid, Hollywood was invited into the White House so that they could receive a briefing on exactly how the raid took place,"" Rustman says. ""What kind of sources we had. What kind of methods we used. All for the purpose of making a Hollywood movie.""

As Rustman speaks, there’s a picture of a cheerful Obama standing at the front of the White House theater entertaining a group of smiling celebrities.

For this fact-check, we'll explore whether it's true that the White House invited the filmmakers to a special briefing about the raid that revealed intelligence sources and methods.

The movie in question is Zero Dark Thirty, which is scheduled for release in December and is billed as ""The story you think you know … this is how it happened.""

The Hollywood connection

The filmmakers, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, had been working on a bin Laden film before he was killed.

Obama announced the death of bin Laden on May 1, 2011. Less than three weeks later, Boal met with two people at the CIA, the chief of staff and the director of public affairs. We know this, and many other details of Boal’s dealings with Washington insiders, thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch, a conservative organization that often sues to get access to government documents.

Judicial Watch unearthed a trove of emails and other documents. They don’t necessarily prove the point made by the OPSEC group, but they show how a well-connected writer with battlefield experience was able to move with great speed and get at least some cooperation from the nation’s defense and national security agencies. And they reveal the thinking of the Pentagon, the CIA and the White House, as officials decided how they would deal with filmmakers working on a story the officials wanted to see told.

Many people in those agencies already knew Boal -- or at least knew of him. He and Bigelow had won an Oscar for The Hurt Locker, the story of bomb disposal experts in Iraq. It was based on Boal’s time as a reporter for Playboy when he was embedded with U.S. forces in 2004.

On May 1, Boal and Bigelow had begun shooting a movie about the 2001 battle at Tora Bora and the hunt for bin Laden. They pivoted quickly to make the movie about the final raid.

By June 6, Boal had spent two hours at the CIA’s Counter Terrorism Center. A CIA public affairs officer encouraged others to cooperate, saying, ""As he did with The Hurt Locker, he’s very concerned about operational security and will take any of our concerns into account."" So from the start, that begins to contradict the group's claim that sensitive sources and methods were revealed.

On June 9, a Pentagon staffer made exactly the same point in an email to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Michael Vickers. A few days later, Vickers sent an email to the Pentagon’s head of public affairs to make sure everyone was on the same page. He notes, ""At the direction of Director (Leon) Panetta, CIA is cooperating fully (not, obviously, giving away anything they shouldn't, but answering questions, such as 'How did you feel at that point'?)""

That email reveals a Pentagon very intrigued with this project. Vickers wrote that he spoke to Adm. Eric Olson, a Navy SEAL who rose to become commander of the Special Operations Command, which oversees the SEALs and other special forces.

""They are thinking it over,"" Vickers writes. ""They would like to shape the story to prevent any gross inaccuracies, but do not want to make it look like the commanders think it's okay to talk to the media. They may want to offer up an (Team) 6 SEAL, who played a key planning role and knows the operators and story well.""

The potential offer to speak to a Navy SEAL planner is critical. It would represent extraordinary access for the filmmakers, but that access didn’t start with the White House. It started at the top of the military, and the Navy SEALs themselves.

On June 15, two emails moved through the bureaucracy. One came from a key aide to Vickers who aimed to clamp down on leaks to the press about the bin Laden operation. All contacts had to be approved. ""Even the simplest of comments, taken out of context or as an accumulation of information, can be extremely damaging to OPSEC,"" the aide wrote. (In this reference, ""OPSEC"" is referring to actual operations security, not the group running the video against Obama.)

That same day, Douglas Wilson, the Pentagon’s head of public affairs moved to put Boal and Bigelow in a very different category from the others seeking access. He sent an email to the one of the White House deputy national security advisers and spoke highly of the filmmakers and the trust they enjoyed around the CIA and the Pentagon. He noted that Defense Secretary Robert Gates admired their work. He asked for guidance on what to do next and suggested a phone call that included the president’s head of counterterrorism.

Boal had worked his way from the CIA, to the Pentagon and now got at least some cooperation with the White House.

We checked the White House visitor log and found that Boal had meetings there on June 30 and July 2, 2011. A later memo quotes Boal saying he ""spoke to the WH and had a good meeting with Brennan and McDonough."" This likely refers to John O. Brennan, chief counterterrorism advisor and Denis McDonough, deputy national security advisor at the White House.

The emails show the filmmakers spent time in ""the vault,"" a room in the CIA building where some of the tactical planning for the raid took place. The emails also show the Pentagon’s head of public affairs trying to arrange to have a drink with the filmmakers at Ris, an upscale restaurant in Washington adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton hotel. The emails also have references to Boal’s dinners with CIA Director Panetta.

Meeting with a SEAL?

A telling meeting took place between the filmmakers and Vickers. In a transcript from July 15, Vickers offered the filmmakers a chance to talk to a Navy SEAL tactician. The dialogue is intriguing:

Vickers: ""Well the basic idea is they'll make a guy available who was involved from the beginning as a planner; a SEAL Team 6 Operator and Commander.""
Boal: ""Are you talking about [name redacted]?""
Vickers: ""A guy named [redacted]. And so he basically can give you everything you would want or would get from Adm. Olson or Adm. McRaven.""
Boal: ""That’s dynamite.""
Bigelow: ""That’s incredible.""

Tom Fitton, head of Judicial Watch, called naming a Team 6 member ""an egregious breach of public trust"" and ""a violation of any sensible effort to protect the names of those who participated in the raid."" For Fitton, this leaves ""no doubt it was a PR push and that involved access to the planner.""

But it is interesting that Boal already knew or at least thought he knew a SEAL Team 6 member. We should also note that while Vickers made the offer, the Pentagon later withdrew it, and according to the department’s assistant press secretary Carl Woog, the interview never took place. Woog emphasized that ""the department has repeatedly stated, and the secretary has testified, that no classified information was presented to the producers.""

The National Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, told us the individual was a planner, not an actual member of SEAL Team 6. As for the filmmakers’ access to high-level officials at the White House, Vietor said the nature of the raid made that necessary.

""Very few people were part of that decision-making process,"" Vietor said. ""So we tried to make some of those individuals available to journalists, authors and filmmakers to help them understand the process and the president’s thinking.""

The claim and the facts

The OPSEC group's video paints a picture of an administration eager to claim glory and willing to reveal sensitive operational details to Hollywood producers. The image of Obama in the White House theater suggests the president himself regaled his visitors from Hollywood with the story of the raid.

But we find the video is very misleading, suggesting Obama himself took part when there is no evidence of that. The photo comes from an event a year earlier when the president had a special screening of a television mini-series celebrating the American soldiers who fought in the Pacific theater during World War II.

The OPSEC group claims that sources and methods were revealed, but we see no proof of that. The internal emails at the CIA and Defense department emphasized that officials would not share anything that might jeopardize future missions. They knew Boal and Bigelow and judged that they had proven they could be trusted. One email says Boal promised to provide officials with the screenplay for their vetting.

Still, approval for the filmmakers’ interviews did come from the very top. The first to engage was Panetta, then-director of the CIA. The final approval came from the national security advisers in the White House.

It is worth noting that the Pentagon has decades of experience of working with filmmakers.

During the Iraq War, defense officials in the George W. Bush administration played a major role in making a movie about the mission to rescue Army soldier Jessica Lynch, who was captured by an Iraqi unit.

In particular, the Pentagon has been generous in sharing many details about the methods of the Navy SEALs and their counter-terrorism methods. In an effort to boost recruitment, the Navy’s Special Warfare Command commissioned the feature film Act of Valor, which used actual SEALs as actors and was based on real-life missions.

Our ruling

The Web video by the group Special Operations OPSEC says ""Days after the (Osama bin Laden) raid, Hollywood was invited into the White House so that they could receive a briefing"" that revealed intelligence sources and methods.

There is an element of truth to the claim because the producers did indeed visit the White House, met with national security officials and clearly got some cooperation from top brass at the Pentagon and CIA.  However, we find no evidence for the main point of the claim, that the Obama administration engineered this and revealed intelligence sources and sensitive methods.

We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1D080>],/factchecks/2012/aug/20/special-operations-opsec-education-fund/group-says-obama-revealed-secret-information-holl/

McCain's change in posture, not position
","In an interview with the

News-Leader

in Springfield, Mo., on June 18, 2008, Sen. John McCain was asked about his recent push for offshore oil drilling.
 
""You have changed your thoughts on that, am I correct?""
 
""No,"" McCain said. ""I've always said it's up to the states and I still say that.""
 
The interview came a day after McCain's headline-making speech in Houston in which he made a pitch for lifting a federal moratorium on offshore drilling.
 
There are actually two issues in McCain's answer. The first is McCain's denial that he has changed his thoughts about offshore drilling. The second is whether, regardless of his opinion, he has consistently said it's up to the individual states to decide whether to drill off their coasts.
 
Here's the rest of McCain's answer to the question:
 
""But if the states want to drill offshore, and I hope they do. ... Gasoline prices have gone from a buck and a quarter to four dollars and it's even going to go higher, according to some. I think we have to explore all of the options that we have, and review them.
 
""And I think offshore oil exploration and natural gas exploration is a good thing to do. But the states would still make the decision.""
 
Opponents have accused McCain of flip-flopping, saying that he was once a proponent of the federal moratorium on offshore drilling. But McCain's record is not so clear. About the closest we could come to finding an inconsistency in McCain's position was two newspaper articles from the presidential race in 1999 — one from the

San Francisco Chronicle,

the other from the

Ventura County (Calif.) Star

— in which the reporters paraphrase McCain's position as supporting the moratorium on offshore drilling. In 2000, the Associated Press listed McCain's position on offshore drilling as ""Supports state wishes over federal fiat in oil drilling.""
 
Here's a sampling of McCain quotes about offshore drilling, starting with ones made when he ran for president in 2000.
 
• ""Ronald Reagan believed ... that states should have enormous input into the decisions that directly concern them. This directly concerns the people of California, this decision on offshore oil drilling. Now, off of this coast of Texas, I understand Texans want offshore oil drilling. That's fine with me. Off Florida, they don't. I think that we should allow these decisions, to some degree to be made —significant degree to be made by the people who are directly affected by them.""

McCain during an interview on ABC News's ""This Week,"" Feb. 27, 2000.

 
• ""The leases for offshore oil drilling should never have been granted without allowing Californians a legitimate voice in the decisionmaking process. I believe it is up to the voters of California to determine the fate of these leases, and as president, I will respect the decision they make regarding the leases. The people of California deserve to be heard, without being forced to resort to legal action against their own government. As president, I will see to it that the interests of the people of California rise above the special interests of Washington.""

McCain to the Associated Press in March 2000.

 
• ""I wouldn't drill off the coast of Florida unless the people of Florida wanted to. And I wouldn't drill off the coast of California unless the people of California wanted to. And I wouldn't drill in the Grand Canyon unless the people in Arizona wanted to.""

McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Dearborn, Mich., Oct. 9, 2007.

 
• ""Look, I'm a federalist, and I believe the states should decide to enormous degrees what happens within those states, including off their coasts. The people of California have decided they don't want oil drilling off their coasts. The people of Louisiana have decided that they do.""

McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley, Ca., on Jan. 30, 2008.

 
Here's what McCain said in Houston on June 17, 2008:
 
""With gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians. We have proven oil reserves of at least 21-billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use.
 
""We can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection. And in states that choose to permit exploration, there must be an appropriate sharing of benefits between federal and state governments. But as a matter of fairness to the American people, and a matter of duty for our government, we must deal with the here and now, and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production.""
 
We should note one anomaly in McCain's position. Unlike many of his Republican counterparts in the Senate, McCain has long been opposed to drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even though most Alaska residents support it.
 
In Houston, McCain explained why ANWR is a special case.
 
""Quite rightly, I believe, we confer a special status on some areas of our country that are best left undisturbed,"" McCain said. ""When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a 'refuge' for a reason.""
 
As for McCain's voting record on offshore drilling, it's a bit mixed.
 
In June 2003, McCain was among 10 Republicans who voted for an amendment proposed by Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham that would have called off a survey and inventory of possible offshore oil and natural gas deposits. It failed.
 
In August, 2006, McCain voted in favor a bill that authorized drilling in about 8.3-million acres of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The bill, which passed handily, also established a 125-mile buffer until 2022 for energy development in Gulf waters off the Florida coast, and extended the moratorium on energy exploration and development in the Gulf from 2012 to 2022.
 
As for ANWR, McCain voted yes on a 2006 procedural measure that protected legislation opening up the Arctic refuge; but he voted for an amendment to strike language that would have done the same in the previous year's budget resolution.
 
Nowhere in those previously listed interviews or speeches prior to Houston does McCain actively advocate for states to institute offshore drilling. Nor does he talk about creating incentives to encourage them to do it, as he did in Houston. That's why the speech made for front-page headlines.
 
Yes, McCain has long been in favor of letting states ultimately decide whether to drill, but he's now become a cheerleader for the cause. If it's not a change in position, it's at least a change in posture.
 
But as the quotes also make clear, McCain — as he said — has consistently characterized offshore drilling as an issue that largely ought to be left up to individual states to determine.
 
We rate his statement Mostly True.

McCain flipped on payroll taxes, if only once
","What politicians have said on TV often comes back to haunt them. Sen. John McCain knows that feeling after Sen. Barack Obama recalled a past statement McCain made about Social Security solvency on a Sunday morning news show. In a June 13, 2008, speech to senior citizens in Columbus, Ohio, Obama outlined his plan to require those earning $250,000 or more to contribute more in payroll taxes while keeping all other tax levels constant. Then Obama dropped this line: ""There was a time when John McCain thought this wasn't such a bad idea. When he was asked a few years ago whether he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax, he said, 'I could.' But today he's attacking me for holding the very same position."" McCain never put specific salary parameters to the issue, but he did tell Tim Russert on a Feb. 20, 2005, edition of  Meet the Press  that he would consider increasing the Social Security payroll tax to help keep the system solvent. Here's the relevant material from the transcript:  Russert: Sen. McCain, there's a big debate in your Republican Party about whether or not, as part of the solution to Social Security's solvency problem, that you lift the cap so that you would pay payroll tax, Social Security tax, not just on the first $90,000 of your income, but perhaps even higher. Could you support that as part of a compromise?  Sen McCain: As part of a compromise I could, and other sacrifices, because we all know that it doesn't add up until we make some very serious and fundamental changes. (At the time, the cap stood at $90,000. In January 2008, it rose to the current level of $102,000.) Reacting to Obama's assertion, McCain's advisers told reporters in a June 2008 conference call that he would not ""under any imaginable circumstance"" consider raising the payroll tax. During the conference call, campaign advisers didn't address McCain's 2005 statement on  Meet the Press.  Neither McCain's campaign nor the Obama camp returned calls seeking more information. But the record is clear in verifying Obama's statement. We rule it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F95200>],/factchecks/2008/jun/26/barack-obama/mccain-flipped-on-payroll-taxes-if-only-once/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Barack Obama']","
'Paid for' without real money
","Lately economists have been fretting about how the candidates' economic plans would affect the budget deficit, which has

soared to $357-billion

following several years of surpluses through 2001. So Sen. Barack Obama caught our attention when he laid out a laundry list of economic proposals in a

speech

on June 16, 2008, and said they were all ""paid for.""
 
Speaking at Kettering University in the faded manufacturing city of Flint, Mich., Obama ticked off several proposals he said would help working Americans:
 
""It starts with a broad-based, middle-class tax cut — $1,000 per family — to help offset the rising cost of gas and food,"" Obama said. ""A foreclosure prevention fund, to help stabilize the housing market and keep people in their homes. A health care plan that lowers costs and gives those without health insurance the same kind of coverage that members of Congress have. A commitment to retirement security that stabilizes Social Security, and provides workers a means to increase savings. And a plan to crack down on unfair and sometimes deceptive lending in the credit card and housing markets, to help families climb out of crippling debt, and stay out of debt in the first place.""
 
""Now these steps that I've proposed are all paid for,"" Obama said.
 
It's that last phrase we're interested in. We interpret it to mean Obama would do all that spending without increasing the budget deficit, and has detailed how he would do so.
 
Advisers and surrogates for Obama have said that more explicitly.
 
""He (Obama) has proposed an entire domestic program that would not increase the deficit at all over the course of his first term in office,"" his economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said in a

conference call

on June 9.
 
Obama ""pays and proposes ways to pay for all of his tax cuts and all of his spending,"" his ally John Edwards said on the

June 16 broadcast

of ABC's

This Week.

 
Let's start by looking at the specific programs Obama referred to. The ""broad-based, middle-class tax cut"" he spoke about referred to his ""Making Work Pay"" tax credit, plus a new income-tax exemption for seniors making under $50,000, his campaign said. Those together would cost about $80-billion a year, according to both the Obama campaign and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
 
The ""foreclosure prevention fund"" would be a one-time cost of $10-billion, the campaign said.
The health care plan, under which all Americans would be able to buy coverage similar to what members of Congress get, will cost some $50-billion to $65-billion per year, the campaign

said.

His aides said it's not clear how much stabilizing Social Security would cost, because both parties would have to hash out a plan to do so. His plan to help workers save is about a $20-billion-a-year program of employer mandates and tax credits.
 
Finally, there's his plan to crack down on unfair lending and to help families out of debt. That referred to regulatory changes, like a proposed rating system for credit cards and home loans, which the campaign said would not cost anything.
 
Now — does he have a plan to pay for all that spending?
 
Here's where it gets tricky. Some of the foreclosure-prevention fund would come from penalties on irresponsible lenders, the campaign's Web site

says

. The Social Security fix might be funded by more payroll taxes on high-earners, Obama has said.
 
But most of the money would come from what the campaign calls ""baskets"" of savings and new revenues. They include savings from a broad range of policy changes, such as ending the Iraq war, letting tax cuts expire for people who earn more than $250,000, closing corporate tax loopholes and discouraging offshore tax havens.
 
The campaign says all those changes would yield several hundred billion dollars a year. For example, ending the Iraq war — the first five years of which cost $600-billion, according to the Pentagon — would save between $90-billion and $100-billion a year, the Obama campaign asserts. All the savings together would be easily enough to pay for all the programs Obama mentioned, along with all the other new spending and tax cuts he plans, the campaign says.
 
But are Obama's savings estimates realistic? We don't know. The campaign has not provided enough detail to validate them, said Greg Leiserson of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.
 
""They (the policy changes) could raise a lot of money, they could raise a little money, we just don't know,"" said Leiserson, who co-wrote

an analysis

of both candidates' tax plans.
 
That undercuts Obama's claim that he has ""paid for"" his programs.
 
There's another problem. Current tax law calls for President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 to expire at the end of 2010, and for the alternative minimum tax to be imposed on far more taxpayers than it is now. If that happened, the budget deficit would shrink and reach a surplus again by 2012, the Congressional Budget Office

projects

. (That projection assumes spending on existing programs, including the war in Iraq, continues, growing at the rate of inflation.)
 
But Obama's plan calls for the tax cuts to be extended for everyone who makes less than $250,000. Overall, his tax plan would decrease revenue by $2.7-trillion over the next 10 years, according to the

Tax Policy Center analysis

. That seems likely to yield a large deficit rather than a surplus. Obama could always close the deficit by cutting spending, but he has not spelled out how he would do so.
 
In fact, Obama's does not promise he won't leave a deficit. In interviews, his economic aides merely said he would leave less of a deficit than the $357-billion gap expected this year. They say that's the best measure of whether Obama's plan is ""paid for."" However, that the 2008 deficit is temporarily high because of a one-time economic stimulus.
 
It's true that Obama has outlined in very general terms where he would get the money to pay for his proposals. And it may be true that those proposals will leave the deficit smaller than it is now, though we can't say for sure.
 
More to the point, Obama can't say for sure. Until he fleshes out his economic plan considerably more, it's disingenuous to go around claiming his proposals are ""paid for."" And that claim is even more suspect considering that his proposals would leave a larger deficit than would the tax laws currently on the books. We find his claim to be Barely True.

He didn't brand them all ""pork""
","
Sen. John McCain has a reputation as a loud critic of political pork, especially the projects that get stuffed into Congress' periodic water bills. McCain says the water projects are overly political, which means Congress approves low-priority or marginal projects simply so members can bring home the bacon.
 
McCain's reputation as a reformer has bolstered his image as a fiscal conservative. But it can also be a liability, particularly when flood victims are complaining that the federal government didn't do enough to prevent a disaster.
 
And it's not just McCain. The existing Army Corps of Engineers process has been widely criticized in government reports and audits for exaggerating the benefits and underestimating the negative effects of water projects and not getting its priorities straight.
 
During a June 21, 2008, address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Miami, Sen. Barack Obama branded McCain a cheapskate who views every local project as ""pork,"" and chastised McCain for visiting flood victims in Iowa while opposing funding for projects to prevent such disasters.
 
""Both Sen. McCain and I have traveled recently to the areas that have been devastated by floods, and I know that Sen. McCain felt as strongly as I did … enormous sympathy for the victims of the recent flooding,"" Obama said. ""And I'm sure they appreciated the sentiment, but they probably would have appreciated it even more if Sen. McCain hadn't opposed legislation to fund levees and flood control programs, which he considers pork.""
 
Obama was referring to McCain's opposition to a water resources bill that Congress debated last year that would have authorized $23.2-billion for more than 900 Army Corps projects and studies. The legislation included $3.9-billion for a system of new locks and dams and environmental restoration for the upper Mississippi River and Illinois waterway system. The bill also carried an ""earmark,"" inserted by members of Iowa's congressional delegation, to funnel $6.9-million into work on the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, the spot where a levee break the weekend of June 14 and 15 forced an evacuation and heavily damaged several dozen homes and businesses.
 
It's true that McCain was out front imploring his Senate colleagues to vote against a final agreement on the bill, arguing that it would increase the Army Corps' backlog of unfinished projects by $23.2-billion. Echoing statements from earlier debates on previous water resources legislation, McCain on Sept. 24, 2007 said, ""It is time that we end this process of blind spending, throwing money at projects that may or may not benefit the larger good. Shouldn't we be doing all that we can to reform the Corps and ensure that the most urgent projects are being funded and constructed? Or are we more content with needless earmarks — too often at the expense of projects that are of most need?""
 
Congress didn't heed McCain's advice and subsequently adopted the agreement in an 81-12 vote. President Bush then vetoed the bill, citing some of the same concerns McCain raised. The House and Senate overrode the veto in November 2007, marking the first time Congress enacted a law over Bush's objections. Both McCain and Obama were busy campaigning and missed the votes.
 
While Obama correctly identifies one area where McCain has criticized politically sensitive local spending priorities, he is not telling the entire story.
 
Earlier in the year, McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., unsuccessfully proposed amendments to the water resources bill that would have established independent reviews to prioritize federal water projects according to the ability of each to reduce the risk to human life, property and the environment. In calling for the changes, McCain cited instances of botched oversight, including one 2002 case in which costs associated with the Sacramento River Flood Protection Project in California rose from $114-million to $500-million.
 
McCain said changing the process as he and Feingold proposed would have ensured that the levees that failed in Iowa and Missouri would have been given highest priority and would have been fixed first.
 
But McCain has been far more willing to talk about bad projects than exemplary ones, which allows Obama to portray his position in broad strokes. Moreover, McCain over the past decade has a history of missing votes on or voting against the annual spending bills that fund some of the water and energy projects. That, too, gives credence to Obama's charge that McCain is categorically opposed to levee and flood control efforts.
 
McCain's campaign responded by portraying Obama as resistant to true reform efforts. It noted the Illinois senator voted against the first attempt to prioritize the Army Corps work in May 2007 — a sign, it said, that Obama was willing to put parochial interests over life-saving flood mitigation. As further proof, McCain's campaign noted that Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. — one of Obama's most fervent campaign supporters — allied herself with McCain and Feingold's effort.
 
McCain was out front in urging the Senate to reject the water resources bill and he has been consistent in branding the government's process for funding those projects to be an exercise in pork-barrel spending. But McCain is not just a naysayer on water projects, he has been advancing an argument about how spending priorities are set for water projects. And proposing a way to change it. We find Obama's claim to be oversimplifying McCain's record and his position on water project funding and we rate it Half True.

He helped but wasn't a major player
","In one of his first ads since winning the Democratic nomination for president, Sen. Barack Obama speaks directly to the camera about his life story and his legislative accomplishments.
 
""America is a country of strong families and strong values,"" the ad begins. ""My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up.""
 
Later in the ad, Obama says, ""I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected.""
 
For his statement that he ""extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected,"" the campaign points to a couple of pieces of legislation.
 
In 2008, Obama and Sen. Claire McCaskill contributed key portions to the National Defense Authorization Act that required postdeployment mental health screenings and a national study on the needs of Iraq veterans. We looked into the legislative history of the bill and found that Obama and McCaskill can at least take some credit for developing the list of requirements. It's not a major extension of benefits, however.
 
Another problem for Obama is that he missed the final vote on the bill because he was campaigning. Republican nominee John McCain missed it, too. The bill passed overwhelmingly, 91-3.
 
The other piece of legislation the campaign points to is an amendment Obama passed that picked up the tab for meals and phone calls for Iraq veterans receiving outpatient treatment.

We looked at this legislation previously

when Obama talked about it at a debate in Las Vegas in early 2008. Obama closed a loophole for outpatient veterans; hospitalized veterans were already covered. So in fairness, this was a tweak to previous legislation.
 
If Obama had said he had helped extend health care for wounded veterans who'd been neglected, we would have given him a better rating. But he phrased his accomplishment to take more of the credit than that. Missing the vote on the 2008 bill does not help his case. For all of these reasons, we find his statement Half True.

He's got some numbers to back him up
","Sen. John McCain has been a member of the U.S. Congress since 1982, but as he runs for president, he's putting as much rhetorical distance between himself and his Capitol Hill colleagues as possible.
 
While defending his support for a gas tax holiday in a June 18, 2008, interview, McCain tarred his fellow members of Congress as ""rather wealthy"" folks who are ""out of touch"" with the needs and fears of working people on fixed incomes.
 
""You know, the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent,"" he said. ""Maybe they ought to pay a little more attention to their constituents.""
 
On June 11, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll awarded Congress a 13 percent approval rating. And that's the same figure McCain offered. During roughly the same time period, Gallup, Fox News and AP/Ipsos all conducted polls which put the approval rating at 19, 19 and 23 percent respectively.
 
All had margins of error of between 3 and 4 percentage points.
 
When Democrats took slim control of Congress in early 2007, there was a brief honeymoon, but approval has steadily dropped, said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
 
Thanks in part to its relatively faceless quality, Congress makes a convenient whipping boy when the nation is dissatisfied, Keeter said. (The same Gallup poll that put Congress at 19 percent found that 30 percent of respondents approved of President George W. Bush.)
 
And dissatisfied we are. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal approval rating of 13 percent was a record low for the poll, besting a 15 percent rating in April 1992.
 
Though the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll is slightly out of step with others recently conducted, it's highly reputable and there's no way to prove the figure false, Keeter said. And anyway, he said, whether it's 13 percent or 23 percent, it's not good news for Congress.
 
McCain may have chosen the poll figure that most dramatically made his point, but the numbers are as good as any and the overall picture he presented — that of a public overwhelmingly displeased with Congress — is right on.
 
We rule his statement True.

The tax cuts Obama is referring to are from his time as a state senator in the Illinois Legislature.

The program is meant ""to offset the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work,"" according to the Internal Revenue Service.
 
In the federal version, when the tax credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to those who qualify. In the Illinois bill that Obama co-sponsored, state taxes can go to zero, but there is no additional refund.
 
In the 2000 legislation, the legislative record shows that Obama was one of more than 40 senators that co-sponsored the bill, with most of them signing up for it on the same day.
 
But the bill had a sunset clause, and when it came time to renew it in 2003, Obama filed the bill and was its chief sponsor. Another 20 senators signed on to co-sponsor it. Rather than renewing it for another few years, the Obama bill made the state earned income tax credit permanent.
 
The record shows Obama was a minor co-sponsor in cutting taxes in 2000 and was the leader in the state Senate in 2003 in making the tax credits permanent. It takes more than one person to pass a bill, and although he played a significant role in making the tax credits permanent, the record on Obama's statement supports only a Mostly True.

Statistics don't lie in this case
","
In a Father's Day address at the Apostolic Church of God in Chicago, Sen. Barack Obama chose a less than celebratory topic: the absence of men in the lives of many children, especially black children.
 
""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children.""
 
He went on to say that these absent fathers don't realize that ""responsibility does not end at conception"" and are ""acting like boys instead of men.""
 
The

New York Times

noted that Obama sounded like comedian Bill Cosby, who has blamed fatherlessness in the black community, among other things, for African-Americans' overrepresentation in jail and underrepresentation among the educated.
 
By using the term ""we,"" we will assume Obama is speaking to people roughly his age, 46. And by that measure, his claim is backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1960, the year before Obama was born, 22 percent of black children lived with single parents. In 1968, the number rose to 31.4 percent. By 2006, the 1960 percentage had more than doubled to 56 percent.
 
And the single parents are overwhelmingly women.
 
In 2006, 91.4 percent of single parents of black children were mothers. That figure hasn't changed over the years. In 1960, it was a shade lower at 91 percent.
 
The figures for single-parent families show a rosier picture among other races. About 28 percent of children of all races lived with a single parent in 2006. In 1960, only about 9 percent of American children lived with a single parent.
 
The absence of fathers is important, Obama continued, because ""children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.""
 
Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatrist with Harvard Medical School and co-author with Bill Cosby of

Come on People: On the Path from Victims to Victors,

said Obama's view rings true: The absence of fathers corresponds with a host of social ills, including dropping out of school and serving time in jail.
 
But he said other factors such as poverty, education level and the age of parents also correlate with single motherhood and adolescent problems.
 
""I felt he was correct in calling attention to the fact that father involvement in children's lives is very important for their well-being and their healthy growth, and studies show that,"" Poussaint said.
 
Rebecca Blank, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies social and economic policy, wrote in an e-mail that it's difficult to pinpoint the exact causes of the social problems Obama mentions because they're so interrelated.
 
But solid research has shown that growing up in a single-family household, even if other factors are controlled, has a negative effect.
 
""I think there are very few social scientists these days who wouldn't agree that children in single-parent households are at risk of a variety of bad outcomes and that family structure has some causal impact on that risk,"" she wrote.
 
Obama's premise that the absence of fathers is leading to social problems is backed up by research, but we're not ruling on that part of his statement. We're ruling on his claim that, ""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children,"" which U.S. Census numbers substantiate. And we rule it to be True.

Obama co-sponsored Illinois welfare reform
","In one of his first ads since winning the Democratic nomination for president, Sen. Barack Obama speaks directly to the camera about his life story and his legislative accomplishments.
 
""America is a country of strong families and strong values,"" the ad begins. ""My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up.""
 
Later in the ad, Obama says, ""I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected.""
 
The claim that Obama moved people from welfare to work goes back to his days as a state senator in the Illinois legislature. President Bill Clinton and Congress significantly overhauled welfare in 1996, requiring recipients to work and setting time limits on benefits. The states in turn had to change their laws to meet the new federal requirements.
 
In 1997, Obama signed up as a chief co-sponsor (one of five in the senate) on Illinois' version of the legislation.
 
But the Illinois governor at the time, Republican Jim Edgar, got a lot of credit as well. Press reports from the time referred to the plan as ""the Edgar plan.""
 
This isn't the first time Obama has referred to

Illinois laws as if he passed them singlehandedly

. Nevertheless, the legislation's primary role was welfare reform, and the legislative record shows that Obama had a leadership role in getting it passed. For these reasons, we find Obama's claim Mostly True.

Other countries, too
","The presidential candidates are fond of talking about how we like to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, and how bad this is. (

Read our story on this phenomenon here

.)
 
""We took out a credit card from the bank of China and the bank of Saudi in the name of our kids, borrowing money to finance this war,"" Obama said on the campaign trail in May 2008. ""You're going to be paying them interest for generations to come -- that makes us weaker.""
 
Obama's correct in his implication that the U.S. is borrowing money to fund the war, because the U.S. government is running budget deficits, meaning the government is spending more money than it brings in through taxes and fees.
 
Of course, the government cannot just print extra paper money when it needs to spend or it would devalue U.S. currency. Instead, it issues, or more precisely sells, U.S. Treasury securities, which are simply IOUs that guarantee repayment with interest. Many U.S. citizens buy them, often in the form of U.S. bonds, but so do many foreign countries, who see them as a safe, stable investment.
 
The number one holder of U.S. Treasury securities among foreign countries isn't China or Saudi Arabia. It's actually Japan. China is number two, the United Kingdom is number three, and a group of oil-producing countries (which includes Saudi Arabia) is number four.
 
So, here's the problem with Obama's argument. And with McCain's. And with Clinton's, while we're at it. All have made similar statements. The bonds the government sells are not program-specific so there is no direct relationship between the holder of bonds and any particular expense of the U.S. government.
Obama could have easily said that Japan or the United Kingdom is lending us money to pay for the war, and that would have been just as true as what he did say.
 
So Obama is correct in his point that the government is spending borrowed money, and that some of our lenders include China and Saudi Arabia. But the lenders also include countries that we think of as friends and allies. By naming only lending nations that might alarm voters, Obama is distorting the picture somewhat. So for this reason, we find his statement Half True.

Obama not one of the Gang
","
In the contest to claim the title as the true champion of bipartisan politics, both Sen. John McCain and Sen. Barack Obama often portray themselves as the man most likely to have success reaching across the aisle to break the logjam of Washington politics.
 
To bolster his case, McCain recently harkened back to the spring of 2005, when he was part of a small bipartisan effort to resolve a bitter standoff between Senate Democrats and Republicans over three conservative judicial nominees named by President George W. Bush.
 
""I joined the Gang of 14, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, so that we wouldn't blow up the United States Senate,"" McCain said in a virtual town hall meeting on June 14, 2008. ""Sen. Obama had the opportunity to join that group. He chose not to.""
 
At the time, the Democrats were using the filibuster to block confirmation votes on some conservative judges. Traditionally, the selection of judges had been viewed as a presidential power that was not to be curtailed. Senators felt free to vote against a nomination, but using procedural powers in the Senate to keep them from coming to a vote at all hadn't been done. The idea that Democrats were willing to use the filibuster to block judges was seen by many as an affront to the protocol-driven operations of the Senate.
 
The Republicans, headed by Bill Frist, were bucking for the so-called ""nuclear option,"" in which they would approve a series of procedural changes to allow the Senate to end filibusters with a majority vote, rather than a ""supermajority"" vote of 60 votes (essentially putting an end to the practice altogether).
 
As part of the Gang of 14 compromise, the Democrats agreed not to support furthering the filibuster of the judicial nominees and not to initiate filibusters of future nominations except under ""extreme circumstances."" In exchange, the Republicans agreed not to vote with Frist on the ""nuclear option."" To be sure, McCain caught a lot of political heat from hard-line members of his party who wanted to move ahead with the ""nuclear option.""
 
Obama was not one of the seven Democrats on the Gang of 14.
 
At the time, Obama reluctantly supported the filibuster.
 
""I'm not a huge fan of the filibuster,"" Obama was quoted as saying in April 2005. ""Historically, what was it used for? Keeping me (an African-American) out of polling places.""
 
Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of the Gang of 14, told McClatchy Newspapers in March 2008 that it was unfair to emphasize Obama's absence from the bipartisan group, because he wasn't pressed to join.
 
""When we got to seven (Democrats) counting myself, there was some discussion of expanding it,"" Nelson said, ""but there was the thought it would be more unworkable.""
 
In his book,

The Audacity of Hope,

Obama states: ""I declined to be a part of what would be called the Gang of 14; given the profiles of some of the judges involved, it was hard to see what judicial nominee might be so much worse as to constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' worthy of filibuster. Still, I could not fault my colleagues for their efforts. The Democrats involved had made a practical decision — without the deal, the 'nuclear option' would have likely gone through.""
 
In an interview with the

St. Petersburg Times

on May 21, 2008, Obama was less generous in his assessment of the deal.
 
""The Republicans like to emphasize the Gang of 14 because frankly the Republicans got everything they wanted out of that,"" Obama said. ""I don't think it was a particularly good compromise.""
 
One can attach whatever significance one wants to McCain's statement, but the bottom line is that it's accurate. We rate it True.

Pushing the envelope to link debt and energy
","John McCain says we're borrowing money from foreign governments to buy oil. He's not too happy about this. (

Read our story on how other candidates make similar statements here

.)
 
""We are borrowing from foreign lenders to buy oil from foreign producers,"" he said in a Houston speech. ""In the world's capital markets, often we are even borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil. For them, the happy result is that they are both supplier and creditor to the most productive economy on earth. For us, the result is both dependency and debt.
 
""Over time, in interest payments, we lose trillions of dollars that could have been better invested in American enterprises. And we lose value in the dollar itself, as our debt portfolio undermines confidence in the American economy.""
 
When McCain says ""borrowing"", he doesn't mean a literal loan from a foreign country's government. Rather, it's the investments that foreigners make -- through buying bonds, but also through investments in the private sector -- because they see America as a good place to invest their money and want to keep their wealth in dollars.
 
Economists we talked to say McCain is right that collectively the United States as a whole spends more than it saves.
 
""As a country, we borrow because American households save very little and the government runs large budget deficits. As a result, we have a saving deficit that can only be financed by borrowing from abroad,"" said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan research group.
 
We also import much more oil than we produce -- a lot more -- and that leads us to the second part of McCain's debt equation.
 
But there's no direct line between borrowing money from the Saudis and buying their oil, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC., who also blogs for the liberal magazine The American Prospect.
 
""What McCain says about Saudi Arabia and oil would be equally true of any imported good from any country,"" Baker said. ""China is also a huge buyer of dollars, so they are lending us the money to buy their clothes.""
 
Jerry Taylor, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, had the harshest assessment of McCain's comments.
 
""All trade across borders implies some degree of 'dependency,' as John McCain seems to define the term. If 'dependency' is bad, then free trade is bad,"" Taylor wrote us via email. ""Restricting investments to 'American enterprises' is to restrict profit opportunity.""
 
Bosworth says McCain is connecting problems -- low savings and dependence on costly foreign oil -- that are really separate issues.
 
""I don't think that there is any link between oil prices causing the low saving of American households or the government's budget deficits,"" he said. ""Both preceded the rise in oil prices. Some people will prefer a solution that increases energy supply and others will argue that it is time to reduce demand. I don't think the lack of saving will play much of a role.""
 
McCain is right in some of the larger themes he's expressing. The U.S. does borrow more than it saves, and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy expenditures. But the two phenomena aren't causally related. The Saudis aren't running a company store, where we're required to borrow from them to buy the product. Rather, these are two issues taking on new relevance because of dramatic increases in oil prices.
 
McCain isn't entirely wrong, but by his choice of words he gives the impression that the two dynamics are working together. For this reason, we find his statement Half True.

No relief at pump here and now
","When Sen. John McCain dropped his energy bombshell, calling for the federal government to lift restrictions on offshore drilling for oil, he began by noting the high price of gas these days.
 
""With gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians,"" McCain said in a speech on Tuesday in the oil hub of Houston, Texas.
 
""As a matter of fairness to the American people, and a matter of duty for our government, we must deal with the here and now,"" McCain said, ""and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production.""
 
The political momentum for offshore drilling has always risen and fallen along with gas prices. But while there are strong arguments that can be made in favor of offshore drilling, reducing the cost of gas ""here and now"" isn't one of them, according to oil experts and economists - many of whom support the plan.
 
For starters, the lead time for oil exploration takes years. Even if offshore drilling areas opened up tomorrow, experts say it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant production. And even then, they say, the U.S. contribution to the overall global oil market would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas.
 
""Drilling offshore to lower oil prices is like walking an extra 20 feet per day to lose weight,"" said David Sandalow, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of Freedom from Oil. ""It's just not going to make much difference.""
 
It takes years to bring new oil wells online, said Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with PFC Energy in Washington. Companies need to drill exploratory wells, then discovery wells around the exploratory wells that show promise. Shipyards that build platforms, a two to three year endeavor, are already booked solid.
 
""It's foolish to sell it as a short-term solution to high gas prices,"" Rodgers said. ""Opening off-shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today.""
 
That being said, Rodgers is a proponent of offshore drilling.
 
Most forecasters believe we are in for more dramatic prices hikes as international demand grows, particularly in rapidly developing countries such as India and China. As demand rises, Rodgers said, it would be good for the U.S. to have more of its own supply.
 
If there is a larger domestic supply of oil in the future, he said, ""you would hope"" it might soften prices some.
 
But even long term projections on the impact of offshore drilling don't promise much relief at the pump.
 
An analysis performed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the independent statistical and analytical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy, found in a report published in 2007 that opening up the outer continental shelf in the Pacific, Atlantic and eastern Gulf regions would result in production no sooner than 2017, and would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil production before 2030.
 
""Because oil prices are determined on the international market, however, any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant,"" the report concludes.
 
The EIA also researched the impact of crude oil production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To put it in scale, ANWR is believed to have a potential for 10.4 billion barrels of crude oil, a little more than half of the projected potential for the offshore areas McCain has proposed opening.
 
ANWR would add only 1 to 2 percent to the overall world oil supply, said Philip Budzig, who authored the report for the EIA. The report concluded drilling there would subtract anywhere from 41 cents to $1.44 per barrel of crude oil around 2025. That translates to a savings of just a couple pennies per gallon at the pump. Again, in 2025.
 
Budzig noted that the report was prepared when oil was going for about $65 a barrel. It's now double that. So, in theory, savings might be double what he projected last year.
 
The case for offshore drilling becomes more compelling when you look long term, Budzig said.
 
Increasing domestic oil production will lower the U.S. trade deficit, he said, putting less stress on the dollar.
 
""It's sort of like investing in your kid's education,"" Budzig said.
 
Former Florida Sen. Bob Graham told the

St. Petersburg Times

he was horrified by McCain's plan.
 
""I doubt there's an economist alive that would make the case that there's a near or longer term relationship between the moratorium and the price of gasoline,"" Graham said.
 
Several economists who spoke to PolitiFact backed that up.
 
""Obviously, if you do offshore drilling now it's not going to give any short term help on the supply of oil,"" said Paul A. Samuelson, a professor of economics at MIT and winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Economics. ""That's far away.""
 
""Getting oil from the tundra and arctic isn't going to solve the problem,"" Samuelson said, adding that the potential for environmental damage needs to be factored in as well.
 
Dr. A.F. Alhaji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, said he supports offshore drilling as a long-term way to lower dependence on foreign oil and thereby improve national security.
 
However, he said, ""I have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons. The reality is there is no correlation between today's prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf.""
 
In fairness, McCain made many arguments when making his case for lifting offshore drilling bans - including enhanced national security. But he left little doubt that the fundamental impetus was to provide some relief to the high prices Americans are paying for gas ""here and now."" And that argument holds little weight. We rule it False.

Right on the number, just a year off
","Some days, John McCain and his advisers sound like they are running as much against President Bush as against Sen. Barack Obama. And after using issues like climate change and nuclear disarmament to begin distancing themselves from the administration, McCain & Co. now are branding themselves as hard-nosed fiscal managers capable of putting the clamps on federal spending … unlike President Bush.
 
McCain adviser Carly Fiorina, former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Corp., took aim at the president's economic stewardship during a June 17, 2008, appearance on MSNBC's

Morning Joe

program, criticizing Bush and GOP leaders who ran Congress for much of his tenure for failing to cut spending to offset his tax cuts.
 
""This Republican president, George Bush, and a Republican Congress, have presided over a 55 percent increase in the size of domestic government spending in the last seven years,"" Fiorina said.
 
McCain's camp is eager to draw distinctions, aware that Obama and Democrats are intent on trying to tie the presumptive GOP nominee to Bush's positions to taxes and some spending priorities. Earlier this month, McCain's top adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, derided Bush's knowledge of the economy in an interview with Bloomberg Television, saying the president knows nothing about the economy except taxes. Holtz-Eakin later said he regretted personalizing the issue.
 
While the definition of ""domestic government spending"" that Fiorina brought up is open to some interpretation, historical tables in the fiscal 2009 budget request that Bush issued in February 2008 demonstrate that all types of federal spending have surged during the Bush years. But domestic spending has not risen quite as fast as Fiorina suggests.
 
Total nondefense domestic spending rose to $2.18-trillion in fiscal 2007 from $1.49-trillion in fiscal 2000 — a 46 percent increase. A good portion of that is attributable to the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, which drove up entitlement costs. Throw in national security spending increases after 9/11, particularly the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and cumulative spending for the same seven years rose 53 percent, from $1.79-trillion to $2.73-trillion.
 
Because McCain supported many of Bush's national security priorities, and even pressed for sending more troops to Iraq, it would be disingenuous for him to portray Bush and Republican Congresses as profligate in these areas. But on the domestic front, McCain did join other fiscal conservatives in opposing the 2003 Medicare drug bill, preferring to target drug benefits to the needy in an effort to avoid broad new federal mandates. And he has consistently spoken about the need to offset tax cuts with spending reductions, including stamping out earmarks in spending bills.
 
The budget documents show discretionary domestic spending — money not explicitly mandated by law and made available through annual spending bills in such amounts as Congress chooses — rose 54 percent over the seven-year timeframe Fiorina cited. Mandatory spending on Social Security, Medicare, other entitlements and interest payments on government debt rose 44 percent.
 
Interestingly, Fiorina's claim is right on the money if you roll estimated spending for fiscal 2008 into the equation, which makes us wonder if she should tweak her talking points. Bush's budget request estimates nondefense domestic spending will total $2.32-trillion in 2008. That's precisely a 55 percent increase from the $1.49-trillion it totaled in 2000.
 
Either way, Fiorina's point is generally backed up by the numbers. Domestic spending did surge during the Bush years, along with every other broad category of government outlays. We judge her claim Mostly True.

Yes, Obama wants to tax windfall profits
","As the candidates jockey over energy policies and offshore drilling, Sen. John McCain has been criticizing Sen. Barack Obama for wanting to raise taxes.
 
""He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas,"" McCain said in a June 18, 2008, speech in Houston. ""If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too — and a lot of good it did us.""
 
Indeed, McCain is right that Obama supports a windfall profits tax, which would be levied on oil companies to capture some of their profits from rising prices.
 
""I'll make oil companies like Exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits, and we'll use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills,"" Obama said in a speech June 9.
 
A windfall tax — actually an excise tax imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price — was enacted in 1980 but repealed in 1988. By then, oil prices had dropped, it was generating little or no revenue and there were concerns that it made the United States more dependent on foreign oil. Many Democrats want to bring it back to discourage oil companies from raising prices.
 
We couldn't find many details about Obama's windfall-profits proposal except that he would use it for
the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps the poor pay their heating and cooling bills.
 
As for the other part of McCain's claim, that Obama wants new taxes for coal and natural gas, the details are more sketchy.
 
The McCain campaign cites a February 2008 interview of Obama with

San Antonio Express-News

columnist Carlos Guerra. In that interview, Obama first answered a question about funding sources for education. Guerra then asked, ""Have you considered other funding sources, say taxing emerging energy forms, for example, say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy?""
 
Obama replied: ""Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it. We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. But I think that the real way to fund education is for local communities to step up and say this is important to us. There are no shortcuts.""
 
We couldn't find any other references to new taxes on coal or natural gas on the Obama's campaign Web site, although we found several items where Obama wants incentives for clean coal.
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the campaign, said Obama was referring to his proposal for a cap-and-trade system for global warming.
 
Still, it's clear from the context that the coal and natural gas comment was more an aside than an announcement of a major new tax proposal. But regardless, Obama said what he said: ""What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas.""
 
He may not have a detailed position paper on it, but it seems to be an overall statement of his beliefs and the Obama campaign did not dispute that he said it.
 
So we find McCain's claim to be Mostly True.

Friends, perhaps, but out of touch
","Less than an hour after Antoin ""Tony"" Rezko's June 4, 2008, conviction on federal charges of fraud and money laundering, the Republican National Committee fired off a news release titled ""Rezko: Obama's Longtime Friend and Money Man.""
 
The first line reads: ""Obama has maintained a friendship with a now convicted felon.""
 
There is no question Rezko was a longtime friend of Sen. Barack Obama's. In a lengthy interview with the

Chicago Sun-Times

published March 15, 2008, Obama detailed a relationship that dated back to when Obama was finishing law school at Harvard and Rezko approached him about coming to work for his development company. Obama declined.
 
He got to know Rezko, he said, when Obama's law work overlapped occasionally with Rezko's development business. But the two became friends when Obama made his first run for Illinois state Senate. Rezko was a key supporter and fundraiser for Obama.
 
""So we became friendly at that point, and through most of my years in the Senate, he was somebody I considered a friend, and I'd probably see maybe when I wasn't in the midst of a campaign, I would probably see maybe six times a year,"" Obama said. ""We'd have lunch or we'd have breakfast.""
 
Obama and his wife, Michelle, had dinners with Rezko and his wife a couple times, Obama said, and they once visited the Rezkos' home at Lake Geneva, in Wisconsin, for the day.
 
When Obama ran for U.S. Senate in 2004, Rezko served on his finance committee and was a significant fundraiser. Rezko even hosted a fundraising event in his home.
 
In the wake of Rezko's October 2006 indictment, the Obama campaign took all campaign contributions tied to Rezko — $160,000 as of January 2008 — and donated them to charity.
 
Although the GOP's support material for its claim that Obama ""has maintained a friendship"" with Rezko relates much of this prior relationship, the words ""has maintained"" suggests that Obama has an ongoing friendship with Rezko.
 
In the March interview with the

Chicago Sun-Times,

Obama said he had not spoken to Rezko since the indictment.
 
Obama was asked if he still considered Rezko a friend.
 
""Yes, with the caveat that obviously if it turns out that the allegations are true, then he's not who I thought he was, and I'd be very disappointed with that,"" Obama said.
 
In a statement issued after the verdict, Obama said he was ""saddened"" by Rezko's conviction.
""This isn't the Tony Rezko I knew,"" he stated.
 
Obama said that if elected president, he would not pardon Rezko for his corruption convictions or reduce his prison time. (Rezko is in federal custody pending his Sept. 3, 2008, sentencing.)
 
Any implication that Obama continues to maintain a friendship with Rezko — getting together, even speaking on the phone — is misleading.
 
But the GOP says it only meant that Obama had, in the past, maintained a friendship with Rezko — which he certainly did. And ""maintained a friendship"" is a bit ambiguous as well. Obama said in March he hadn't spoken to Rezko in more than a year, and it's a safe bet the two won't be kicking back at a sports bar any time soon. But still, even in March, Obama said he still considered Rezko a friend. We rate the GOP statement Mostly True.

There's no ""gotcha"" here
","In the immediate wake of the conviction of Antoin ""Tony"" Rezko, a prominent former fundraiser for Sen. Barack Obama, on federal charges of fraud and money laundering, the Republican National Committee put out a news release that raises questions about whether Obama has profited from his relationship with Rezko. ""Could Obama have afforded his home without Rezko's help?"" the release asks. Obama and his wife, Michelle, purchased a century-old mansion from a Chicago doctor in 2005 for $1.65-million. On the same day the Obamas closed on their house, Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, bought a vacant lot next door from the same seller, at the full asking price. While the lots were being sold separately, and the seller has confirmed that  the Obamas got no discount  from Rezko purchasing the lot next door, the GOP news release suggests Obama flip-flopped on the issue of whether he could afford to buy the vacant lot purchased by Rezko. ""Obama originally said that he could not afford to purchase the parcel of land Rezko's wife purchased and that the house itself was already a stretch."" ""But Obama later said that he did not need help purchasing 'both or either of the tracts' of land involved in the purchase of his Chicago home."" The first statement is accurate. It comes from an interview Obama had with the  Chicago Tribune,  published Nov. 1, 2006: ""It was 'already a stretch' to buy the house, Obama said, so the vacant lot was not affordable for his family."" The second quote is based on a  Time  magazine reporter asking Obama for a March 6, 2008, story: ""Did you generally or expressively state a need for help in buying both or either of the tracts?"" Obama: ""No, I didn't need help."" This answer isn't the clear contradiction it's made out to be. Obama was not asked if he could afford to buy both of the tracts, he was asked if he ever told Rezko that he needed help buying both or either of the tracts. In an interview with the  Chicago Sun-Times  in March 2008, Obama said the sellers had originally sought to sell the house together with the vacant lot next door, but when the property sat on the market for a long time, they decided to separate the lots. The second vacant lot was big enough to be developed. So by the time the Obamas first saw the house, it was being marketed separately. Obama has consistently said that he only ever pursued the purchase of the home, not the lot. In that context, he would have had no reason to tell Rezko he couldn't afford both lots. And with his recent book advances, he apparently had the money to buy the house without Rezko's help. (His 2005 financial disclosure form states that he received $378,239 in book royalties; and $847,167 in a book advance.) His answer to  Time  appears to reflect that. The GOP appears to be parsing words in hopes of scoring a ""gotcha"" that just isn't there. We rate the statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F25640>],/factchecks/2008/jun/17/republican-national-committee-republican/theres-no-gotcha-here/
