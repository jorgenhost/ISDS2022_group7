Police say the officer on stage with Trump isn’t Derek Chauvin
","In video footage taken before he died on May 25, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, repeats that he ""can’t breathe"" as a white Minneapolis police officer presses his knee into Floyd’s neck.  That officer, who has been identified as Derek Chauvin, and three other officers who were at the scene have been fired. Chauvin, a 19-year-veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department, has been involved in several police-involved shootings, the Star Tribune reported. On social media, people are sharing a photo that seemingly adds another layer to his history.  ""Hey look,"" reads the caption of a photo that shows several people on a stage with President Donald Trump. A yellow arrow points to a man standing near him, behind a podium with the presidential seal. ""Here’s a picture of Derek Chauvin - the cop who killed George Floyd.""   A Fox News affiliate in Minneapolis reported on May 27 that neither Chauvin nor the other three officers were at the October campaign rally in Minneapolis that’s shown in the photo being shared online.  Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, spoke at the rally, according to the station. Kroll, who is standing next to the man in the photo social media users have fingered as Chauvin, said it’s a different officer.  We rate this Facebook post False.",/factchecks/2020/may/27/viral-image/police-say-officer-stage-trump-isnt-derek-chauvin/

Americans have died from the flu and COVID-19
","Flawed claims that the seasonal flu has killed more people than COVID-19 have circulated around the internet for a while now.  But now a post on Facebook claims the opposite: that no Americans have died from the flu in 2020.

Because the agency can’t track each case of influenza through its weekly surveillance data, it provides an estimated range to ""reflect the larger burden,"" its website says. According to preliminary CDC data, there were anywhere from 24,000 to 62,000 American flu deaths from Oct. 1, 2019, through April 4, 2020.

Flu fatalities are based on death certificate data, which are collected and estimated each week by the National Center for Health Statistics within the CDC. According to the NCHS weekly tally of influenza deaths, about 8,000 Americans have died from influenza from January 2020 to May 16, 2020. This is not counting deaths caused by pneumonia, which is a common complication of the flu. The CDC says that COVID-19, which has now killed nearly 100,000 Americans, is affecting the way people are seeking health care, so data should be interpreted with caution.

Michigan Gov. Whitmer did not spend May 20 at her vacation home
","Some Facebook users say they have proof that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer isn’t following her own stay-at-home order. On May 20, conservative radio host Randy Bishop posted an image that shows two cars outside a blue house and a garage. In the caption, he claimed it was taken that afternoon at Whitmer’s ""‘UpNorth Cottage’ in Antrim County."" ""Evidently Gov. Whitmer's ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ executive orders DON'T apply to HER family!!!"" Bishop wrote. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) Since Whitmer, a Democrat, has been the target of several hoaxes about her handling of the coronavirus pandemic, we wanted to check out this Facebook post, too. We did not find definitive proof that the photo was taken on May 20, but the photo did not appear online prior to that date. The governor’s office says Whitmer was not at her second home on May 20. We reached out to Bishop for his evidence, but we haven’t heard back. An executive order signed by Whitmer that went into effect mid-April prohibited people from traveling between two residences. Although she has extended her stay-at-home order through June 12, the provision banning travel to second homes within the state has been dropped. ""Michiganders may travel between their residences, but I still strongly discourage people from doing so unless it is absolutely necessary,"" Whitmer said in late April. ""We ask that you consider not doing that."" Whitmer lives in the governor’s mansion in Lansing, but her primary residence is in East Lansing, according to her 2018 financial disclosure. The document also lists a ""family lake house"" in Elk Rapids, a town in northern Michigan. A May 20 article from the Gateway Pundit appears to back up Bishop’s claim that Whitmer’s family spent the afternoon at their lake house. The conservative website researched the license plate on the black Chevrolet Tahoe in the photo and found that it belongs to Marc Mallory, Whitmer’s husband. ""Gretchen and Marc were at their summer home today,"" the Gateway Pundit wrote. That’s inaccurate, according to the Michigan governor’s office. ""The governor was in Midland to tour the devastating flood damage and meet with first responders as they evacuated thousands of people to safety,"" a spokeswoman told PolitiFact in an email. ""She then returned to her home in Lansing."" Media reports confirm that Whitmer spent May 20 in Midland. The next day, she held a press conference in Lansing about the state’s coronavirus response. There is some evidence that Mallory could have been at the couple’s home in Elk Rapids. Using public records searches and Google Earth, we confirmed that the car in the Facebook photo belongs to Mallory and the house is the family’s property on Birch Lake.  The Detroit News reported that the owner of NorthShore Dock LLC, a company near Birch Lake, said in Facebook posts that Mallory had called to try to get his boat in the water before Memorial Day weekend. The posts, which have since been deleted, attracted the ire of Republican state lawmakers, who say Whitmer’s family may not be following her own stay-at-home guidance. We asked the governor’s office about the veracity of the Facebook posts, but we haven’t heard back. Whitmer said Tuesday that Mallory’s call to the dock company, during which he asked if his status as the governor’s husband would help get his boat in the water, was a joke. ""He thought it might get a laugh,"" Whitmer said. ""It didn't, and to be honest I wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived."" Regardless, there is no evidence that Whitmer spent the afternoon of May 20 at her house in Elk Rapids. And even if she did, it would not have violated her current stay-at-home order.

Below the image, which has been shared widely on Facebook, is this caption: ""The woman in this photograph is Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, meeting with the Ku Klux Klan in 1926, Silver Lake, New Jersey.

In her 1938 autobiography, she wrote that she was willing to talk to virtually anyone as she advocated for birth control across the United States: ""Always to me any aroused group was a good group, and therefore I accepted an invitation to talk to the women’s branch of the Ku Klux Klan at Silver Lake, New Jersey, one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing.""  The Women of the Ku Klux Klan was not the KKK itself but a parallel organization that supported the goals of the men’s group. Attending the meeting in New Jersey involved a complicated process that included driving to a secret location, according to her autobiography.  We didn’t find any photos showing Sanger at that meeting.  And there’s no evidence that the KKK image shared in the Facebook post had anything to do with Sanger. It was taken during a Ku Klux Klan ritual in Georgia on Jan. 1, 1930, according to Getty Images. In the Facebook post, the photo has been altered to make it look like Sanger is in the frame along with a sign welcoming her to the meeting. However, the original photo shows a white cross where this doctored image makes it look like Sanger is standing. There is no sign referencing Sanger in the original photo either. Gizmodo reported in 2015 that the altered image was created in 2006 as part of a contest from an anti-Sanger blog. ""The blog contest, unsurprisingly, was pretty specific,"" Gizmodo says in the story.

No, Nancy Pelosi does not oppose remote voting by House members
","A Facebook post paints House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as hypocritical on voting. An image with the post shows two photos of Pelosi. One caption reads: ""Congress shall not vote remotely because it is not secure!""  The other reads: ""Americans should all vote for president by mail!"" The post itself says: ""Yes she did say them both."" Pelosi didn’t utter either of those quotes, according to our Google and Nexis searches. Pelosi is a prominent supporter of letting voters cast ballots by mail — a process opposed by President Donald Trump, who claims it is open to fraud. But this post mischaracterizes her stance on congressional voting.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In late March, as the House moved to pass a $2 trillion stimulus package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Pelosi expressed reluctance about lawmakers voting remotely  on the package. But by May, she voted for a measure that requires a House committee to study remote voting. March 24, interviews: On the idea of holding a remote vote on the $2 trillion stimulus, Pelosi told MSNBC: ""There are serious constitutional, technological and security concerns about it. They can be addressed, but for right now, we're just working very hard to get unanimous consent so we can get this bill done, and then consider what the options are later."" In an interview with CNN moments later, she was even more terse, The Hill reported, saying it may be an option in the future, but at the moment ""we're not prepared for (it)."" April 9, teleconference with reporters: Pelosi said any changes to the requirement that House members vote in person are a long way off, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, saying that Pelosi said: ""We’re not there yet, and we’re not going to be there no matter how many letters somebody sends in — with all the respect in the world for that.""  Her concerns included the security of any technology used, the constitutionality of changes to the rules and the time needed to be sure any new system is well thought out and bipartisan. Pelosi’s tone changed in the weeks before the May 10 Facebook post as the need for social distancing amid the outbreak became better understood. April 16, teleconference with reporters: ""I've said"" to the House committee chairs about remote voting, ""give our members options; show us how we can do what. What are the options that the Constitution, the rules of the House, the technology, the security enables us to do, and that is what they have been working on. Until we have an appropriate way to do it, we can’t do it. So, it’s not about being negative on it, it’s just, show us the way … . Everybody is working so hard on all of these initiatives, including how we can come together, whether it’s by proxy voting or remote voting or whatever it is. When we are ready, we will do it."" Sometimes the terms remote and proxy voting are used interchangeably, but they mean different things in this context. Remote refers to the concept of a member using technology to cast a vote; proxy refers to a member who is not on the House floor authorizing another member, who is on the floor, to cast their ballot. April 26, CNN interview: Asked if it’s time to allow remote voting during the pandemic, Pelosi said: ""I'm all for doing the remote voting by proxy. I want it to be bipartisan. The Republican leader, Mr. (Kevin) McCarthy, has assured me that he will consider this. He's not there yet; he could be there. But whether he is or not, we will — our process was to strive to make it bipartisan."" May 20, authorization: Pelosi formally authorized a 45-day period during which House members can vote by proxy. The House had adopted the change in rules on May 15, in a 217-189 vote, mostly along party lines; Pelosi voted yes. Any member attending a House vote can cast as many as 10 votes on behalf of colleagues. The new rules also allow, pending certification, for a process in which lawmakers will eventually be able to cast their votes from home, either via a secure online portal or a video conferencing system. The measure requires the House Administration Committee study the feasibility of using technology to conduct remote voting in the House. On May 26, House Republicans sued Pelosi to stop the new proxy voting system, claiming it is unconstitutional.  A Facebook post claimed Pelosi said ""Congress shall not vote remotely because it is not secure!"" while also saying that ""Americans should all vote for president by mail!"" Pelosi is a prominent supporter of voters casting ballots by mail. Initially, she raised concerns about House members voting remotely and said the House was not ready, but weeks before the post her tone changed and she backed a measure that requires a House committee to study the feasibility of using technology for remote voting.

Trump said Pa. Rep. Conor Lamb backed Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. That’s not true.
","President Donald Trump tweeted a Memorial Day attack on a Democratic congressman from western Pennsylvania, labeling him an ""American fraud"" while calling his political opponent an ""American hero.""  Trump also accused U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb — a Marine Corps veteran and former prosecutor who represents Allegheny, Butler, and Beaver counties — of being a puppet for Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and breaking his promise to vote against her for Speaker of the House. ""He said he would NOT vote for her for speaker, and he did,"" Trump wrote in a tweet endorsing Sean Parnell, an Army veteran who served in combat in Afghanistan and is Lamb’s Republican rival in Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district.  A quick search of Lamb’s voting record shows that Trump’s claim is not true.  Lamb vowed to support new leadership, and he followed through. He was one of 15 Democrats in Congress who did not vote for Pelosi in the January 2019 speaker election. Lamb voted for U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts instead. He was first elected to Congress in a March 2018 special election that heralded the midterm Democratic wave to come. Lamb won his first full term in November 2018, defeating three-term Republican incumbent Keith Rothfus by 12 percentage points.  Lamb was a federal prosecutor who served as a Judge Advocate in the Marine Corps for four years before being honorably discharged as a captain in 2013. He later served in the Marine reserves, ending his service this year.  Lamb responded to Trump’s attack by tweeting a screenshot of the message showing that Parnell had retweeted the president and saying this:  ""These people have been lying about my record since the day I became a candidate,"" he wrote.  ""It hasn’t stopped, and it won’t stop, until we beat them at the ballot box in November.""  Trump’s original tweet also misspelled Lamb’s name. He later deleted it and replaced it with a tweet that spells Lamb’s name correctly but makes the same false claim.  It wasn’t the first time Trump made a false claim about Lamb.  In March 2018, Trump falsely told attendees at a private fundraiser for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley that Lamb ""ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me.""  Lamb did run as a moderate Democrat in a conservative district and avoided openly criticizing the president. He even showed himself to be in agreement with Trump on certain policy points. But at the time, we found no evidence that Lamb praised the president on the campaign trail.  Trump accused Lamb of voting to make Pelosi speaker of the house, but his voting record from the January 2019 speaker election clearly shows he voted for another candidate.

No, California Is Not Sending Mail-In Ballots “To Anyone In The State,” As Trump Falsely Claimed
","President Trump claimed on Twitter Tuesday, without evidence, that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is sending millions of ballots to ""anyone living in the state, no matter who they are,"" while adding ""This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"" In the same Twitter thread, Trump repeated his allegation that voting by mail ""is substantially fraudulent,"" a claim election experts have said is overblown.  Here’s Trump’s full statement:  ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone..... ....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"" Trump repeated his claim during a news conference Tuesday afternoon, saying ""anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot.""  Trump’s attacks come two days after the California Republican Party, along with national GOP groups, filed a federal lawsuit against Newsom, a Democrat, to halt his plan to send mail-in ballots to Californians ahead of the November election. Newsom earlier this month ordered all counties to send out mail-in ballots, citing health concerns amid COVID-19. Contrary to Trump’s claim, no ballots have yet been sent out. We zeroed in on Trump’s claim that ""anyone living in the state, no matter who they are"" would receive these ballots. We set out on a fact check.  Our research A review of Newsom’s executive order shows only registered voters would receive vote-by-mail ballots, not ""anyone living in the state,"" as Trump claimed.   ""Each county elections officials shall transmit vote-by-mail ballots for the November 3, 2020 General Election to all voters who are, as of the last day on which vote-by-mail ballots may be transmitted to voters in connection with that election, registered to vote in that election. As set forth in this paragraph, every Californian who is eligible to vote in the November 3, 2020 General Election shall receive a vote-by-mail ballot."" The Secretary of State’s website outlines criteria for registering to vote in California.  You must be:  A United States citizen and a resident of California, 18 years old or older on Election Day, Not currently in state or federal prison or on parole for the conviction of a felony Not currently found mentally incompetent to vote by a court  This criteria reinforces the fact that not just ""anyone"" would receive a ballot.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence supporting Trump’s statement.  Newsom rejected the president’s assertion that voting by mail leads to fraud when asked about it during a press conference on Tuesday. The governor also cited several studies that have examined the practice and found an extremely low rate of fraud, including a 5-year effort by the Bush administration that turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections.  ""I don’t think it deserves to be politicized. This is a health issue,"" Newsom added.  A spokesperson for Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who is also a Democrat, also disputed the president’s assertion. ""Only active registered voters will be mailed a ballot ahead of the November 3, 2020 General Election. The President’s tweet is completely false,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email.  Voters are considered ""inactive"" if they do not vote in two consecutive federal general elections or if their county receives a returned residency confirmation without a forwarding address within the same county, according to the Secretary of State’s website.  Trump’s claim led Twitter, for the first time on Tuesday, to place a fact-checking warning on the president’s tweet. A spokesperson for Twitter told NPR the tweet contains ""misleading information about the voting process, specifically mail-in ballots."" Padilla has pushed back against Trump’s past claims about vote-by-mail. On Twitter on Sunday, Padilla responded to the GOP lawsuit this way: ""Expanding vote-by-mail during a pandemic is not a partisan issue — it’s a moral imperative to protect voting rights and public safety. Vote-by-mail has been used safely and effectively in red, blue, and purple states for years. This lawsuit is just another part of Trump’s political smear campaign against voting by mail. We will not let this virus be exploited for voter suppression."" Some Republicans have cited issues of voter roll maintenance as evidence of fraud. President Trump, for example, has falsely cited a January 2019 settlement California reached with the conservative group Judicial Watch as evidence. On ""Meet the Press"" last year, Trump alleged the settlement shows California ""admitted"" there were ""a million"" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election. We rated that claim Pants On Fire. In reality, the agreement Trump cited required Los Angeles County election officials to remove inactive registrations from voter rolls to comply with federal law. The 20-page settlement document, however, notes all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county. It makes no mention of voter fraud or illegal voting. During the 2016 campaign, Trump distorted the findings in a 2012 Pew study to allege widespread voter fraud was taking place. The national study found 24 million voter registrations were ""no longer valid or significantly inaccurate."" More than 1.8 million dead people were listed as voters, the report said, and 2.75 million people were registered to vote in more than one state. Trump has used that study to allege ""dead people"" are voting. But an analysis of the study by FactCheck.org shows ""The report did not allege the 1.8 million deceased people actually voted. Rather, Pew said that it is evidence of the need to upgrade voter registration systems.""  Our rating President Trump claimed California Gov. Gavin Newsom ""is sending millions of ballots to anyone living in the state, no matter who they are,"" while adding ""This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"" In reality, Newsom ordered counties to send mail-in ballots only to registered voters in California, hardly to ""anyone living in the state.""  To register to vote in California, residents must be 18, U.S. citizens, not in state or federal prison or on parole for the conviction of a felony, and not declared mentally incompetent to vote by a court.  When combined with the misleading allegation that mail-in voting leads to fraud (something election experts say is exceedingly rare), and Trump’s assertion that California’s election will be ""Rigged,"" the president’s overall claim is reckless, unsubstantiated and wrong.

Facebook post gets debt wrong in comparison of Florida, Texas, California and New York
","The COVID-19 pandemic has put a massive strain on state budgets but some social media users have pointed the finger at Democrat-led states. A Facebook post lists metrics for the four most populous states including their budgets. It states that Texas and Florida have ""balanced"" budgets while California is ""in debt $54 billion and New York is ""in debt $6.1 billion."" While this post didn’t comment on the party affiliations of the governors, similar posts point out that the governors of Florida and Texas are Republicans while the governors of New York and California are Democrats. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is misleading in multiple ways. It fails to explain some basics about state budgets.  First, it’s common for states to borrow money to construct state buildings, roads or environmental restoration. You can have debt and a balanced budget. And all of these states must pass a balanced budget.  Second, the post describes certain dollar amounts as ""debt"" when they were actually shortfalls. All four states, in fact, carry billions of dollars in debt. Shortfalls occur when revenue collections come in lower than expected and/or expenditures can come in higher than forecasted, said Brian Sigritz, the Director of State Fiscal Studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers. Comparing different states’ budget gaps is difficult, because they tend to change month-to-month and states release revenue forecasts at different times. Amid COVID-19, Sigritz warned that ""some states may not have announced a budget gap figure yet, but will likely face a shortfall."" ""Debt"" in the context of a state budget refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. A projected shortfall or budget gap is the amount that state officials have to address in order to balance a state budget.  RELATED: New York pension fund does not need a federal bailout Florida’s total state direct debt outstanding as of June 30, 2019, was $20.6 billion. ""As for the impact of COVID-19, there is little official revenue data or estimates yet, although we know it will be big,"" said Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at Florida TaxWatch, a key budget watchdog organization. April experienced an overall combined revenue loss of $878.1 million, the state estimated. Wenner said that most officials believe there is enough in reserves and federal aid to avoid a deficit in this budget year. ""After the governor signs the new budget (and presumably vetoes a lot) and more revenue data comes in, we'll have a better idea of what the next fiscal year looks like,"" Wenner said. Texas passes a budget every two years and the current budget year ends on Aug. 31, 2021.   The state hasn’t revised the budget but Comptroller Glenn Hegar has said the economy is in a recession and announced that state sales tax revenues from April 2019 compared to April 2020 saw the steepest decline since January 2010. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott requested state agencies and universities submit a plan by June 15 that uses savings to reduce their use of revenue by 5%. The Texas Tribune reported that the budget will be ""billions of dollars out of balance."" The most recent calculations show Texas had a total of $59.9 billion in state debt by August 31, 2019.  News articles at the end of 2019 stated that New York faced a $6.1 billion budget gap —-- before the pandemic hit. (The Citizens Budget Commission said the amount was $7 billion.) In April, the state Assembly passed a $177 billion budget by borrowing, relying on federal aid and deferring some decisions. The budget for the 2020-2021 year started in April.  The economic downturn has worsened the state’s finances. Before the pandemic, the state was expecting a 7% increase in revenue, but now it is expecting a 14% decline in revenue. A state estimate on April 25 puts revenue losses at $13.3 billion this year and $61 billion over the next four years.  Outstanding debt at the end of fiscal year 2020, which closed on March 31, was $54.4 billion. The state issues debt for capital purposes such as road and bridge construction, environmental conservation, and facility construction. California’s debt was reported to be $129 billion as of May 1, 2020. In the 2020-21 budget Newsom proposed in January, the state of California planned to pay part of this debt and had a projected $5.6 billion budget surplus for the 2020-21 fiscal year. This was before COVID-19 shut down businesses and led to high unemployment in California. In May, Politico reported new forecasts of a 25% plunge in ""the state's big three tax sources — personal income, sales and corporations"" would lead to a $54.3 billion deficit.  Newsom released revisions to the budget on May 14 which are supposed to balance the budget for the next year. But there is a projected deficit in future years, culminating in $16 billion dollars by 2023-24.  A Facebook post said Texas and Florida have a ""balanced budget"" while California is ""in debt $54 billion"" and New York is ""in debt $6.1 billion."" This post misleads readers in multiple ways. First, it is possible to have debt and a balanced budget. Second, the post mixes up debt with budget shortfalls. All four states carry billions in debt. Third, it’s difficult to compare the current financial status of four different states because they have different budget cycles and the impact of the pandemic remains a moving economic target.  While Florida and Texas have passed balance budgets, they too are certain to face economic woes related to the pandemic.  In early May, California officials projected a $54 billion shortfall, but a new budget proposal lays out a plan to balance the budget, although it still leaves a projected future deficit.  The $6.1 billion figure for New York stems from projections late last year about a shortfall, and ignores that the state has since passed a balanced budget. This statement rates False. ",/factchecks/2020/may/26/facebook-posts/facebook-post-gets-debt-wrong-comparison-florida-t/

Donald Trump spreads baseless claim that MSNBC host murdered a staff member in 2001
","Twice in the past two weeks, President Donald Trump has revived the unsupported assertion that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough murdered a member of his staff when he served in Congress in 2001. ""When will they open a cold case on the psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida,"" Trump tweeted May 12. ""Did he get away with murder?"" When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn’t it obvious? What’s happening now? A total nut job! ""So many unanswered and obvious questions, but I won’t bring them up now!"" he tweeted May 26. ""Law enforcement eventually will?"" We reached out to the White House to learn more about the unanswered questions and did not hear back. To the best of anyone’s knowledge, there are no questions that have any grounding in fact. In the summer of 2001, Lori Klausutis, a  constituent services coordinator was found dead in Scarborough’s congressional district office in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. PolitiFact founder and former Washington bureau chief of the St. Petersburg Times Bill Adair investigated at the time. ""Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk,"" Adair wrote. ""The head injury caused the death, Berkland said."" Recently, Adair wrote on Twitter about the reporting experience. ""I filed public records requests and did a fair number of interviews. I talked with people who knew the aide, Lori Klausutis, and questioned the police chief and the medical examiner,"" he wrote. Adair said there is no evidence to support the idea that Klausutis died of anything but natural causes. She had told others on the day of her death that she was feeling unwell. At the time of her death, Scarborough was hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C. When Trump raised the ""unsolved mystery"" in 2017, we rated that Pants on Fire.

Biden beating Biden? Social media users misquote Biden, manufacture gaffe
","Conservative social media users are misquoting former Vice President Joe Biden, sharing an out-of-context clip that they claim shows the Democratic frontrunner accidentally saying he is going to beat himself in the upcoming presidential election. ""Joe Biden tells voters he’s ‘going to beat Joe Biden,’"" said the headline from a May 25 article on saraacarter.com.  The post followed similar claims in tweets from President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, his son Donald Trump Jr., Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and conservative pundits such as Fox News host Sean Hannity and Turning Point USA’s Benny Johnson.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Biden campaign told us what multiple other reporters and fact-checkers had already pointed out: That what Biden really said was, ""I’m going to be Joe Biden.""  Biden’s comments came during a May 22 interview with CNBC.  Anchor Joe Kernen asked Biden if he felt ""prepared now to say you’re going to govern as a progressive and enact programs in the mold of (Bernie) Sanders and (Elizabeth) Warren."" Biden replied by saying he was going ""to be Joe Biden"" and telling Kernen to ""look at my record"" before listing where he agrees and disagrees with Sanders and Warren on policies related to health care and student loan forgiveness. Here's Biden’s full response, which you can watch here. We’ve put the relevant portion in bold.  ""I’m prepared to say that I have a record of over 40 years and that I’m going to be Joe Biden.

I do believe that anyone going to school, that in fact goes to a public university and/or community college, they should be able to go for free if income is under $125,000.

Does GOP Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson call Social Security a Ponzi scheme and back privatizing it?
","Social Security is one of the most commonly used vehicles for attack ads in election campaigns. And the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, which will be decided Nov. 8, 2016, is no exception. Republican incumbent Ron Johnson said his Democratic challenger, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, ""voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors"" and ""tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."" Our rating was Mostly False. Feingold did support a measure that increased taxes on Social Security benefits for higher-income seniors, not across the board, but did not try to give benefits to illegal immigrants. Mostly False was also our rating when the Wisconsin Democratic Party said Johnson ""supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age"" for Social Security. Johnson has said he is open to considering such proposals and he voted for a federal budget proposal that contained them. But voting for a federal budget proposal and its myriad programs isn’t an explicit show of support for cutting benefits and raising the retirement age for Social Security. (Go here to see all of our fact checks in the Johnson-Feingold race.) Now comes Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group that released an ad Oct. 26, 2016 that makes this claim: ""Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program.""

We’ll check both parts. ‘Ponzi scheme’ During the U.S. Senate campaign in 2010, in which Johnson ousted Feingold, Johnson said Washington politicians ""run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme"" (a claim we rated Mostly False). A Ponzi scheme is illegal -- it’s an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Johnson has emphasized the pay-as-you-go nature of Social Security -- using taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans -- and decried the ""raiding"" of the Social Security trust fund. The claim from Americans United for Change, though, is that Johnson currently calls Social Security a Ponzi, not that it’s run like one. The Huffington Post reported that Johnson told a local Americans for Prosperity group in June 2016: ""We’ve got to convince more of our fellow citizens that Social Security really is — and by the way, I was wrong when I said this in 2010, I said it’s a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are illegal. So, Social Security is — it’s a legal Ponzi scheme."" Johnson has also called Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme on other occasions during the current campaign. ‘Privatize the program’ The Huffington Post article said Johnson supported privatizing Social Security, but that the public wasn’t ready for the idea. He was quoted as saying: ""Currently, politically, you can’t do it."" The article didn’t say whether Johnson explained what sort of privatizing he would favor. Johnson’s campaign did not dispute the Huffington Post story, which the website said was based on a recording it obtained. The campaign told us Johnson is willing ""to consider any serious proposal that would protect Social Security."" In 2015, Johnson told a small of group of people he would ""take a look"" at a form of privatization, according to a video clip that was posted to YouTube. He said perhaps he would be open to raising taxes for Social Security if people could keep part of the funds rather than having them go to the Social Security fund. Johnson also said it ""was a shame"" that a privatization initiative from President George W. Bush wasn’t explored more fully. And that brings up an important point. The claim that Johnson ""wants to privatize the program"" could be taken to mean a complete privatization. But there is no indication he backs that. The Bush initiative amounted to partial privatization. It would have allowed younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. Our rating Americans United for Change says: ""Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program."" Ponzi schemes are illegal. Johnson calls Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme to emphasize that it uses taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans. Johnson has expressed support for some form of privatization of Social Security, such as allowing individuals to invest some of their Social Security contributions, but it’s not clear that he backs complete privatization. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9edf489e-cf8b-41ad-b0f3-359c9ac03823",/factchecks/2016/nov/04/americans-united-change/does-gop-wisconsin-sen-ron-johnson-call-social-sec/

Money for Rochester's photonics institute came before Reed bill
","U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D- Fairport, often takes credit for a new photonics manufacturing institute coming to Rochester. But her Republican opponent for the 25th Congressional District seat says the credit belongs elsewhere. During a debate, Gates Town Supervisor Mark Assini credited a congressman from another district in New York State for securing the photonics funding. ""The photonics bill that was sponsored in Congress and written, was written by Congressman Tom Reed, not Congresswoman Louise Slaughter,"" said Assini, a Republican. Reed, R-Corning, represents a congressional district south of Rochester. ""There's about 100 co-sponsors on this bill, and guess whose name was not on that co-sponsorship list?"" Assini asked. Slaughter replied that her work on the project took place several years before Reed introduced his bill in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. ""So he didn’t have a thing in the world to do with it, didn’t even have it decide to be photonics and to have it come to Rochester,"" she said. So, who’s right?  The photonics timeline Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics in Rochester last year. When completed, the institute is expected to add hundreds of new jobs to the region. It’s one of the largest investments in Rochester by the state and federal governments in recent years. Assini does not dispute Slaughter supported the project, but he believes she had no part in the legislation that brought the institute to the region. In fact, there was no legislation that led to the photonics institute. It was the result of an Obama administration initiative to spur advanced manufacturing in the United States, largely funded out of existing Defense Department money. In 2012, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology issued a report with its recommendations for boosting manufacturing investment and innovation. Among those recommendations: a ""national network of innovation institutes."" In response to that recommendation, the Obama administration created  the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation in 2014. The network brings together research institutions, private-sector companies and nonprofits to come up with innovations in advanced manufacturing. No member of Congress had to do anything to secure funding. The money was already in the Department of Defense, which announced funding for creation of a photonics institute in 2014. Slaughter did send three letters that year asking the Obama administration to consider Rochester as a location for one of the institutes created under the program. But it was SUNY Polytechnic Institute that submitted the Rochester proposal on behalf of the SUNY Research Foundation and a consortium of 124 companies, nonprofits and universities. No elected officials, including Slaughter, were involved in writing and submitting the application, according to Empire State Development. In June 2015, Cuomo, Biden and other lawmakers announced state and federal funding for the institute. Where did the funding come from? Assini says his debate reference was to the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014, or RAMI. Under RAMI, the Secretary of Defense can provide financial assistance ""to a person or group of persons to assist the organization in planning, establishing, or supporting a center for manufacturing innovation."" The bill was sponsored by Reed in the House, but did not pass as a standalone bill. It was later included in an omnibus spending bill that became law in December 2014. RAMI had nothing to do with the Rochester institute, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Rochester institute would have been approved and funded even if RAMI had not passed. The funding had already been announced by the Department of Defense before RAMI became law in December 2014. Our ruling At a debate between candidates in the 25th Congressional District, Assini said, ""The photonics bill that was sponsored in Congress and written, was written by Congressman Tom Reed, not Congresswoman Louise Slaughter."" Financial support for the new photonics institute comes from Department of Defense funds that existed before Congress approved the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014.  The Department of Defense says Rochester was selected based on the application prepared by SUNY Polytechnic Institute. The state says no lawmakers were involved in crafting the application, but Slaughter did ask the Obama administration to consider Rochester in the selection process. We rate Assini’s claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0a6ff59a-dc68-4f2b-907f-a66231686f02",/factchecks/2016/nov/04/mark-assini/photonics-funding-rochester-came-reed-bill/

Morgan Carroll says Mike Coffman ‘changes tune on immigration for English-speaking audience’
","Democratic challenger Morgan Carroll's campaign says Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman changes his immigration stance depending on the audience. In a recent news release, Carroll's camp accused Coffman of saying ""stop the deportations"" while speaking Spanish in the Univision debate on Oct. 4 and then flip-flopping to say ""you're going to be deported,"" while speaking English during a KUSA-TV interview two weeks later. ""Mike Coffman can lie in whatever language he wants, but it's clear that Mike Coffman will say or do anythincig to hold on to his job,"" said Carroll campaign spokesman,Drew Godinich in the release. The dispute captures the bare-knuckle battle for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, which rings Denver’s eastern suburbs and is one of the most competitive swing districts in the nation. In recent years, Coffman moderated his once-hardline positions on immigration after the district, formerly a conservative bastion, was redrawn in 2012 and became the most politically and ethnically diverse enclave in Colorado. He learned Spanish and has worked to reach out to Hispanic and Muslim constituents and attend Ethiopian community festivals. But Carroll, a state senator, and her Democratic allies have worked just as hard to remind voters that in 2010 Coffman said, ""The DREAM Act will be a nightmare for the American people,"" as he voted against the bill to give children brought into the country unlawfully a path to citizenship if they attended college or served in the military. And they recall that Coffman supported doing away with bilingual ballots in 2011, saying non-English speakers ought to ""pull out a dictionary"" when they are at home reviewing their mail-in ballots. We looked closer at the claim that a Spanish-speaking Coffman said ""stop the deportations"" in the Univision debate and then warned undocumented immigrants, ""you're going to be deported,"" while speaking English in a KUSA-TV interview. (Coffman's immigration comments start at 7:09 in the KUSA interview). Coffman has recently made comments on TV programs with English-speaking audiences that we need tougher border security and immigration enforcement and, at some point in the future, undocumented immigrants need to be deported. But Coffman clearly states -- in Spanish and English TV appearances -- that he advocates a ""path to permanent residency"" for young immigrants who were brought here as children. And for longtime, undocumented adult immigrants who haven't violated criminal laws, he supports a grace period of three-to-six months where they could ""come out of the shadows"" and gain legalized status that would allow them to live and work here ""without fear of deportations."" Here's the Carroll campaign's news release translation for Coffman's Spanish comments on immigration (with a section they highlighted in bold): ""I think that as a part of an immigration reform, we should create a (period) of time that allows those who have not broken any other law other than immigration laws to come out of the shadows, obtain documentation that allows them to work in our country without fear, to stop the deportations."" PolitiFact partner Denver7 checked the Carroll campaign's Spanish translation of Coffman and found a brief but noteworthy error. Coffman said he supported immigration reform that would create a time period for undocumented immigrants who have not broken criminal laws to come out of the shadows and obtain documentation that allows them to work in our country ""without fear of deportations."" He did not say, ""stop the deportations,"" as the Carroll camp’s translation stated. (Coffman's Spanish comments on immigration begin at 6:55 in the Univision debate) Let's turn to Coffman’s interview in English with KUSA anchor Kyle Clark. As the Carroll campaign noted, when Coffman was asked what should be done with unlawful immigrants in the country, he replied, ""I think we need to go to a system...where we have tough enforcement. Where if you're here illegally, you're going to be deported."" Yet, Coffman stressed, ""My sympathies are really with the children (whose parents are unlawful immigrants). The children that were taken here when they were young, who grew up here, who really know no other country but the United States."" He talked about how he's worked to help these young people by introducing legislation, including a 2013 bill, the Military Enlistment Opportunity Act, which sought to provide immigrant children an opportunity to serve in the U.S. military and gain a path to citizenship. On Univision and KUSA, Coffman said he supports giving these young immigrants a path to permanent residency and citizenship based on their education, work history or military service -- which sounds similar to the DREAM Act he once voted against.  What about unlawful adult immigrants? ""I think for the adults, what I would like to see is to give them a period of time to come out of the shadows (and) as long as they haven't violated criminal laws, to give them a legalized status that would allow them to work here without fear of deportation,"" he told KUSA. This echoes Coffman's Spanish debate comments where he proposed a grace period where noncriminal adult immigrants could ""obtain documentation that allows them to work in our country without fear of deportations."" Coffman also makes clear that the window for granting legal status to undocumented immigration must eventually close. Asked about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's ""mass deportation plan"" at a recent KUSA debate, Coffman said, ""I think that's the system we ought to move to."" Once his proposed grace period ends, Coffman said: ""I would like to see us move to a much tougher system after that point in time. We have to get control of our borders."" Coffman campaign spokeswoman Cinamon Watson said his opponents continue to mischaracterize his support for immigration reform. She cited news coverage of how the congressman has clashed with fellow Republican lawmakers and earned praise from some Democrats on reform. Our ruling The Carroll campaign says Coffman said ""stop the deportations"" while speaking Spanish in a Univision debate and then shifted to saying ""you're going to be deported,"" while speaking English during a KUSA interview. Technically, Coffman said in Spanish that he supported reform that would allow noncriminal adult immigrants to obtain documentation to work in the United States ""without fear of deportations"" -- not ""stop the deportations,"" as the Carroll camp’s translation stated. The Carroll campaign is correct that Coffman said, ""If you're here illegally, you're going to be deported"" during the KUSA interview. But he also backed off that hardline position and emphasized his support for providing legal status to noncriminal adult immigrants and young people who were brought here as children who have lived here for years. Carroll can accuse Coffman of trying to be all things to all people, but her news release left out that he maintained -- in Spanish and English -- his reform goal of ensuring that noncriminal immigrants have an opportunity to live and work here ""without fear of deportations.""

Did Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold repeat the lie of the year about Obamacare?
","An ad from the political arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce starts with a misleading attack on Democrat Russ Feingold, saying the former U.S. senator ""cast the deciding vote for Obamacare.""   We rated that claim Mostly False when it was made in 2015 by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent Feingold is challenging in the Nov. 8, 2016 election. (Go here to see all of our fact checks in that race.) Feingold did cast one of the 60 votes, which he touts, on a crucial measure that paved the way for final Senate passage of the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010. But to call it the deciding vote is misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt. Meanwhile, the chamber’s ad, which was released Oct. 28, 2016, makes more attacks on Feingold regarding the law, saying of Feingold: ""He said we could keep our doctors and our plans. It was rated as the Lie of the Year."" Let’s give that claim an examination. 'Keep our doctors and our plans' The chamber cites a column Feingold wrote for the La Crosse Tribune during his 2010 campaign, which ended with a loss to Johnson. The column poses questions and answers about Obamacare. It does not mention doctors, but the first question covers plans: I currently purchase my own insurance. Will this bill force me into a public plan? Feingold’s answer: 
No. The health care law does not create a public plan. If you like the plan you purchase, the health care reform bill does not force you to change it. So, the chamber’s claim is that Feingold said ""we could keep our doctors and plans"" under Obamacare. Feingold, though answering a question about a ""public plan,"" essentially said the same -- that the law ""does not force you"" to change insurance plans. But we also found this statement about Obamacare on Feingold’s 2010 campaign website: You will be allowed to see the doctor of your choice and, if you like your current plan, you are free to keep it. Which brings us to the second part of the chamber’s statement. 'Rated as the Lie of the Year' The second part claims that what Feingold said was rated as the Lie of the Year. The reference is to PolitiFact National’s Lie of the Year for 2013, which was this statement made repeatedly by Obama and others about the Affordable Care Act: ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" The Feingold campaign argues that insurance plans existing before 2010 were grandfathered in under the law, but that employers and insurance companies chose to make changes, causing cancellations. But our colleagues wrote that Obama’s promise ""was impossible to keep"":

As cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama’s breezy assurances were wrong. Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief.  Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology …. The Affordable Care Act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called ""grandfathering,"" which basically said insurance companies could keep selling plans if they followed certain rules.

The problem for insurers was that the Obamacare rules were strict. If the plans deviated even a little, they would lose their grandfathered status. In practice, that meant insurers canceled plans that didn’t meet new standards. Our rating The U.S. chamber says Feingold said that with Obamacare ""we could keep our doctors and our plans, it was rated as the Lie of the Year."" Feingold did make that statement about keeping doctors and insurance plans during his 2010 Senate campaign. And that was PolitiFact National’s 2013 Lie of the Year.

Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump says 'organized crime runs wild on reservations'

Seven years later during another fight with Indian casinos, Trump was linked to an advertising campaign that warned that drugs and crime would follow the expansion of Indian gaming. But we can’t find any more recent examples -- including during the current campaign -- of Trump saying that organized crime is pervasive on reservations. This calls into question Clinton’s use of ""says"" in the present tense. The Imus interview In the early 1990s, Trump’s business was heavily dependent on his portfolio of Atlantic City casinos. He apparently feared losing business if Indian reservations opened casinos throughout nearby states. So he actively opposed loosening laws that governed where Indian casinos could operate. Part of his argument had to do with stopping the spread of organized crime. Appearing on Don Imus’ radio show on June 18, 1993, Trump said that ""a lot of the reservations are being, in some people's opinion, at least to a certain extent, run by organized crime and organized crime elements, as you can imagine."" At another point in the program, Trump referred to Indian tribes as ""all chiefs and no Indians,"" and mocked tribal citizenship by suggesting that he ""would perhaps become Indian myself."" (Imus, for his part, referred to native Americans as ""drunken injuns."") The comments led the National Indian Gaming Association and the Association on American Indian Affairs to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. The congressional testimony A few months later, Trump traveled to Washington to testify before the House Natural Resources subcommittee on Indian Affairs on Oct. 5, 1993. At the time, Congress was considering rewriting the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. ""Organized crime is rampant on the Indian reservations,"" he testified. ""If this continues as a threat, it's my opinion that it will ... blow sky-high and it's going to destroy an industry, a legitimate industry."" He added, ""That an Indian chief is going to tell Joe Killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me. I think it's obvious that organized crime is rampant -- and I don't mean a little bit -- on Indian reservations."" Then-Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., asked Trump to corroborate his claim. ""I have many incidents,"" Trump said. ""You folks know that."" ""This will be the biggest crime problem in the nation's history,"" Trump also testified. ""I believe you folks have created a monster."" At another point in his testimony, Trump said some Indians seeking casino licenses ""don't look like Indians to me and they don't look like Indians to Indians."" Then-Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., responded, ""Thank God that's not the test of whether or not people have rights in this country, whether or not they have passed your look test."" Miller added, ""I don't believe I've ever heard more irresponsible testimony than I've heard from this panel."" Then-Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., sided with Trump, pointing to ""22 serious allegations"" of wrongdoing in Indian gaming operations, some involving ties to organized crime, that he had culled from published accounts, the Associated Press reported. ""We are close to breaking the back of organized crime, but this is like tossing them a lifeline just as they are drowning,"" Torricelli said. But Jim E. Moody, the FBI’s organized crime and drug operations section chief, dismissed the idea that organized crime had deep tentacles in Indian gaming. He said the agency had found only one case in which ""organized crime forces have been convicted for attempting to control"" Indian gaming. The 2000 advertisements So Trump is on record twice -- once on Imus’ show, once before a House subcommittee -- explicitly saying Indian reservations were tainted by organized crime. And in one additional instance, he implied that drug dealing would follow the expansion of casinos on Indian land. That was in 2000, when Trump’s casino holdings were facing the renewed prospect of competition from Indian casinos. That year, New York state was considering allowing Indian casinos in the Catskill mountains. But TV, newspaper and radio ads sponsored by the opaquely named New York Institute for Law and Safety accused the Mohawk tribe of having mob ties. The Los Angeles Times reported that the institute ""was the brainchild of Trump’s longtime lobbyist and consultant, Roger Stone, and Trump himself was hands-on — not just paying the bills, but signing off on ad copy or radio scripts depicting the tribe as violent criminals and drug dealers. When Stone hired private investigators to dig up dirt on the Mohawks, Trump secretly paid the bills. ‘Roger – This could be good!’ Trump scrawled across one ad that included a picture of hypodermic needles and lines of powder."" The 2016 campaign So Trump explicitly linked Indian reservations and organized crime in 1993, and implied something similar as late as 2000. That’s either 23 years ago or 16 years ago. We couldn’t find any more recent examples in our searches, and when we checked with the Clinton campaign, they did not provide any more recent example, either. Trump has repeatedly called Warren, one of his most outspoken critics, ""Pocahontas"" for once claiming that she had Indian blood. Family lore held that she had Indian ancestry, but later research cast doubt on that conclusion. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Clinton said Trump ""says organized crime runs wild on reservations."" Trump did say that at least twice -- but that was 23 years ago. He later implied such a connection in 2000. But there’s no indication he said that publicly in the past 16 years, including during the 2016 campaign. So Clinton’s use of the present tense -- ""says"" -- and her decision to cite it in the same breath as Trump's ""Pocahantas"" insult, which did occur during the 2016 campaign, is inaccurate. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/nov/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-says-organized-crime-/

Trump says Nevadans will see a 'massive' hike in health care premiums, but some context needed
","At a recent campaign rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump tried to connect the recent news of health care premium cost hikes next year to his target audience — Nevada voters. ""It’s just been announced that the citizens of Nevada are going to experience a massive, massive -- in fact, I don’t even want to tell you what the number is, I won’t because you’ll walk out of here depressed -- double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year,"" he said. ""Ten of Nevada’s 16 counties will have only Obamacare, and think of it, you can have one, exchange insurer that you can choose from. They are in a very good position to negotiate with you, aren’t they?"" Trump, who wants to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, threw out some pretty specific figures in terms of Nevada health care costs, making us curious as to how accurate he was. While he largely gets the numbers correct, Trump’s rhetoric overstates the impact of rate hikes that Nevadans enrolled in the state’s insurance market will face next year. A big league premium hike? Republicans across the country have seized on recent news that health care premium costs under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law would increase by an average of 25 percent across the 39 states using the federal online marketplace, coupled with about 28 percent of insurers leaving the marketplace. The premium hikes for some plans in some states are striking: a Kaiser Family Foundation study cites a hypothetical 27-year-old in Arizona who could see the monthly cost of a ""second-lowest cost silver plan"" jump from $196 to $422, or 116 percent. The average cost for a plan through Nevada Health Link, a state-managed website that uses the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace, is also going up. The state is on track for an average increase of about 12 percent for unsubsidized premium costs, which is the eleventh-lowest hike in the country. While a double-digit rise in premium costs is nothing to scoff at, Nevada Health Link spokeswoman Janel Davis said about 87 percent of Nevadans enrolled in an exchange plan receive a tax credit to help pay down insurance costs and that the subsidy should increase in lockstep with any rise in premium. Davis said it’s difficult to calculate an average dollar increase in premium costs because the subsidy is dependent on a variety of factors including income, family size and age. Trump is also correct that most Nevada counties will only have one insurer, but he didn’t get the number of counties in the state quite correct. Nevada has 16 standard counties and the independent Carson City, which is counted as the equivalent of a county by the exchange and census. An emailed version of Trump’s prepared remarks cites 17 counties in the state, though the version on the campaign’s website has 16. Regardless, a large percentage of Nevada counties (59 percent) only have one insurer to choose from. However, the majority of Nevadans enrolled through the exchange live in counties with more than one insurer. According to Kaiser more than 90 percent (79,000) of Nevadans enrolled in the exchange have at least three insurers to choose from, while only 3 percent (3,000) are enrolled in mostly rural counties with only one insurer. And unlike other states, none of the three insurers in Nevada are planning to leave the exchange marketplace in 2017. Nevada Republican Reps. Joe Heck, Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei have introduced a bill exempting counties with only one insurer from the individual mandate penalty, though the legislation hasn’t moved forward since being introduced in September. Our ruling Trump said Nevadans will see a ""double-digit hike in their Obamacare premiums for the year"" and ""10 of Nevada’s 16 counties will only have one Obamacare...exchange insurer"" Trump is mostly correct, but his rhetoric is a little overstated. Nevadans who get health insurance through the exchange will see their unsubsidized premium costs rise by about 12 percent (although most people in the exchange receive subsidies). Most counties in the state will only have one insurer on the exchange next year, but about 97 percent of enrollees live in a county with at least two insurers. Still, the basic facts are correct. We rate Trump’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/nov/04/donald-trump/trump-says-nevadans-will-see-massive-hike-health-c/

Trump wrongly claims tremendous support from women
","Donald Trump’s resurgent campaign has narrowed the polling gap between himself and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In the toss-up state of Florida, Trump said people of all stripes appreciate what he has to offer. And he mentioned one group in particular. ""I think I have tremendous support from women,"" Trump said in a Nov. 3, 2016, speech in Jacksonville, Fla. ""Tremendous support."" We wondered what the polls tell us about female sentiment toward the Republican candidate. Trump has garnered headlines for video of him boasting about groping women, and more than 10 women have said Trump forced himself on them. Here’s a scan of the latest polling results. The CBS News/New York Times poll from Nov. 3, 2016 found 50 percent of women back Clinton and 36 percent support Trump. In a new poll from ABC News/Washington Post, Clinton gets 52 percent of the women compared to 41 percent for Trump. The Los Angeles Times/USC poll finds women favor Clinton by an 8-point margin, 49 percent to 41 percent. The Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP election tracker also gives Clinton an edge among women by 51 percent to 38 percent. The Trump campaign cited this survey, saying it shows Trump gaining support from women. A few days earlier, Trump enjoyed the backing of 34 percent of women. The Los Angeles Times/USC poll also shows Clinton’s numbers among women slipping by a few points in recent days. However, the average across the four most recent polls shows women choosing Clinton over Trump by an 11-point margin. This is consistent with the gap pollsters have seen going back several months. How do Trump’s numbers compare to past Republican nominees? Not so well, said Christina Wolbrecht, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. ""The exact figure depends on your data source, but the reliable sources all put the percent of women voting for GOP nominees at the low to upper 40s since 2000,"" Wolbrecht said. An American National Election Studies survey found women backing the Republican candidate by 44 percent in 2000 (George W. Bush), 47 percent in 2004 (Bush re-election) and 43 percent in 2008 (John McCain). According to Gallup, Mitt Romney also garnered 43 percent of the woman vote in 2012. Trump’s best number in the recent polls is 41 percent and two put him below that, at 36 and 38 percent. His average across four polls is 39 percent. Political science professor Kathleen Dolan at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee said one sub-group of women leans toward Trump -- white women without college degrees.  And he does lead among Republican women. But Dolan said that comes with a caveat. ""Even among Republican women, a group he should be carrying, he only has about 79 percent of them,"" Dolan said. ""This is compared to the 92 percent of Republican women who voted for Romney in 2012."" Susan Carroll, a senior scholar at the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said, "" ‘Tremendous’ is a clear exaggeration if compared with how Republican nominees have fared in the exit poll results in previous elections."" Our ruling Trump said that he has ""tremendous support from women."" His campaign pointed to a poll that shows him gaining ground with women, but on average, he lags behind Clinton by 11 percentage points. And even the poll cited by his campaign finds he still faces a 13-point gap. His best performance shows that 41 percent of women support him, but his polling average is 39 percent, appreciably lower than the fraction that have backed previous Republican candidates. That doesn’t seem to meet the common definition of ""tremendous.""

Evidence ridiculously thin for sensational claim of huge underground Clinton sex network
","The presidential race has tightened again, this time after the FBI revealed that Hillary Clinton emails might be found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Now some conservative websites are claiming — without offering any evidence — that the probe has uncovered evidence of a pedophile sex ring run under the guise of the Clinton Foundation. ""Breaking: FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network,"" the Conservative Daily Post said on Nov. 1. ""A source from the FBI has indicated ... that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington, D.C.,"" the website reports, saying ""there are at least six members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies that partake in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front."" No sources are named. No documents are cited. The claim about a child trafficking and a pedophile sex ring links to a New York Post story that makes no reference to either child trafficking or a sex ring. The claim about the Clinton Foundation and members of Congress links to an internet message board where anonymous people have posted under the topic, ""Breaking: Its (sic) worse than classified emails. Political Pedophile Sex Ring exposed."" ""Hillary, Bill, all of them knew/know and were active participants,"" says the poster, who has the nickname ""WartHog76."" ""DC and the FBI, DOJ fear a complete loss of public support for the federal government. ... Both parties, all levels of government. Its (sic) about to come apart."" Subsequent posts by other people range from speculation that the story is part of a Clinton strategy (""Throw out some wild claims, have them proven false, and their real crimes will be dismissed as false"") to a link to another website claiming that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are connected to a place called Sex Slave Island. The latter pertain to the real-life story of financier Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire sentenced to 18 months in jail and ordered to register as a pedophile in 2008 after pleading guilty to a Florida felony charge of soliciting a minor. He had been accused of hiring underage girls for massages and sex at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Clinton has repeatedly flown on his plane. Trump's phone numbers were found in Epstein's address book. The Conservative Daily Post article doesn't mention Trump's connections to Epstein. We contacted the FBI. Spokesman Andrew Ames said in an email, ""We have provided no comment, nor confirmed any investigation, beyond the existence of a letter from the Director to select members of Congress, which was then provided to the media by members of Congress.""

Our ruling The Conservative Daily Post says, ""FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network.""

Debunking Ron Johnson claim Obamacare had no impact on uninsured in Wisconsin
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has offered many critiques of Obamacare, but in an October 2016 debate he claimed that in Wisconsin the health care law has also failed to accomplish its most fundamental goal — insuring more people. In an Oct. 14 debate with challenger Russ Feingold in Green Bay, Johnson criticized the Affordable Care Act for boosting premiums and limiting access to doctors. And he said this: ""The fact of the matter is, prior to Obamacare here in Wisconsin, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. After Obamacare, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. It hasn’t had an impact."" Let’s take a look at the numbers. Wrong number When we reached out to Johnson’s team for supporting evidence, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson made a mistake in his claim. He meant to say 94% were insured before Obamacare and 95% after. That’s not a huge difference, but it changes Johnson’s point that the law ""hasn’t had an impact."" Voelkel said those numbers came from the 2010 and 2014 Wisconsin Family Health Survey, conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. That looks at how many people had insurance for all or part of the preceding year. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, but the individual health insurance mandate and most other core elements didn’t take effect until 2014. Using the 2010 survey is problematic since DHS changed its methodology and warns against comparing surveys before 2012 with those after. That doesn’t make a big difference in this case, however, because the 2012 survey showed the same 94 percent insured rate as 2010. But 2014 isn’t necessarily a great choice for an ""after"" statistic, since it was a transition year. And there’s more recent data available. DHS hasn’t released the results of its 2015 survey yet, but the U.S. Census Bureau and other surveys have. And those numbers tell a different story than Johnson. Uninsured numbers drop The U.S. Census Bureau gathers figures annually on insurance status and shows a significant drop in the number of Wisconsinites without insurance since Obamacare took effect. After hovering between 9 percent and 9.4 percent uninsured from 2008 to 2013, Wisconsin dropped to 7.3 percent in 2014 and 5.7 percent in 2015, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. That’s a drop of nearly 40 percent from before Obamacare to after. ""Johnson’s claim is way off base,"" said Jon Peacock, research director for the nonprofit, non-partisan Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Peacock said the American Community Survey is the best source for such health data. Like the DHS survey, it counts people as insured if they had health insurance for any part of the prior year. Other sources show the same trend. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit think tank focusing on national health issues, says the percentage uninsured in Wisconsin dropped from 9 percent in 2013 to 7 percent in 2015, based on the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a point-in-time survey that measures whether the survey taker currently has health insurance, showed an even larger drop, from 11.7 percent uninsured in 2013 to 5.9 percent in 2015. Our rating Johnson claimed that 95 percent of Wisconsinites were insured both before and after Obamacare. The claim runs into problems on several fronts. He misspoke on the statistic he was trying to cite, and he references a 2014 survey when more recent data is available. But above all, he uses the numbers to claim Obamacare hasn’t had an impact on the number of uninsured in Wisconsin. And that’s simply not the case.

Trump says the media doesn't show his crowds at rallies. He's wrong
","Time after time, Donald Trump has complained that the media doesn’t show show the magnitude of his crowds at rallies. ""I have to put up with some of the most dishonest people in the world — the media,"" Trump told a crowd in Pensacola, Fla. ""They never shows crowds like that — look at that, it goes all the way back. They never show crowds. They don't show crowds."" We wondered if the media really never showed Trump crowds, so we turned to the archives and a former CBS photojournalist to figure it out. The coverage Most rally coverage shown on television focuses on the candidate speaking behind the podium, rather than showing the whole crowd. There’s a reason for this. At campaign events, one television network organization is responsible for controlling the head-on pool camera, and other cameras are responsible for wide shots and reaction shots. Les Rose, a professor at Syracuse and former field producer and photojournalist for CBS, said whoever is working the head-on pool camera is not working for the employer, but working for every television network or station in America.  Of course, local news stations and national stations bring their own camera equipment to cover the event, but media outlets are dependent on the footage that is shot on these head-on pool cameras. The cameraperson in charge of the head-on pool camera has a very specific goal: get a shot of the candidate walking onto the stage, a shot of the candidate walking off the stage and the candidate saying the speech. ""If (Trump’s) looking strictly at that feed (from the head-on camera), then you’re never going to see a crowd because that’s not the gig,"" Rose said. The reason news outlets often show the head-on pool footage is because the audio is the most clear in comparison to the other camera responsible for the reaction shots. Rose said the other cameras pick up natural sounds like applause that can make it harder to hear the actual speech. Still, this doesn’t mean the media doesn’t show crowds at Trump rallies. A quick Google search quickly debunked this. Reporters have shown Trump’s crowds through photos.  See examples here, here, here, here and here. News stories:  ""More than 15,000 fired-up Donald Trump fans turned out Monday night to cheer on the presidential nominee heading into the final two weeks of the campaign,"" reads the lede of a story from the Tampa Bay Times from his Oct. 24 rally in Tampa. ""His supporters routinely pointed, as the nominee did, to the huge crowds still flocking to see him as evidence that his campaign remains strong,"" reads a line from a New York Times article from Trump’s rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. The Washington Post even wrote a story about Trump’s crowds that looked into the actual size of crowds at Trump rallies. ""Ever since Trump launched his presidential campaign in June 2015, he has attracted massive crowds to rallies across the country,"" reads the article. ""During the primaries, Trump’s head counts were nearly always larger than those of his Republican rivals or Clinton’s, whose audiences back then usually topped out at 1,000. But instead of celebrating the actual size of these crowds, Trump has routinely exaggerated the already large numbers.""  They also wrote a story about large crowds and how they don’t necessarily correlate with large vote totals. Social media Many reporters have documented Trump’s crowds on Twitter.

Anti-recreational marijuana ad cherry-picks data for claim on newborn babies and pot
","The last-minute contributions opposing an initiative that would legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona continue to pile up, with even Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson shelling out $500,000 against the cause. Much like the money, the ads against recreational marijuana continue to flow as well. An Oct. 11 ad from Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, an anti-pot group, uses testimonies from two former Colorado politicians in highlighting the supposed dangers of recreational marijuana. ""In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system,"" former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb says. This claim stood out to us right away. Could half of all newborn babies tested at this particular hospital really have marijuana in their system? Deceptive data The ad cites a September 2016 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area -- an interagency group focused on combating drug trafficking. According to the report, ""nearly half"" of newborns tested in March 2016 at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Colo., tested positive for marijuana. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for the anti-pot group, also pointed us to a July 2016 CBS Denver story on the hospital. The article notes that the head of the neonatal unit, Dr. Steve Simerville, is reporting a ""dramatic increase"" in newborns with marijuana in their system. We reached out to the hospital and dug into the numbers. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but St. Mary-Corwin spokeswoman Wendi Dammann said babies have been drug tested at the hospital for at least a decade. ""The screening criteria was developed by both local hospitals (St. Mary-Corwin and Parkview) and Children’s Hospital Colorado,"" she said. As far as the numbers cited in the ad, Dammann confirmed that five out of the 11 newborn babies tested in March 2016 did test positive for marijuana. So that’s less than 46 percent -- not half -- of a handful of births in one month. Cherry-picking one month of data makes the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is. That is not the case. From January 2016 through September 2016, 403 babies were born at St. Mary-Corwin. About one-quarter of those, or 101, were tested for marijuana. Of those 101 newborns, 27 tested positive for marijuana in their systems. That’s a rate slightly under 27 percent. And in 2015, the hospital saw 519 births. Of the 93 newborn babies tested for marijuana, 31 came up positive for marijuana. That’s a rate of 33 percent. Marijuana use during and after pregnancy can be quite harmful. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, exposure to THC ""could have profound and long-lasting consequences"" to a baby’s brain and behavior, including neurological development.   We wanted to know how these statistics compared to the country or states where marijuana is not legal, but we could not find much research on that point.   However, Dr. Edith Allen of Phoenix Children’s Hospital, studied drug habits for pregnant women with criteria including personal or family history of drug use at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center between 2006 and 2010. Her study found THC in 431 babies out of 727 mother-baby pairings tested -- almost 60 percent. However, Allen pointed out that not every pregnant woman was tested. Our ruling The ad claimed, ""In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system."" That hospital -- St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center -- did have more than 45 percent of their newborn babies tested test positive for marijuana in their systems. The big issue with the talking point is it cherry-picks one month of data. Overall, from January 2015 through September 2016, almost 1 in 3 newborn babies tested for marijuana at St. Mary-Corwin came up positive for marijuana in their systems. That’s not half, but it’s still pretty high.

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump 'wants to undo marriage equality'
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump in a campaign speech of wanting to reverse the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage. During a Nov. 2, 2016, rally in Las Vegas, Clinton gave a laundry list of ideals she said Donald Trump opposed, including equal rights for LGBTQ members. ""If you care about LGBT rights, he wants to undo marriage equality,"" she said of the Republican presidential candidate. She repeated the claim hours later at a rally in Tempe, Ariz. Trump has spoken out against marriage equality before, but we wondered if he still held that view. While he’s said gays and lesbians deserve protection under the law, he has also said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would want to overturn the law. ‘I am for traditional marriage’ The first indication of Trump’s feelings on same-sex marriage go back to an interview in The Advocate in 2000, when Trump was allegedly considering running for president. ""I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,"" Trump said. He added that he favored a domestic partnership law that would give same-sex couples the same legal benefits as married couples. (He voiced support for Elton John’s 2005 civil union with David Furnish in a post on his now-defunct Trump University blog, however.) More than a decade later, in a March 2011 interview as he mulled a presidential run, Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that he was against marriage equality. ""I just don't feel good about it,"" Trump said. ""I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage."" Two years later, Trump hedged a bit: ""I think I’m evolving, and I think I’m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman,"" he told MSNBC in 2013. Then Trump announced he really was running for president on June 16, 2015, and he quickly reiterated he didn’t support marriage equality. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling came out on June 26, Trump tweeted, ""Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!"" Two days later, Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper on CNN that he was ""just for traditional marriage."" Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage would not be a realistic approach. But by October 2015, he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. ""We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices, and frankly, they should have at least had that as a state's right issue,"" he told CBN News. He also said he considered the ruling the law now. He told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Jan. 31, 2016, that he disagreed with the court’s 5-4 decision. ""If I'm elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things,"" Trump said. ""They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don't like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state — it should be a states' rights issue. And that's the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it."" Looking for a concise answer, Wallace asked Trump if he would ""try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage."" ""I could strongly consider that, yes,"" Trump said. His position didn’t change during the litany of GOP primary debates, although he hasn’t strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision. In March 2016, he said at a Detroit debate that he agreed with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s opposition to the ruling. ""I would certainly have rather left it to the states,"" Trump said. ""I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would preferred it had been left to the states, and I think most people would have preferred that."" Since then, Trump has said little about same-sex marriage. Trump's campaign didn't respond to our request for comment, and Clinton's spokesman didn't add any further comment. His stump speeches tend to avoid same-sex marriage, and we couldn’t find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates. When the GOP unveiled its party platform during this summer’s Republican National Convention, which urged the reversal of ""the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage,"" Trump’s influence was downplayed. Trump ""has not really tried to weigh in on the platform,"" Wyoming Sen. John Barasso, the platform committee chairman, told NPR in July. Our ruling Clinton said Trump ""wants to undo marriage equality."" While he’s waffled slightly at times, Trump has said repeatedly that he supported ""traditional marriage."" He also has said he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would reverse the 2015 ruling allowing same-sex marriage. He has not said much on the subject in recent months, other than to reiterate he felt it should have been a state-level decision. But he has not recanted his earlier views, either.

Russ Feingold falsely claims only his opponent is benefiting from spending by super PACs
","Democrat Russ Feingold, locked in a tight rematch with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, called a recent attack ad from Johnson’s camp ""simply false"" and ""intentionally misleading."" The ad accused Feingold of starting his Progressives United committee to pay himself and his staff, not to support progressive candidates. (We rated Half True a similar claim from the state GOP) When speaking to reporters in Milwaukee October 27, Feingold said about the ad: ""They don’t want to talk about the fact that Senator Johnson not only loves the current finance system, but he is the one who is benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not."" We took a look at claim about who benefitted from the Progressive’s United fund. In this item, we are looking at Feingold’s response: That Johnson is benefiting from several super PACs, but he is not. We wondered if that was right. Unpacking the PACs The day after Feingold’s statement, a major Democratic super PAC announced a $2 million ad buy on his behalf. But we’re considering Feingold’s claim at the time he made it. Feingold himself has a history with campaign finance reform — he was half of the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which limited the amount of money national parties can raise and spend on behalf of their candidates. The act was an attempt to reign in spending, but some say it pushed donors to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money but can’t donate the money directly to a candidate. Which brings us to 2016. At the time of Feingold’s statement, both candidates had already benefited from super PACs, according to data from the Federal Election Committee’s website. Two super PACs — For Our Future and Working America Coalition — had spent around $50,000 to support Feingold. And four super PACs had spent around $950,000 to support Johnson: Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Let America Work. Of course, money spent to oppose a candidate also benefits the other and there was even more spent there. Four super PACs spent almost $640,000 to oppose Johnson: For Our Future, Working America Coalition, Planned Parenthood Votes and the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund. And five super PACs spent more than $2.5 million to oppose Feingold: Americas PAC, Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, The New Prosperity Foundation and Reform Wisconsin Fund. So at the time of Feingold’s statement, super PACs had reported spending around $690,000 on Feingold’s behalf and nearly $3.5 million on Johnson’s. (As noted, an additional $2 million was directed to Feingold the next day.) Feingold’s camp pointed to the fact that Johnson had benefited from a much larger share of super PAC spending. Maybe so. But that’s not what Feingold said. Our rating Feingold said Johnson is ""benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not."" Simply put, he was. Though such spending for Johnson has been higher, Feingold has received significant super PAC support.

Sen. Richard Burr claims responsibility for longest judicial vacancy in US history
","Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas lit into the political atmosphere in Washington, D.C. At a speech hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation, Thomas was asked about the politics surrounding judicial nominations. Thomas himself had a contentious confirmation process in the early 1990s, led by Senate Democrats, and for most of this year Senate Republicans have been pushing to keep the late Antonin Scalia’s seat empty. ""At some point we have got to recognize that we’re destroying our institutions,"" Thomas said. A few days later, Republican Sen. Richard Burr took a different approach, in private comments that came to light in a leaked audio tape. In the tape, Burr claims responsibility for ""the longest judicial vacancy in (U.S.) history"" – specifically a seat on the federal district court serving Eastern North Carolina. He said it while pledging, if re-elected, to stonewall Supreme Court nominees from a hypothetical Hillary Clinton administration. ""If Hillary becomes president, I’m going to do everything I can do to make sure that four years from now, we’re still going to have an opening on the Supreme Court,"" Burr said, earning a round of applause. ""This is not tough for me,"" he added later. ""I had the longest judicial vacancy in the history of the United States – on the Eastern District of North Carolina. Not many people know that."" The vacancy he’s talking about is the longest current vacancy. But is it really the longest ever? And is Burr as responsible for it as he claims? We endeavored to find out. The vacant seat That district he’s talking about is a high-profile one, stretching from the capital in Raleigh to the coast. Its judges preside over political corruption trials as well as the many high-level drug trafficking cases that are made along Interstate 95. Judges are based in Raleigh, Fayetteville, Wilmington, Greenville, New Bern and Elizabeth City – but the Fayetteville seat is vacant. The federal government considers it a ""judicial emergency,"" having now been vacant for nearly 4,000 days. That’s the seat Burr is talking about. But how much influence has he had on keeping it empty? A single senator’s power The U.S. Constitution instructs the president to nominate federal judges and instructs the Senate to confirm them. There are three levels of federal courts – district courts, appeals courts and the Supreme Court – which currently have a combined 102 vacancies. The longest-standing one is in Eastern North Carolina’s district court, and it’s not even close. That seat has been open nearly 11 years, since Dec. 31, 2005. The next-longest vacancy has existed since Jan. 7, 2010. Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is an expert on federal judicial nominations and vacancies. Traditionally, he said, nominees who won the support of both their home state’s senators would be confirmed, regardless of party politics. But that began changing in the late 1990s and early 2000s and has gotten even more partisan recently, he said. Wheeler said now, nominees might fail to be confirmed over political concerns even if they have the support of both home senators. But the Senate still follows a long-standing tradition not to confirm any nominee without both home senators’ support. ""It's a little back-scratching,"" he said. ""Senators realize they want to keep control of patronage in their state."" How that applies to North Carolina Burr joined the Senate in January 2005, nearly a year before the vacancy occurred. In 2006, President Bush nominated Raleigh attorney Thomas Farr to the seat. Burr and then-Sen. Elizabeth Dole supported Farr – but Senate Democrats did nothing, so the vacancy continued into Obama’s tenure. Obama didn’t nominate anyone until 2013. Burr said he wouldn’t support that first nominee, federal prosecutor Jennifer May-Parker, so that stopped her nomination. Obama waited a few more years and then, this April, nominated Patricia Timmons-Goodson. Burr immediately said he would refuse to support the former N.C. Supreme Court justice, calling her choice ""a brazenly political nomination."" Both Timmons-Goodson and May-Parker are Democrats and black women. The eastern district has never had a black judge, although its black population is above the state average. In the leaked audio tape, Burr said he believes Obama broke a promise to him about a different nominee, so he told the president: ""Let me make you a promise. This seat will be vacant on the day you go out of office."" The all-time record? So Burr is partly responsible for the longest current vacancy. And among only district court seats, it does indeed hold the all-time record, according to Winston Bowman, an associate historian with the Federal Judicial Center. But Bowman said there has been at least one vacancy, at the appeals court level, that lasted even longer. And as fate would have it, Burr was involved in that one, too. A seat on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was open for just over 16 years, from 1994 to 2010. That seat is now held by James Wynn, a North Carolinian who replaced another North Carolina judge on the court, which oversees multiple East Coast states. Wynn was originally nominated by Bill Clinton, but the Senate made no move to confirm him. The seat remained empty during Bush’s two terms, and Wynn was renominated by Obama in 2009. Then-Sen. Kay Hagan, a fellow Democrat, endorsed his nomination and so did Burr, and in 2010 Wynn was confirmed by the Senate. It’s possible Burr’s support for Wynn was part of the deal he said he made with Obama, which now has him working to keep the eastern district seat empty, although we don’t know for sure. Burr’s team didn’t respond to our questions about the deal. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said he is personally responsible for ""the longest judicial vacancy in the history of the United States."" The 11-year vacancy he’s talking about does hold the record for federal district court seats, but not for all federal courts – at least not yet. In terms of his responsibility for the district court vacancy, Burr is right that he’s a large reason why it’s still empty. But he doesn’t get 100 percent of the credit or blame. Democrats blocked Bush’s nominee to the seat from 2006 until 2008. If they hadn’t, this vacancy would have been filled a decade ago. But that didn’t happen, and Burr is right that he’s responsible for keeping the seat empty.

Trump leaves out context in claim about immigrants and crime
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has emphasized his promise to deport criminals living in the United States illegally with just a few days left before the election. In recent rallies in the swing states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, he recounted how Americans have been murdered by undocumented immigrants with criminal records. ""Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants,"" Trump said Oct. 27 in Springfield, Ohio. He offered a range of anecdotes in different cities. In Springfield, Trump mentioned a 90-year-old Minnesota farmer ""brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home."" In Kinston, N.C., Trump told the story of a 21-year-old ""viciously murdered in cold blood, shot point blank by an illegal immigrant with a long and vicious criminal record."" In Tallahassee, Fla., Trump spoke about a 25-year-old shot dead by a man who had been deported four times and ""had a lengthy criminal record."" We asked Trump’s campaign for more details, wondering if the thousands of killings referred to specific years or regions. We did not get a response. We decided to look into the statement given the key role immigration has played this election season. Lack of data Immigration experts told us Trump’s statement is so vague it is bound to be true. Without time or geographic parameters, the statement is just as accurate as saying ""thousands of Americans have been killed by men,"" said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. The challenge in finding concrete numbers is due to a shortfall of data. There is no national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of the victims. About 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants accounted for about 3.5 percent of the total national population in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. Certainly some undocumented immigrants do commit violent crimes. ""The rate of murder may be lower or higher than other groups, but when we are talking about people, violent crime is never zero,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies. ""By the same token it cannot be thousands every year. But adding up a few years then it has to be in the ‘thousands.’ There are a lot of murders in America and there are a lot illegal immigrants, so the statement has to be true."" Overall, there are about 16,000 murders and 10,000 drunk driving deaths a year (the drunk driver is the person killed more than 60 percent of the time), Camarota said. Research on crime activity At his rallies, Trump portrays a picture of undocumented immigrants as a strong force of violent crime. Among the examples he offers is the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier in July 2015. Authorities said her killer was an immigrant in the country illegally who had been ordered deported five times. Some killings highlighted by Trump’s campaign involved drunk driving incidents. Others went back more than a decade, according to a McClatchy review. McClatchy found that one of the killings Trump has mentioned dates back to 1990 and involved a man who was not in the country illegally, but a legal refugee originally from Vietnam. The man he shot, a police officer in California, ended up a paraplegic and died of cancer 12 years after being shot, McClatchy reported. While Trump’s discourse suggests waves of immigrants equals violence, scholars say studies don’t substantiate that message. Research on immigrants and crime finds that immigrants are not more likely than U.S.-born individuals to take part in crime, said Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Social Work. ""Again and again, we see evidence that they are not,"" Salas-Wright said. ""In fact, it’s the opposite."" Studies show that for the most part, people who migrate are a self-selecting group who want to better their lives, provide for their families back in their home countries and who don’t want to risk getting in trouble with the law, said Kubrin, the criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of immigrant males between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population in that same age group. (The Census does not specify legal status.) Our ruling Trump said, ""Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants."" Trump puts no timeframe on his comment, leaving his audience to fill in the blanks. In reality, there is no solid data for homicides committed by people here illegally. His implicit suggestion is that people should fear illegal immigrants more than citizens, and we don't see evidence for that. Research shows immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than the native-born population. However, like the legal U.S. population, some of the country's more than 11 million undocumented immigrants have committed murders. Trump’s statement was open-ended enough that we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d5475563-24db-4e90-8690-4d02c81f5bbf",/factchecks/2016/nov/03/donald-trump/trump-leaves-out-context-claim-about-immigrants-an/

Todd Starnes says University of Texas students advised not to wear cowboy boots, hats on Halloween
","Conservative commentator Todd Starnes recently wrote: ""Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween."" Starnes went on: ""Telling a Texan not to wear cowboy boots is like telling Colonel Sanders not to fry chicken."" Dern tootin’. And did UT-Austin tell students not to don cowboy hats or boots? Some guidance went to students in advance of Halloween 2016, we confirmed. But those nudges didn’t single out cowboy hats and boots. Starnes said in his Oct. 28, 2016, opinion piece posted by Fox News that he learned of the advice about hats, boots and other no-no’s from a story  posted the same day by the College Fix, a conservative student-written website. Its story opened: ""Leave your cowboy boots and Hawaiian leis at home this Halloween unless you want to hear from University of Texas-Austin administrators."" Like other accounts including a subsequent Houston Chronicle news story and a blog post on the Austin American-Statesman website, the story included a web link to what's described as the relevant checklist for UT students. An introduction to that checklist, titled ""Costume & Theme Selection,"" states: ""You don’t have bad intentions, but your social theme or costume idea could have a negative impact. Themes and costumes may intentionally or unintentionally appropriate another culture or experience."" Hunting for mentions of hats and boots, we saw that at the bottom of the second page, under ""Harmful Themes and Costumes,"" the document lists: --Any time you paint or tint your skin in an attempt to appear to be a different skin tone, race, or culture (e.g., Blackface) --Generalized representation/stereotypes of Asian cultures --’Cowboys and Indians’/anything ‘Squaw’ or generalized depiction of an indigenous person or peoples The list of discouraged themes or costumes goes on to specify eight other questionable themes. But the mention of ""cowboys and Indians"" was the closest reference to cowboy hats or boots, as far as we could tell. Starnes, speaking by phone in response to our inquiry, told us he ""extrapolated"" his statement about the university advising against cowboy boots and hats solely from the ""cowboys and Indians"" admonition. On behalf of the university, administration spokesman J.B. Bird responded to our inquiry by saying the pages highlighted in news accounts fail to note a preceding page in the presentation. Bird then pointed us to UT’s post of a full copy of the guidelines showing that a three-paragraph statement on the first page says the ""voluntary guidelines"" are intended ""to educate students about costume and party theme selection."" That opening section continues: ""UT Austin does not place limits on students' freedom of expression. We do not regulate their speech or enforce costume guidelines as rules. Our philosophy is to educate students and remind them that they are accountable to each other and that their actions can negatively impact other members of the university community. ""We offer these voluntary guidelines in that spirit,"" the section closes. We asked Bird if the ""cowboy/Indian"" mention might reasonably be read to deter students from donning cowboy boots or hats on Halloween. Negative, Bird said by phone, in part because nothing there or elsewhere in the guidelines  explicitly counsel against simply wearing such hats or boots. For a student perspective, we reached Will Deer, a senior who told us he’s close to ending a one-year term as the student president of the University of Texas Interfraternity Council, which oversees 29 fraternity chapters. By phone, Deer said he personally sees the guidelines as mandates that help ensure student events are culturally appropriate. ""That’s because I am a representative for the entire IFC community,"" he said. But by his read, Deer said, the ""cowboys and Indians"" portion of the guidelines speaks solely to party themes the university would advise against. Commentator Starnes' claim specific to hats or boots, Deer said, ""kind of took that out of context. It’s incorrect."" ""The culture here in Texas is cowboy boots and cowboy hats,"" Deer said. Our ruling Starnes wrote: ""Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween."" Voluntary student guidelines distributed before Halloween 2016 listed ""cowboys and Indians"" among potentially harmful themes or costumes to avoid. However, the administration’s advice didn’t stretch to counseling students not to wear cowboy boots or hats. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Did Russ Feingold form 'his own political group to pay himself and his staff millions'?
","Russ Feingold and his staff were out of work after losing the U.S. Senate election to Ron Johnson in 2010, but many top aides found a soft landing in a pair of political groups Feingold founded. Progressives United Political Action Committee and Progressives United Inc. (a nonprofit organization) debuted shortly after the election and began raising money with promises to stand up to corporate influence in politics. But a GOP radio ad that first aired Oct. 14, 2016 alleges these groups were more about the payroll than the mission. Amid criticism of Feingold fundraising practices, the staged conversation turns to Progressives United. ""Get this, he even formed his own political group to pay himself and his staff millions,"" a woman says. It’s a two-pronged claim that merits investigation. Did Feingold and his staffers really bring in millions of dollars from Progressives United? And do the actions of Progressives United support the claim that they were formed ""to"" pay the staff? Tallying the salaries The ad refers to a single political group, but Feingold formed two national groups — the PAC and the nonprofit.  They ""shared staff and resources"" but had separate fundraising and activities, according to a description on an archived version of the Progressives United website. Feingold campaign spokesman Michael Tyler told us the PAC’s mission was to support candidates directly and indirectly while the nonprofit focused on issue advocacy, particularly ""to stand up against exploding corporate influence caused by Citizens United."" Since the groups shared a name, a founder and much of their leadership structure — several top aides from Feingold’s campaign worked at both — we think it’s fair to examine them together. The Progressives United PAC had a payroll of $1.1 million from 2011 until it stopped raising money in 2015, Federal Election Commission records show. The Progressives United nonprofit totaled $1.15 million in salaries from 2011 until it shut down in 2014, according to 990 forms filed with the IRS. So the tally reaches $2.25 million, enough to justify the ad’s claim of ""millions."" The ad doesn’t specify whether the ""staff"" in question refers to all Progressives United staff or only those who also worked for Feingold in the Senate or through his campaign. But it’s worth noting the groups overlapped heavily. Longtime Feingold Chief of Staff Mary Irvine was paid $317,823 from 2011-’13 between the two groups before leaving for a job at the state department. She was listed as vice president of the nonprofit. Cole Leystra, currently Feingold’s deputy campaign manager, totaled $291,209 between the groups. He was comptroller of Feingold’s campaign from 2004-’11, then executive director of the nonprofit from 2011-’15, according to his LinkedIn profile. Feingold himself was paid $77,000 by Progressives United. He received $17,500 as a ""strategic and organizational management consultant"" for the PAC and $59,500 from the nonprofit, where he was listed as president from 2011-’13. Examining the mission The ad claims Progressives United was formed ""to"" pay Feingold and his staff millions, implying a primary purpose was merely to keep staff employed. Only Feingold knows his motivation for starting the groups, and we can’t fact check intentions. But we can look at outcomes. Financial records for both groups show the majority of money  raised went to salaries and administrative costs – several times higher than projected, in the case of the nonprofit. The groups spent a combined $10 million between 2011 and 2015. IRS documents submitted by the Progressives United nonprofit said half of its activities would focus on grassroots organizing, lobbying and education, and about 10% would be administration and fundraising. In reality, the more than half of the group’s expenditures each year fell into the fundraising and management/general categories, peaking at 63% in 2011. The PAC spent even more of its money in those categories. Fundraising, salaries and administrative costs accounted for 88 percent of spending in the 2012 election cycle, 97 percent in the 2014 cycle and 94 percent in the 2016 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Direct donations to candidates were between 2 percent and 7 percent of total expenditures in each two-year cycle. Republicans hold up those numbers as evidence of a shady operation. ""This PAC obviously served as a campaign in waiting,"" said Pat Garrett, spokesman for the Wisconsin GOP. ""Look who was on the PAC, look who was on the senate campaign."" The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel identified nine former Feingold staffers that went on to work for one of the two groups. Likewise, eight Progressives United staffers now work for Feingold’s current campaign, the paper reported in April. There are other connections as well. The Feingold campaign bought the mailing list created by Progressives United PAC and used it to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, and Progressives United and Feingold’s campaign used the same direct mail, telemarketing and online firms. Paul Jossey, a Republican campaign finance attorney who has previously criticized Tea Party PACs for questionable practices, said the Progressives United PAC was ""warehousing his top political staff in plush jobs and building up his email list for his future candidate run."" He called the group a ""shadow campaign."" Tyler, the campaign spokesman, said Progressives United was not a stereotypical PAC that focused on donating large amounts to candidates. He noted similar groups such as Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee also reported minimal donations directly to candidates. Tyler said Progressives United focused on organizing and encouraging donors to give directly to candidates. He said those appeals led to $1.6 million in donations for various candidates. FEC records list $350,000 in direct donations to candidates, and Tyler said the rest were donations through Act Blue, a nonprofit that lets third-party groups like Progressives United set up a page to encourage members to donate directly to specific candidates. When asked for examples of action Progressives United took in support of its mission, Tyler provided a list focused largely on communications. It included a news story where Feingold was quoted on behalf of the group, a number of emails the group sent out and four examples of the group urging members to take action, including signing a petition, contacting the SEC and calling state attorneys general. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Progressives United filled a legitimate purpose as one of many groups focused on grassroots organization rather than direct donations. Green’s group also focuses on grassroots efforts. ""The real point was to do the hard work of organizing,"" Green said of Progressives United. ""It’s just honestly a degree of old-school political thinking and naiveté about how hard-working organizations are structured to look at a modern day PAC and only judge its work by the checks it cuts."" Barry Burden, professor of political science at UW-Madison, said the extensive spending on staff and infrastructure don’t mean Progressives United was a sham, just that it wasn’t overly successful. ""My sense is this group probably just didn’t raise as much as Feingold would have liked to spend on candidates, so nearly all of its income went toward either salaries or infrastructure or advertising,"" Burden said. Our rating                                   A Wisconsin GOP radio ad said Progressives United paid Feingold and his staffers millions of dollars and was formed by Feingold essentially to do just that. IRS and election filings show the payroll did indeed top $2 million between Progressives United PAC and nonprofit, so the numbers are right. But there’s no smoking gun to show the group was formed for the purpose of paying and warehousing staff until the next campaign. Yes, records show the vast majority of money raised by Progressives United went to salaries and overhead — far more than the group itself projected. And yes, there is significant overlap between Feingold’s campaign staff and the leaders of Progressives United. But the ad didn’t allege Progressives United was inefficient or populated with Feingold confidants – it said it was formed ""to"" pay those staffers millions. And there’s no proof of that.
