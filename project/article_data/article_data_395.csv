California gas prices are going up, but not at $9 a gallon in early March 2022
","California gas prices recently hit a record high, and some social media users are sharing photos of gas station signs to express their disbelief and disgust. But one image that’s been viewed widely on Facebook appears to show gas prices reaching about $9 a gallon. In the image, it looks like unleaded gas is about $9, unleaded plus is about $9.01, unleaded premium is about $9.02 and diesel is about $9.03 for customers paying with cash. Using a debit or credit card, those prices jump to about $9.06, $9.07, $9.08 and $9.09, respectively.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We identified the gas station where the picture was taken by a number that appears on the Dutch Bros coffee stand in the background: 1130. There’s a Dutch Bros at 1130 E March Lane in Stockton, California, and an ARCO gas station is next door. Using the street view feature of Google Maps, we were able to identify other similarities between that location and the picture in the Facebook post, such as the placement of palm trees around the store, a sign affixed to one of the trees, and the proximity of the gas station sign to a lamp post.  We tried multiple numbers we found listed for the ARCO station but none worked, and we were unsuccessful in trying to reach someone at ARCO Southwest, which includes Stockton.  So we called other ARCOs in the city, and didn’t find any prices close to $9. At the ARCO on Trinity Parkway, about 9 miles from the location on March Lane, unleaded cost $4.95 if paying with cash and $5.05 with a card, an employee there said.  At the Golden State Highway location, about 10 miles from the March Lane station, an employee gasped realizing that gas there cost $5.15 a gallon.  According to AAA, the national average of gas prices on March 7 was $4.065. In California, it was higher: $5.343. That’s a new record for the highest recorded average price in California, according to AAA. Average diesel prices also hit a new record on March 7 with costs averaging $5.692 a gallon.  In the Stockton-Lodi region, according to AAA, the average for regular gas is $5.24, and $5.75 for diesel. GasBuddy reflects similar prices in Stockton. We found plenty of articles about soaring gas prices in California but no reports of prices soaring as high as $9 a gallon. The Los Angeles Times reported on March 6 that the average California gas prices are now over $5 a gallon, noting that ""a few stations"" in Los Angeles County have surpassed $6 a gallon.  We’ve previously reported on photos of gas station signs that appear to be selling gas for nearly $10. But the stations weren’t actually selling gas for that much. It’s common for stations to advertise fake, high prices on their signs when they’re either closed or out of gas to discourage drivers from stopping.  We rate the March 4 claim that gas was being sold for $9 in California False.",/factchecks/2022/mar/07/viral-image/california-gas-prices-are-going-not-9-gallon-early/

Fact-checking Rep. Jamaal Bowman on legacy admissions, affirmative action
","U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat who represents New York's 16th District, recently tweeted a comment about admissions equity at selective universities, an issue he’s currently seeking to address with legislation. ""More white legacy students get admitted to top universities than Black & Latinx students admitted through affirmative action"" Bowman tweeted on Jan. 26.  Bowman has introduced a bill with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., to overhaul legacy and donor admissions practices at universities. The Fair College Admissions for Students Act would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prevent colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs from offering admissions preferences to children of alumni or donors. While Bowman has a point that white students do benefit significantly from legacy admissions, his tweet includes some imprecise phrasing and oversimplifies some recent research. When we asked Patsy Montesinos, a spokesperson for Bowman, for the evidence to support the tweet, she said it was based on an opinion article by Deborah Archer, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, published in Bloomberg Law, and a 2019 study, ""Legacy and Athlete Preferences at Harvard,"" by three academics for the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Here, we will focus on the academic paper since it was the only one that offered new, specific data. When we reached out to the co-authors of the academic paper, one of them, Tyler Ransom, a University of Oklahoma economist, took issue with how Bowman’s tweet was worded. The paper is based on data that emerged from a lawsuit against Harvard University over alleged discrimination against Asian American applicants. As part of the lawsuit, Harvard provided unusual access to data underlying admissions decisions for specific types of applicants, including recruited athletes, legacy students (that is, those who are children of alumni), the children of faculty and staff, and the children of major donors. The paper analyzed this data. For starters, the paper studied admissions patterns at Harvard — not at all ""top universities."" Ransom also took issue with Bowman’s phrasing, which could be read to suggest that white legacy admissions exceed the combination of Black and Latino affirmative action admissions. In reality, the paper’s analysis estimated that, collectively, the number of Blacks and Latino admitted as a result of affirmative action was higher than the number of white legacy admissions. Only when the number of Black affirmative action admits was compared individually to the number of white legacy admits, or when the number of Latino affirmative action admits was compared individually to the number of white legacy admits, did the number of legacy admits exceed the number of affirmative action admits. Bowman’s office also shared a memorandum that criticized legacy preferences. The memorandum, written by the advocacy group Education Reform Now, cited data from Princeton University’s admission statistics from 2021. The data listed indicate that legacy students made up 13% of admits, Blacks made up 8%, and Latinos made up 11%. This shows the same pattern: Collectively, Black and Hispanic admits exceeded the number of legacy admits, even though individually, each group’s admission numbers were outpaced by legacy students. When looking at this data, It’s worth noting a few factors that complicate the conclusions that can be drawn. First, Black and Hispanic admits from the Princeton data may also be legacy admits. Second, it’s impossible to know whether some of the white legacy admits would have been admitted even without their legacy status. And third, not all of the Black and Latino Princeton admits would have been the beneficiary of affirmative action. When we presented our reporting to Bowman's office, Alex Foley, a legislative aide, acknowledged that drawing conclusions about the data can be difficult. However, he added that ""many top universities do enroll more legacy students"" than they do Black or Latino students. Bowman said, ""More white legacy students get admitted to top universities than Black & Latinx students admitted through affirmative action."" There is evidence that legacy students do get an unusually large benefit in the elite college admissions process but the data is quite limited. And, recent data suggests some complications in drawing comparisons between the admission rates of various groups.  These complications include the reality that some admits are both minorities and legacies. It's also hard to say what share of white legacy admits and Black and Latino admits received preferences from their legacy status or from affirmative action, respectively. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2022/mar/07/jamaal-bowman/fact-checking-rep-jamaal-bowman-legacy-admissions-/

Dr. Rochelle Walensky referenced CNN report from 2020, before she joined CDC
","It would be troubling if the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relied on the media for updates on the COVID-19 pandemic.

""So many of us wanted to be helpful. So many of us wanted to say, ‘OK, this is our ticket out, right?’ ‘Now we’re done.’ So I think we had perhaps too little caution and too much optimism for some good things that came our way."" Walensky’s press secretary, Jason McDonald, confirmed to PolitiFact that she was referring to the initial news from Pfizer and BioNTech that studies showed their COVID-19 vaccine to be 95% effective, which the companies announced to the world on Nov. 18, 2020. On that date, Walensky was not working for the CDC, so it makes sense that she heard the news about the vaccine from CNN or other news outlets, just like the rest of us. Walensky served as chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and as a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School when then-President-elect Joe Biden nominated her to lead the CDC. She officially started the director job on Jan. 20, 2021.  A Facebook post alleges that the CDC director said she gets her updates about COVID-19 from CNN. The claim is misleading because Walensky was referring to the initial news that Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine proved 95% effective after a phase 3 study.

Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin says he reduced homicides by 40% his first year in office
","Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin promotes a ""tough-on-crime"" mantra as part of his campaign for Illinois governor.  Since Irvin jumped into the GOP primary earlier this year, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and lawmakers have criticized Irvin for touting a crime-busting reputation while ignoring his 15 years of work as a defense attorney.  In a Feb. 20 tweet, Irvin said, ""In my first year in office, Aurora homicides went down by 40%. While crime is exploding under anti-police politicians, I have suppressed crime in Aurora. Send me to Springfield and I’ll do the same thing across all Illinois."" In my first year in office, Aurora homicides went down by 40%. While crime is exploding under anti-police politicians, I have suppressed crime in Aurora. Send me to Springfield and I’ll do the same thing across all Illinois. We decided to check out whether Irvin’s claims at reducing homicides in one year stand up to his assertion he ""suppressed crime"" since taking office in May 2017.  Irvin, who has been mayor for five years, chose to compare the two years that reflect the largest downturn in homicides. Overall, however, homicides have fluctuated under his tenure.  According to the Aurora Police Department, six homicides were committed in Aurora in 2017 and four in 2018. Eleni Demertzis, an Irvin spokesperson, said their team analyzed data from 2016 — the last full year before Irvin assumed office — and 2018 — the first full year after. In 2016, seven homicides occurred in the city of about 200,000 people. By data, she referred to a total of 11 homicides over two years. ""The number comes out to 43%, which we rounded down to 40%,"" Demertzis said, attributing the mayor’s ""strong leadership"" to a downturn in crime. She said he increased police budgets and added more officers. Demertzis pointed to a 2021 study by WalletHub that rated Aurora as the sixth largest safe city in America. But experts say it is both misleading and disingenuous to ascribe crime trends involving such low numbers, specifically homicide rates.  Ted Gest, founding partner of John Jay College’s Center on Media, Crime and Justice, said it would be difficult for any mayor to claim credit or take the blame for changes in crime rates in any period because data often fluctuates.  ""It is sort of ridiculous for a mayor to say they lowered homicides by 40%,"" said Gest. ""In this case, when the numbers are obviously very small, single digit numbers, why not just use the actual numbers?"" Using Irvin’s math, the homicide rate during his second year in office jumped by 200%, from 4 in 2018 to 12 in 2019. Gest, who oversees daily news digest Crime and Justice News and authored Crime and Politics, a book about America’s explosion in crime rates, said it is unreliable to compare homicide rates from year-to-year especially with small numbers like Aurora’s. Any one event that results in multiple homicides can create a drastic change in the homicide rate.  Take the 12 homicides that occurred in Aurora in 2019. Five of the 12 total murders were connected to a single event  — a shooting at the Henry Pratt Company.  Using exact numbers is especially important when considering other factors that impact crime trends. It can also be helpful to consider national crime, and in some cases, international crime, according to Wesley Skogan, a Northwestern University professor emeritus and member of the research faculty of the Institute for Policy Research.  For example, Skogan pointed to the 11 homicides that happened in Aurora in 2020 and said the high number was ""perfectly in accord"" with a national crime spike when the U.S. murder rate rose by 30% between 2019 and 2020.  Skogan echoed Gest and added that it is helpful to look at crimes that have a significant impact rather than measuring success based on small numbers.  ""It would be more useful if civic leaders would focus on several crime categories which affect great numbers of residents in their community,"" Skogan said.  Unless Irvin could point to some very specific change and connect that to something specific that he did, it would be tricky to prove whether his actions helped reduce the number of homicides, Gest said.  Irvin claimed that he reduced the number of homicides by 40% during his first year as Aurora mayor.  There is only an element of truth in this claim: Homicides in Aurora dropped from six to four during Irvin’s first year as mayor. Experts say using percentages to describe the small fluctuations in the city’s homicide stats is misleading, and there is no proven connection to Irvin’s policies. We rate this claim Mostly False.   MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2022/mar/06/richard-irvin/aurora-mayor-richard-irvin-says-he-reduced-homicid/

No, Putin didn’t say the West is controlled by Satanic pedophiles
","In a video that’s been edited to look like Russian President Vladimir Putin is dancing on a flight of stairs, a question appears, asking ""How can you support Putin?"" The answers follow in quick succession in the form of what look like news headlines that appear on the screen, including this one: ""Putin: The West is controlled by Satanic pedophiles.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Angela Stent, senior advisor for the Center for Eurasian, Russian & East European Studies at Georgetown University who’s written multiple books about Russia and its president including, ""Putin’s World: Russia Against the West and with the Rest.""  Stent told us that she hadn’t ""seen or read"" the statement attributed to Putin. We also couldn’t find evidence to support that Putin said the West is controlled by Satanic pedophiles.  The claim that Putin said it isn’t new but it is getting fresh attention since Russia recently invaded Ukraine.  In July 2021, Reuters looked into the claim that Putin said the west is controlled by Satanic pedophiles and couldn’t find any public record of the president saying that after reviewing his speeches, which were published on the Kremlin’s site. (The site was not working as PolitiFact was checking this post.)  In a 2013 speech, Reuters reported, Putin mentioned both Satan and pedophilia, but in different contexts than they’re presented in this Facebook video.  ""We can see how many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilization,"" Putin said, according to an English translation of the speech. ""They are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious and even sexual. They are implementing policies that equate large families with same-sex partnerships, belief in God with the belief in Satan.""  Other headlines that appear in the Facebook video — ""Putin: America is Godless, has turned away from Christian values"" from Breitbart, and ""Vladimir Putin: The New World Order worships Satan"" from a Russian blog —  also refer to this portion of Putin’s speech.  Stent told Reuters at the time that the Kremlin considers Russia the only truly Christian country, and thinks that the West is no longer Christian because of its interest in LGBTQ rights.  Putin also said during this speech that ""the excesses of political correctness have reached the point where people are seriously talking about registering political parties whose aim is to promote pedophilia."" Reuters reported he was likely referring to a Dutch association that once advocated for pedophilia to be accepted. The headline that Putin said the West is controlled by Satanic pedophiles was posted on a blog five years ago and also relies on this 2013 speech, but presents it as if Putin made the comments during former President Donald Trump’s tenure. The blog, like the headlines in the Faceook video, sound themes familiar among those who follow QAnon, a movement that claims without evidence that there is a global cabal of child sex traffickers that Trump is trying to thwart.  The rest of the headlines that appear in the video vary in accuracy.  ""Putin calls Bill and Hillary Clinton ‘the same Satan’"" was published in PJ Media in 2016 after Putin quoted a Russian proverb while talking about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s desire to be president like her husband, former President Bill Clinton. ""As we say, husband and wife are the same Satan,"" Putin said.  ""Putin: All US presidents are puppets — ‘dark men in suits rule America’"" appeared on blog posts in 2017 that paraphrased comments Putin made to the French publication Le Figaro.  According to an English Translation of Putin’s remarks that appeared on the Kremlin’s website, he did not mention puppets but said: ""I have already spoken to three U.S. presidents. They come and go, but politics stay the same at all times. Do you know why? Because of the powerful bureaucracy. When a person is elected, they may have some ideas. Then people with briefcases arrive, well dressed, wearing dark suits, just like mine, except for the red tie, since they wear black or dark blue ones. These people start explaining how things are done. And instantly, everything changes. This is what happens with every administration."" ""‘I’m going to defeat the Illuminati with my bare hands’ | Putin 2016,"" appeared atop a 2016 blog post that reported ""Putin is said to have uttered these bold words.""

Immigrants who are known criminals are not using an arrest warrant to fly on U.S. aircraft
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is among Republicans taking aim at the Biden administration’s handling of immigration at the nation’s Southern border. In a Feb. 4, 2022 news release about a policy that allows immigrants to use immigration warrants as a form of identification, Johnson included this statement: ""The Biden administration’s disregard for the rule of law knows no bounds. Since the president took office a year ago, we have seen at least 2.4 million people enter this country illegally. For DHS and TSA to allow known criminals who possess an arrest warrant to fly on U.S. aircraft threatens our homeland security.""  The numbers are eye-popping.  In the 2021 fiscal year, which ran from October 2020 through September 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Control reported 1.73 million encounters at the southern border, according to agency data, with apprehensions greatly increasing in the latter months.  So far in fiscal year 2022, there have been more than 518,000 encounters at the border, not including data from January or February.  But what caught our attention is the second part of Johnson’s claim – that immigrants are being permitted to use ""arrest warrants"" as a form of identification in order to board flights within the U.S., in place of a state-issued I.D. or passport.  Is Johnson right? When asked for backup, Johnson’s office shared a document written by David Pekoske, the administrator of the TSA, which handles traveler screening for those boarding planes. In the document, accepted forms of identification are listed, including various U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) forms, Department of Homeland Security forms and others.  The list includes: ICE Form I-200 – Warrant for Arrest of Alien. Case closed?  Not exactly. It’s considerably more complicated than that. Let’s start with Johnson’s phrase ""arrest warrant,"" and how it is commonly understood – a document, typically signed by a judge, that authorizes police to arrest someone related to a specific criminal offense. From that vantage point, it’s almost nonsensical to think the target of such an arrest would be carrying such a document, much less using it as identification. In fact, the target presumably wouldn’t even know that a warrant was issued for their arrest. So, just what does the document in question represent? Civil – not criminal – violations are issued by ICE when a person enters the U.S. without the approval of an immigration officer or overstays a work or travel visa.  It is illegal to do so, according to the American Immigration Council, with the first offense amounting to a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or up to six months in prison. The second offense, or illegal re-entry, is a felony punishable by up to two years in prison, but higher penalties can apply depending on the situation.  The I-200 is used in a variety of contexts, according to David Bier, a research fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. For an asylum seeker crossing into the U.S., he said, ICE would issue the form after Border Patrol has transferred the person to an ICE detention facility.  But because it isn’t possible for ICE to detain everyone referred by Border Control, the agency does release individuals, but only after they are deemed not a threat to the community and not a flight risk, Bier said.  ""The Form I-200 is often the only personal identification available to a person released by ICE, either because they entered without any ID or, as commonly, because ICE or Customs and Border Patrol has confiscated their passports and released them without any other identification,"" Bier said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  Bier said the only alternative to allowing people to use the Form I-200 would be to strand thousands of people in the city they are released in, far away from family or friends.  ""Besides being inhumane, no state or city would support such a policy,"" he said. ""The I-200 is issued only after an investigation into the person's identity and would only be possessed by someone released by ICE if they had their fingerprints collected and background check conducted, so it works fine as identification."" What’s more, according to the TSA, civil violation documents are not viewed by themselves as indicating someone is a threat to public safety or national security. Indeed, they have been allowed as a form of identification since 2019, a change that took place under President Donald Trump. Their use is important, because the document can confirm the identity of an individual, which the agency can then use to see if the person is on a no-fly list or does pose a known threat to public safety or national security.  Let’s also take a look at Johnson’s use of the phrase ""known criminal"" – according to the Department of Homeland Security, known criminals are persons who have a prior criminal conviction. Just because a person is identifying themselves using an ICE form doesn’t mean they have been convicted of a crime.  Finally, the document provided by Johnson’s staff itself notes that immigration status, without other issues, is not a factor in the TSA screening process.  So, based on an admittedly misleading title, the senator is misusing – or at least misunderstanding – what the document is. Johnson claimed that TSA was allowing undocumented immigrants who are ""known criminals who possess an arrest warrant to fly on U.S. aircraft (which) threatens our homeland security.""  While immigrants can use civil immigration violation documents to prove their identity in order to board planes, those documents are not criminal arrest warrants, as the claim suggests. Indeed, there is no reason to think the target of a criminal arrest warrant would be given a copy of such a warrant, much less carry it with him or herself. What’s more, under the process officials have already established an individual’s identity and determined they are not a threat or a flight risk. That said, a memo from the TSA administrator includes a document labeled ""Warrant for Arrest of Alien"" on a list of acceptable paperwork. So, there is at least an element of truth to the matter. That fits our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2022/mar/04/ron-johnson/immigrants-who-are-known-criminals-are-not-using-a/

The Feb. 25 post showed a photo of the Joker from the Batman film, ""The Dark Knight',"" with text overlaid that read, ""Them: Let’s pray for Ukraine! Me: It’s all scripted and staged."" The accompanying text post read, ""Russia and Ukraine is a coverup!"" and linked to a nine-minute YouTube video that falsely claimed the war is a coverup to distract from COVID-19, which it says was also planned and staged. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First off, COVID-19 is real. PolitiFact named claims to the contrary its 2020 Lie of the Year. Statistical data, hospitals, medical workers, news reports and more show that the pandemic is authentic, and has caused millions to get sick or die.  As for war in Ukraine, daily evidence proves that there is indeed a war.  During the early morning of Feb. 24, after months of increased Russian military presence near the Ukrainian border, President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion into Ukraine in a televised speech, calling it a ""special military operation.""  Following Russian missile strikes on Feb. 24, 2022, a destroyed car, damaged radar and equipment are shown at a Ukrainian military facility outside Mariupol, Ukraine. (AP Photo) Before the Russian invasion, numerous Ukrainian civilians volunteered to become fighters and took part in military training. Now, they’re on the frontline. NPR, The New York Times and other news sources have extensively covered the situation in Ukraine, where journalists and citizens have transmitted images depicting the war effort.  This picture, my God. https://t.co/8m2EDk8cBb pic.twitter.com/YW8dZ2fI04 The exact number of civilians killed is unknown, but as of March 2, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service estimated more than 2,000 Ukrainians dead, according to CNN. On March 4, the United Nations gave a lower count of 331 people killed, including 19 children, and 675 who were injured. But ""the real toll is likely to be much higher,"" Liz Throssell, U.N. spokesperson, said.  The U.N. reported that most civilian deaths in the first eight days of conflict were ""caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes."" Russia has also reported casualties. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that 498 Russian troops have died and 1,597 more have been injured, NPR reported. With the impact of the war on civilians being publicly reported, and both sides reporting troops’ deaths and injuries, the claim that any of this is being staged proves to be baseless. Even more evidence that the conflict is real: the swift response from other countries. NATO has stated they will not engage in the war, but have taken other means of action against Russia. The United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have joined together in implementing harsh economic sanctions against the Russian economy. During his State of the Union Address on March 1, President Joe Biden announced that, in addition to cutting off Russia's largest banks from the international banking system, the U.S. ""will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy.""  The value of the ruble, Russia’s currency, has fallen to less than one U.S. cent. Rising prices on some products like electronics and appliances have caused citizens to stock up, and NPR reports that arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia are racking up. They cite a Russian human rights group called OVD-Info, who’ve counted more than 8,000 arrests.  Wealthy elites, who also face sanctions, have criticized Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Scott Radnitz, an associate professor of Russian and Eurasian studies at the University of Washington, viewed the Facebook post and video, and said that the claim hinges on a world domination conspiracy theory — but there is no evidence presented for why or how the war is being staged. ""There is little to refute directly, other than to note that thousands or millions of people would have to be in on any conspiracy to fake a war, and like the 9/11 attacks (which some people also deny) there is substantial video footage of attacks on Ukrainian cities, Russian invading forces, and throngs of refugees,"" Radnitz said. Nevertheless, he added, ""a true believer will persist in denying all that evidence, something that is easier to do when the conflict is geographically distant and they do not personally know anyone directly affected by it."" With a war raging, the world responding and both sides of the conflict experiencing its effects, the claim that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""scripted and staged"" holds no merit.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis mischaracterizes the efficacy of face masks
","On March 2, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis walked into a press conference at the University of South Florida and saw seven high school students standing behind a podium, each of them wearing face masks.  ""You don't have to wear those masks,"" DeSantis told the students. ""I mean, please take them off."" Some of them laughed, but the governor wasn't joking. ""Honestly, this is not doing anything. We've got to stop with this COVID theater.""  ""So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous,"" DeSantis said before turning toward the lectern and letting out an audible sigh.  Behind the viral exchange, recorded on video by NBC affiliate WFLA, was a false notion promoted by the Republican governor — though upheld by a slew of his statewide policies — that mask-wearing is an ineffective symbol of paranoia.   Throughout the pandemic, DeSantis has taken positions contrary to public health guidance from experts. In July, he issued an executive order barring schools from requiring face masks, saying that mask guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lacked a ""well-grounded scientific justification."" We rated that claim False.  But the eyebrow-raising scene of a governor scolding students for wearing masks posed a broader question: Are there still legitimate reasons people might choose to wear face masks in public? We decided to find out.  When we asked DeSantis about the incident, his press secretary, Christina Pushaw, said the governor wanted to ensure that people were informed about the ""lack of evidence for masks.""  ""Following Florida, the CDC has even stopped recommending mask wearing for most Americans, and even the most liberal states have dropped mask mandates for schools,"" Pushaw said. ""After two years of mixed messages and social engineering from health authorities and media, the governor wants to make sure everyone is aware of the facts and data."" Contrary to what Pushaw suggested, the CDC based its decision on its view that the nation is in a ""stronger place"" in the pandemic because of the widespread availability of testing, vaccines, and other tools to prevent COVID-19. The relaxed mask recommendations for a large share of the U.S. were released in February.  Still, Dr. Greta Massetti, a senior epidemiologist for the CDC, said in a press conference announcing the recommendations that masking in low transmission areas was not unreasonable.  ""We should all keep in mind that some people may choose to wear a mask at any time based on personal preference,"" Massetti said. ""And importantly, people who wear high-quality masks are well protected, even if others around you are not masking."" A recent study published by the CDC found that wearing face masks notably reduced the likelihood of testing positive for COVID. Well-fitting masks block virus-sized particles in laboratory conditions, according to the study.  Respirator masks proved to be the most effective, reducing the risk of contracting the virus by about 83%. Surgical masks came in second, with an efficacy of 66%.  ""Masks have been a significant piece of personal protective equipment for both health care workers potentially exposed to pathogens and laboratorians,"" said Jill Roberts, associate professor at the University of South Florida’s College of Public Health. The latest mask recommendations from the CDC urge people in areas of high community transmission to wear face masks when in public. A significant number of cities and counties across the U.S. have high COVID transmission rates.     Florida’s Hillsborough County — where DeSantis held the conference — currently has a high transmission rate and, per the CDC guidelines, people should wear masks. However, in accordance with DeSantis’ executive order, Hillsborough County Public Schools does not require its students to wear face masks.  But it doesn’t discourage mask-wearing, either. ""It is a student and parent’s choice to protect their health in a way they feel most appropriate,"" a spokesperson for the school district told PolitiFact. The CDC urges immunocompromised people — such as people with cerebral palsy, diabetes, or heart disease — to continue wearing masks when in public. Immunocompromised people comprise 2.7% of adults in the U.S., or about 7 million, according to the CDC.  ""Immunocompromised individuals do not have the luxury of assuming that an infection will not be serious,"" Roberts told PolitiFact. ""Therefore, it is important that they are able to take steps to prevent disease, including wearing masks."" In high-risk congregate settings, like schools, immunocompromised people are recommended to take further precautions.  After the emergence of the omicron variant, COVID-19 cases and hospitalization among children spiked. Immunocompromised children were disproportionately affected.  Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities are twice as likely to get COVID-19 than their peers and have a higher mortality rate, the American Academy of Pediatrics found. For some of these children, difficulty with verbal communication can lead to the underreporting of COVID symptoms — further exacerbating their vulnerability.  ""For immunocompromised kids, it is not 'ridiculous' to wear masks,"" said Matthew Dietz, litigation director at the Disability Independence Group. ""But this ridiculously minor precaution protects their lives."" Children with disabilities may require close contact with teaching assistants on the bus or in classrooms. In such instances, masking can help mitigate the risk of infection while still providing the child with the assistance they need.  DeSantis told students that wearing masks ""is not doing anything. We've got to stop with this COVID theater.""  Health authorities say that wearing a mask, even in a low-risk situation, can be effective at preventing transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. In high-risk areas, like where DeSantis was speaking, public health authorities strongly recommend wearing a mask. People who are immunocompromised are particularly at risk; masking at all times would be a recommended protective measure for this group.  DeSantis’ statement is not accurate. We rate it False. ",/factchecks/2022/mar/04/ron-desantis/florida-gov-ron-desantis-mischaracterizes-efficacy/

Rep. Chris Taylor says Gov. Scott Walker's budget filled with mistakes
","As Gov. Scott Walker travels the country in his not-quite-formal-presidential bid, Democrats in Wisconsin complain he’s neglecting the state. That criticism extends to the 2015-’17 state budget, which will soon be up for votes in the Assembly and Senate. Democrats (and a few Republicans) have complained about a variety of matters in the budget, and said the package was poorly prepared. Such complaints were raised in a news release issued the day before work on the budget began in the Joint Finance Committee. The Democrats on the committee complained that lawmakers were given a ""last minute error document"" that ran 110 pages. ""Drafting errors may happen, but I highly doubt that 110 pages and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes and unintended consequences are anything but the product of an extremely distracted Governor not putting his home state first,"" state Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) said in a news release issued by the Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee. Is Taylor right? Did Walker’s budget have an unusual number of budget corrections that were cleaned up in the final hours? How the process works Such last-minute correction documents are not new. They even have a formal bureaucratic name -- an ""errata report."" Like past governors, Walker issued his budget in February of 2015. The document itself runs 1,800 pages, with most of it being highly technical in nature. The errata report is a document that corrects mistakes identified between the time when the budget is announced and when the Legislature begins its work. In April 2013, during the last state budget cycle, the Walker Administration sent lawmakers an errata report fixing about a dozen items and recommending eight amendments. A March 15, 2013 memo corrected 61 more items, all of which appeared to be very technical. In Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, similar memos corrected about 40 items. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s final budget included about 75 corrections in memos issued in March 2009. ""When you’re dealing with an 1,800 page bill you’re going to find a mistake or two,"" said Legislative Fiscal Bureau Director Bob Lang, who has been with the agency since 1971. ""I don’t recall a budget where there weren’t technical changes."" Department of Administrator spokesman Cullen Werwie said much the same in an email: ""Nearly every budget has an errata to make minor and technical changes. This year is no different."" Looking at Walker’s budget Compared with recent budgets, the errata report from the Department of Administration for the 2015-’17, dated April 15, 2015, budget made more corrections -- about 110 by our count -- than those in the past several budgets. On April 13, 2015, the Joint Finance Committee received a smaller document with 12 items that needed to be cleaned up. What about the portion of Taylor’s claim that the changes involved millions of dollars? The ""millions"" figure cited corresponds with the April 13 errata memo, which says the changes will decrease the state’s general fund balance by $2.87 million. Taylor aide Maggie Gau noted that ""millions"" also applies to a figure that shows up on page 106 of the April 15 memo. Walker wanted to move the worker’s compensation division from the Department of Workforce Development to the Officer of the Commissioner of Insurance. The original budget failed to include funding for the workers comp agency for the period leading up to that transition. That added $15.67 million in expense. Page 52 of the memo said there were another $4.8 million in expense related to ""supplies and services"" that were not accounted for in the move of the workers compensation division. That’s at least $20 million in cleaned up mistakes. Other corrections included in the errata memo were substantial policy changes. Among the corrections: Walker’s original budget eliminated mention of the Wisconsin Idea as the foundation of the University of Wisconsin System. (Walker claimed at the time that it was a mistake, but records showed the budget drafting staff following directions issued by Walker’s team.)  The memo restored the Wisconsin Idea language. The memo also created a new policy, and proposed capping UW System undergraduate tuition increases at no more than the annual increase in the consumer price index. Our rating Taylor said that Walker’s proposed budget ""contained 110 pages and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes"" that were corrected with a follow-up document. Taylor is right on the number of the tweaks made in the budget and that they affected millions of dollars in the state budget. But such clean-up memos are a routine part of the budget process -- though there were a bit more this time than in the three previous state budgets.

Does becoming a prostitute mean you've only got about 7 years to live?
","Amid a growing awareness that sex trafficking is a problem in Rhode Island, the public access program ""State of the State"" broadcast a discussion of the issue. During the show, host Rebecca Quigley offered several statistics about sex workers. One in particular caught our ear. ""Once a woman enters into the sex trade,"" she said, ""her average life expectancy is seven years, with AIDS and homicide as the top killers."" So if a 18-year-old woman starts working as a prostitute, she's likely to be dead by age 25? We decided to check out that provocative statistic. We found the claim echoed in many sites on the Internet, including Ohio Catholic Conference, The Straight Dope, CNN and others. In contrast, we located a 2004 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that used 33 years of data to examine the lives of female prostitutes in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Nearly 2,000 were ultimately tracked. Some had been in the business for a few years, others for much longer. The researchers found that fewer than 8 percent died over the three decades. When we tracked down the authors, they said the actual life expectancy, like so many statistics used in the prostitution debate, isn't really known. But, they said, it's not seven years. ""If you had a life expectancy that short, you'd have difficulty replenishing the pool with new prostitutes,"" said coauthor Devon D. Brewer, who directs Interdisciplinary Scientific Research, a Seattle-based research and consulting firm. ""It's tough to put into words how dramatic an overstatement that is. There's zero basis that I'm aware of for making statements like that."" ""The truth is, the vast majority of women who enter into prostitution leave the trade alive, so to say a life expectancy of seven years . . . There is no basis for anything that incredibly dramatic,"" he said. ""That's a statement that gains credence because it's repeated so often and it perhaps has very little to do with reality,"" said chief author John J. Potterat, now retired from the El Paso County Department of Health and Environment in Colorado Springs. When we heard back from Quigley, she cited several sources we had seen that made the same claim, including an article from Emergency Physicians Monthly that traced a variant of the claim to Melissa Farley, clinical psychologist, founder and director of Prostitution Research and Education, based in San Francisco. She's an anti-prostitution activist. Farley told us that, although she's heard the statistic, she's never seen any documentation to back it up. What is true, the experts all agreed, is that prostitution is a very dangerous profession. The fact that the seven-year statistic is wrong, said Brewer, the Seattle scholar, ""doesn't take away from the fact that the risk of death that prostitute women face is higher than any other set of women ever studied, at least the risk of homicide. Does that mean most prostitutes are getting killed? No. It means compared to other women in other professions it's the one you're mostly likely to be murdered in."" Brewer and his colleagues estimated that the women they studied faced a 1 percent chance of being murdered during their prostitution career. That murder rate, by the way, has also spawned another bogus statistic — that prostitutes typically die around age 34. What Brewer, Potterat and their colleagues actually found was that among the 21 prostitutes in their study who were murdered, their average age when they died was 34. As retired call girl Maggie McNeill noted last year in the Washington Post, to say that's ""the average life expectancy of all street workers, or of all sex workers . . . would be analogous to saying that because the average soldier who is killed in battle is 21 years old, the average man who joins the military dies at 21."" Quigley's best source supporting her claim — and one we found as well — was the FBI. In an FBI document titled ""FY 2011 Budget Request At A Glance,"" the bureau asks for $333 million and 831 positions to fight child exploitation. The fact sheet claims, ""Studies estimate between 200,000 and 300,000 children are being forced into prostitution at any given time in the United States. The average age of a new child prostitute is 13, and the life expectancy after becoming a child prostitute is 7 years."" No source is cited. We couldn't find another FBI document that repeated the seven-year claim. So the FBI was only talking about child prostitution, not prostitution in general. And when we contacted the FBI, the agency repudiated the statistic. Spokesman Christopher M. Allen said that after checking with the bureau's Violent Crimes Against Children Section, it appears that the seven-year life expectancy claim may have come from a case the FBI handled, one that involved several victims. ""It should not be considered a general statement of FBI findings,"" Allen wrote in an email. Our ruling Rebecca Quigley said, ""Once a woman enters into the sex trade, her average life expectancy is seven years."" She — like many others on the Internet — are incorrectly quoting a FBI budget report that only deals with child prostitution and offers no documentation. And the FBI is now trying to set the record straight. There’s little doubt that prostitution can be one of the most dangerous endeavors undertaken by a woman. But the seven-year claim is flat out False.   (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)",/factchecks/2015/may/31/rebecca-quigley/does-becoming-prostitute-mean-youve-only-got-about/

Would paying half the cost of a new Milwaukee Bucks arena be a relatively low share for taxpayers?
","News broke on May 27, 2015 that an agreement was close on how to pay for a new $500 million arena for the Milwaukee Bucks, the basketball team that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once led to glory. Some details of the proposed arrangement between the Bucks and state and local government officials were new. But the overall cost sharing was, more or less, what had long been expected: The Bucks’ owners would pay half and taxpayers would pay half. According to Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, such a split would be good for taxpayers. Here is what he said April 10, 2015 on ""Here and Now,"" a Wisconsin Public Television show: ""If this comes out close to a 50-50 partnership, it will be much better -- in terms of the portion of the public financing -- than most of the other arena projects done around the country."" In other words, Sheehy, who supports the new arena, is saying that taxpayers picking up half the tab for a new Milwaukee arena is relatively low, compared to how much taxpayers have contributed toward arenas for other National Basketball Association teams. The parties set a self-imposed deadline of May 29, 2015 to try and finalize the financing deal, which would have to be approved, likely within the next few weeks, as part of the 2015-’17 state budget. So, let’s take a look. The Bucks and their arenas The Bucks joined the NBA in the 1968-’69 season. Led by Abdul-Jabbar and another future Hall of Famer, Oscar Robertson, they won their only league championship in the 1970-’71 season. That, according to the team, meant the Bucks went further, faster, than any expansion team in the history of major professional sports. In recent years, however, the Bucks have struggled, and that is one reason there has been a drive to build a new arena. The team’s current home -- the $90 million BMO Harris Bradley Center, which was built through a donation by the late Milwaukee philanthropist Jane Bradley Pettit -- opened in 1988. The 18,600-seat arena is the third-oldest and the third-smallest in the 30-team NBA. Momentum for a new arena picked up in April 2014, when the Bucks’ longtime owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl of Milwaukee, announced he was selling the team to New York hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. Kohl and the new owners pledged to contribute $250 million toward a new arena. Coming up with the other $250 million has been the sticking point, leading to months of negotiations involving Gov. Scott Walker, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. There is time pressure in that the NBA has said a new arena must be built by the fall of 2017, or Milwaukee would risk losing the team to another market. Other arena deals To see how other NBA arenas have been financed, we turned to two sources: The 2012 edition of ""Financing Economic Development in the 21st Century,""  a textbook that includes a chapter on financing professional sports facilities. And a database, last updated in August 2014, that is maintained by Marquette University Law School’s National Sports Law Institute. We’ve listed the 15 NBA arenas -- comprising half the arenas in the league -- that have been built since 1999. We went back to 1999 because a wave of NBA arenas -- seven of them -- went up that year. As we’ll see, there is some disagreement between the figures provided by the textbook and by Marquette. Holy Cross College sports economist Victor Matheson, who wrote the sports facilities chapter in the textbook, told us that’s not surprising because there are different ways to define a public contribution and because stadium financing deals aren’t always transparent. Based on the two sources we checked, at least eight of the 15 NBA arenas built since 1999 were financed with more than 50 percent taxpayer support. Indeed, although there is some variation in the figures in the two sources, seven of the eight arenas were built with at least 82 percent public money (the total cost figures are according to the textbook). Arenas built with more than 50% public money NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the texbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Orlando 2010 $480 million 90% 87.5% Charlotte 2005 $265 million 100% 100% Memphis 2004 $250 million 100% 83% Houston 2003 $235 million 82% 100% San Antonio 2002 $186 million 85% 84% Oklahoma City 2002 $89 million 100% 100% Miami 1999 $213 million 100% 59% New Orleans 1999 $114 million 100% 100%   Conversely, the textbook and Marquette agree that only four of the arenas were built with taxpayer contributions of 50 percent or less. Arenas built with 50% or less public money NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the textbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Dallas 2001 $420 million 50% 30% Toronto 1999 $265 million 0% 0% Denver 1999 $160 million 22% 3% Los Angeles 1999 $375 million 16% 19%   There was not agreement between the between the two sources on the public portion paid for arenas in Brooklyn, Indianapolis and Atlanta: NBA city Year arena built Total cost Portion paid by taxpayers per the texbook Portion paid by taxpayers per Marquette Indianapolis 1999 $183 million 100% 43% Atlanta 1999 $214 million 29% 91% Brooklyn 2010 $637 million 24% N/A   Our rating Sheehy said a 50-50 public-private split for paying for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena would ""be much better in terms of the portion of the public financing than most of the other arena projects done around the country.""

Mike Huckabee: Supreme Court 'can't overrule' other branches of government
","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks current leaders need a basic civics refresher. The Republican presidential hopeful has said current politicians have allowed the judicial branch to exert more power than the executive and legislative branches of government. If elected, he would not bow to what he sees as ""judicial supremacy."" On Fox News Sunday May 24, he said this ""defies everything there is about the three equal branches of government."" He added, ""We are sworn to uphold the Constitution and law. And it has to be consistent and agreed upon with three branches of government -- one can't overrule the other two."" We know from our own basic civics lessons about checks and balances -- that the three branches of government have the ability to limit each others’ power. So we wanted to dig into Huckabee’s claim that one branch, particularly the courts, ""can’t overrule the other two."" On the one hand, Huckabee glosses over the fact that the Supreme Court can overrule laws passed by Congress and the president. However, he has a point that the Supreme Court doesn’t have to be the final word on the law -- the president and Congress have tools that can achieve certain goals in the face of judicial opposition. ""Working out the details of (his position) turns out to be quite complicated, but Huckabee is saying something located within one tradition in constitutional interpretation,"" said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. The final word One thing Huckabee and legal scholars across the political spectrum can agree on is that the courts have the power of judicial review. This means they can rule on the constitutionality of a law brought before the courts. To take just one example, in 1989, the Supreme Court effectively invalidated laws that prohibit flag burning by ruling that a Texan who burned an American flag was exercising his constitutional right to free speech. Though judicial review was not explicitly laid out in the Constitution, several founding fathers called for it, and the Supreme Court’s 1803 ruling on Marbury vs. Madison confirmed the court’s prerogative. It remains a cornerstone of the United States’ judiciary system. So the Supreme Court can clearly overrule the other two branches of government. Congress may pass a law and the president can sign it, but the court can invalidate it. The Supreme Court, however, only has the ability to interpret laws-- not to draft or enforce them. So the president is obligated to enforce the law as determined by the courts, said Katy Harriger, a professor of constitutional law at Wake Forest University. For instance, in 1954, the Supreme Court in Brown vs. Board of Education ruled that segregated schools are unconstitutional. The then-governor of Arkansas had decided that his state would not desegregate its schools to comply with the ruling, and in 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Arkansas to enforce the court’s decision. ""Deciding not to comply with a Supreme Court ruling would undermine the entire judiciary and have dire consequences for the separation of powers,"" said Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Slattery added that this doesn’t relieve the other branches of also upholding the Constitution. For instance, the president is obligated to veto legislation he believes is unconstitutional. Additionally, while the president and the legislature can’t flat-out ignore a ruling, they can still achieve the same goals contrary to Supreme Court opposition. They could amend the Constitution, for example, or appoint new judges who align with their position. ""If the other branches of the federal government don’t back the court, it is true that the court has very limited power to enforce its judgments,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Several presidents have chosen to independently interpret the Constitution, such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln disagreed with the 1857 Supreme Court ruling in the Dred Scott case, which concluded that people of African descent -- free or slave -- were not American citizens, and therefore could not petition for their freedom. So he pushed for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery and the 14th Amendment established the right to citizenship, nullifying the Dred Scott vs. Sandford decision. (The 14th Amendment passed after his death.) In other words, all three branches have at least some ability to go around the other branches when they disagree. This is what Huckabee was trying to express, said Huckabee spokesman Hogan Gidley -- that the court’s decisions are not immediately binding because the court can only write an opinion, not pass or enforce laws. Court opinions do not automatically become law, he said, and in this way, the legislative and executive branch are co-equal with the judiciary with ""numerous options"" to respond to rulings. That said, the other branches do tend to view the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of the Constitution, Roosevelt said -- and he and other legal scholars see that as a good thing. ""It would be difficult for our constitutional system of government to work if we did not have one body that had the last word on the meaning of the Constitution,"" Roosevelt added. While sympathetic to Huckabee’s position, Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Cornell University, said it’s not often that the situation arises where the executive and legislative branches can push back successfully against an adverse judicial ruling. And to the extent that rulings often align with public opinion, it would not be politically expedient in some cases to try to go around a ruling that most of the country agrees with. Defying the court through well-established means, such as a constitutional amendment, ""is all perfectly legitimate. Each branch publicly contests with the others using the tools at its disposal,"" Chafetz said. Our ruling In trying to make the point that the judicial branch has grabbed too much power, Huckabee said the Supreme Court ""can’t overrule the other two"" branches of government.  But the Supreme Court indeed has the power to overrule the other branches through judicial review -- the court's ability to rule that a law passed by Congress and signed by the president is unconstitutional. While there are certainly tools the president and Congress can use to go around a Supreme Court decision it doesn't like -- such as amending the Constitution or selecting justices that support the alternate position -- these are difficult to accomplish and usually require years of effort, making them rare. The much more common result is for the executive and legislative branches accept a Supreme Court decision as the final word. Huckabee may not like this state of affairs, but on balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/may/29/mike-huckabee/huckabee-supreme-court-cant-overrule-other-branche/

Jeb Bush: 'ISIS didn't exist when my brother was president' and al-Qaida was 'wiped out'
","After former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faced a tough couple of weeks related to his comments about whether he would have invaded Iraq even if he had known about faulty intelligence, he used a new tactic in New Hampshire: Blame President Barack Obama. ""The world is radically different, and so the focus ought to be on ‘knowing what you know now, Mr. President, would you, should you have kept 10,000 troops in Iraq?’ "" Bush said at a roundtable event in Portsmouth May 20. Bush noted that the Iraqi city of Ramadi had been taken over by ISIS the day before his roundtable. He then continued: ""ISIS didn’t exist when my brother was president. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president. There were mistakes made in Iraq for sure, but the surge created a fragile but stable Iraq that the president could have built on....."" He then criticized how Obama has handled Iraq. We decided to fact-check Bush’s claims that ISIS did not exist under President George W. Bush and that al-Qaida was wiped out in Iraq. (The Washington Post’s The Fact-Checker examined this issue as well.) ‘ISIS didn't exist when my brother was president’ A spokesman for Bush’s political action committee pointed to a 2014 op-ed by Ali Khedery, who served as senior adviser to three heads of US Central Command from 2003-10. It starts by saying, ""Three years ago, the Islamic State (ISIS) did not exist; now it controls vast swaths of Syria and Iraq."" Technically, yes, a group with the name ""ISIS"" did not exist under President Bush. The group’s roots, however, trace back to 2004. ""There were evolutions that took place with some of the name changes,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In 2004, long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established Al-Qa‘ida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2006, the group was renamed the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014, Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert at the New America Foundation, told PolitiFact Florida. ""Al-Sham just refers to the Levant and reflects the group's increased focus on Syria,"" he said. ""It reflects a geographic shift rather than change in political focus. It's the same group throughout."" ‘Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president’ Al-Qaida’s power waxed and waned over the years, but was it ""wiped out,"" as Jeb Bush said? The group’s targeting of Sunni civilians, which led to a backlash, combined with operations by Coalition forces and the Iraqi government, weakened the group in 2007. The Congressional Research Service wrote in August 2008 that U.S. officials concluded that al-Qaida in Iraq was ""weakened almost to the point of outright defeat  in Iraq, although they say it remains lethal and has the potential to revive in Iraq."" The surge under Bush was successful -- the attacks al-Qaida was carrying out had significantly declined by January 2009 when Bush left office. ""Literally everybody viewed this as a defeat for ISIS,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""When I say everybody I mean al-Qaida included. They viewed this as a major defeat to its brand."" A spokesman for Jeb Bush pointed to several articles that noted how the group was weakened, including a Washington Post article that stated that in 2009 ""the power of the Islamist militancy in Iraq was at its lowest ebb, and the number of killings had plunged."" In 2010, Vice President Joe Biden declared success in Iraq. When the combat mission ends, he said the administration ""will be able to point to it and say, ‘We told you what we’re going to do, and we did it.’"" But three factors led the group to a comeback: the Syrian war, the Iraqi government ruled in a sectarian way that alienated Sunnis, and the U.S. withdrew troops. Two experts we interviewed disagreed with each other on the extent that al-Qaida was ""wiped out"" under Bush. ""There is no doubt that the surge hurt AQI/ISI deeply,"" Fishman told PolitiFact Florida. ""The group was much weaker as a result. But it remained vibrant by the standards of any other AQ-linked jihadi group in the world."" Derek Harvey, a retired U.S. Army colonel who provided counsel to the U.S. on Iraq during Bush’s presidency and is now a professor at the University of South Florida, told PolitiFact that he disagreed with Fishman’s statement about the strength of ISI. ""The fact is that the few remnants of the organization found refuge in Syria, and it was there that they found the space and time to rebuild in 2009-11, and by summer 2012 they were strong enough to reemerge in Sunni Arab provinces in Iraq,"" he said. ""Although there will always be remnants of terror groups, I say that Jeb Bush is accurate that AQI was wiped out."" But al-Qaida did have a rebirth, Harvey said.  ""Both al-Qaida as a larger organization, and the Islamic State are far more powerful, diffused into more lands and among more distant peoples than at any time during the Bush years,"" Harvey said. In 2014, Obama was criticized for underestimating the Islamic State when he referred to it as a ""JV"" team in a January article in the New Yorker. In February 2014, the leadership of al-Qaida disowned the Islamic State of Iraq stating online that its former affiliate ""is not a branch of the al-Qaida group (and al-Qaida) does not have an organizational relationship with it and is not the group responsible for their actions,"" Time wrote. We will turn to Michael O’Hanlon, an expert on defense policy at the Brookings Institute, to summarize a critique of both of Bush’s claims: ""ISIL is a relatively new creation, but its roots are in al-Qaida in Iraq. Al-Qaida was significantly weakened by President Bush and company, but it was not wiped out. Moreover, the dynamics that the Iraq war set in motion contributed to the rise of ISIL, because Syria facilitated movement of many foreign fighters in and out of Iraq, and some of them resettled in Syria after the Iraq surge. ""Also, al-Qaida in Iraq didn’t really exist before the 2003 invasion,"" O’Hanlon said. ""So it’s too clean and neat for Gov. Bush to make the statement he did; there are kernels of truth in his claim but it misses a broader reality."" Our ruling Bush said, ""ISIS didn't exist when my brother was President. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president."" There are problems with both pieces of Bush’s claim. Yes, a group called ISIS didn’t exist while Bush was president, but the roots of the organization were indeed present and operating under a different banner. As far as claiming al-Qaida was ""wiped out,"" most experts consider that a stretch. The group’s power certainly diminished under Bush but it wasn’t wiped out. Bush’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/may/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-isis-didnt-exist-when-my-brother-was/

John McCain says 75% of airstrike missions against ISIS return without firing a weapon
","As the United States struggles with how best to respond militarily to Islamic State advances in Iraq, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., offered a bit of context about how airstrikes in the region are proceeding. On the May 24, 2015, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, McCain -- a leading Republican voice on military matters -- was asked by host Bob Schieffer, ""You have called this strategy a disaster. But what can, what should we be doing about this?"" McCain responded that the first thing to do is to stop arguing that the United States is making significant progress against ISIS (also known as ISIL, the Islamic State or DAESH). ""We need to have a robust strategy,"" McCain said. ""We need more troops on the ground. We need forward air controllers. But just referring to airstrikes, do you know that 75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon? It’s because we don’t have somebody on the ground who can identify … a moving target. ... We found in Vietnam that if you don’t have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect."" We wondered whether it’s correct that ""75 percent"" of combat airstrike missions ""return to base without having fired a weapon."" When we checked with the senator’s staff, they said that McCain -- who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee -- was basing his claim on data he was given by the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, the part of the military that oversees activities the region where the airstrikes are being carried out. The data McCain’s staff had at the time of his appearance on Face the Nation showed that through the end of March, there had been 2,950 strikes out of 12,121 strike-sorties, or 24 percent. That leaves 75 percent of sorties that had no strikes. (Strike-sorties do not include support flights, such as those for surveillance or tanker refuelings.) We double-checked with the Pentagon, and two officials said that McCain got his numbers right. As of May 27, 2015, the United States had flown approximately 15,600 strike-sorties resulting in approximately 4,198 strikes, said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a spokeswoman with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. That works out to 27 percent -- slightly higher than the data McCain had, but close enough for our purposes. Pentagon officials told PolitiFact that there was nothing unusual or surprising about that ratio. ""The fact that aircraft go on missions and don't strike anything is not out of the norm,"" said Air Force Capt. Andrew ""Ender"" Caulk of Air Forces Central Command Public Affairs. Despite U.S. strikes being ""the most precise in the history of warfare,"" Caulk said, ""conducting strike operations in the heavily populated areas where DAESH hides presents challenges. We are fighting an enemy who goes out of their way to put civilians at risk. However, the vast majority of pilots understand the need for the tactical patience in this environment. This fight against DAESH is not the kind of fight from previous decades."" Caulk added that if the United States engaged ""the way some of these 'critics' want us to, we would be operating in violation of agreements established between the coalition nations and Iraq and putting civilians and Iraqi forces at greater risk. The bottom line: We will not stoop to the level of our enemy and put civilians more in harm's way than absolutely necessary."" Our ruling McCain said that if you count United States airstrikes against ISIS, ""75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon."" Statistics from the Pentagon back that up. We won’t wade into the debate over whether the current approach is right or needs adjusting, but on the specific data point McCain mentioned, we find no fault.

Made-up Ted Cruz quotation has Texan comparing child molesting and gay relations
","Readers brought to our attention a Facebook meme suggesting U.S. Sen.

We were skeptical, in part because we’ve found no factual bases for similar web posts attempting to link Cruz to especially provocative statements. Pants on Fire ratings were bestowed in March and April 2015 to two outlandish posts about Cruz.. Now comes this May 2015 Facebook post showing a smiling Cruz next to Josh Duggar, who resigned from the conservative Family Research Council May 21, 2015. Duggar's resignation came after reports surfaced that at the age of 14, he had allegedly sexually assaulted four female siblings in his large family, plus an additional female victim. According to U.S. News and World Report, Duggar’s family confirmed the allegations via an apology on their Facebook page, downplaying the multiple incidents as ""very bad mistakes."" For those of us bereft o' cable TV: Josh Duggar is among the children in the Duggar family of Arkansas who are stars of the TLC show ""19 Kids and Counting."" The Facebook post says that the day after Duggar quit the council, Cruz said: ""While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar’s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other.""

Glenn Beck says Hillary Clinton makes more at one speech than average CEO in a year
","Conservative pundits are calling out Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for reeling in hefty speaking fees when she left the State Department, saying the big checks belie her message of addressing income inequality as she runs for the White House. ""Let’s remember one thing about this woman of the people,"" conservative radio host Glenn Beck said on his May 13 show. ""She knows a few things about making money. She makes more per hour at a speaking gig than the average CEO does in a year. Let me say that again: She makes more at a speaking gig in an hour than the average CEO does in a year. But let’s have her lecture us about those out of control CEO salaries."" A reader wanted to know if that was true. The Clinton presidential campaign did not comment for this fact-check. A spokesperson for Beck could also not be reached. Clinton’s pay Since leaving her post as secretary of state in 2013, Clinton has earned millions of dollars from giving talks at universities, corporations and industry groups. So has her husband. The Clinton Foundation recently disclosed speaking engagements by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton that brought in between $12 million and $26 million for the foundation. The foundation counts 16 Hillary Clinton speeches without giving specific amounts, including nine in the range of $250,001-$500,000 and seven within $100,001-$250,000. Those fees go to the foundation. What about fees that go to the Clintons themselves? Hillary Clinton’s 2015 financial disclosure provides more specific information about 51 additional speeches in 2014 and 2015. The honorariums varied in amount, so here are some examples: On the lower end of the scale, Salesforce.com paid $125,000, the California Medical Association paid $100,000, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce paid $150,000. On the high end, Biotechnology Industry Organization and Qualcomm paid $335,000, eBay paid $315,000, and Cisco paid $325,000. More typical were honorariums around $225,000, such as from speeches to a Silicon Valley conference for women, Commercial Real Estate Women Network, SalesForce.com, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, Ameriprise and the National Council for Behavioral Healthcare, among others. With that background in mind, let’s compare her speaking fees to the average pay of CEOs. CEO pay There are a few ways of talking about CEO pay, and it comes down to how you define the average CEO. Workers with that job description can make anywhere from five to nine figures. Beck might be referencing a widely shared Washington Examiner story that compared Clinton’s ""reported premium speaking fee of $300,000 per speech"" to the earnings of the country’s top 10 highest-paid CEOs (as reported by Forbes). The Examiner broke down the CEOs’ total compensation by a federal standard of 2,080 yearly work-hours. The result: If you broke down CEO pay by the hour, they would earn $54,213 compared to Clinton’s $300,000 speaking fee (which is on the high side of what we found). The Examiner also points out that, realistically speaking, it takes more than an hour to make a speech happen — there’s also speech prep, travel, and time for meals and rest to consider, too. However, Beck’s statement did not include the hourly nuance at all. He simply compared one Clinton speech to the annual income of a CEO. By one measure from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, Beck is way, way off. The think tank found that CEOs of the country’s top 350 firms received average compensation of $15.2 million in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. The EPI researchers used data from Compustat, which pulls in chief executive salaries from publicly held companies as reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s several zeroes away from Clinton’s average $225,000 speech in 2014 and 2015. The AFL-CIO compiled a list of the 100 highest-paid CEOs in 2014. No. 100 was Dr. Leonard Bell of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, who earned $20 million. Naturally, the income of the average CEO decreases as you expand the definition of who is a CEO. Economist Mark Perry of the conservative American Enterprise Institute critiques the EPI methodology for neglecting CEO salaries on the lower end of the spectrum.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies 246,240 people by the title of ""chief executive."" Looking at that group, as of May 2014, the average wages was $180,700. For the more than 21,000 employees within that group who work as managers of companies and enterprises, average annual pay was about $216,100. While those figures are less than the typical Clinton speaking fee, they’re an incomplete picture of what people who classify themselves as chief executives make. For one, as our colleagues FactCheck.org pointed out, the BLS data does not factor in stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically round out a CEO’s total compensation. Several reports back up that salary comprises at least less than half of total compensation for many CEOs.  For instance, salary made up just 10 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2012, according to an Associated Press analysis of about 320 companies. A survey of 50 big-company CEOs for the Wall Street Journal found cash pay made up about 37 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2014. Expanding the pool, Equilar determined that of the S&P 1500 CEOs, 20.8 percent of the pay mix in 2014 was for salary. Also, the BLS averages include chief executives in Puerto Rico, as well as those who work in the public sector at schools and in government that might not fit the classic CEO definition. (Those groups, by the way, all see below-average wages, according to BLS.) Plus, counting every CEO’s pay overlooks that the vast majority employ few workers, said Lawrence Mishel, Economic Policy Institute president and an economist who worked on the executive pay research. ""That’s cute but highly misleading,"" Mishel said of Perry’s criticism, ""because it doesn’t reflect that the average worker works for a large firm, and the average CEO works for a very small firm."" The CEOs of small- to mid-sized businesses also often own large chunks of their businesses that can be sold as capital gains or passed down to heirs, which would not be counted as compensation, said Kevin Murphy, University of Southern California finance professor. The debate about who counts as a typical CEO could also be applied to the worlds of professional athletes, musicians and actors. ""The fact is that, in many occupations with ‘superstars,’ the distribution of pay is highly skewed in the sense that the pay for the top earners may be many multiples of the pay for the median person in that occupation,"" Murphy said. ""Perhaps it’s best for us to always qualify ‘CEO’ with ‘Superstar CEO’ or ‘S&P 500 CEO’ to avoid confusion."" Our ruling Beck said Hillary Clinton ""makes more at a speaking gig in an hour than the average CEO does in a year,"" in the context of Clinton criticizing ""out of control CEO salaries."" This is an example of imperfect data. What’s clear is Clinton earned north of $200,000 for a typical paid appearance. But what’s complicated is comparing that one-off event to what a CEO makes in a year. Looking at CEOs of large companies, Beck’s claim completely falls apart. The data that puts Beck’s claim in the best light, from BLS, is incomplete. It doesn’t include stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically make up an executive’s compensation package. Nor does it account for CEOs of small and medium-sized business who have ownership stakes. At the same time, it includes people classified as chief executives in the public sector, as well as in Puerto Rico — groups that drag the average salary down. Beck's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says Florida was the only state to get AAA bond rating during his tenure
","Not-quite-yet Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush continues to sell potential voters on his eight years as Florida’s governor. ""Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating),"" Bush told business leaders in Portsmouth, N.H., on May 20, 2015. He added the change followed years of increasing the state’s cash reserves from $1 billion to $10 billion. A state getting its bond rating upgraded is a relatively rare occurrence, so we wondered whether Florida was the only state to jump to a top rating while Bush was in office from 1999-2006. Getting an upgrade   For this analysis, we’re focusing on the state’s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state’s ability to pay its debts. This rating, which is kind of like a person’s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Each reports their ratings differently, but Bush’s Right to Rise political action committee spokesman Matt Gorman told us he was referring specifically to the S&P analysis. Gorman shared a Pew Charitable Trusts infographic that showed ""S&P state credit ratings"" from 2001 to 2014. The infographic shows that Florida was the only state between 2001 and 2006 to make the ratings leap Bush specified (AA to AAA). On Feb. 25, 2005, S&P upgraded Florida’s general obligation bond rating from AA+ (which is slightly higher than their AA rating, actually) to AAA. The difference is in rating the state’s capacity to meet its debt obligations from ""very strong"" to ""extremely strong,"" according to agency guidelines. For the record, Moody’s and Fitch also upgraded the state that year, but their ratings are designated differently. S&P’s report on the upgrade said the decision was ""based on the state's strong and conservative financial and budget management practices, coupled with substantial budget reserves and economic trends that have been among the strongest nationally."" The report also cited stable state revenue, a moderate debt burden and a service-based economy that was growing faster than the national average as among other reasons for the upgrade. S&P’s analysis said Florida’s outlook was stable due to ""the state's strong budget reserves and demonstrated track record of active budget management and long-term planning and forecasting."" Bush wants to take credit for this budget management, and he could lay some claim to the idea. He was well-known during his tenure for regularly using the line-item veto to discard hundreds of millions in spending on budgeted projects Bush deemed wasteful or that didn’t follow his agenda. Taking the red pen to the Legislature’s final budgets helped build the state’s cash reserves from $1.3 billion to $9.8 billion by 2006, so Bush’s numbers there are pretty accurate. The Legislature actively socked cash away in state coffers during this time. So, yes, Florida was the only state to make the jump looking at data between 2001 and 2014. But there’s one problem: Bush became governor in 1999. Those two years make a big difference. We asked S&P for its history of state ratings and found two instances that counter Bush’s claim: On Feb. 22, 2000, S&P upgraded Delaware from AA+ to AAA. On Sept. 27, 2000, the agency did the same for Michigan. (It was downgraded back to AA+ in 2003.) Florida, for the record, still enjoys the AAA rating it earned in 2005, with an outlook S&P now considers stable. Our ruling Bush said, ""Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating)."" Florida’s general obligation bond rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services in 2005. But both Delaware and Michigan were upgraded from AA+ to AAA by the S&P in 2000, which was during Bush’s second year in office. The information Bush’s PAC cited did not include his first two years in office. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2015/may/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-was-only-state-get-aaa-bond-/

Did Rand Paul equate a right to health care with slavery?
","Comedian Sarah Silverman’s liberal leanings are almost as well-known as her raunchy style. Her 2008 pro-Barack Obama video ""The Great Schlep"" attracted 2.2 million views on YouTube; a follow-up from 2012 attracted another 1.1 million views.  Recently, a reader forwarded us this shareable meme from Silverman’s feed at WhoSay, a social media site, that’s critical of presidential candidate and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The meme -- which Silverman had passed along from the Twitter account of actor Michael Sheen -- shows Paul seated at a congressional hearing. The meme purports to quote Paul equating the right to health care with slavery.  What do the facts say? We were able to track down the source of the comments. They stem from a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions subcommittee hearing on May 11, 2011. Paul’s unusual comparison attracted a flurry of media attention at the time, as well as sniping by Paul’s critics. The meme shortened Paul’s comments to fit the available space, but the abridgement doesn’t strike us as twisting the gist of his comments. Here’s the full excerpt: ""With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have to realize what that implies. It’s not an abstraction. I’m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. It means that you’re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses. ""Basically, once you imply a belief in a right to someone’s services, do you have a right to plumbing? Do you have a right to water? Do you have right to food? You’re basically saying you believe in slavery. You’re saying you believe in taking and extracting from another person. Our founding documents were very clear about this. You have a right to pursue happiness but there’s no guarantee of physical comfort. There’s no guarantee of concrete items. In order to give something concrete, you have to take it from someone. So there’s an implied threat of force. ""If I’m a physician in your community and you say you have a right to health care, do you have a right to beat down my door with the police, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That’s ultimately what the right to free health care would be. If you believe in a right to health care, you’re believing in basically the use of force to conscript someone to do your bidding."" A few days after the speech, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a free-market group, posted a longer version of Paul’s speech on YouTube, suggesting that the next 30 seconds or so provided more nuance to Paul’s comments and had been overlooked by commentators. Here is the additional comment: ""Now just because it's a noble thing to believe that we are obligated as Christians, we are obligated to the Hippocratic Oath, we have always done this. Since the beginning of modern medicine we have always provided 100 percent access. I do it in exchange for privileges. I do it because I believe in the Hippocratic Oath. But my hospital also says to me you can only operate in this hospital if you agree to see everyone coming through the emergency room. I always have. People have always had 100 percent access to our emergency room. Those are for emergencies -- those are not the best place for primary care."" We don’t think Paul’s subsequent comments greatly change what he said earlier, since he’s saying he’s consenting to the servitude of treating non-paying patients as a condition of being allowed to practice at certain hospitals. In this comment, he still sees it as a burden to be borne. In addition, Paul says he’s referring to emergency-room care, not to primary care. Primary care was the point of getting uninsured Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act, so they wouldn’t have to resort to going to emergency rooms for basic services. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- who, as it happens, is also running for president in 2016 -- used his perch as the chairman of the subcommittee to ask a witness, physician Dana Kraus, whether she felt like a ""slave"" working at her federally qualified health center. ""I love my job,"" she responded. ""I do not feel like a slave."" Even Matt Welch, the editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, had harsh words for Paul, who has long been identified with the libertarian movement. ""Could slaves free themselves by changing professions?"" Welch wrote. ""Do doctors in Switzerland get taken away at gunpoint? To treat the analogy with technical seriousness, even setting aside (as if you could) the colossal weight of America's most lasting shame, is to render it ridiculous, in my opinion."" We could not find an instance of Paul addressing these comments further, and Paul’s staff didn’t respond to a pair of inquiries. Our ruling Silverman forwarded a social media meme that said Paul has stated that supporting the ""right to health care … means you believe in slavery."" The meme has been abridged from the full quote, but we see no significant change in his meaning. We also found no evidence that Paul had backtracked on the views he expressed. We rate the meme’s claim True.",/factchecks/2015/may/27/sarah-silverman/did-rand-paul-equate-right-health-care-slavery/

Gina Hinojosa says Austin teachers ""lowest paid"" of any urban Texas district and any district nearby
","In May 2015, the president of Austin’s school board urged state lawmakers to put billions of additional dollars into school aid. The money should flow to teacher pay, Gina Hinojosa said, adding that teachers in the Austin district have lower salaries than peers elsewhere. Specifically, Hinojosa told Austin American-Statesman reporter Kiah Collier: ""Currently our teachers are the lowest paid of any urban, lowest paid of any surrounding school district and we believe that's unacceptable."" The lowest among whom? ""Amongst all urban districts in the state and amongst surrounding Central Texas school districts,"" Hinojosa said. Is all of that so? To our inquiry, Hinojosa said she drew on information gathered by the district. District spokesman Reyne Telles then said by email the comparisons appeared in charts (see them here) showing the salaries of teachers with bachelor’s degrees at different years of experience drawn from information posted online by districts. Telles said the district is ""confident in the numbers,"" which were part of a January 2015 staff presentation to the board. Left out of the comparison: Some 1,675 local teachers with master’s or doctoral degrees who, a district chart indicates, accounted for 29 percent of the district’s 5,842 teachers in 2014-15. By email, a district official, Michael Houser, said the teachers with advanced degrees earned $862 more than other Austin teachers. He said he believes that stipend trailed comparable payments made by the district’s Texas competitors. At any rate, the presentation that Hinojosa relied on shows some Austin teachers making more than Austin-area peers in 2014-15. But the bulk, more than six in 10 by our calculation, had salaries less than what was paid teachers nearby and in selected urban districts around the state. Houser told us by phone the district did not compare salaries in all urban districts, focusing instead on those other districts where it’s had recruiting success. Similarly, Houser said, the district did not check salaries in every nearby district, focusing on ""our most immediate competition."" The district’s charts show: --In 2014-15, Austin teachers with five through 30 years of experience were paid less than nearby peers in nearly every instance. Also, those teachers made less than nearly all peers in eight selected urban Texas districts: Cypress-Fairbanks (Harris County), Dallas, El Paso, Fort Bend, Fort Worth, Houston, Northside (Bexar County) and San Antonio. Austin teachers trailed the average pay for teachers in the other districts by $4,422 (for teachers with no experience) to $7,687 (teacher with 10 years’ experience). --In contrast, beginning and very experienced Austin teachers mostly drew more in pay than peers in the nine nearby districts: Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville, Round Rock and San Marcos. That is, Austin teachers with no experience were paid $44,046, which exceeded the salary of comparable teachers in each of the nearby districts by a minimum of $546 up to $2,046. The nearby districts paid teachers with no experience an average of $42,810. --Austin teachers with 35 years of experience earned $3,595 to $6,104 more than teachers in four of the nearby districts though up to $3,605 less than comparable teachers in the five other Austin-area districts. Austin’s $56,595 salary for such teachers ran $1,406 ahead of the average $58,189 pay for such teachers in the nearby districts. Social Security A wrinkle: The district’s charts did not account for money it pays toward Social Security benefits for employees. By phone, Houser told us that’s because what once seemed a recruiting advantage—the district making contributions for Social Security and for pensions through the Teacher Retirement System of Texas—has become an albatross; teachers, Houser said, would prefer to get the district’s Social Security contributions in take-home pay. District spokesman Jacob Barrett said the Austin district is among 47 statewide that long ago committed to backing both benefits. Houser said that if Social Security contributions are folded into the comparisons, Austin’s teachers received more in compensation in 2014-15 than peers in the nearby districts. But Austin’s teachers still saw less compensation than counterparts in the urban districts the district considers peers, he said. We checked this by counting as income the district’s Social Security contributions, 6.2 percent of each employee’s gross pay. After these adjustments, Austin’s teacher salaries at every experience level exceeded the average for the nine nearby districts, with the Austin advantage ranging from $324 a year (for teachers with 25 years’ experience) to $5,101 (teachers with 35 years’ experience). But, as Houser said, counting the contributions as income did not propel Austin’s teachers at any experience level to higher pay than the average salaries of peers in the urban districts Austin uses for comparisons. An unknown: Whether Austin teachers will uniformly participate in Social Security long enough to reap full benefits on retirement. Health insurance We also asked if the Austin district compared health insurance benefits by district. By email, Houser pointed out a chart in the board presentation indicating Austin’s payments of $446.25 a month to cover employee health insurance premiums in 2014-15 were more than what nearly every nearby peer district spent; the Lake Travis district expended $537 a worker. The Austin district’s spending also outpaced expenditures for premiums in most of the urban districts selected as peers; the Houston district was paying $500. Austin generally pays more, Houser indicated, to fund a health plan offering more benefits than, say, the TRS-backed plan for which districts in 2014-15 were paying $325 monthly for employee premiums. Other pay analyses Other pay analyses bore out what we saw in the Austin district’s information. For instance, we asked the Texas Education Agency for its best data on teacher salaries within each district; spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency website where we punched in district names to reach average base salaries for teachers in 2014-15 (not counting Social Security contributions). By this gauge, the Austin district’s average base teacher salary of $47,476 trailed average base teacher salaries in all but one of the nine nearby districts; the Manor district’s average base teacher salary was $46,093. Our searches indicated Austin’s average base teacher salary was less than the average base teacher salary in a dozen other urban districts. We looked at the Arlington, North East (Bexar County), Socorro and Ysleta districts in addition to the urban districts shown in the Austin district’s charts. TEA considers these added districts, like the Austin district and others, to be ""major urban"" districts. A district falls into this category if it’s located in a county with a population of at least 840,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged. For another take, we turned to the Texas Association of School Boards, which annually surveys districts on salaries. Spokesman Dax Gonzalez emailed us its findings for 2014-15--and the results, also not folding in Social Security contributions, aligned with the Austin district’s charts in that the least experienced and most experienced Austin teachers had higher salaries than peers in nearby districts--but other teachers trailed. Compared to teachers in the major urban districts that the TEA groups with the Austin district, Austin teachers had lower salaries at all experience levels. In the end, Hinojosa didn’t dispute the range of our findings. Still, she said, ""we have a real problem in this district paying our employees enough."" Our ruling Hinojosa said Austin school district ""teachers are the lowest paid of any urban"" Texas district and the ""lowest paid of any surrounding school district."" Hinojosa relied on research not extending to all urban or all nearby districts nor did it roll in teachers with advanced degrees. Those gaps aside, the pay contrasts aren’t entirely clear-cut. Inexperienced and very experienced Austin teachers were paid more in 2014-15 than peers in some or most nearby districts and if you count Social Security contributions, Austin teachers in general were compensated better on average than teachers in nearby districts. On the other hand, all Austin district teachers were paid less than counterparts in comparable urban districts across the state--even after taking into account Social Security contributions. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Did Marco Rubio say felons should be barred from voting but should get their guns back?
","A Facebook meme suggests that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes convicted felons should regain their right to own a gun but not the right to vote. The meme, sent to us by a reader, presents two quotes purportedly by Rubio. The first, dated March 16, is, ""No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence."" The second quote, from May 6, says, ""Of course, convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time. It is their constitutional right."" The claim was attributed to the Facebook community group ""Stop the world, the teabaggers want off."" We’ll note right off the bat that the group’s Facebook page cops to being a primarily satirical site. It says, ""This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages."" Still, casual Facebook users are unlikely to see this bit of context and could easily take the quotes in the meme at face value, so we’ll check the substance of the meme anyway. We searched Nexis and Google for the quotes and did not find any instances in which Rubio said those words. (We contacted spokespersons for Rubio and did not get a response. We also tried to contact the ""Teabaggers"" group via Twitter and Facebook but did not hear back.) Felons and voting rights States have the power to decide how -- or whether -- to restore the rights of felons to vote once they have served their time. (Maine and Vermont allow felons to vote while in prison.) In Florida in 2007 under then-Gov. Charlie Crist, the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. The Cabinet set rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back, including the requirement that they had to finish their sentences. At the time, Rubio was the speaker of the House, but since the Cabinet set the rules, the Legislature had no official role. When Rubio ran against Crist for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010, he attacked his record on restoration of voting rights. In 2009, Rubio said on Morning Joe that Crist ""restored the rights of felons to vote automatically here in Florida."" The following year, Rubio said Crist ""worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida."" (ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group advocated for increased voter access, but there was no proof that Crist worked with ACORN on his plan to restore voting rights to felons, so we rated that claim False.) In both instances, Rubio clearly sounded like he was criticizing Crist. It’s not a big leap to think that he is personally against allowing felons to regain their right to vote, but his words fall short of making that clear. The issue of restoring voting rights to certain felons has come up in the U.S. Senate the past two years but it hasn’t received a vote, so we don’t know Rubio’s position on it. The Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 would allow citizens to vote in any federal election even if they had been convicted of a non-violent criminal offense unless the individual was in jail or on probation. The bipartisan duo of Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate from Kentucky, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, are the measure’s co-sponsors. Last year, Paul co-sponsored a similar bill with U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida. Paul, who has made efforts to court black voters, has said that stripping voting rights from felons is a form of voter suppression and has disproportionately harmed black voters. Felons and gun ownership Under federal law, individuals with felony convictions lose their right to own guns, but states can restore these rights, a 2011 New York Times investigation found. In some states, felons can only regain their right to bear arms if they are pardoned, while others allow certain felons to regain their rights after five to 20 years. In Florida, felons are eligible to apply eight years after the completion of their sentence. But we could not find any statements in which Rubio directly talked about whether convicted felons should be able to regain their right to own a gun. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Rubio said that ""felons should not have their voting rights restored"" but that ""convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time."" The meme was posted by a site that describes itself as satirical, and we found no evidence that Rubio actually said the words attributed to him. While Rubio has spoken critically in the past about felons regaining voting rights, he does not appear to have taken a stance on the restoration of felons’ gun rights. Rubio didn’t say these words, so we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/may/27/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-says-marco-rubio-wants-restore-gun-r/

Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare, Ron Johnson says
","Shortly after Democrat Russ Feingold announced he would challenge U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016, setting up a rematch from six years earlier, Johnson outlined how he would define the former three-term senator. Feingold is a builder of big government, a career politician and a Washington insider, Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an article published May 19, 2015. And the first-term Republican pledged: ""I’ll point out Sen. Feingold was the deciding vote on Obamacare. That’s not working out so good for Wisconsinites."" The deciding vote on Obamacare? The same claim has been made against a number of other Democratic senators over the past five years. Our colleagues have checked five of them -- four were rated Mostly False and one False. But does the claim apply to Feingold? The vote All of the claims center on the penultimate vote in the Senate to approve President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The vote, taken Dec. 23, 2009, was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the health care reform bill itself could proceed. Without that move to prevent Republican filibusters, a final vote on the bill would have been blocked. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes -- and the Democrats got exactly 60. All 58 Democratic senators, including Feingold, along with two independents voted yes. The next day,the Senate passed Obamacare. Obama signed the measure into law in March 2010. Johnson's spokeswoman, Melinda Schnell, argued to us in an email that all 60 votes for cloture were decisive, because any one of the senators ""could have, on her or his own, stopped the measure by voting otherwise."" Yes. But Johnson's claim is that Feingold cast the deciding vote, not one of 60 votes. So was there a single deciding senator? Arguably yes, but not Feingold. Four days before the cloture vote was held, Senate Democrats announced they had clinched the 60th vote they needed by reaching a compromise with Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, who had concerns about abortion-related provisions in the bill. Nelson even appeared at a news conference to explain his position. Earlier in the process, according to a detailed recounting by the Los Angeles Times, reluctant Democratic Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, as well as Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, were persuaded to vote yes. In contrast, based on accounts in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times and the Boston Globe -- there is no mention that Feingold's vote for cloture was ever in doubt. And Johnson didn’t cite any evidence that it was. A footnote before we close: A week before the Obamacare cloture vote, Feingold played a pivotal role on a different cloture vote. Republicans threatened to filibuster an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the Obamacare measure. To get around that, according to the Los Angeles Times, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had to convince Feingold -- an opponent of the defense bill -- not to join the Republican blockade. Feingold agreed to vote with his party. The effect was to advance the health care bill. Our rating Johnson said Feingold ""was the deciding vote on Obamacare."" There is an element of truth in Johnson's claim. Obamacare backers needed 60 yes votes on a crucial vote in the Senate that paved the way for final Senate passage of the health care reform bill. Feingold cast one of those votes.   But to call it the deciding vote is misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt. We rate Johnson's statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2015/may/27/ron-johnson/russ-feingold-cast-deciding-vote-pave-way-obamacar/

Report: Georgia 49 in women in state, federal elected offices
","In 2015, most major political officeholders in the U.S. -- including about 80 percent of the members of Congress and about 75 percent of the nation’s state lawmakers -- are men, a new report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research shows. The institute ranks Georgia 49th among the 50 states for women serving in elected state and federal offices in 2015, citing its all-male congressional delegation, its 77 percent-male state Legislature and its lack of any women in statewide elected office. PolitiFact Georgia decided to look closer at the numbers. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a Washington-based nonprofit, tracks issues considered pertinent to women’s lives, including political participation, employment and earnings, work and family, poverty and opportunity, reproductive rights, health and well-being, and violence and safety. On the political front, the group follows several trends, including women serving in elected office. The new report shows upticks nationally between 2004 and 2015 in both the number and share of women serving in state legislatures, the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, but declines in the number and share of women holding statewide elective office. Nationally, as of March, women held 104 of 535 (19.4 percent) seats in the U.S. Congress, 1,786 of 7,383 (24.2 percent) seats in state legislatures and 78 of 317 (24.6 percent) statewide elective executive offices, the report states. In Georgia, 54 women are serving in the 236-member state Legislature this year, the researchers reported. But they found the state had no women in the U.S. House, U.S. Senate or in statewide elected office. Only Louisiana rated lower than Georgia, with women making up 10.3 percent of its state Senate and 13.3 percent of the state House but holding no seats in Congress and no statewide offices.  New Hampshire is No. 1 for 2015, up from 42nd place in 2004, with three of its four congressional seats held by women. The state has a female governor, and women fill about one-third of the state’s House and Senate seats, according to the institute.  We checked the institute’s data against information on female legislators available at the website of the National Council of State Legislatures. The NCSL reported 1,782 female legislators, nationally, and 53 in Georgia, numbers just slightly different, as of February, from the institute’s totals. The NCSL pointed out that the data were subject to change due to resignations, appointments and special elections. The National Women’s Political Caucus reported the number of women serving in state legislatures in 2013 was 1,779, essentially what it is today. The institute’s report notes that women haven’t made the gains in elected offices in recent years that they did in the past couple of decades. It points out that, in the six years from 2009 to 2015, the female members of Congress grew only minimally, from 16.8 percent to 19.4 percent. There are various theories on why more women aren’t officeholders. Some research suggests that women generally win elected office at similar rates as men but fewer women run for office. Veteran state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said politics is frequently a rough business and one where ""men assume they are qualified and ready to be elected or appointed, women are more hesitant to take the leap."" But when they are willing to serve and willing to compete for opportunities to lead, as well as  just to be there, women can do really well, Oliver said. ""They can be a moderating influence. They are more collaborative and they can be better at  identifying a variety of issues that affect real people, and that’s true of both Democratic and Republican women,"" she said. State Rep. Debbie Buckner, a Democrat from Junction City, said she believes the House lost more than the normal number of female lawmakers after redistricting. ""Maybe it is ‘Southern’ manners or disdain for conflict, but there were some who chose not to run against their colleagues,"" said Buckner, who was first elected to the House in 2002. She said it is difficult for a woman to serve in the Legislature when it means juggling family, job, campaigning, fundraising, constituent concerns and legislative duties that include preparing for committee meetings and floor debates. ""My first year of service my daughter was only six,"" Buckner said. ""I was asked repeatedly: ‘Don't you worry about her? How can you leave her? Or how do how do you do this with such a young child at home?’ … I have often wondered how many male legislators were asked any of those questions."" Buckner said she believes ""intelligent and thoughtful women add much to the process."" ""Their perspective is more broad and encompassing and many times more collaborative,"" she said. Our conclusion: A new report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research says Georgia is 49th among the 50 states for women serving in elected state and federal offices. It cites the state’s all-male congressional delegation, its 77 percent-male Legislature and its lack of any women in statewide elected office. Other sources report similar data. We rate the statement as True.  ",/factchecks/2015/may/27/institute-womens-policy-research/report-georgia-49-women-state-federal-elected-offi/

Commonwealth Institute says most Va. corporations don't pay state income taxes
","A liberal think tank says corporations aren’t paying their fair share into Virginia’s treasury. ""At last count, roughly two-thirds of corporations didn’t pay any income tax in Virginia despite this being a time of record high corporate profits,"" the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis wrote in an April 30 blog. ""That’s due in large part to the teams of accountants they deploy to exploit special tax breaks and reduce or eliminate what they owe."" Virginia’s corporate tax rate has been set at 6 percent since it was created in 1972. During the tax year that ended last June 30, it pumped $757.5 million into state coffers. While that may sound like a big number, the corporate income tax is a distant third in making money for the state. The largest source of revenue comes from individual income taxes, which garnered $11.2 billion during fiscal 2014, followed by sales taxes, which brought in about $3.1 billion. We wondered if it’s true that two-thirds of the corporations doing business in the commonwealth don’t pay income taxes. Commonwealth Institute spokesman Patrick Getlein pointed us to figures compiled by the Virginia Department of Taxation for tax returns filed for 2012, the most recent year data are available. The report shows, on page 25, that of 66,862 corporate income tax filers in the state, 43,481 had no liability.   That means 65 percent of corporate filers didn’t put a penny of income tax into the state treasury, as the Commonwealth Institute said. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission came with similar figures in a 2010 report on Virginia’s corporate tax system that examined 2006 filings. It found that ""nearly two-thirds of corporate filers appear to have no tax liability at all."" Of 74,665 corporate filers that year, 46,406 didn’t owe any income tax. All of these corporate tax figures come with caveats, however. Dormancy JLARC found that nearly 30 percent of the non-paying filers in 2006 -- 13,147 corporations -- didn’t owe income taxes because they had no financial activity in the state that year. Corporations that close in Virginia are still required to file tax statements for a period of years. When ""inactive"" corporations were removed from the equation, JLARC found there were 33,259 ""active"" corporations that paid no income tax in 2006, or about 44 percent of all the businesses that filed.   Those companies may have been profitable from a business perspective, JLARC said, but were able to report a loss from a tax perspective by claiming deductions. Neither JLARC nor the Department of Taxation has an updated estimate of the number of inactive corporations in Virginia. Different types of corporations Virginia only levies its corporate income tax on ""C corporations"" -- businesses in which the entity, not the owners, pay the taxes. The state doesn’t apply the tax to certain types of C corporations such as banks and insurance companies, but gets money from them in other ways. Banks, for example, pay a franchise tax and insurance companies pay a premiums tax. Fewer than 10 percent of businesses in Virginia are C corporations, according to JLARC figures. The vast remainder are ""pass-through"" entities in which the business doesn’t pay taxes , the owners and shareholders do. This includes S corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. Biggest pay bulk The lion’s share of corporate income taxes is paid are paid by a relatively small group of highly profitable multistate businesses, JLARC said. In 2006, nearly two-thirds of corporate tax revenues was generated by 200 large companies with annual incomes exceeding $10 million, the watchdog group found. On the other hand, 93 percent of corporate filers earned less than $100,000 and they paid only 5 percent of the tax’s total revenues. Other taxes Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank, said we should keep in mind that corporations are subject to other levies beyond income taxes. For example, they can owe state sales taxes on items they buy for their business, and local taxes on their property and gross business receipts. ""Corporate tax income is only one part of the overall tax burden on business, and often a relatively modest share of corporate tax liability,"" said Walczak, a former aide to state Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg. A final note: We couldn’t find data breakdown showing the percent of corporations in each state that don’t pay income taxes. On a national level, the Government Accountability Office said in a 2008 report that 60-70 percent of U.S. corporations had no tax liability from 1998 through 2005. Our ruling The Commonwealth Institute said ""At last count, roughly two-thirds of corporations didn’t pay any income tax."" It’s correct that two-thirds of corporate filers wound up owing zero income tax, according to the most recent report on the issue by the state Department of Taxation and another by JLARC. Many profitable companies can avoid the levy by claiming deductions. But the institute leaves out information. Many corporations don’t pay because they’ve stopped operating in the state, yet are still required by law to file a return.  JLARC, after weeding out those businesses in 2010, found that 44 percent of active corporations didn’t pay income tax. We rate its claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/may/27/commonwealth-institute/commonwealth-institute-says-most-va-corporations-d/
"['State Budget', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
The saga of state spending enforcer Jeb Bush's one-time alias, Veto Corleone
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush has resurrected an infamous moniker from his days in Tallahassee on the campaign trail in an attempt to show he is the godfather of fiscal conservatism. During a meeting with business leaders in Portsmouth, N.H., on May 20, 2015, Bush pointed out he was well-known for using the line-item veto at his disposal as governor. ""They called me Veto Corleone, which was something I was quite proud of,"" Bush said, citing a reference to Marlon Brando’s character in The Godfather. He added that he vetoed 2,500 separate line items totaling $2 billion over his eight years. Bush has brought out that anecdote several times during the run-up to a presidential campaign, implying he would again focus on cutting wasteful spending. We wondered if he was accurate in claiming that nickname. We made our own inquiries and found that yes, pork projects really did sleep with the fishes. Offers he could refuse Bush came into office in 1999 vowing to use his line-item veto on state spending he didn’t like, and he followed through with a vengeance. He also wanted the state to focus on building reserves. That first year, he shocked lawmakers by slashing $313 million out of the $48.6 billion budget approved by the Legislature. It was more than double the previous veto record of $150 million set by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in 1988. The Senate was so angry about the cuts, they sued Bush over his partial veto of funding for an extended school year. The Florida Supreme Court eventually ruled Bush defied the state Constitution by cutting $16 million out of a $40 million appropriation to keep schools open longer. They said he either had to cut all of the program or none of it. Media reports said John Thrasher, then speaker of the House, dubbed Bush ""Veto Corleone"" after the fictional mafia don (spelled Vito Corleone) for his liberal use of the power. Thrasher, who is now president of Florida State University, confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that he coined the nickname, which seemed to be something of a friendly dig. Thrasher’s collegial relationship with Bush was apparent in 2000, when Thrasher brought the budget to Bush’s office while wearing a white lab coat and a stethoscope  ""to make sure the governor has a heart."" Bush answered by approving a couple of Thrasher’s pet projects, then chopping another $313.7 million out of appropriations. Here’s a look at how much Bush vetoed from each year’s budget: Year Total state budget Amount Bush vetoed 1999 $48.6 billion $313 million* 2000 $51 billion $313.7 million 2001 $48.3 billion $288.8 million 2002 $50.4 billion $107 million 2003 $53.5 billion $33 million 2004 $57.3 billion $349 million 2005 $64.7 billion $180 million 2006 $73.9 billion $448.7 million * The state Supreme Court ruled a $16 million veto in 1999 unconstitutional. The first year of Bush’s second term, in 2003, Bush cut a low of $33 million, but $7.2 million of that was funding for high-speed rail. Bush later led an effort to repeal a constitutional amendment requiring the creation of high-speed rail transit in the state. Bush also saved the most for last, hacking $448.7 million out of the 2006 budget, including a university tuition increase, spending on parks and police vehicles, as well as job training and education programs. That year state spending was up to $73.9 billion, a 52 percent increase from his first year in office. ""It's never easy,"" Bush said in 2006. ""You always hurt people's feelings. I don't enjoy that. And I'm always surprised that people are surprised. I've been consistent. There should be no surprises. And the people who really follow the budget knew that."" We should note that if Bush wins the presidency, he likely won’t get to whack as much. A president doesn’t have a line-item veto and has to either accept or reject an entire piece of legislation. Our ruling Bush said ""they called me Veto Corleone"" as governor for his frequent use of the line-item veto. He did have a fondness for ruthlessly slashing projects he deemed wasteful or not in line with his agenda. Thrasher confirmed he nicknamed the governor after the fictional mobster.

Scott Walker says $499 million 'structural surplus' is ahead
","The education funding cuts in Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed 2015-’17 budget rankled critics because at one point a nearly $1 billion surplus was projected for the start of that budget. Walker and fellow Republicans returned much of the surplus to taxpayers in 2014, and then slower-than-predicted growth in tax collections further boxed in the GOP entering the new budget cycle. Now, while campaigning for president, Walker eagerly touts his budget as fiscally responsible. He is even using the ""S"" word again -- surplus. ""At the end of the budget we're debating right now for our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million -- nearly a half-a-billion dollars on the structural side of things,"" Walker said in a May 9, 2015 speech at the South Carolina Freedom Summit in Greenville. Wait, his budget cuts education but it ends up in a surplus? All the claims and counterclaims about deficits and surpluses can get confusing. Let’s look more closely at this one. First, note the modifier ""structural"" in front of ""surplus."" That’s important. Walker is talking about a particular measure of a budget’s fiscal responsibility, one published regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It’s usually called the ""structural deficit"" or ""structural surplus,"" but even that name is misleading. The measure is not a prediction of whether the next budget will be in balance. By law it has to be. Rather, it is a tally of the size of the budget challenge lawmakers will face in the following budget (2017-’19) based on the spending and taxing decisions they are making in the upcoming one. Think of it as a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need to balance that 2017-’19 budget. It’s rough because the Fiscal Bureau doesn’t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs. But it gives lawmakers an idea of how decisions they are making might affect state finances going forward. The Fiscal Bureau examined Walker’s 2015-’17 budget plan and said it would create a positive balance of $300 million in year one of that 2017-19 budget and another $199 million in year two. This is the report that Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick cited to back up his claim. That adds up to $499 million, as Walker said. His own budget document published a similar number. Behind the numbers Much of the ""structural surplus"" traces to Walker’s proposed cut in aid for local school districts and to timing factors in the way Walker funds school tax credits, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. ""You generally run into structural problems when, in the second year of the budget, spending is greater than ongoing revenues,"" Knapp said. ""That is not the case in the governor’s proposal."" Another expert agreed with the numbers, but found fault with how Walker phrased the deficit number as a done deal, when it’s not through the Legislature yet. ""He assumes that the budget will pass exactly as he proposed it, and we all know that won’t happen,"" said Jon Peacock, head of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families’ Wisconsin Budget Project. ""Even the governor has been urging changes to the budget."" That’s a fair point; the budget is still in the sausage-making stage. Peacock raised a larger criticism of using the structural imbalance number as a measure of the state’s fiscal condition. Lawmakers and governors have learned how to game a once-useful tool, he said. For instance, Peacock said, Walker’s budget unrealistically assumes a popular form of school aids will disappear in the following two-year budget. Knapp, too, called the school aid change ""a bit of an accounting trick"" that seems designed only to inflate the size of the structural surplus. Our rating Walker said a sign of his restoring fiscal responsibility was that ""For our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million."" A reliable, independent source made that estimate, so the figure is solid. Walker, though, makes it sound like a done deal when the budget is still undergoing legislative review.
