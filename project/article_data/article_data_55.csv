Missouri’s aging bridges are a problem, but maybe not for the reasons you think
","The Missouri Department of Transportation’s chronic lack of funding isn’t very surprising anymore. Just last November, Missouri voters rejected Proposition D, which would have increased the state’s gas tax by 10 cents and used the funds to boost spending on roads and bridges. Without the additional funding, MoDOT counts on federal grant money to address infrastructure problems like the one posed by Missouri’s aging bridges. In his Aug. 29 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., announced that MoDOT will receive a $20.7 million federal grant for the state’s bridge replacement program. To highlight the significance of the challenges, Graves said, ""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old—most were only designed to last for 50 years."" The problem sounds severe and a little dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers hold up. To a degree, they do — Graves took the sentence from the MoDOT website. But that doesn’t mean it’s time to panic every time you drive over a bridge. MoDOT’s website confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years old. An average takes into account all bridges from newly built ones to those much older than 48 years. So how old are Missouri’s oldest bridges? We don’t know. State bridge engineer Dennis Heckman pointed out a lack of records before about 1900. About 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and might be even older. Heckman explained that design life doesn’t mean a bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. Intended design life is not a set expiration date. In reality, it’s more like a sell-by date that indicates when a bridge’s quality needs to be monitored more closely. ""When they reach that age, you’re going to be maintaining them a lot more, fixing them a lot more,"" Heckman said. ""They just become a lot more high maintenance."" There’s also some variation in the design life of Missouri’s bridges to take into account. For decades, Heckman said, a 50-year design life was standard, and about 8,000 of MoDOT’s 10,400 bridges have a design life of 50 years. In the past 10 to 15 years, designing bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; about 2,350 bridges were built to this standard. And longer, river-crossing bridges are built with a design life of 100 years. About 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design life category. In total, 6,000, or 60%, of Missouri’s bridges are past their intended design life, and Heckman said MoDOT’s ability to extend the lifespan of these bridges is unique to each bridge and its specific conditions. But bridge condition, not intended design life, is what determines MoDOT’s course of action. Federal law requires all publicly owned highway bridges over 20 feet long to be inspected about once every two years, and currently, 909 of the bridges MoDOT inspects are rated ""poor"" by federal National Bridge Inspection Standards. Poor is the worst rating a bridge can receive and remain open for use. Poor bridges result in weight limits that hinder economic development and reduce Missourians’ safety, Heckman said. ""Heavier trucks can’t use them. Farmers can’t use them when they’re hauling their grain or hogs to market. So you end up with a lot of detours."" He also said many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, firetruck, or ambulance. Most states strive to have only about 3% to 4% of their bridges ranked poor, Heckman said. Currently, 9% of Missouri’s bridges are poor. ""At our current funding levels, we’re basically treading water,"" said Bob Brendel, MoDOT’s special assignments coordinator. ""We’re basically repairing and replacing about as many bridges every year as fall into the poor category."" Graves said, ""The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old — most were only designed to last for 50 years."" This statement comes directly from MoDOT’s data on state bridges, but it needs a bit of clarification. Most bridges don’t need to be replaced when they turn 50. That’s when engineers could expect them to need more maintenance. Condition, not design life, determines the death of a bridge. With that additional information, we rate the claim Mostly True",/factchecks/2019/oct/02/sam-graves/missouris-aging-bridges-are-problem-maybe-not-reas/

Did Donald Trump win West Virginia by 42 points in 2016?
","At a rally in neighboring southwestern Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump trumpeted his wide 2016 presidential election victory in West Virginia. ""I won that one by 42 points -- 42 points -- West Virginia,"" Trump said during his Aug. 13 speech in Monaca, Pa.  That would be a big win. Was his victory in the Mountaineer State that large?  The Trump campaign pointed us to the official results on the website of the West Virginia Secretary of State, which showed that Trump won West Virginia with 68.63%, outpacing his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, with 26.48%. The difference is 42.15 percentage points -- right in tune with what Trump said. West Virginia accounted for Trump’s second-widest margin of victory of any state, following Wyoming at 46.29%. The 2016 results were also the latest sign of the widening of the gap between Republicans and Democrats in West Virginia, a state where Democrats were once dominant. The following chart shows how Democratic margins of victory in the presidential race shrank between 1992 and 1996, then produced increasingly large Repubilcan margins of victory.   As the Pew Research Center has noted, this pattern has coincided with the increasing alignment of national partisan politics on certain demographic factors, notably race, educational attainment and population density. Geographical areas that are less racially diverse, less college-educated and more rural have swung hard to the Republican Party in recent years, especially in federal-level elections. When Governing magazine recently analyzed all 50 states on these three demographic factors, it found that West Virginia had the strongest Republican-aligned demographics of any state. Trump said that in the 2016 presidential election in West Virginia, he won by 42 points. He’s correct; in fact, it was his second-widest margin in any state, trailing only Wyoming.

Rodman misstates Dunnavant's short-term health insurance bill
","Del. Debra Rodman is telling voters that the quality of their health insurance is at risk if they re-elect Republican state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico. ""Sen. Dunnavant wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions,"" Rodman, a Democrat, says in a TV ad launched Sept. 20. Rodman made the same charge on at least three glossy mailers she sent to voters in late September. One of them particularly got the ire of Dunnavant, a physician. ""What do you call a doctor who wrote a bill that would let insurers deny coverage for pre-existing conditions?"" it asks. Next to the words is a picture of a duck with the caption ""QUACK."" Dunnavant told the Richmond Times-Dispatch it is a ""denigrating smear"" to be called a quack. And on her website, she called Rodman’s charges about her bill ""not accurate and completely misleading."" So we fact-checked Rodman’s claim that Dunnavant wrote a bill that would let insurance companies to ""deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" Rodman backs her statement by citing a bill Dunnavant introduced in January 2018 that initially would have required health insurance companies doing business with the state government or municipalities to participate in Virginia’s health benefit exchange. At Dunnavant’s request, the bill was amended. The provision she originally sought was replaced by a measure she said would conditionally change Virginia’s law for short-term health insurance policies. Short-term plans provide low-cost, limited-duration insurance that doesn’t have to comply with the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. They don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions, prescriptions or maternity care and often come with high deductibles. Critics call them ""junk insurance."" The Obama administration in 2016 issued a rule limiting short-term policies to 90 days to provide stop-gap policies to people who lost their health coverage and were waiting for enrollment periods to begin on the individual insurance market. Virginia’s insurance regulations were adjusted to the federal regulation. President Donald Trump says the ACA is unconstitutional and should be abolished. In an effort to weaken the law, his administration announced in 2017 that it would change the rules on short-term policies to let them last for 364 days.  Dunnavant’s amended bill - written with Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania - would have compelled Virginia to conform to the expected new federal regulation. Reeves said the lengthened policies would help Virginians without employer-provided insurance who had seen steep premium increases on their individual, ACA-compliant plans.  In Virginia, the average premium for individual coverage in the ACA market is $796 a month, according to the State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Insurance. That’s twice the cost in 2016. In contrast, some short-term plans are advertised for $50 a month.  Dunnavant’s amended bill passed the Senate unanimously. Democrats opposed the measure in the House, arguing the extended policies would encourage Virginians to drop their ACA-compliant coverage for low-cost, high-risk plans. The bill passed the House on a partisan 51-46 vote. Gov. Ralph Northan, a Democrat, vetoed the legislation. In August 2018, the White House issued final rules that allow short-term plans to last 364 days and be renewed twice, meaning consumers could be insured by them for three years. In November, the state’s Bureau of  Insurance routinely conformed Virginia’s insurance regulations to the federal change without seeking General Assembly approval. We repeat: State regulators adapted Virginia’s health insurance regulations to the federal change without General Assembly approval. State law allows the insurance bureau to do that. It’s standard practice, according to Ken Schrad, information director at the State Corporation Commission, which oversees the bureau. In other words, Dunnavant’s and Reeves’ bill mandating the state to comply with changed federal regulations expanding short-term policies was unnecessary. ""These are federal decisions,"" said Doug Gray, executive director of the Virginia Association of Health Plans. ""The state doesn’t have a great role in controlling Obamacare."" All of this undermines Rodman’s claim that Dunnavant ""wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions."" Virginia insurers were already allowed to write 90-day short-term policies omitting pre-existing conditions and more. Dunnavant’s bill would have superfluously extended the period to 364-days to match expected new federal rules. Rodman’s claim also lacks perspective: It suggests that any Virginian could be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions when, in fact, the regulation will affect few. About 79 percent of Virginians are insured by ACA-complaint plans - subsidized by their employers or the government with mandated coverage for pre-existing conditions, accoording SCC data.  The remaining 21% percent is the pool most likely to consider short-term term insurance. Are those who opt in being ""denied"" pre-existing coverage, as Rodman contends, or making a free choice? We’ll leave that call to you. Our ruling Rodman misleadingly claims Dunnevant ""wrote the Republican bill that would let insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions.""  Dunnavant opposes Obamacare. She sponsored an unsuccessful bill in 2018 that would have expanded inexpensive, short-term health insurance policies that don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions and many other medical circumstances. They are exempt from Obamacare standards.  But contrary to Rodman’s claim, Dunnavant’s bill wouldn’t have ""let"" insurance companies sell short-term plans, they were already permitted to sell 90-day policies in Virginia in accordance with ACA rules. Dunnevant’s bill would have extended the coverage period to 364 days to comply with expected new federal rules - something the state regulators automatically do. would have done. Rodman’s statement also suggests that anyone could have been denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. In fact, 79 percent of Virginians have ACA-compliant insurance, subsidized by their employers or the government, that mandates such coverage. We rate Rodman’s dramatic claim False.  ",/factchecks/2019/oct/01/rodman-debra/rodman-misstates-dunnavants-short-term-health-insu/

Wisconsin lawmaker hits the target with claim on racial background of death row prisoners
","Wisconsin was one of the first states to abolish capital punishment, on July 10, 1853.  The move followed the 1851 execution of John McCaffary, the first and last person to be executed under Wisconsin state law. More than 2,000 people witnessed the execution by hanging of McCaffary in Kenosha. He had received the death penalty for drowning his wife, Bridgett McCaffary, on July 23, 1850, in a backyard cistern. The hanging turned into a gruesome spectacle, as McCaffary struggled on the end of the rope for some 20 minutes as he was slowly strangled, according to the MurderPedia.org website. The uproar over the slow public strangulation of McCaffary prompted Wisconsin to ban the death penalty.   While there is no death penalty in Wisconsin, the issue resonates nationwide -- particularly since the Trump administration moved in July 2019 to reinstate the federal death penalty.  U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., slammed the reinstatement in a July 26, 2019 tweet: ""The death penalty is a discriminatory policy. More than half of death row prisoners are people of color. The Trump administration isn’t fooling anyone by reinstating the federal death penalty and executing a white supremacist first. Distraction & deflection is their goal."" Is Moore right that ""more than half of death row prisoners are people of color""? Establishing the terms Before we jump in, some background on the issue. As of August 28, 2019, there are 30 states that currently allow the death penalty. They include Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Texas and Utah. Most of the death penalty states are in the west and south, with the nearest ones to Wisconsin being Indiana, Ohio and Kansas. Capital punishment was abolished in Illinois in 2011.  All told, some 2,700 people are on death row at the state level. A little more than 60 are in federal prisons awaiting the death penalty. Meanwhile, according to a March 30, 2014, National Public Radio article, ""The Journey from ’Colored’ to ‘Minorities’ to ‘People of Color,’"" the definition of ""person of color"" has varied over the years. ""In U.S. history, ‘person of color’ has often been used to refer only to people of African heritage,"" the article states. ""Today, it usually covers all/any peoples of African, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, Asian or Pacific Island descent, and its intent is to be inclusive."" With that in mind, how does Moore’s death-row claim stack up? The evidence When asked to back up the claim, Moore’s staff referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to two reports.  The first is a September 2011 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, ""Race and the Death Penalty."" It asserted that ""People of color have accounted for a disproportionate 43% of total executions since 1976 and 55% of those currently awaiting execution.""  The second report Moore’s office cited was from the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, that provides legal representation to prisoners. Its report also said more than half of the people on state death rows in the United States are people of color: ""Of the more than 2,700 people currently under a death sentence, 42 percent are black, 13 percent are Hispanic, and 42 percent are white."" The data in the Equal Justice Initiative report came from a May 31, 2019, report from the Death Penalty Information Center, which compiled data from the death penalty states and found that as of May 2019, there are 2,721 inmates on death row. It included the same racial statistics cited by the Equal Justice Initiative, but with an additional 3% listed as ""other.""  Those reports, however, only cover state-level death penalty cases.   Federal data To get a handle on the makeup of federal prisoners, we turned to the Death Penalty Information Center, which is a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization that provides the media and the public with analysis and information about capital punishment. As of April 1, 2019, it found there were 62 inmates with the following racial background: White -- 27 (43.5%) Black -- 26 (41.9%) Latino -- 7 (11.3%) Native American -- 1 (1.6%)  Asian -- 1 (1.6%) So, people of color make up a majority of death row inmates at both the state and federal levels. Our ruling Moore said  ""More than half of death row prisoners are people of color.""   Reports from organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Equal Justice Initiative and the Death Penalty Information Center confirm the death row racial population claim, both at the state and federal level.  We rate her claim True. ",/factchecks/2019/oct/01/gwen-moore/state-lawmaker-hits-target-claim-racial-background/

Fact-checking Jim Justice's boast about W.Va. highway rankings
","Facing a competitive reelection bid in 2020, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice sought to tout his record on improving the state’s highways. ""Our WV highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, up 20 spots from last year’s ranking!"" Justice tweeted Aug. 22. ""This ranking affirms all the hard work we’ve done, and that we continue to do, fixing our state’s roads."" Our WV highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, up 20 spots from last year’s ranking! This ranking affirms all the hard work we’ve done, and that we continue to do, fixing our state’s roads. #WV #WVGov https://t.co/GY699UI0M6   Let’s take a closer look at the source of his assertion. (Justice’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) Justice’s tweet linked to a news release from the governor’s office that cited the source of the rankings as the Reason Foundation’s 24th annual highway report. The Reason Foundation has a libertarian perspective, including individual liberty and free markets, the foundation’s website says. The annual highway study uses spending and performance data that state agencies send to the federal government. To do this, it ranks the 50 states in 13 categories, such as highway expenditures per mile, pavement conditions, congestion, bridge conditions and fatality rates. Looking at the overall state figures, West Virginia does rank 16th in the country, a rise of 20 notches from 36th in the previous year’s survey.  Compared to its neighbors, the report finds West Virginia slightly ahead of Ohio (18th) and Maryland (39th) in overall ranking but behind Virginia (2nd). West Virginia is doing worse than some regionally comparable states like Kentucky (5th) but better than others such as Indiana (33rd). The top overall state was North Dakota, and the worst was New Jersey. Read the full list here.  It should be noted that West Virginia’s 16th-place overall ranking obscures some aspects of the report that paint a less rosy picture of the state’s highways. For starters, the bulk of the highway data in the most recent report covers 2016,which is before Justice took office. Only two categories out of 13 use 2017 data, when he had begun his first term. So while this report represents a positive development for West Virginia, it doesn’t fully reflect Justice’s own policies, as he implied when he referred to ""all the hard work we’ve done."" In addition, a technical change in the report’s methodology played a role in West Virginia’s increase. According to the report’s summary of the state’s rankings, West Virginia ""benefited from the report no longer measuring narrow rural arterial lanes,"" a category where the state ranked 50th last year. Finally, looking only at the overall ranking, as Justice does, obscures some relatively weak ratings for West Virginia on key sub-categories. Notably, the state ranks 36th in its overall fatality rate, 48th in structurally deficient bridges, 20th in urban Interstate pavement condition and 21st in rural Interstate pavement condition.  The state scored better on cost measures, ranking second in total spending per mile and third in capital and bridge costs per mile.  ""To improve in the rankings, West Virginia needs to reduce its percentage of structurally deficient bridges and its rural arterial pavement condition,"" Feigenbaum told PolitiFact West Virginia. ""The state is in the bottom five for structurally deficient bridges and the bottom 15 for rural arterial pavement condition in the country."" Justice tweeted, ""Our WV highways rank 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, up 20 spots from last year’s ranking! This ranking affirms all the hard work we’ve done, and that we continue to do, fixing our state’s roads."" Justice has a point about the overall number, but his celebratory tone is somewhat exaggerated. Most of the data reflects a period before he became governor, and a major reason for the increase came from the elimination of a category from the previous year’s report in which West Virginia ranked 50th nationally.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2019/oct/01/jim-justice/fact-checking-jim-justices-boast-about-wva-highway/

Donald Trump’s false claim about a change in whistleblower rules
","President Donald Trump raised the specter of shady bureaucratic doings that allowed a whistleblower’s complaint to move forward when ordinarily it wouldn’t have. ""Who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report?"" Trump tweeted Sept. 30. ""Drain the swamp!"" WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP! Trump was far from the only one saying the rules were changed ""just before"" the report that ignited an impeachment inquiry was filed Aug. 12. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted the same thing Sept. 28. ""Whistleblowers were required to provide direct, first-hand knowledge of allegations,"" McCarthy wrote. ""But just days before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward, the IC (Inspector General of the Intelligence Community) secretly removed that requirement from the complaint form."" Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani echoed the same point Sept. 29. All three tweets lead back to the same article on the conservative website Federalist.  All three are wrong.  • First-hand knowledge by a whistleblower has never been required since the law protecting intelligence community whistleblowers was enacted. • Inspector General staff, who investigate a charge, need first-hand information to move a complaint forward — as they did in this case. • The current complaint was based on both first- and second-hand information. The Sept. 27 article claimed, ""Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings."" The evidence comes from a tweet thread started by Stephen McIntyre on the morning the Federalist article appeared. McIntyre is a former mining company director who created the Climate Audit blog, which questions the official data behind climate change. From the thread, a few key points emerge: As of May 24, 2018, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community’s Urgent Concern disclosure form — the form whistleblowers fill out  — offered three choices to describe how the whistleblower got his/her information: personal knowledge, heard from other people, and other sources.  The current form offers just two choices: personal knowledge or ""heard about it from others."" That form dates from August 2019.  The previous form also included a section under the subhead ""First-hand information required."" ""In order to find an urgent concern ‘credible,’ the IC IG (Intelligence Community Inspector General) must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA (Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act) based on an employee’s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing. This includes information received from another person, such as when a fellow employee informs you that he/she witnessed some type of wrongdoing. (Anyone with first-hand knowledge of the allegations may file a disclosure in writing directly with the IC IG.) Similarly, speculation about the existence of wrongdoing does not provide sufficient basis to meet the statutory requirements of the ICWPA. If you think wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions, IC IG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA."" The current reporting form lacks that section. Based on these facts, Trump and other Republicans asserted that the rules for whistleblowers were changed ""just before"" the current complaint was filed. Actually, only the forms were changed. The rules stayed the same. The whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry filled out the earlier version of the form, and no rules were changed. The Office of Inspector General issued a statement Sept. 30 saying that ""the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019, is the same form the IC IG has had in place since May 24, 2018."" The inspector general’s office underscored that the whistleblower received the section about the need for first-hand evidence before a claim would go on to the next step. So changes to the form took place after the whistleblower filed. As for the rules on what is required, those have been the same since 2014 under an order issued by the Director of National Intelligence. Intelligence Community Directive 120 defines a protected disclosure as one that the employee ""reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule or regulation."" The statement from the Inspector General’s office emphasized the reasonable belief standard. ""By law the Complainant – or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees – need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint,"" the statement said. ""The IC IG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law."" The section about the need for first-hand information has to do with the investigation that follows a whistleblower’s report, not a requirement for the report itself. ""This is their way of tempering the whistleblower’s expectations,"" said analyst Irvin McCullough, with the nonprofit Government Accountability Project. (McCullough’s father served as inspector general until 2017 and now represents the whistleblower.) ""It says we might not find enough to support your complaint."" The latest IG statement says it changed its forms after the current affair unfurled, because it understood some parts ""could be read — incorrectly — as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint."" The statement noted that the whistleblower checked both boxes to indicate he/she had both first and second-hand information.  It also notes that its investigation found the report credible and urgent. The White House had no comment. Trump said, ""Longstanding whistleblower rules (were changed) just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report."" The current rules have been in place since 2014. Whistleblowers can provide either first or second-hand information, or both. The current whistleblower filled out a form that dates from May 2018. Whatever changes existed on that form date from 14 months before the present claim was filed. Investigators require more than second-hand information in order to move a complaint forward, but that is not a requirement before a complaint can be filed. The Inspector General’s office changed its forms after the whistleblower filed, but those changes had no bearing on the rules under which a claim would be processed.

Did Pat McCrory help immigrants get driver's licenses?
","A conservative pundit called out former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory for taking a liberal stance on immigrants’ access to driver’s licenses. During a recent appearance on Fox’s The Ingraham Angle, Laura Ingraham and Michelle Malkin discussed Republican Dan Bishop’s victory in the 9th Congressional District race. Malkin praised Bishop for his commitment to the conservative agenda and suggested that other Republicans had gone astray. She said, ""It was a previous North Carolina governor who was a Republican who shepherded in driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks."" Malkin is a political blogger, commentator, and author whose work focuses on immigration and corruption. She appeared on the show to discuss her new book, ""Open Borders Inc.: Who's Funding America's Destruction?""  Her claim seemed fishy to us for a few reasons. First, the state didn’t have a Republican governor until over a decade after 9/11. Also, North Carolina isn’t among the 14 states and territories that allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get a driver’s license. There’s actually a bill in the General Assembly to do this, but it hasn’t passed. So, we decided to look into her claim and found there was little to support it.  We assume she was talking about former Governor Pat McCrory, because he was the only Republican to hold the office since 9/11. During his term, DACA recipients became eligible for driver’s licenses. However, McCrory opposed allowing immigrants living in the country illegally to get drivers’ licenses. It’s quite a stretch for Malkin to say he ""shepherded in"" those privileges. Limitations on driver’s licenses for immigrants in NC Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to make immigrants living in the country illegally eligible for driver’s licenses, according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures in July 2019. North Carolina is not one of them. That wasn’t always the case. In the 1990s and early 2000s, those immigrants could get driver’s licenses in North Carolina. In a New York Times article from August 2001, Wayne Hurder, the state’s director of driver’s license certification, explained the reasoning behind the policy. ''We think it's in the best interests of everyone in the state if we can get them to learn the laws of the road and get insurance. It's not our job to get into national immigration policy — this is a purely practical decision,"" Hurder said at the time.  But in response to 9/11, Congress launched several efforts to strengthen domestic security. The REAL ID Act of 2005 mandated states to require proof of citizenship for REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards. REAL IDs are required by federal agencies for people who want to access federal facilities, board federally-regulated airplanes, and enter nuclear power plants. The law is being phased in with a final deadline in October 2020. In 2005, then-Governor Mike Easley, a Democrat, followed the mandate and signed a law that specified driver’s license applicants must provide a valid Social Security Number, which prevented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from getting licenses. Before then, applicants could provide an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead.  In recent years, a group of Democratic state representatives have been pushing another bill called the Safer Roads and Communities Act. It also would enable those immigrants to get licenses. The bill’s supporters argue that if more drivers are trained and insured, roads will be safer for everyone. DACA recipients are eligible  We reached out to Malkin about her claim but did not hear back. It seems likely that she was referring to a policy change in 2013 to allow immigrants who qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to get North Carolina driver’s licenses. (They are a small subset of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, accounting for about 15%.) Pat McCrory, who is the only Republican governor since 9/11, was in office at the time. Neither the REAL ID Act of 2005 nor the recent bills in the General Assembly were in play during his term. DACA was a program established under President Barack Obama that would defer deportation for ""Dreamers"" — young immigrants who illegally entered the United States as children — who met certain criteria. Immigrants with the new status could apply for a Social Security card and legally work in the United States. But the North Carolina DMV wasn’t sure how to handle driver’s license applications from DACA recipients and asked the attorney general’s office to weigh in. In January 2013, then Attorney General Roy Cooper released a legal opinion that said DACA recipients were entitled to driver’s licenses. When we asked McCrory about the policy, he emphasized that the driver’s licenses issued to DACA recipients included the phrases ""Legal Presence"" and ""No Lawful Status."" The former governor said, ""We were following the law reluctantly."" McCrory also told us that he opposed expanding driver’s license eligibility to immigrants living here illegally. When a 2015 bill was introduced that proposed to do just that, McCrory’s legislative liaison told lawmakers, ""He is concerned with the provision providing driving privileges to those who are in this country unlawfully."" Our ruling Michelle Malkin said former Republican Governor Pat McCrory ""shepherded in driver’s licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks."" For the most part, her claim isn’t supported by the facts. North Carolina hasn’t allowed unauthorized immigrants to get driver’s licenses since 2006, when a Democratic governor signed an act requiring driver’s license applicants to provide a valid Social Security Number. We found widely varying estimates on the number of people living in North Carolina illegally who are currently ineligible for driver’s licenses. Although North Carolina decided to allow DACA recipients to access driver’s licenses during McCrory’s tenure as governor, he said he followed that ""reluctantly"" and did not support making the larger population of immigrants living here illegally eligible for driver’s licenses.  We rate the claim Mostly False.

No, Vermont’s governor did not vote to impeach Donald Trump
","It is not true that Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott ""just voted"" to impeach President Donald Trump, as a Facebook post claims. ""Hi I’m Vermont Republican Phil Scott. I just voted to impeach President Trump,"" said a Sept. 27 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 5,000 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post is wrong on several accounts: a governor has no voting role in impeachment proceedings, there hasn’t been a vote to impeach Trump, and the governor didn’t even say Trump should be impeached. What has Scott said or done? Below is the background provided by Rebecca Kelley, the governor’s communications director. On Sept. 25, Scott’s office received an inquiry from the Associated Press asking for comment regarding the impeachment inquiry against Trump formally announced Sept. 24 by U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Scott’s office sent the Associated Press a statement which in part said, ""we have much more to learn and need to understand all the facts as this serious allegation is considered. It appears Congress will be starting an inquiry process, which I believe is appropriate."" Impeachment shouldn’t be taken lightly or abused, Scott’s statement said, adding that he hoped Congress would be objective and transparent in their process. On Sept. 26, the governor at his pre-scheduled weekly press conference again was asked about the impeachment inquiry. VTDigger.org reported that Scott said he supported the inquiry, but hoped it would be driven by facts, not politics. ""I think this is Congress’ responsibility and, again, let the facts determine the course of action moving forward,"" Scott said, according to VTDigger.org’s reporting. ""When we see the facts, when I see the facts, I’d be happy to comment on that when it happens. I don’t want to get ahead of this."" Kelley emphasized to PolitiFact that Scott’s comments have been on the inquiry process and that he’s said that the outcome should not be predetermined, but fact-based. So the Facebook post takes a step ahead of what Scott has said about the inquiry process to inaccurately claim that he ""just voted"" to impeach Trump. The Facebook post additionally ignores the facts that impeachment-related votes involve the U.S. Congress, not state governors. The House also has yet to cast a vote on impeachment. (Read our story on how the impeachment process works.) Our ruling A Facebook post says Scott ""just voted to impeach President Trump."" Scott has not done that. As Vermont’s governor, Scott cannot vote on this issue. Impeachment proceedings are a matter of Congress, not state governors.

Bernie Sanders says 49% of ‘new’ income goes to the top 1%
","Speaking to a crowd of Chicago Teachers Union members as they considered a strike over contract demands, presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders riffed on the theme for which he is perhaps best known: economic inequality. Sanders told the cheering crowd that, if elected, he plans to pay for his many proposals — including making public colleges and universities tuition-free and wiping out student debt — with his recently proposed wealth tax. He said this is ""a time of massive and grotesque income and wealth inequality in America."" ""49% of all new income goes to the top 1%,"" Sanders said while ticking off his usual talking points on the gap between the nation’s richest and everyone else — some of which we’ve checked before — and promising that if he is elected, ""the billionaire class and the large, profitable corporations will start paying their fair share of taxes."" While mulling a presidential run in early 2015, Sanders used a considerably more stark version of the same claim, contending almost all income growth at the time was going to the top 1%. We rated that Mostly True, finding Sanders had accurately represented a somewhat limited, though widely cited research study based on federal tax data. But the discrepancy between Sanders’ new figure — which refers to income growth — and the one from a few years ago gave us pause, so we decided to take a closer look. It turns out his latest statement relates to an updated edition of the same study. Once again, he cited it accurately. Just like last time, however, there are several caveats worth keeping in mind. Sanders based his claim on the latest update to a study from Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who uses pre-tax income reported in Internal Revenue Service filings to compare top income dating back to 1913. As Saez’s report notes, it’s the only data source that stretches back that far. In his March update, Saez highlights his finding that average inflation-adjusted family income grew by 14% from 2009 to 2017, the latest year for which IRS data is available. But growth in the wake of the Great Recession was uneven, he notes, with the incomes of the top 1% rising 38% while the incomes of the bottom 99% grew only 8.7%. ""Hence, the top 1% captured 49% of the income gains during this recovery period,"" Saez concluded. That backs up the figure Sanders used. But Saez’s work does not include income received from government programs such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment compensation, or health insurance benefits. Other studies that do account for these significant income factors, along with after-tax income — including one performed by Saez — suggest a more narrow gap in income growth. Because Saez’s calculations are based on pre-tax income, his work doesn’t account for the other way in which the federal government redistributes earnings — by requiring the wealthy to pay a heftier share in taxes. That’s particularly relevant here, given that Sanders was speaking about the need to hike taxes on the very rich. ""If you want to have a comprehensive measure of how Americans pay their bills, we’ve got to add all sources of income and we have to subtract the taxes that are taken out of our pay before we even get it,"" said economist Gary Burtless, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. In a report published last year, Urban Institute economist Stephen Rose surveyed a collection of recent studies on income inequality, highlighting how differences in methodology ""greatly affect findings"" and identifying the Saez series Sanders cited as the clear outlier. The Saez report Sanders drew from also takes as its starting point the end of one of the nation’s worst economic slumps. Experts told us that’s an important point to keep in mind because the country’s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession, meaning the gains they registered during the first few years of the recovery as the stock market began to bounce back were especially large but are now growing more slowly by comparison. Sanders said ""49% of all new income goes to the top 1%."" That’s a reference to growth in pre-tax, pre-government benefit income during the economic recovery following the Great Recession from 2009 to 2017, which was calculated by one of the leading experts in the field of income inequality research. However, it’s not the only way to measure income, and other economists we spoke with pointed to more comprehensive, though slightly more dated, studies that compare income growth after accounting for what people pay to and receive from the government. We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim the U.S. funds undocumented immigrants coming over the border
","Donald Trump bemoaned the $19 trillion national debt before launching into an attack on an expansive federal budget bill during a rally in Fountain Hills, Ariz. Referring to a spending bill known as the ""omnibus,"" Trump said March 19. ""It funds Obamacare, it funds Syrians coming into the United States, we have no idea who they are, it funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix."" President Barack Obama signed the omnibus, a $1.1 trillion federal spending bill, in December. The catch-all bill funds the federal government through Sept. 30, 2016. The type of expenditures vary quite a bit, covering benefit extensions for 9/11 first-responders and an increase in research dollars for the National Institutes of Health. The bill lumps together multiple spending bills. At PolitiFact Arizona, we were most interested in Trump’s claim that the omnibus ""funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix."" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our request for comment. Maybe because that’s because Trump is wrong. The omnibus bill does not fund undocumented immigrants ""coming in and through"" the border. In fact, it funds the very agency tasked with keeping undocumented immigrants out, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. ""The salary of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is contained in that bill,"" said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. ""If they weren’t funded, they’d have to stop patrolling."" What Trump could have meant -- though it’s not what he said -- is that undocumented immigrants in the United States may be benefitting from subsidies such as food stamps through their children. But again, that’s not what he said. ""There’s not ...a budget item for illegal immigration,"" said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Obamacare, Syrians entering the U.S. This fact-check focuses on Trump's claim about undocumented immigrants. But since he also mentioned Obamacare and funding ""Syrians coming into the United States,"" we thought it might be useful to address those claims as well. Most of the spending associated with President Barack Obama’s signature health care is mandatory spending and not part of the omnibus. But the omnibus did include relatively small amounts of discretionary spending, which includes services such as community health clinics. The bill also funded the Health and Human Services Department, which received $75.2 billion. De Rugy said the bill pays for ""only a little"" of the Affordable Care Act, namely administrative costs. The omnibus provides humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees in Jordan. The bill also funds refugees, in general, settling in the United States. It does not specifically fund Syrian refugees. ""Those restrictions were left out of the omnibus. You’re funding the normal immigration process,"" said Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, which advocates for eliminating budget deficits. Dartmouth College government professor Joseph Bafumi noted that these refugees ""could be Syrian."" According to the U.S. State Department, 1,682 Syrians entered the United States as of Dec. 31, 2015. Still, that’s less than 3 percent of the 69,933 total refugees admitted to the United States for fiscal year 2015. Our ruling Trump criticized the ""omnibus"" spending bill passed by Congress and signed by Obama in December, saying it ""funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix,"" among other things. That’s wrong. It actually funds the agency trying to keep people from crossing the border illegally. Trump’s claim is wildly wrong.

LGBT group says NC spent as much on HB2 special session as on government rape crisis programs
","The North Carolina General Assembly convened a special session last week and passed a sweeping bill that prohibits schools from letting transgender students use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also prohibits cities and counties from raising the minimum wage or passing local anti-discrimination laws. The bill was supported by every Republican member of the N.C. House and Senate, as well as 11 House Democrats. Some critics cried foul that it took away discrimination protections from the LGBT community. Others, including the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, criticized the GOP for calling a special session at an extra cost to taxpayers. When the legislature is in session it costs the state approximately $42,000 a day, on average. The LGBT Progress branch of the Center for American Progress compared that figure unfavorably to state spending that helps rape victims. A few minutes after the bill passed, the group tweeted: ""NC spent $42K today to ban trans ppl from bathrooms. That’s almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year."" The tweet’s premise itself is slightly misleading, perhaps due to the forced brevity in Twitter’s 140-character limit. North Carolina did not ban transgender people from bathrooms. It banned them from the bathroom of the gender they identify as. They may still use whichever bathroom corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. But let’s look at the second part of the tweet. Did North Carolina really just spend nearly as much meeting to overturn the Charlotte ordinance – citing fears over sexual assault as a major motivation – as it spends in a year to help victims of rape? Yes and no. The state spends about $45,000 a year on government-run rape crisis program. That’s close to the $42,000 estimated price tag for the special session. But the state also spends another $2.8 million annually on funds that get distributed to the charities that run the vast majority of rape crisis centers throughout the state. But the tweet did specify government rape crisis programs. Sarah McBride, the campaigns and communications manager for the think tank’s LGBT branch, said it was carefully worded that way. ""The government rape crisis program appropriations was $44,678 in the NC certified 2015-2016 budget and the same in the 2016-2017 budget,"" she wrote in an email, providing a budget document as proof. ""Note that the spending for NGO rape crisis programs is much higher, but that the tweet specified ""government programs."" NGO means non-government-organization – in this case, charities like the North Carolina Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which maintains more than 100 rape crisis centers and emergency hotlines for victims all over the state. In addition to donations, these NGOs also rely on some government funding. In recent years, that support has equated to $2.8 million – in addition to the nearly $45,000 that the state spends on government-run rape crisis initiatives. We appreciate McBride’s transparency. But the average person reading that tweet isn’t going to be familiar with the government-versus-NGO breakdown of rape services in North Carolina, which makes it fairly misleading. In fact, even a spokesman for the N.C. Department of Administration – the agency that distributes the state’s $2.8 million rape crisis budget – said he had no idea what the tweet was referring to. Our ruling LGBT Progress said North Carolina spent ""almost as much as it spends on government rape crisis programs in a year"" to convene a special session for HB2. While that’s technically not wrong, due to careful wording, it’s highly misleading. The vast majority of government spending to help aid victims goes to local charities, not government rape crisis programs, which is less than 2 percent of annual spending on assistance to rape victims.

Equality NC director: No public safety risks in cities with transgender anti-discrimination rules
","In the fight to defend Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, supporters questioned claims that it would have been a threat to public safety. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said many large cities have rules similar to what Charlotte proposed, before the legislature nullified it. Equality NC has since sued North Carolina to try to overturn the law. ""There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities,"" Sgro said at a rally outside the legislature just days before Charlotte’s bill was overturned. Conservatives weren’t swayed, though. Before Charlotte’s bill was passed, and then after when it was being debated by the General Assembly and even now that is has been overturned, concerns about safety have been frequently mentioned. Mostly, opponents said opening up women’s restrooms to transgender women – people who are biologically male but identify as female – will make it easier for male sexual predators to commit crimes in bathrooms and locker rooms. Online, supporters galvanized around the motto #KeepNCSafe and sent out ads that included the phrase ""don’t let our girls become victims"" and ""keep children safe."" N.C. GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse cited ""privacy and safety concerns"" in attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is running for governor as a Democrat, for not stepping in to stop Charlotte’s bill on his own. A popular Christian author from Charlotte, Frank Turek, wrote an article about the backlash to the law that included the line, ""The danger is real from sexual predators in women’s restrooms."" On Thursday, the N.C. GOP distributed his column via email and bolded that sentence about sexual predators. So who is right? The evidence is overwhelmingly on Sgro’s side. That’s not to say that people don’t have honest concerns over privacy or mental anguish. Indeed, several opponents of Charlotte’s ordinance have spoken of their own experiences with sexual assault, and their fears that seeing someone with male genitalia in a women’s room might trigger painful memories. But still, Sgro said, Charlotte’s bill would not have legalized sexual assault, harassment or voyeurism – it just would’ve let transgender men and women use the bathrooms they’re more comfortable in. ""Transgender people are not predators,"" he said. Examples to prove Sgro wrong? The entire state of Maryland and some of the largest cities in the country, including New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle and Austin, Texas, have rules banning discrimination against transgender people in public accommodation, including bathrooms. More than 200 cities and counties also ban workplace discrimination against transgender people. A dozen state public school systems and dozens of college campuses also have ordinances banning discrimination against transgender people, including in bathrooms. We asked the N.C. GOP if they could point to anything that backs up the safety fears. They provided a link to a news story in Seattle from earlier this year, about a man who had twice gone into a women’s locker room and began undressing. Seattle does allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. The man didn’t identify as transgender and didn’t appear to present as a woman, the story said. No one called the police, and the man wasn’t charged with any crime. Follow-up stories described the incident as a stunt, perhaps politically motivated. The liberal group Media Matters For America has studied the bathroom issue for several years, largely under the guidance of Carlos Maza. Maza, a Wake Forest University graduate, tweeted after North Carolina’s new law passed that ""A man has never used an LGBT non-discrimination law to sneak into a bathroom."" Maza has also polled public school systems that allow transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. In a June 2015 article, he wrote that in 17 districts with a total of 600,00 students, officials hadn’t reported a single incident of ""harassment or inappropriate behavior"" related to transgender students and bathrooms. But we still weren’t satisfied, so we kept digging, looking for examples of proven criminal behavior. We were likewise unable to find any examples in the United States, though we did find a case in Canada. In that case, Christopher Hambrook posed as a woman to gain entry to women’s shelters, where he attacked several people before being caught. Hambrook was sentenced to an ""indefinite"" jail term in 2014 that could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison. Hambrook committed the crimes in Toronto, which has an ordinance protecting transgender people. That appears to be the first, and so far only, incident of its kind in North America. After spending hours combing through conservative blogs and family values websites dedicated to news about transgender bathroom ordinances, we were able to confirm three cases in the United States in the last 17 years in which a biological male was convicted of a crime that involved him in a women’s bathroom or locker room and dressed as a woman. It’s unclear if any of the three identified as transgender women, but none of those cases happened in cities where it would’ve been legal for a transgender woman to use the women’s room anyway. And none involved sexual assault or rape. In 1999, Patrick Hagan was convicted in Tampa, Fla., for punching a woman in a bar bathroom during an argument. In 2010, Norwood Burns was convicted in Gordon County, Georgia, for exposing himself in a Walmart bathroom. In 2011, Thomas Lee Benson was convicted of trespassing in a Clackamas, Oregon, women’s locker room and trying to talk to children. Again, though, none of those crimes occurred in places where biological men would’ve had any legal claim to being in a women’s room by virtue of being a transgender woman. The blogs did identify a few examples of alleged criminal activity having taken place under the guise of transgender-friendly bathrooms laws, but we couldn’t find proof of any convictions in those cases. Our ruling Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, said that ""There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities"" with ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. We haven’t found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups. There was one incident in Canada, involving a rapist. In the U.S., there have been a few yet-unproven allegations.

Ad says beer and wine in grocery stores is 'good for everybody'
","The feel-good TV ad featuring images of Colorado outdoor adventurers and happy people holding beers bottles declares it's time to ""give Coloradans what they want — real craft beer at grocery stores."" The political ad is sponsored by King Soopers, Walmart and Safeway, big chains that are backing a Colorado ballot measure to allow grocery and big box stores to sell full-strength beer and wine. The campaign operates under the group Your Choice Colorado. The ad features Chris Phelps, co-owner of Saint Patrick’s Brewing Company, who says if the proposal becomes reality, ""People have more access to it (craft beer), the breweries have more access to the people, and it's good for everybody."" That heady assessment is hotly contested by opponents, who say the ballot measure would hurt craft breweries and wineries because big grocery chains would just offer the better-known craft brands. They also warn it would cause the demise of hundreds of liquor stores, a crucial marketplace for craft brewers and wineries. We decided to examine the ad's claim that expanding the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery and big box stores will be ""good for everybody."" Brewhaha years in the making The brewing debate highlights a contradictory quirk about Colorado, where marijuana chain stores are legal but state law prohibits chain stores that sell alcohol. This in a state whose craft brewery industry nationally ranks first for state economic contribution per capita, second in the average amount of beer consumed by drinking-age adults (13.6 gallons annually), and third in barrels of craft beer produced (1.7 million annually). Under current state law, a grocery store chain can only have one licensed location that sells full-strength beer, wine and liquor. The one-location-per-license limit also applies to liquor stores. Otherwise, the state restricts grocery and convenience stores to selling beer that contains just 3.2 percent alcohol. Colorado is one of five states in the country that have the 3.2 percent beer restriction. (The others are Utah, Kansas, Minnesota and Oklahoma). Colorado's liquors restrictions date back more than 80 years ago to the end of Prohibition, the nation's 13-year ban on booze. Colorado liquor stores have a near-monopoly on the sale of beer, wine and hard liquor — except for the one liquor store outlet each grocery store chain can operate. Grocery store-funded study: Everybody wins! Your Choice Colorado argues modernizing the state’s ""antiquated"" alcohol laws will save consumers time and money, create about 200 new grocery stores, add an estimated 22,000 new jobs and boost craft beer sales by $125 million. This analysis comes from a study by a University of Denver economist funded by King Soopers, Walmart and Safeway. You can imagine why the opposing campaign, Keep Colorado Local, an alliance of liquor stores, craft breweries, wineries and the Colorado Restaurant Association, questions the findings right off the bat. Allowing full-strength beer and wine sales at grocery and big box stores will cut the prices Coloradans pay by 18 percent through increased competition, the study said. ""Alcohol restrictions act like a tax on Colorado consumers, by contributing to significantly higher alcohol prices and limiting consumer choice,"" said the study’s author, Jack Strauss, the DU economics professor. Strauss calls the state’s liquor stores a ""protected class,"" because they don’t face competitive pressure to lower prices and have a comparatively low business failure rate. But the economist said the law is also bad for craft-beer brewers, because their products are denied access to a wider marketplace. Passage of the ballot measure would bring tens of millions in sales to medium- to large-sized craft brewers, Strauss said, and smaller brewers could do well if they have a good product and ""get lucky"" by gaining access to the big retail stores. Small brewers, however, should continue to find a ""specialty"" product niche in liquor stores, he added. Strauss said his conclusions are supported by sales data from Washington state and Oregon, big craft-brewing states where full-strength beer and wine are sold in grocery and big box stores. He said Safeway and Kroger’s sales of local craft beer in Oregon and Washington are well over $100 million annually. Meanwhile, liquor store sales in Portland and Seattle have more sales per capita of 55 percent and 14 percent, respectively, than Denver liquor stores, Strauss said. In Colorado, he noted that liquor stores appear to be thriving near grocery and big-box stores that have their chain’s allotted one liquor-store location. He counted about 75 liquor stores near the King Soopers and Target stores that sell alcohol in Glendale and 35 liquor stores near the Safeway that sells alcohol in Littleton. Still, Strauss acknowledges there’s a possibility of ""some small liquor stores potentially going under."" Opponents say the big chain stores got what they paid for in the DU economist’s study. ""The notion that liquor stores adjacent to a grocery store would stay in business is something that must have been authored in the creative writing department,"" said Curtis Hubbard, a spokesman for the opposing campaign’s alliance, Keep Colorado Local. Opponent-funded study: Liquor stores will be decimated  Opponents cite a 2011 study by Summit Economics on the potential impacts of allowing full-strength beer to be sold Colorado grocery and convenience stores. The study was funded by the Colorado Licensed Beverage Association and other groups representing independent liquor stores. The study said that full-strength beer legislation, which was being considered by state lawmakers at the time, would devastate mom-and-pop liquors stores. The study predicted that if the full-strength beer proposal became law, within five years: • 700 independent liquor stores -- 42 percent of the state’s 1,650 total liquor stores -- would close. • 10,000 jobs would be lost, including liquor store workers and the rippling impact across the economy. • $240 million in annual wages would be lost. There are 311 licensed craft breweries in the state and more than 50 breweries oppose the ballot measure to allow beer and wine sales in grocery stores. They say the loss of liquor stores would harm brewers, too. ""Liquor law in Colorado encourages breweries to grow like nowhere else and have made us the envy of the rest of the country,"" said John Carlson, executive director of the Colorado Brewers Guild. ""Craft brewers are able to get their beer on the shelves of local liquor stores quickly and easily because they have the cooler space and the staff of local stores are their friends and neighbors who are invested in the community’s success. Colorado brewers enhance and grow the local economy."" Yet, a 2009 study for the state legislature concluded the evidence from Colorado and other states shows that allowing full-strength beer sales in grocery and convenience stores would not cause ""the widespread closings of liquor stores predicted by opponents."" The study was for a proposed bill that ultimately failed.    Independent economists: Lower prices, negative impact on liquor stores Independent economists we consulted agree that increased competition should lead to lower prices. But they also say it will hurt the liquor stores. ""We find that prices are indeed lower in states where alcohol is sold in grocery stores,"" said Marco Costanigro, an associate professor of economics at Colorado State University who co-authored a 2013 study, Economic and Social Implications of Regulating Alcohol in Grocery Stores.    ""I am pretty positive that the lower prices can be ascribed to increased competition and the cost-savings that larger distributors can achieve thanks to economies of scale,"" Costanigro added. Martin Shields, another CSU economist, said that while allowing full-strength beer and wine in grocery stories will likely give consumers lower prices and convenient one-stop shopping, it ""will likely significantly hurt liquor stores."" Research shows the potential economic winners -- and losers -- of loosening restrictive alcohol laws. In a 2012 study, Cornell University economist Bradley J. Rickard did a simulation model to assess the likely economic effects of allowing wine sales at grocery stores in New York state. Despite a poll showing that 58 percent of New York state residents support allowing wine to be sold in grocery stores, legislative efforts to make it happen have failed over 50 years. Rickard's analysis found that, if grocers could sell wine, state tax revenue would increase by $22 million annually and revenue for state wineries would grow about 13 percent. But introducing wine in grocery stores would have ""negative consequences"" for liquor stores, whose revenues were calculated to fall by 28 percent, the study said.     Our ruling     A Your Choice Colorado ad says a ballot measure to expand the sale of full-strength beer and wine to grocery and big box stores will be ""good for everybody."" The economic impact study funded by large grocery retailers said the proposal would save consumers time and money, create about 200 more grocery stores, add 22,000 new jobs and boost craft beer sales by $125 million. Opponents forecast precisely the opposite effect, saying it would close 700 liquor stores, cause the loss of 10,000 jobs, and hurt craft breweries and wineries. Independent economists say the proposal would increase competition, giving consumers lower prices and convenient one-stop shopping. But they acknowledge that liquor stories will be negatively impacted. The ad makes a fair point about consumer benefits but goes too far in saying the measure works out for all sides.

Ted Strickland's attack ad against Rob Portman twists facts on trade law
"," Ted Strickland goes back 11 years in an ad targeting incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, chastising his role as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. ""It was his job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel,"" the narrator says. ""He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."" Titled ""Beltway Rob,"" the ad is part of an ongoing name-calling battle between the Strickland and Portman campaigns. (Portman mocks Strickland as ""Retread Ted."") Strickland’s ad left us wondering if Portman dropped the ball on foreign steel during his year as trade representative. (""Dumping"" in trade speak typically refers to a country introducing a cheaper-than-normal product into a foreign market and edging out domestic manufacturers.) Was it really his job to stop China’s illegal steel dumping, and did Portman really do nothing to stand up for the United States? Strickland’s campaign pointed us to a 2012 Politico article about potential running mates for Mitt Romney’s presidential bid. Portman’s name was on the short list, the article said, but a chapter in Portman’s trade history could be leveraged as a weakness by Democratic opponents. We turned to the trade wonks for more clarity. Role of trade representative So was it Portman’s job to ""stop China's illegal dumping of steel?""   In a word, no. ""Like a lot of political ads, it’s more complicated than the ad is saying,"" said Warren Maruyama, who served as general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Portman’s successor, Susan Schwab. The trade representative’s job is to act as the government’s spokesperson on trade, negotiate trade agreements, file cases with the World Trade Organization on behalf of domestic interests and defend against cases where those interests are challenged, and to oversee coordination with the alphabet soup of other agencies whose interests overlap with trade, Maruyama said. Trade law is arcane, and it’s easier to yell ""China bad!"" than it is to explain its nuances. But to a trade expert’s ear, it makes no sense to say that Portman failed to stop illegal Chinese dumping. It’s like saying LeBron James failed to score any touchdowns last season — that's the wrong sport. Likewise, the law is very clear that the U.S. trade representative has no role in the determinations on unfair trade practices such as dumping. Determinations regarding dumping are made by the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Court, in procedures which are deliberately shielded from political or outside interference. ""It’s walled off from political considerations, and Portman could have gotten into trouble if he’d tried to interfere,"" Maruyama said.   If dumping is proven, it’s an unfair trade practice for which relief is mandatory. The U.S. International Trade Commission decides if there is injury or the threat of injury, and the Commerce Department determines the appropriate relief, through higher tariffs. Alan Wolff, who was deputy special representative for trade negotiations during President Jimmy Carter’s administration, agreed. ""Portman had no role on anti-dumping,"" he said. ""That’s flat-out wrong."" The attack ad copy is conflating two different issues, Wolff said. The case referenced by Politico, the one that the Strickland ad wants to use as proof of Portman’s inaction on Chinese dumping, didn’t involve market-dumping at all. The case at hand is different In August 2005, American makers of circular welded non-alloy steel pipe, which is often used in home-building, filed for relief from ""market disruption"" under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Market disruption is not the same as dumping. Trade experts draw a firm distinction between the two terms. (When the Wall Street Journal mischaracterized a similar 2009 market disruption case as a dumping case, the paper ran a correction.) ""There is a clear difference,"" Maruyama said. ""The thing about ‘dumping’ is it sounds bad, so people throw it around, but it’s just not accurate."" Section 421 is ""a unique and rarely used statute,"" according to Schwab, who took over for Portman after Bush tapped him to head the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Cases under this statute for market disruption fall under a category of ""safeguard"" considerations, where it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, only that a trade action has caused them ""injury, or threat of injury."" It’s ""a way of bypassing a formal dumping hearing by the trade commission,"" Schwab said. Section 421 cases are also unique in that they require approval from the White House. The president, the law says, must determine whether trade relief measures are in the country’s economic interest, ""or could threaten national security."" In October 2005, the International Trade Commission issued its determination on the steel pipe case. Four of six trade commissioners sided with the steel pipe manufacturers and recommended tariffs and safeguard actions be imposed on China’s pipe imports. Two commissioners dissented, finding no market disruption. Here, it was Portman’s job to coordinate the process where representatives from other agencies weigh in. ""They all sit down and argue,"" Maruyama said, ""and if they have a consensus, that’s the recommendation that goes up to the president. If there are differences, and often there are, it goes over to the White House in a memo summarizing all the pros and cons. And then Bush gets to decide.""   Portman had a Cabinet role in this occasion, but Schwab said Bush was very clear that there was only one ""decider"" in his administration. ""It wasn’t a Portman-Bush decision,"" she said. ""It was a Bush decision."" Bush did not impose relief in this case, or in three other 421 cases that crossed his desk when Portman wasn’t his trade representative. In the steel pipe case, Bush said that relief wasn’t in the national economic interest. He believed that punishing China on steel pipe wouldn’t ultimately help U.S. steel manufacturers. ""There are many other countries currently supplying standard pipe to the U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese imports,"" wrote Portman in a February 2006 letter to Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., one of many lawmakers catching heat from angry steel industry constituents. Schwab called attacks on Portman’s record on China ""ironic."" ""Portman was always my strongest ally when I wanted to take the Chinese to the WTO,"" she said. ""He was a hawk on these issues. If I wanted to file trade enforcement cases on China I could always count on him."" Our ruling Strickland’s ad says that it was Portman’s ""job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."" We consulted trade experts on both sides of the partisan aisle. They were unanimous that the ad’s statement is fundamentally wrong. Portman did not have a role to play in anti-dumping measures as U.S. trade representative. The 2005 trade matter that the ad attacks him over had nothing to do with dumping. This case only reached Portman, and ultimately Bush, because it was filed under another part of trade law that triggers presidential involvement that isn't used for true ""dumping"" cases. And if you switched ""Bush"" for ""Portman"" in this ad, it would still be a cynical twisting of words. ""Dumping"" is not a catch-all for Chinese steel in the market.

Chris Larson inaccurately says Chris Abele has ""done nothing"" about the Estabrook Dam
","The fate of the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River has played an outsized role during the 2016 campaign for Milwaukee County Executive. That’s especially true because, despite a 6-year-old order from the state Department of Natural Resources to either repair or replace the 80-year-old structure, and a circuit court order declaring the dam a nuisance, the issue has not been resolved. County Executive Chris Abele wants to tear the dam down, but the County Board has voted to repair the structure. When Abele challenger Chris Larson was on the board, he voted to repair the dam, but now says he’s willing to consider removing it because public sentiment seems to have changed. But Larson, a state senator, also has been sharply critical of Abele’s leadership on the issue. Both are Democrats running for the nonpartisan office in the April 5, 2016 election. Abele ""has had five years and he’s done nothing"" about the dam, Larson said during a March 29, 2016 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club. That echoed what he wrote in a March 15, 2016 email to supporters: ""The current county executive has provided no leadership in forging a consensus on what to do with the dam, he has no urgency in addressing this problem."" Is Larson correct that Abele has ""done nothing"" on the matter? The options There are two major alternatives before county officials. Removal: The Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups, has urged the removal of the dam. They note that the removal of the North Avenue Dam, a few miles downstream, led to improved water quality and a thriving fish and wildlife population. Advocates also argue the Estabrook Dam primarily benefits a small number of property owners who enjoy the impoundment, or lake, that the dam creates. They say that is unfair -- even illegal -- because a public facility is creating benefits for a few private property owners. Repair: The Milwaukee River Preservation Association, a group that includes riverfront property owners, and others, including County Board Chairman Theo Lipscomb, favor repairing the dam. They argue the dam creates an important water recreational area and say its removal could lead to the release of toxins built up behind the structure over the decades. Under orders by the federal government, the county hired a consultant, AECOM, to conduct an environmental assessment of the dam. The $250,000 report, released in early 2015, did not recommend an option. But it did note public sentiment at meetings held in September 2014 was about 2-to-1 in favor of removal and said that over time it would cost twice as much to repair and continue operating the dam than it would be to remove it. The report also cited the environmental benefits to allowing water to flow freely and called removal the most ""environmentally protective alternative."" The report was conducted during Abele’s tenure, under orders from the federal government, because it was believed, at the time, that the feds owned an island that is connected to the dam. Abele’s tenure There’s considerable disagreement between Abele and some members of the County Board -- especially Lipscomb, who represents the area -- over how to address the dam. If you had to describe Abele’s record on the dam in one word, it would be ""hamstrung."" On at least two occasions involving the 2015 budget, Lipscomb succeed in getting the board to insert money into the county budget -- first to repair the dam and later to build a fish passage, which is a component of one of the rebuilding options. Abele vetoed both, with one overridden and one sustained. In between the votes and vetoes, Abele’s parks department sent a memo to the board urging it to take action and noting the board itself had changed its position from remove to replace several times. Abele also sent the board a resolution to remove the dam, noting that repairs had become increasingly expensive. And Abele’s chief of staff, Raisa Koltun, followed up with several emails to Lipscomb, but the matter was never scheduled for a vote. Beyond the stalemate with the County Board, Koltun said Abele has worked to forge a consensus with local units of government that have an interest in the dam, including the city of Milwaukee, villages of Shorewood and Brown Deer and the Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District. He has also worked with groups like the Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited and the Milwaukee Riverkeeper, as well as pursued private and federal funding to help pay for the dam’s removal. Our rating Larson says Abele has had five years in office and ""done nothing"" about the Estabrook Dam, with an earlier statement blaming him for a lack of consensus. But records and news accounts show Abele has been consistent in wanting the dam removed, has taken steps to make his wishes known and to build support for removal among nearby communities and other groups. Along the way, he has been thwarted by the County Board. Larson’s statement was that Abele has done nothing.

Donald Trump wants to pull the U.S. out of NATO, Hillary Clinton says
","Donald Trump’s calls for rethinking NATO and the United States’ involvement in it have, like so many of his ideas, stirred controversy. Given that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an institution relied on for security and peacekeeping, it’s no surprise that some reacted with alarm and condemnation. Among them was the Democratic frontrunner for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Campaigning in Milwaukee on March 28, 2016, Clinton declared that the Republican front runner ""wants us to pull out of NATO."" In recent days, Trump has repeatedly called NATO obsolete, saying it should be restructured. He has complained that the United States is paying too large a share of the organization’s costs. And, when pressed, he has said that if changes aren’t made if he is president, he might consider pulling the U.S. out of NATO. But is there evidence to back Clinton’s claim that Trump actually wants to pull out? NATO and its costs NATO was created in 1949, with the United States as one of the 12 founding members, largely to provide collective security against expansionism by the Soviet Union. The alliance, which now has 28 members, aims to protect freedom and security of its members through political and military means. Cost-sharing has been an issue. In 2014, Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, now the speaker of the House, claimed that all 28 members of NATO have ""pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense,"" but only Britain, Greece and the United States do so. We rated his statement Mostly True (Estonia also met that threshold.). Trump’s comments Clinton made her claim days after Trump made headlines with comments about NATO in separate interviews with major news organizations. The New York businessman told the Washington Post editorial board on March 21, 2016, that U.S. involvement in NATO may need to be significantly diminished in the coming years, the Post reported. ""We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,"" Trump said, adding later, ""NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes, we’re protecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money."" Later that week, Trump told New York Times reporters that NATO is ""unfair, economically, to us,"" and said he was open to an alternative organization focused on counterterrorism. ""So, NATO is something that at the time was excellent,"" he said. ""Today, it has to be changed. It has to be changed to include terror. It has to be changed from the standpoint of cost because the United States bears far too much of the cost of NATO."" When pressed, as Clinton’s campaign pointed out, Trump has also indicated he would consider pulling the United States out of NATO. In a March 30, 2016, town hall event in Green Bay (where Trump said women who have abortions should be punished), moderator Chris Matthews twice tried to clarify with if Trump, as president, would ""walk"" if he couldn’t negotiate desired changes in NATO. ""If we have to walk, we have to walk,"" Trump said. That statement came two days after Clinton made her claim, so it wasn’t evidence she could point to in making her statement. But even that is short of Trump saying he wants to pull the United States out of NATO. Our rating Clinton says Donald Trump ""wants us to pull out of NATO."" Trump certainly has opened the door to that possibility, suggesting that if reforms aren’t made to mission and cost sharing, he might consider pulling the United States out of the organization. But he hasn’t gone to say he wants to pull the United States out.

Peter Kinder right about high unemployment in minority communities
","Candidates for Missouri’s GOP gubernatorial nomination have sparred over race relations, MU campus protests and the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri. At a March 17 debate in Columbia, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder said unemployment was a key cause of the events in Ferguson, saying, ""Young men were walking around with nothing to do."" The reasons for the unrest in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown aren’t simple, but we wanted to determine whether Kinder’s numbers for youth unemployment in minority communities were on the money. Youth unemployment in Ferguson and the city of St. Louis Kinder’s office said the numbers came from a St. Louis Post-Dispatch column in 2014, which said 47 percent of the metro area’s African-American men between ages 16 and 24 were unemployed, according to 2012 census numbers. Peter Muesser, professor of labor economics at MU, said the youth jobless rate Kinder cited seemed to be in the correct range. ""I’m seeing Kinder’s statement as likely reliable because it was based on Census Bureau info,"" he said. ""The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau are the best sources when it comes to reliable unemployment statistics."" The Census Bureau and the BLS work together, using annual and monthly surveys to define the unemployment rate and other measures of the American population. The Current Population Survey is more in-depth, but the American Community Survey has a bigger sample size, which allows for unemployment estimates from smaller geographical areas like cities and townships. According to the American Community Survey, the youth unemployment rates in 2014 for St. Louis City, Ferguson Township, and Ferguson City were significantly different. Because Kinder specified youth unemployment in minority communities, we looked at the demographic makeup of both St. Louis City and Ferguson. St. Louis has a comparable number of black and white residents. Ferguson has a significantly larger African-American population, with black residents outnumbering white residents by a 2-to-1 margin.  The rate of African American unemployment in all age groups is historically twice that of white unemployment across the nation. Youth unemployment is no different – nationally, the unemployment rate for African Americans 16-24 is about 20 percent, while the unemployment rate for the same age group of whites is about 10 percent.  Our Ruling The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data fits Ferguson into Kinder’s claim of youth unemployment of about 40 percent to 45 percent in minority communities. Defining which cities, suburbs and townships are ""minority communities"" is a matter of debate. But it’s worth noting that Ferguson’s youth are not only more unemployed than their peers in St. Louis , they are also significantly more unemployed on average than both white and black 16-24 year-olds across the country. Ferguson was the community in question when Kinder cited the rate of 40 percent to 45 percent of youth unemployment in minority communities — and Ferguson does fit into Kinder’s estimate.

Donald Trump has no evidence that Ted Cruz was responsible for naked Melania ad
","Call it the war over the wives. An ad suggesting that Donald Trump's wife, Melania, might not be modest enough to be first lady started a series of nasty exchanges between Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz that have been the talk of the campaign for more than a week. CNN's Anderson Cooper grilled Trump about the ad during a March 29 interview in Wisconsin, questioning Trump about his accusation, made in a March 22 tweet, that Cruz was responsible for the picture. ""I did not start this,"" Trump told Cooper seven days after the tweet. ""He sent out a picture and he knew very well it was a picture ... "" ""He didn't send out a picture,"" Cooper interrupted. ""It was an anti-Trump super PAC."" When Cooper asked Trump if he had any proof that Cruz was behind the ad, Trump said, ""No. Everybody knows he sent it out. He knew the people in the super PAC. He knew. I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase,"" a reference to the words that accompanied the nude photograph of Mrs. Trump, a model, posed on a rug. ""Meet Melania Trump, your next first lady,"" the ad said. ""Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday,"" a reference to the March 22 Utah primary. ""I didn't send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah. He did,"" said Trump. ""It was his people, who were his friends."" For this fact-check, we'll look at whether Trump is correct that Cruz distributed this Facebook ad containing a nude photograph of Trump's wife.  Federal law says political ads must clearly identify their source, and this one lists the source as a political action committee called Make America Awesome. Such groups are called super PACs because they can spend limitless amounts of money advocating for or against a candidate or a point of view. Super PACs have one major restriction: They can't coordinate their efforts with a candidate's official campaign, which is restricted in its spending. If Cruz did arrange for the ad under the auspices of the super PAC, it would be a serious violation of federal law. The super PAC says . . . ""The Cruz campaign had nothing to do with this ad whatsoever. We didn’t get the image or the idea for the ad from them,"" said Republican strategist Liz Mair, who is behind the super PAC. Make America Awesome, based in Virginia, was founded in December and reports $20,752 in contributions through February, with most of the money that it spent going to small purchases of air time in nine states, according to the Federal Election Commission website. ""I would guess that including money that has come in since our last filing, we have raised about $35,000,"" said Mair. There's also no evidence that the PAC is a front for the Cruz campaign. When we checked the PAC's YouTube page, we found four commercials, only two of which are the standard length for broadcast. The Jan. 20 ""Buyer Beware"" commercial, obviously made on a shoestring budget, includes a light-hearted rundown of nine Republican presidential candidates as breakfast cereals. They include Jeb Bush (""Good source of experience and wonkiness. The brand you know.""), Ben Carson (""With extra nice guy doctorness.""), Chris Christie (""100% RDA of telling it like it is."") and Ted Cruz (""Two Scoops of Conservatism!""). In the ad, the shopper buys the Trump cereal (""Guaranteed success and a free 'Screw the Liberal Establishment!' voucher inside"") and ends up regretting the purchase. Mormon women targeted ""The only ads we've run in favor of any candidate are the three Facebook ads we ran targeting Mormons in Utah and Arizona, of which the Melania one was one, and the one with the least money put behind it (about $300, maybe even less than that, honestly),"" Mair wrote in an email. The Melania ad, she wrote, ""was targeted only to Mormon women of (if I recall correctly) ages 45-65 living in Utah and Arizona who self-identified as moderate, conservative or very conservative. ""The shot we used was chosen because of the presence of handcuffs, which was particularly bothersome to the target audience,"" Mair said. ""However, there are definitely racier shots of her out there that would no doubt be considered more scandalous by a lot of voters across the entire political spectrum — too racy for us to use in Facebook ads, candidly."" Although the ads urge voters to support the Texas senator, he was only one of two viable alternatives to Trump currently on the ballot in those states. Picture purchased? In a March 27 interview with ABC News, Trump claimed Cruz or his campaign bought the rights to the Melania photo and gave it to the super PAC. There's no evidence that Cruz, the campaign or Mair's group purchased rights to the photo, taken when she was Trump's girlfriend. ""The image was, at the time we concepted out and then created the ad, already republished all over the Internet at numerous sites,"" Mair told us in an email. The photographer who took the image for the 2000 photo spread in British GQ, Antoine Verglas, told our friends at FactCheck.org that nobody contacted him to buy rights to the picture. The magazine reprinted that photo, along with other pictures from the shoot, online March 4 under the headline, ""The Future First Lady? Sexy Melania Trump's Nude Photo Shoot."" ""As for Cruz himself,"" Mair said, ""I think I've met him at gatherings attended by many people maybe once or twice in my life (and it will have been some time ago), and I have never spoken to him privately."" We contacted the Trump campaign but didn't get a response. Our ruling Trump said Cruz was responsible for the racy ad questioning whether people wanted Melania Trump to be first lady. One of the tenets of PolitiFact is that the person making the claim is responsible for substantiating it. Trump said on CNN that he has no real proof. And all the evidence we found points to the ad being the work of a political action committee whose goal has been to block Trump's nomination. There’s no proof of Cruz working with that committee, which would be illegal. We rate Trump's claim as False.",/factchecks/2016/mar/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-has-no-evidence-ted-cruz-was-responsi/

Horrified students awoke to the madness and quickly noted Trump’s penchant for the politically controversial. Trump has advocated deporting all illegal immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the U.S. The student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, reported that about 40 students soon staged a campus protest, at one point shouting to the school’s administration: ""You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!"" Then students moved into the administration building calling out: ""It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains."" Critics saw the incident as political correctness run amok at an institution that is supposed to promote free speech and a diversity of ideas. The pundits pounced. The story was carried across the globe. Left-leaning comedian Bill Maher said this: ""I so badly want to dropkick these kids into a place where there is actual pain and suffering."" Larry Wilmore fired off a brutal Comedy Central segment, complete with a fake Emory student (Justice Davenport) who opined: ""I had no idea I went to school with people who had different opinions from me. It’s terrifying."" Newspapers, network television and social media joined the beat-down, many asserting that counseling was being offered to soothe the bruised psyches of the offended students. But that part of the story is off base, Emory spokeswoman Elaine Justice said. ""Emory University did not offer counseling to students as a result of the incident and subsequent controversy,"" Justice said in an email. Part of the counseling confusion comes from a March 22 email sent to students. The email refers to ""emergency funds"" offered ""for student groups seeking to respond to the incident."" But those funds were not for counseling, Justice said. Snopes.com ruled as ""false"" one report that Emory provided ""emergency counseling."" ""Likewise, the (Student Government Association) and College Council offered ‘open office hours’ to their fellow students, not counseling,"" Justice said. But Justice also added this: ""As is the case at every university, counseling is routinely available to all students in whatever circumstances they are experiencing."" Did any Emory student seek that routinely available counseling as a result of the chalkings? Justice said she did not know. Our ruling Various media outlets reported that counseling was specifically offered to Emory students upset over the fact that someone chalked pro-Trump messages on campus. But no funds were provided for any kind of emergency counseling due to the incident. Counseling is routinely provided to Emory students upon request. But there was no organized effort to counsel students due to this specific incident. The university cannot confirm whether any individual students sought routine counseling as a result of the chalkings. And that does create a bit of uncertainty in the dust-up over the Trump chalkings and their aftermath.

Gov. Rick Scott makes misleading claim about record funding for HIV/AIDS prevention
","Asked to explain a discrepancy in the state's number of new HIV cases, Florida Gov. Rick Scott only crowed about how much is being spent on prevention programs. Florida had the dubious distinction of leading the nation in new HIV cases a few months ago, even as the country’s overall trend was declining. Then the Department of Health’s division of disease control revised the numbers, which is a routine practice to get rid of duplicate entries and so forth. But the Tampa Bay Times found that the adjusted total showed only a slight increase in the number of new cases reported since Scott took office in 2011, putting Florida behind California and Texas. The revisions erased one in four cases in 2014, an unprecedented drop that led experts to question the extent of the changes. When the Times asked Scott’s office why the figures were revised so drastically, spokesman John Tupps said only that Scott is ""proud that Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention."" For this fact-check, we are putting Scott to the Truth-O-Meter, and not his spokesman, because this has become a talking point of his administration. Scott made a similar claim in a news release after he signed the 2016-17 budget, saying that ""last year, Florida invested a record $34 million in HIV/AIDS prevention."" Leaving alone the health department’s self-editing for a moment, could it be that the state has spent a record amount combatting HIV/AIDS? Well, the state health department did get more funding for prevention programs in 2015 than ever before. But almost all of that money came from the federal government, not Florida. Federal aid for AIDS prevention Scott is pretty uneven in his distaste for using federal taxpayer money. He has refused $2.4 billion to build a high-speed rail line between Tampa and Orlando and opposed Medicaid expansion under Obamacare because he thought it was too expensive for the state. Meanwhile, he has pleaded for federal disaster declarations and sued Washington for not renewing the Low Income Pool, a temporary pot of federal money used mostly to pay for indigent hospital patients. That brings us to his boast of record prevention program spending. His office directed us to the health department, which cited the same amount. The word choice is interesting, because ""investing"" makes it sound like the state of Florida is spending tens of millions of its own dollars to address a public health crisis. That $34 million, however, is all from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not state coffers. The money is part of an awards process that gives cash to state health departments and some cities that apply for help with curbing HIV/AIDS cases. The CDC awards are for programs like HIV testing, services for HIV-positive patients and their partners, condom distribution and more. It’s not unusual for Florida to be getting money from the federal government for this purpose. The CDC provides most of this funding because the agency is in charge of monitoring and fighting infectious diseases, according to Emily McCloskey, senior manager for policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors. The CDC is the primary source of money to deal with HIV and AIDS, but also other STDs and conditions like hepatitis, tuberculosis, diabetes, arthritis and obesity. Technically, the pot of money at issue is split between prevention programs and testing. Other awards for different programs not included in the total can be obtained in different ways, including directly through county health departments and community based organizations. But as you can see, the amount Scott is touting has indeed gone up: Year Amount awarded by CDC 2011 $19.4 million 2012 $28.3 million 2013 $30.6 million 2014 $33 million 2015 $34 million 2016 $34.8 million Sources: CDC, Florida Department of Health, National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors Florida does add some of its own money to assist with these services. Health department spokeswoman Mara Gambineri told us that an additional $1.4 million in state funding for 2015 was meant ""for a prevention program that includes a public awareness campaign, to operate the HIV hotline and for four targeted outreach coordinators."" When Scott signed the 2016-17 budget just passed by the Legislature, he noted the state contribution for HIV/AIDS services was upped to $1.65 million — out of a total state budget of $82 billion. Of course, a higher total from the CDC isn’t necessarily because the state showed more commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention. As one of the most populous states, it received more CDC funding than any other state except New York and California in 2015. Florida also has a pronounced problem with HIV infections, as the controversy with the state health department’s revisions shows. McCloskey said the CDC overhauled how it awarded grants for the 2012 fiscal year. That accounted not only for the big jump between 2011 and 2012, but affected subsequent years as well. (This particular grant process is due to be revised for 2017.) ""CDC reviewed their funding allocations and formulas and redid the formulas to allocate more funding to states with the largest impact,"" she said. ""That is why Florida has received more funding."" The cash Scott is talking about is awarded based on need, taking into account infection rates and patient population, among other factors. The state does have to apply, but the CDC calculates how much Florida gets.  In short, the state has been getting (and spending) more money from the federal government because Florida has needed the help. Our ruling Scott said, ""Florida is investing record amounts of funding for HIV/AIDS prevention."" There is more money than ever being provided for HIV/AIDS prevention programs, but it’s not because the state has been focused on appropriating millions. The funding to which he is referring is almost entirely coming from the CDC. The state kicks in a little cash, but it’s less than 5 percent of what the federal government supplies. Scott also neglects to mention that the primary reason the amount has increased is because HIV infection rates have gone up in Florida. There’s a grain of truth in the soundbite, but Scott ignores context and obscures facts that would lead to a very different impression about an important public health issue.

McCrory: Local governments can have in-house discrimination policies stricter than the state's
","In what he dubbed a ""myths vs. facts"" press release addressing news reports on North Carolina’s new LGBT law, Gov. Pat McCrory made multiple statements that caused us to raise our eyebrows. In general McCrory has been trying to downplay the effects of the state’s new law, commonly referred to as HB2. We already checked one of his statements, on the possibility of North Carolina losing $4.5 billion in federal education funding due to Title IX violations. McCrory said there’s no threat, citing a federal judge’s opinion. We rated that claim Half True. We also checked McCrory’s statement that this law didn’t take away ""any rights"" in ""any city in North Carolina."" We rated that claim False. Now we’re turning our attention to a claim of his about the ability of cities to strengthen employment policies. The state now recognizes discrimination only against certain groups, not including gay or transgender people. The new law does allow cities and counties to set in-house rules on minimum wage, work hours and other employment-related issues. They can’t impose any such rules on private businesses, but they can make the rules for themselves. When it comes to discrimination rules, however, the issue is much murkier – even despite the governor’s promise that there’s nothing to worry about. ""Does this law prohibit towns, cities or counties in North Carolina from setting their own nondiscrimination policies in employment that go beyond state law?"" McCrory asked in his press release. ""Answer: No. Town(s), cities and counties in North Carolina are still allowed to set stricter non-discrimination policies for their own employees if they choose."" However, the actual wording of the law seems to say the exact opposite. Let’s hear it: ""... the General Statutes supersede and preempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a unit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or imposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of discriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to personnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law."" The end initially appears to say local governments can protect their own employees (""personnel employed by that body"") from discriminatory firing – a phrase that would appear to back up McCrory’s point. But the sentence doesn’t stop there. It continues on: ""except such regulations applicable to personnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law"" (emphasis added). And the new state law says the only discrimination protections recognized in North Carolina are ""race, religion, color, national origin, age, biological sex or handicap."" It defines biological sex as ""The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate."" In Greensboro, town officials are skeptical that McCrory is correct in saying they’ll be able to keep their old, stricter policies that protected transgender people. A memo from the office of City Attorney Tom Carruthers said ""the recent amendments in city policy and ordinance to protect gender identity and gender preference are now probably eliminated."" Carrboro had similar discrimination protections. Like in Greensboro, town leaders think they may now be moot – particularly the protections for transgender employees – despite what McCrory said. ""The bill calls into question – and I’m being careful with my word choice there – it calls into question the ability of local government to ban discrimination based on gender identity (because) that’s not the same as biological sex,"" Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman said. Other town, city or county governments had gender identity discrimination protections that are now in question, including Raleigh, Charlotte, Asheville, Boone and Chapel Hill, and Buncombe, Mecklenberg and Orange counties. According to the News & Observer, Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger cited the loss of in-house anti-discrimination rules as one reason why the town passed a resolution calling for the law’s repeal. ""The greatest sentiment was the loss of local control,"" Hemminger said. Asking law professors So the law says that cities and counties can have stricter discrimination policies, unless they conflict with state law. Most of the affected cities previously had discrimination rules regarding gay and transgender employees. And yet it appears that any attempt to restore their protections – especially for transgender people – would conflict with state law. Why is that exception even included in the bill, if it appears to nullify itself? ""That is a savings clause that saves nothing,"" said Enrique Armijo, a constitutional law professor at Elon University School of Law. Essentially, Armijo argued, it looks important but means nothing. He said it’s ""farcical"" for McCrory to argue that the law allows local governments to set stricter, internal anti-discrimination policies. ""The governor's interest here is in making the law seem like it does a lot less than it does,"" Armijo said. Unfortunately, we don’t know exactly what legal interpretation McCrory was using when he put together his ""myths vs. facts"" press release, which is on his state website, campaign website and was distributed by numerous state agencies. His office did not respond to multiple requests for help clarifying the reasoning behind his statement, or the seeming contradictions in the law. So we went and talked to more law professors. Katharine T. Bartlett, a former dean of Duke University Law School who is now a professor there, said McCrory’s claim seems true. Bartlett teaches and writes about subjects including employment discrimination, gender and the law, gender theory and social change. ""This ‘except such regulations…’ language is very vague,"" she said. ""Perhaps intentionally so, perhaps a result of the rush in which it was enacted. That said, I would read this language to allow local governments to have their own nondiscriminatory policies, as long as they do not impose them on any other employers."" On the other hand is Michael Gerhardt, the Samuel Ashe Distinguished Professor in constitutional law at UNC-Chapel Hill and the director of the school’s Law and Government program. ""I think (McCrory’s) reading is disingenuous,"" Gerhardt said. ""... It seems like (HB2) was motivated to produce a law that was going to override whatever the localities did."" Our ruling Local government leaders are worried they’ll lose local discrimination protections, and two of the three legal experts we spoke with said they have good reason to be. The consensus isn’t unanimous. Bartlett, the former Duke Law dean, argued that McCrory is correct. And even some of the municipal leaders couched their fears, not willing to say their policies are definitely gone. It might be that no one will know for sure until a judge rules one way or the other. But in the meantime, McCrory is telling local governments that they can absolutely keep doing something that the local governments themselves, and several constitutional law professors, don’t necessarily think they can. But McCrory doesn’t offer any legal reasoning for his claim, his office didn’t respond when asked to clarify the seeming contradictions, and the majority of people we spoke to who are involved in the issue directly, or are looking at it from the outside as professors, believe that it’s not nearly so cut-and-dried. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/mar/31/pat-mccrory/mccrory-local-governments-can-have-house-discrimin/

Ted Cruz says EPA tried to regulate puddles and drainage ditches
","Ted Cruz says the Environmental Protection Agency has gone overboard in regulating farms by regulating even puddles and ditches. ""They're hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive. They're hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms,"" Cruz said in a March 29 CNN town hall in Milwaukee, Wis. ""For example, the Waters of the United States Rule (is) where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations."" Are puddles and drainage ditches regulated by the EPA? We’ll wade through the research to find out. A Cruz spokesman did not answer our questions for this fact-check. What a water rule said about puddles  The Clean Water Act passed in 1972 after high-profile disasters and pollution problems, including the Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio and fish kills at Florida’s Lake Thonotosassa in 1969. The goal of the act was to regulate discharges into water, but for years industry groups and environmental advocates debated which bodies of water should be included. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the law’s reach. In May 2015, the EPA announced a new rule intended to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act. But within months it was put on hold nationwide pending litigation and remaind on hold as of the writing of this fact-check -- a key point that Cruz omitted. The crux of the rule wasn’t the size of the bodies of water, but whether a body of water could carry pollution into other larger waters. The EPA wants to regulate tributaries, ponds, streams and wetlands to prevent businesses, farms or other entities from dumping waste into the water. Before the rule was finalized, the EPA invited public comment and the regulation of puddles became a talking point for conservatives and business advocates who bashed the rule as federal overreach. To clear up matters, the final rule explicitly addressed the question of puddles: ""The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so."" The American Farm Bureau Federation has argued that the rule language was so broad that it could ultimately include something not much larger than a puddle. Spokesman William Rodger says that puddles could be classified as ""vernal pools"" or ""wetlands"" and then fall under the EPA’s jurisdiction. ""We stand by our assertion that puddles – as commonly understood by the average person – can be regulated under the Waters of the United States rule,"" he said in response to our questions about Cruz’s statement But multiple environmental experts have told PolitiFact Florida that they were skeptical that the EPA would end up regulating puddles. ""It is an absurd assertion,"" William L. Andreen, University of Alabama law professor, told PolitiFact Florida in October. ""There are no cases on point because the agencies have never asserted jurisdiction in such fantastical situations."" What the water rule said about ditches The EPA had previously interpreted the Clean Water Act to include jurisdiction over ditches but sought to provide clarity with the new rule, which also contained the puddle exclusion. The rule does not regulate most ditches, according to the EPA. Here is what it does say about ditches: ""The rule continues the current policy of regulating ditches that are constructed in tributaries or are relocated tributaries or, in certain circumstances drain wetlands, or that science clearly demonstrates are functioning as a tributary. These jurisdictional waters affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of downstream waters. The rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation."" Farmers feared that ditches that flow only during or after a rain would be classified in a way that would put them under enforcement. U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, raised that concern in a March 22 congressional hearing. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said that even if it rains hard and looks like there’s streams everywhere, those don’t count, she said. ""It only has to be something that is constructed or natural that really can impact the downstream water. After that, there's no connection,"" McCarthy said. The EPA wrote in a response to comments about ditches: ""The agencies do not intend to increase the number of ditches that are jurisdictional. In fact, by clarifying and expanding the specific exclusions for ditches, the agencies anticipate that more ditches will be clearly excluded in comparison to previous regulations and guidance related to waters of the U.S."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""The EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations."" The EPA’s water rule specifically excludes puddles. It only applies to ditches that are constructed out of streams or ditches that function like streams and could carry pollution to downstream waters. Cruz omits that the water rule was put on hold by the courts in 2015 pending litigation.

Is GOP helping pay for campaign of Supreme Court justice who 'skipped court' for lobby event?
","One of the knocks against Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley is that she was elevated quickly to the high court because of her ties to state Republicans, particularly Gov. Scott Walker. State Court of Appeals Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who is challenging Bradley in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election, produced a TV ad that hits on that theme. The ad, released March 15, 2016, claims the Republican Party ""is helping pay for"" Bradley's campaign and that Bradley ""recently skipped court to attend an event paid for"" by Walker’s ""lobbyist friends.""
Skipped court is an exaggeration. But the other two parts of Kloppenburg’s claim are on target. GOP help Kloppenburg's campaign cited a Bradley campaign report filed with the state that lists contributions received in January 2016. The state GOP made $8,242 in in-kind contributions, for robo-calls and for wages for its own staff. Meanwhile, the Clark County Republican Party gave $100 in cash and the Dane County GOP $20 in cash, Bradley reported. Another Bradley report showed the Washington County GOP in December 2015 gave $500 in cash and $400 in in-kind donations, for food and beverages at a fundraising event. So, in total, the state and county GOP party organizations have given a total of $9,262 in cash and in-kind contributions to Bradley’s campaign. (According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign finances, through Feb. 1, 2016 Bradley had raised a total of $317,792 and Kloppenburg had raisaed $335,693.) Bradley’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information for this fact check. Also in December 2015, ahead of the three-way primary in February 2016, the chairman of the state Republican Party, Brad Courtney, sent a mass email seeking volunteers to help gather signatures for Bradley. To get on the ballot, the candidates needed at least 2,000 signatures. (While Bradley is widely acknowledged as politically conservative, Kloppenburg is widely regarded as liberal, in part because of $18,000 in contributions her campaign has received from the Madison teachers union and because she has made contributions over the years to Democratic candidates.) 'Skipped court' The part of the claim that says Bradley skipped court exaggerates what happened. The Supreme Court was hearing oral arguments in a case on Feb. 24, 2016 and Bradley left about 15 minutes early. She did not miss an entire session, as the Kloppenburg claim suggests. A Bradley campaign spokeswoman said at the time that Bradley reviewed the briefs and did not have any other questions on the case when she left the arguments. Bradley left so she could speak to an annual gathering put on by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobbying group and a heavy spender in past court races. Conservative Justice Michael Gableman also left the arguments early to attend the event. Liberal justice Ann Walsh said at the time it is rare for justices to leave oral arguments early. But it was later reported she had left oral arguments 30 minutes early in February 2015 in order to speak to the Wisconsin Counties Association as part of her own re-election campaign. 'Lobbyist friends' Bradley was appointed to the Supreme Court in October 2015 by Walker, five months after he appointed her to the Court of Appeals. Walker also put Bradley on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, in 2012, and she later won election to that judgeship. Walker has long enjoyed the backing of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. Two examples: A WMC executive was a member of Walker’s transition team after Walker was elected in 2010. The conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth -- whom Walker had urged donors to give to -- gave $2.5 million to WMC, which in turn ran ads promoting Walker when he fended off a recall in 2012. Our rating Kloppenburg says the GOP ""is helping pay for"" Bradley's campaign and ""she recently skipped court to attend an event paid for by"" Walker's ""lobbyist friends."" The state and county Republican parties have given $9,262 in cash and in-kind contributions to Bradley's campaign. She didn't entirely skip court one day, but did leave oral arguments the Supreme Court was hearing early in order to speak at a Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce event. WMC, the state's largest business lobby, is a major supporter of Walker. We rate Kloppenburg's statement Mostly True. (Note: This item was updated to clarify that in-kind contributions from the state GOP paid for wages for its own staff, not for Bradley's campaign staff.)",/factchecks/2016/mar/31/joanne-kloppenburg/gop-helping-pay-campaign-wisconsin-supreme-court-j/
"['Regulation', 'Missouri', 'Catherine Hanaway']","
Hanaway isn't exaggerating the extreme length of Missouri's barber code
","At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, former Speaker of the Missouri House Catherine Hanaway managed to work barbers and the Bible into the same sentence. ""The barber regulation here in Missouri is 10,000 words long. … The book of Revelation is 10,000 words long. Surely we can tell a barber how many combs to have in fewer words than it takes to describe Armageddon."" What struck us about Hanaway’s claim — other than the relative importance of a barber’s toolkit and Judgment Day — was the sheer volume of regulations. Are there really 10,000 words regulating the people who cut our hair? Barbers are governed by the Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners, a division of the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration. So, just how long are these regulations? Well, Hanaway could’ve picked something much longer than Revelation. We copied the full statutes and regulations governing barbers and cosmetologists into GoogleDocs and the word count was nearly 60,000. Even after removing the chapters that only apply to cosmetologists, the total is about 40,000. When we ran Revelation through the word count, we came up with about 12,000. When we dove into all 60,000 words, we found that most of the regulations have to do with licensing and training requirements. In order to work as a barber in Missouri, you have to attend a barber school and earn a license. And in order to teach students to be barbers, schools have to meet certain standards. The rules also cover sanitation codes and apprenticeships. Splitting hairs Hanaway said we shouldn’t need so many words to tell a barber how many combs to have. But that’s not exactly what the regulations are for. There is no statute requiring the guy cutting your hair at Supercuts to have at least five combs. There is one rule that calls for a specific number of combs, but it applies exclusively to barber schools. Schools are required to provide their students with training kits that contain, among other things, at least four combs. A little off the top So why would Hanaway bring up an obscure barber school statute at the gubernatorial debate? It’s not the first time she's mentioned it. In 2015, Hanaway met with Phelps County Republicans and brought up the same 10,000-word figure. Her campaign website even pledges to ""Start cutting away at overly long, overly burdensome regulations like the more than 10,000 words regulating our state’s barbers."" We reached out to Hanaway’s campaign about why she chose to highlight barbers and heard back from Will Scharf, policy director of Hanaway for Governor. Scharf called barbers an ""instructive example"" of over-regulation and part of a larger plan from Hanaway to ""institute a moratorium on all new non-emergency regulations"" if elected. Hanaway isn’t alone in her goal of trimming barber regulations, either. In 2013, a bill that would have made earning a license optional for service providers such as barbers and cosmetologists earned support from several Republicans, but ultimately the bill failed to pass. Scharf told us that Hanaway’s views are separate from that legislation. However, if such a bill were to pass, attending a barber school would be optional and the number of combs in a toolkit made moot. Our ruling Hanaway said there are 10,000 words of regulations for barbers in Missouri, the same number that are in the book of Revelation. The Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners Statutes and Regulations isn’t just as long as the book of Revelation — it’s much longer. The numbers more than make her point.

Pat McCrory is wrong when he says North Carolina's new LGBT law doesn't take away existing rights
","Ever since North Carolina passed a new state law banning cities and counties from enacting their own ordinances on discrimination laws, minimum wages and more, Republican leaders have been on the defensive in the face of national attention. A major talking point has been that, even despite the new law, nothing has actually changed. Gov. Pat McCrory has said as much in person as well as in written statements. Other GOP leaders who supported the bill have done the same. ""We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina, from Raleigh to Durham to Chapel Hill to Charlotte,"" McCrory said at a press conference Monday. ""Every city and every corporation has the exact same discrimination policy this week as they had two weeks ago."" We’re going to focus specifically on the claim about cities. When asked about it at that press conference Monday, McCrory said he was blindsided by the question and couldn’t answer it. The reporter had asked, specifically, about the status of a housing discrimination ordinance in Greensboro and a policy in Raleigh that said any contractors who wanted to do business with the local government needed to have policies forbidding discrimination against gay or transgender people. Carrboro also has a similar policy for contractors. A spokesman for the governor later said local housing ordinances wouldn’t be affected, citing a part of the bill that exempts ""any private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public."" But he had no answers about Carrboro and Raleigh on Monday. He didn’t respond to a follow-up email sent Wednesday. Another spokesman responded only to say he wasn’t the right person to ask. Perhaps that’s because the law does invalidate those ordinances. ""He’s completely wrong about that, unfortunately,"" said Carrboro’s town attorney, Nick Herman, about McCrory’s claim that the law doesn’t take away any existing rights. Herman said the governor’s comments surprised him. Carrboro, for years, has had a policy that contractors paid by the town must have anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation or gender identity. And HB2 specifically says that local governments do not have the right to put any such requirements on contractors. ""I was absolutely shocked to hear that the governor – I give him all presumption of good faith – but for him to claim this bill does not change existing law means he is not being adequately advised,"" Herman said. More towns and counties around the state also had in-house anti-discrimination policies that protected local government employees on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. McCrory has also said those won’t go away, although some of the officials in those municipalities say they’re skeptical. We interviewed three law professors about it; two disagreed with McCrory and one agreed with him. No more state claims for discrimination Taking a broader look at the law, it also took away a right that had previously been available to residents of any and every city in the state – the ability to file a state lawsuit over discriminatory firing. Such claims had been accepted by state courts since the 1980s, but they are no longer valid under HB2. ""This Article does not create, and shall not be construed to create or support, a statutory or common law private right of action, and no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy expressed herein,"" the law states. ""This is a seismic issue,"" said Eric Doggett, a Raleigh lawyer who works in employment discrimination. ""It’s huge. It’s a massive loss of rights, and it happened with almost no debate."" Laura Noble, a Chapel Hill employment discrimination lawyer, agreed. ""I won’t refer to this as a ‘bathroom bill’ because that's really not what it's about,"" she said. ""It’s about the elimination of discrimination protections."" The law does say people who believe they were fired for discriminatory reasons can still bring suits to the state executive branch’s Human Resource Commission. But Doggett said that group doesn’t have the ability to award damages, like the state courts did until last Wednesday. ""There’s no remedy,"" he said. ""They have no teeth. … If we state it's the public policy of this state not to discriminate on those bases, it doesn’t mean anything if we can't enforce it."" Noble concurred, saying that no matter the state discrimination policy is now, it’s largely meaningless. ""What's the point of having it on the books if there's no sanctions if someone violates it?"" She said. People can still file federal discrimination lawsuits. However, both attorneys said federal courts have a much shorter statute of limitations than state courts – less than six months, compared to three years – which often stops plaintiffs from suing if they have a case but waited too long. Debbie Durban, a corporate attorney with Nelson Mullins who practices in North and South Carolina, has experience defending businesses from discrimination claims. She also said her understanding of the bill is that it takes away state lawsuits, although she said most state claims eventually end up at the federal level anyway. Our ruling McCrory said that with the passage of HB2, ""we have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina."" That is not true. It took away the rights of cities to put certain anti-discrimination requirements on private contractors, and it nullified existing policies like in Carrboro and Raleigh. It might have also taken away the rights of cities and counties to pass their own in-house anti-discrimination policies, depending on which lawyer you ask. And it takes away the right of everyone in North Carolina to file a state-level lawsuit alleging a discriminatory firing, according to attorneys who represent both employers and employees in those cases. But even if you discount the discrimination lawsuit changes and only focus on municipal government powers and rights, McCrory is still wrong.

Donald Trump: Michelle Fields changed her story since first claiming campaign manager grabbed her
","Donald Trump is maintaining the innocence of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was arrested March 29 and charged with simple battery for forcefully grabbing a reporter. Following a March 8 press conference in Jupiter, Fla., Michelle Fields, at the time a writer for the conservative website Breitbart, tried to ask Trump a question as he was leaving. Lewandowski allegedly grabbed Fields’ arm and pulled her away, leaving bruises. When news of the incident started to spread, Lewandowski tweeted at Fields, saying, ""you are totally delusional. I never touched you."" But security footage of the event released by the Jupiter Police Department March 29 appears to show Lewandowski grabbing Fields.    (video from the Washington Post) Despite the recent video, Trump said Lewandowski didn’t misrepresent what happened. Rather, it’s Fields who is being deceptive, he said. ""(Fields) said she went to the ground, or something to the effect of she almost went to the ground,"" Trump said at a March 29 CNN town hall. ""She was in pain. She went to the ground. When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed. She didn't talk about it."" Trump asked on Twitter why no one was checking to see how Fields’ story changed, and Fields responded, ""Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop lying."" Did Fields change her story on what happened between her and Lewandowski? It appears not. We couldn’t find an example of her publicly retelling what happened since the second week of March when the story first unfolded. And since the security footage became public March 29, Fields has not yet given an interview. We tried to reach Trump and Fields and did not hear back. At the CNN town hall, Trump said Fields’ initial claim was that she fell to the ground or that she almost fell to the ground. It was the latter. ""I was jolted backwards,"" Fields wrote March 10. ""Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken."" The Washington Post’s Ben Terris witnessed the incident and wrote a similar account the same day. ""As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, (Fields) pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question,"" Terris wrote. ""I watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s 41-year-old campaign manager."" Lewandowski and the Trump campaign immediately denied Fields’ accusation. ""The accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false,"" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. ""As one of the dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident."" Fields stood by her account of what happened in a March 14 interview with Fox’s Megyn Kelly. ""This is a campaign that continues to lie,"" she said. ""I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation."" Following the incident, Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak published a report where he questioned whether it was actually Lewandowski who grabbed Fields rather than another man. Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned. Since the security footage came out in the past couple days, though, Pollak has admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, conversely, said the footage ""exonerates"" Lewandowski ""totally."" It doesn’t; it looks from the video as if he did grab her — and the police report says the video is consistent with what Fields alleged. Trump also criticized Fields for allegedly grabbing him to ask a question and for holding a pen. While somewhat expected for a reporter to have a pen handy, Trump said it could have been a ""little bomb"" or a knife.  Our ruling Trump said that when Michelle Fields ""found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed."" We see no evidence that Fields’ story about her altercation with Trump’s campaign manager has changed. She gave an initial account and hasn't backed off of it.
