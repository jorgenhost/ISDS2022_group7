Yes, Congress has disproportionate share of millionaires, but claim's numbers are off
","With income inequality a persistent hot topic in the Democratic presidential primary, it’s not surprising that a familiar meme is circulating on Facebook claiming that Congress is far richer than the public. The Facebook post says that 50% of Congress is made up of millionaires, compared with only 1% of America as a whole. Similar Facebook posts have circulated at least since 2011, but we wanted to find more current numbers.  Unlike many of the statements we fact-check on Facebook, this one has some truth to it. A key analysis showed that close to half of the House and Senate members are millionaires. We couldn’t find a source that said 1% of the American public are millionaires, but we do know that it’s far less than in Congress. The post was recently flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post says: ""Let that sink in and tell me again how you become a multi millionaire earning $174,000 annually?"" That is the salary for members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, with leadership positions paying slightly more. But many members were wealthy before they arrived. The Center for Responsive Politics compiles financial disclosures of members of Congress. Those disclosure forms do not require exact values so the reports show the value of assets and liabilities within a range. The intent of the disclosures is to highlight potential conflicts of interest, not give a complete accounting of a member’s personal valuation, according to the center. The center’s data for 2016 shows the members’ financial data in three categories: minimum net worth, average and maximum net worth. If we use the average net worth category for the House and Senate, it showed about 48% have worths of at least $1 million. The richest member was then-U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. who had a net wealth of about $324 million and made much of his wealth from a car alarm company. Roll Call analyzed 530 members by their by their minimum net worths. By that measurement, there are 207 who are worth at least $1 million. That method results in about 39% of the members being millionaires. It’s clear that the wealth of Congress is disproportionate to the general public, but by how much? According to the Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve Board, 12% of family economic units had $1 million or more of net wealth (all assets minus all debts), said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. A family economic unit consists of the heads of the families and dependents who live with them.  We found some other analyses about how many Americans are millionaires, but none were the 1% cited in the Facebook post.  Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report showed that there are approximately 18.6 million Americans with a net worth in excess of $1 million, which works out to about 8% of the adult population. Spectrem Group found that in 2018, there were 11.8 million American households with a net worth of at least $1 million. That works out to about 5% of the adult population. The market research firm quantifies millionaire households by net worth, not including primary residence.  It’s possible that when the Facebook post said that 1% of people are millionaires, it was referring to annual income, which is different than net wealth. Net worth includes a person’s cash, home value, stocks, bonds and other property minus any debts owed. But if we used income as the benchmark, the calculation for Congress would be different. The House and Senate members don’t earn $1 million in their salary, but some earn investment income.  For the population as a whole, IRS data for 2017 showed about 500,000 tax returns had incomes of at least $1 million. There were about 104 million tax returns filed, so that means less than 1 percent were for people who earned at least $1 million. RELATED STORY: Bernie Sanders has entered millionaire class, tax returns show RELATED FACT-CHECK: Fact-checking Joe Biden's claim that he was among the poorest in government A Facebook post said 50% of the members of Congress are millionaires compared with only 1% of the American public as a whole. The number of millionaires in Congress is hard to pinpoint precisely, because they disclose their finances in ranges. But data from the Center for Responsive Politics showed that about 48% were worth at least $1 million. The post understates the number of millionaires among the public. A more accurate number would be between 5% and 12%. But the general point that millionaires in Congress far outpace those among citizens is correct. This statement rates Half True.      ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C100240>],/factchecks/2020/jan/22/facebook-posts/yes-congress-has-disproportionate-share-millionair/

"['Immigration', 'North Carolina', 'Thom Tillis']","
Thom Tillis says Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies. Not quite.
","Like many Republicans up for election, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis is putting immigration at the forefront of his campaign. And to contrast himself with his Democratic opponents, he’s pointing to state-level policies. In a Jan. 10 email newsletter, the Tillis campaign said Democrats Cal Cunningham and NC Sen. Erica Smith support ""sanctuary policies."" The headline says: ""Sanctuary policies result in gruesome violence, do Cunningham and Smith still support them?"" The email goes on to talk about an ""illegal immigrant"" who was released from jail in Mecklenburg County ""despite the objections"" of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (also known as ICE). Is it true that Cunningham and Smith support sanctuary policies? Not quite. Cunningham and Smith opposed a bill that would require North Carolina sheriffs to detain people on behalf of ICE. But neither has flat-out endorsed sanctuary policies. Each Democrat has said they believe local governments should have the flexibility to comply or not.  About HB 370 There’s no single definition of what constitutes a ""sanctuary city."" The term is loosely applied to cities or states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.  In some states, a city can ban its law enforcement from cooperating with ICE (thus earning the term ""sanctuary city."") But in North Carolina, sanctuary cities are banned. Former Gov. Pat McCrory signed a law prohibiting municipalities from blocking ICE cooperation. However, sheriffs still had (and still have) some wiggle room. Sheriffs can decide independently whether they want to comply with ICE. As PolitiFact NC has reported, ICE detainers aren’t valid warrants. So a handful of Democratic sheriffs declined to honor detainers. They said they didn’t want to use local resources for federal business, and they feared that cooperating with ICE would harm relationships with their Hispanic constituents. That brings us to the Tillis campaign’s argument.  North Carolina lawmakers last year considered a bill that would’ve required sheriffs to comply with ICE. More specifically, the bill -- labeled House Bill 370 --  would’ve required North Carolina sheriffs to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the terms of their jail sentence if requested to do so by ICE.   Contacted by PolitiFact, Tillis spokesman Andrew Romero said the campaign’s claim is based on Cunningham and Smith opposing House Bill 370. (PolitiFact has written about HB 370 previously, when President Trump made a Mostly False claim about Democratic congressional candidate Dan McCready.) The GOP-controlled state legislature passed HB 370. But Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it, so it never became law. What Cunningham said The Tillis campaign cited an interview Cunningham conducted with WFAE in Charlotte. Reporter Steve Harrison asked Cunningham if he agreed with the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s decision to ignore ICE detainer requests. Cunningham said: ""I tend to trust law enforcement to discharge its duty,"" adding that Mecklenburg voters elected the sheriff and have the power to hold him accountable. ""I trust the voters in Mecklenburg County to weigh in on exactly that,"" he said. ""Here’s what I know. That law enforcement makes difficult decisions every day. And as a United States senator, it’s not my job to second guess, it’s my job to make sure they have the resources they need to keep their communities safe."" The Tillis campaign also noted Cunningham’s opposition to a federal bill Tillis introduced. The bill that would compel local law enforcement officials to comply with federal detainer requests or face possible civil action by victims and the loss of federal grants. Asked about the bill, Cunningham campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson accused Tillis of ""threatening funding for North Carolina to score cheap political points,"" the Charlotte Observer reported. What Smith said As for Smith, she voted against HB 370 when it was before the state Senate. She also talked about the bill during a couple interviews. Speaking with WFAE, Smith cited some of the same arguments as Cunningham. But she also said she would be OK with local law enforcement honoring ICE detainer requests so long as the federal government paid for the costs. ""I'm fine (with sheriffs) detaining them if the federal government is going to foot the bill and do their jobs. Certainly, we do not want the release of people who are a threat to public safety,"" she said. ""But if ICE and Department of Homeland really wants us to close their detention, then they should pay for it. They're getting taxpayer dollars to do just that."" Speaking with Tim Boyum on Spectrum News, Smith made the same argument. ""If you want the sheriffs to enforce and detain illegal immigrants, then send them the appropriations and the funding. That is the US Senate’s responsibility."" Our ruling Tillis said Cunningham and Smith support ""sanctuary policies.""  Both candidates oppose a bill that would require sheriffs to comply with ICE. But that’s not the same as endorsing sanctuary cities. In fact, Smith said she would support a sheriff’s decision to comply with ICE if ICE offered financial assistance. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097076BC0>],/factchecks/2020/jan/22/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-says-cunningham-and-smith-support-sanc/
"['National', 'Impeachment', 'Pat Cipollone']","
In Senate trial, Pat Cipollone was wrong on GOP access to SCIF depositions
","On the first full day of President Donald Trump’s Senate impeachment trial, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone claimed that House Democrats had run roughshod over the president’s procedural rights by denying Republicans access to key parts of the investigation. Cipollone had several complaints, but one stood out to us as clearly wrong.  ""Not even (House Intelligence Chairman Adam) Schiff’s Republican colleagues were allowed into the SCIF"" during the House impeachment investigation, Cipollone said on the Senate floor Jan. 21. (A ""SCIF,"" which stands for ""sensitive compartmented information facility,"" is a secure government facility where classified intelligence can be discussed without eavesdropping.) Cipollone’s assertion echoed one made by, and on behalf of, a group of Republicans who staged a sit-in at the House Intelligence committee, to protest what they argued were unfair ground rules for the Republican minority during the House impeachment inquiry. On Oct. 23, more than 40 Republican lawmakers disrupted witness testimony by storming the SCIF where depositions were under way, chanting, ""Let us in!""  At the time of the sit-in, Republicans could argue that that the impeachment hearings had only taken place behind closed doors and without transcripts being formally released. (Those transcripts were later released to the public, minus redactions for national-security reasons.) But what about access to the depositions at the Intelligence Committee? Were all Republicans banned? No.  In the recent impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., instructed three House committees — Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs — to carry out an investigation that the House Judiciary Committee eventually used to draft articles of impeachment. All three committees and all of their members had access to depositions in the SCIF.  There are nine Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, 17 on the House Oversight Committee, and 21 on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  All 47 of those Republicans have been able to participate and ask questions in the interviews and depositions held to this point, Ashley Etienne, Pelosi’s communications director, told PolitiFact last October. Independent experts told us the same thing. Some Republican House members, such as Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, were kept out of the hearings not because of their party affiliation, but because they did not sit not on the relevant committees. (Democrats who weren’t on the committees were kept out as well.) Some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, chose not to attend despite being able to do so. The proof is also in the transcripts that were publicly released: Republican lawmakers and staff asked questions of witnesses, with the witness responding under oath. One analysis by Philip Bump of the Washington Post found that Republican lawmakers made extensive use of their questioning powers in the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a member of the National Security Council. He did this by tallying up the number of lines devoted to each party’s remarks in the transcript that was eventually released. ""About 44% of the transcript is made up of questions or answers from Democratic members or staff,"" Bump wrote. ""About 41% is from the Republicans. The remaining 15% was discussion and objections."" Neither the White House nor Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign replied to our query asking for evidence that backed Cipollone’s claim. Cipollone said, ""Not even Schiff’s Republican colleagues were allowed into the SCIF"" during the House impeachment investigation. Not only were they allowed in, but there’s voluminous evidence in the deposition transcripts that they asked questions extensively and received answers under oath.  We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C090340>],/factchecks/2020/jan/21/pat-cipollone/senate-trial-pat-cipollone-was-wrong-gop-access-sc/
"['Impeachment', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Yes, every past impeachment trial included witnesses. Baldwin hits mark with Trump-related claim
","Witnesses have been a key point of debate in the lead up to President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial before the U.S. Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., delayed sending the Senate the articles of impeachment while seeking —among other things — a commitment to call witnesses from Republicans who control the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed to force votes on witnesses and documents in the Republican-controlled chamber. Democrats say avoiding witnesses would be tantamount to a cover-up. And Wisconsin’s Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, said it would also be breaking with centuries of tradition. ""Every other impeachment trial the Senate has ever had, including those for other federal officials aside from the two presidential impeachments … has included witnesses,"" Baldwin said in a Jan. 19, 2020, appearance on WISN-TV’s ‘UpFront’ program. Have witnesses really been called in every other Senate impeachment? Let’s break out the history books. The Senate has held just two prior impeachment trials against presidents — Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. Both included witnesses. The Senate heard testimony from 41 witnesses in the Johnson proceeding, and three for Clinton, including Monica Lewinsky. In the Clinton case, House managers obtained depositions from the witnesses and excerpts of that testimony were shown to the Senate, the Washington Post reported. But those aren’t the only impeachments the Senate has heard. The U.S. Senate website lists 19 people prior to Trump who were impeached by the House, including 14 judges, a senator, a Supreme Court justice and the secretary of war. Cases against three of the judges were halted before a trial when the judges resigned, and the case against Sen. William Blount in 1799 — the first impeachment in U.S. history — stopped before trial when the Senate determined it didn’t have such jurisdiction over one of its own. That leaves 13 impeachment trials against other federal officials dating back to 1804. Eight of those yielded a guilty verdict, and five a not-guilty finding. But all of them involved witnesses, said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""I think there was a little bit of a sense — as there often is with things like Senate procedure — that the precedent is ambiguous and can be used however you want it,"" Bookbinder told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""We found that it’s not ambiguous in this case. … Every Senate impeachment trial that has been completed has involved witnesses."" Lawyers and researchers from the organization dug through Congressional archives and historical records for every impeachment for Bookbinder’s Jan. 9, 2020, op-ed in the Washington Post. His group is a nonpartisan, nonprofit watchdog that seeks to promote ethics in government and reduce the influence of money in politics. Asked for evidence of Baldwin’s claim, her staff simply pointed to the Washington Post rundown.  Bookbinder’s piece also noted three recent trials have involved witnesses not called during the House phase of the impeachment proceedings: Judge Walter Nixon in 1989, Clinton and Judge Thomas Porteous in 2010. The piece said in part: ""Although at least one senator has suggested that the Senate has no duty to go beyond testimony obtained by the House, that has happened on multiple occasions. The Senate heard from seven witnesses at Walter Nixon’s trial who had not testified before the House; three at Clinton’s trial who also had not testified before the House; and 17 at Porteous’s trial who had not testified before the House."" Baldwin said every impeachment trial in Senate history has included witnesses. The research backs up her claim, though there are a few things to note. The Clinton impeachment involved video depositions, not live witnesses. And four people impeached by the House didn’t have a full trial in the Senate. But the 15 people who faced a full trial in the Senate all saw witnesses called. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097836D40>],/factchecks/2020/jan/21/tammy-baldwin/Trump-every-other-senate-impeachment-had-witnesses/
"['Impeachment', 'Sports', 'Wisconsin', 'Mike Gallagher']","
House did not impeach Trump for third time or for criticizing NFL
","As the U.S. Senate begins its trial of President Donald Trump, based on impeachment articles approved by the House, congressional Republicans have blasted Democrats for what they say was an attempt to remove him from office long before the official Dec. 18, 2019 vote.  In a Dec. 20, 2019 appearance on WTMJ radio’s Steve Scaffidi Show, U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher added his voice to the fray.  Gallagher, R-Wis., argued that the ""common-sense Wisconsinite"" would rather resolve Trump’s future at the ballot box come November. Gallagher, elected in 2016, represents the 8th District, which includes the Fox Valley and Green Bay.  ""Isn’t this the third impeachment vote you’ve had in the House? Which it is,"" Gallagher told Scaffidi. ""They tried to impeach Trump for criticizing the NFL and for some other things.""  Is Gallagher right? And how does football fit in?  Let’s break it down.  Falling back on old votes  When asked to provide evidence for Gallagher’s claim, his press secretary Jordan Dunn pointed to the same three House roll call votes that Gallagher’s colleague from southeastern Wisconsin, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, used to make a claim about impeachment about a week earlier.  Each of the votes overwhelmingly tabled impeachment resolutions offered by U.S. Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. The first vote took place Dec. 6, 2017, the second Jan. 18, 2018, and the third July 17, 2019 — days before the Ukraine call that triggered the official impeachment inquiry.  Like Sensenbrenner, Gallagher’s office claimed that lawmakers who voted ""no"" on the motion to table the impeachment measure were actually casting a ""yes"" vote on impeachment.  But, as we reported before, experts told us those two actions can’t be conflated.  ""In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,"" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. ""It is not technically a direct vote on the substance of the resolution."" Thus, there never was a vote on the merits of any of Green’s measures.  Though one can surely argue at least some Democrats were convinced Trump had committed impeachable offenses before the Ukraine call, no one cast an ""impeachment vote"" until Dec. 18. That’s when Trump was impeached over allegations he withheld aid to Ukraine and asked the country to open an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. So Gallagher is off point on the first part of the claim. Impeachment and NFL criticism  What about the idea Democrats wanted to impeach Trump for criticizing the NFL? The text of Green’s 2017 resolution references a statement in which Trump took aim at professional football players — following the lead of former quarterback Colin Kapernick — who had begun to kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice.  At a Sept. 23, 2017 campaign rally in Huntsville, Ala., the president said:  ""Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he’s fired? He’s fired!’""  But Green’s resolution admonished Trump for ""inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of race and gender,"" not for chastising the football league itself.  Indeed, in May 2018, when the NFL released a policy warning that players who protested during the national anthem would face consequences, Trump commended the league.  Moreover, that paragraph was just one of 11 instances Green cited as examples of why the president should be impeached.  Others included Trump’s referring to members of hate groups that marched in Charlottesville, Va/, in 2017 as ""very fine people,"" his call for a complete ban on Muslims entering the U.S., banning transgender people from serving in the military, arguing that the federal government gave too much help to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and issuing several disparaging statements about U.S. Rep Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, who is African American.  To claim that some representatives wanted Trump impeached solely over NFL criticism is a mischaracterization of the facts.  Our rating Gallagher claimed that the Dec. 18 House impeachment vote was the third by Democrats — ""They tried to impeach Trump for criticizing the NFL and for some other things.""  But both parts of the claim fall flat.  The three roll call votes he referred to weren’t impeachment votes — they were procedural votes to set aside debate on impeachment measures. Experts told us that the ""no"" votes cannot be interpreted as a vote on the merits of impeachment.  As for the NFL, the reference to a Trump NFL-related statement was offered as evidence for the allegation that Trump was attempting to divide the country based on race and gender. Even that was just one of 11 different points cited in the resolution. We rate Gallagher’s claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C090100>],/factchecks/2020/jan/21/mike-gallagher/house-did-not-impeach-trump-third-time-or-criticiz/

","A Facebook post claims that far more people tuned in to watch a rally for President Donald Trump than to view the Democratic presidential debate televised the same night. ""CNN reports DemDebate had 2.3 million viewers. Trump rally had 6.7 million last night!"" said a Jan. 15 Facebook post, published a day after the Democratic debate in Iowa and the Trump rally in Wisconsin.  The post, shared more than 700 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s inaccurate. CNN said the debate had an average 7.3 million television viewers, plus 4 million live starts on CNN’s platforms such as CNN.com and mobile apps. (Live starts refers to the number of times a play button was clicked on during a live event, or if a user opened the CNNgo app via Apple TV and selected ""live TV"" to start playing the debate.) The debate started at 9 p.m. eastern time and ended shortly after 11 p.m., and Trump’s rally began shortly after 8 p.m. eastern time. He spoke for about 1.5 hours at the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena in Milwaukee, Wisc. (The arena’s capacity is 12,700.) Neither the White House nor Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign provided viewership numbers for Trump’s Milwaukee rally.  Fox Business channel aired the rally in its entirety. It had about 662,000 total viewers during the 8 p.m. time slot, and about 476,000 total viewers in the 9 p.m. hour, according to Nielsen data.  Fox News channel’s 8 p.m. show, ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" aired the rally for 1 minute and had about 3.3 million total viewers for the show’s entirety. Fox News’ 9 p.m. show, ""Hannity,"" aired it for 12 minutes and the show had about 3.4 million total viewers. (Those two shows usually have about that many viewers.) MSNBC did not air the rally, according to a review of MSNBC programming on the media monitoring service TVEyes. An ABC spokesperson said the network did not air the rally live on television, and while it did provide streaming of the event online at ABC News Live, it did not provide viewer numbers. PolitiFact also asked CBS and NBC if they aired the rally live in its entirety or in part, but we did not get a response. A Facebook post said, ""CNN reports DemDebate had 2.3 million viewers. Trump rally had 6.7 million last night!"" The post vastly underreported the viewership numbers for the Democratic debate aired on CNN; there were 7.3 million viewers on TV alone. As to the number of viewers the Trump rally received, we know that Fox Business, a cable channel that aired the rally in its entirety (as CNN did for the debate), pulled in 662,000 viewers at 8 p.m. and 476,000 viewers at 9 p.m. Combined, ""Hannity"" and ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" two top shows on Fox News, aired less than 15 minutes of the hour-plus Trump rally. Each show had more than 3 million viewers that night, as they typically do.

No, Adam Schiff didn’t pay witnesses to testify against President Trump

Modern income tax structure born in 1913, but Americans paid taxes before that
","A viral post on Facebook makes the broad claim that Americans kept all of their earnings up until 1913, and still had schools, roads and subways.  We checked similar variations of this claim in the past, but decided this calls for a fresh look. The post displays a dated image of a busy street filled with automobiles. Text overlaid atop the photo says: ""Up until 1913 Americans kept all of their earnings. Despite this, America still had schools, roads, colleges, vast railroads, subways and an Army & Navy. (Tell me again why taxes are necessary?)"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim contains some accurate information, but it needs some additional context and details. The year 1913 is often cited because that’s when the 16th Amendment was ratified, which allowed Congress to collect tax on individual incomes. Congress later enacted legislation that imposed a 1% tax on incomes over $3,000 with a graduated surtax on incomes above $20,000.   While 1913 marks the birth of the 1040 tax form, it wasn’t the first time Americans paid a tax on their earnings. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed a revised measure into law that enacted the nation’s first income tax to help pay for the Civil War. It created a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and levied a 3% tax on incomes between $600 and $10,000, and a 5% tax on incomes higher than that. Congress repealed the measure 10 years later in 1872.  In 1894, Congress passed a new income tax –– but it never took effect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional a year later because it was not apportioned according to each state’s population, as the Constitution then required. That meant, for example, that if 5% of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, no more than 5% of the tax’s total revenue could come from Virginia. But in 1913, the 16th Amendment removed the constitutional hurdle by authorizing Congress to collect taxes on incomes, ""without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" It’s also worth mentioning that the Facebook post doesn’t limit itself to federal taxes. States could, and in multiple cases did, tax earnings before 1913.  So how did the U.S. government generate revenue prior to income taxes? Before the Civil War, government funds were primarily obtained from tariffs on imports, the selling of public land and temporary excise taxes. During the decades following the war, when the income tax lapsed, the IRS says about 90% of the country’s revenues came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine and tobacco.  While the modern tax structure wasn’t in place before 1913 and the U.S. did have things like schools, roads, subways, etc., citizens still helped pay for them. A Facebook post says Americans kept ""all of their earnings"" up until 1913. The modern income tax structure, including Form 1040, was, indeed, adopted in 1913.  But the post disregards pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax, one of which was in place for a decade, and it ignores early state income taxes.

"['Population', 'Water', 'Texas', 'Kirk Watson']","
Kirk Watson says state's population will double in 50 years or so while amount of water will remain about the same
","
Austin’s state senator makes a by-the-numbers’ case for funding the state’s water plan.

For an October 2012 voters guide, Democrat Kirk Watson was asked by the League of Women Voters, Austin Area, what programs or solutions he believes necessary to address the state’s current and future water needs.

""Texas’ population is projected to double in the next 50 years or so,"" Watson replied, ""but our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now. Texas has an official water plan showing our water needs over a half-century and ideas for meeting those needs. But that plan requires steady funding. Ideas such as bottled water fees and utility surcharges should be considered. But the first priority should be promoting, incentivizing and optimizing conservation.""

Watson has a point. The plan, which is revised every five years, largely remains unfunded. In April 2012, we rated as Broken a 2010 promise by Gov. Rick Perry to coax the 2011 Legislature to invest in it, though lawmakers had voted to finance approximately $100 million in water-plan projects. Overall, lawmakers and Perry agreed on the state covering 11 percent of the plan’s estimated costs through 2019.

For this article, we wondered about Watson’s recent population and water-supply projections. Will the state’s population double in 50 years or so while available water remains about the same?

By email, Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal said that within the guide’s answer word-limit, Watson based his claim on statewide and regional projections in the 2012 version of the water plan.

The plan, published by the Texas Water Development Board, has figures related to Watson’s questionnaire answer, we found, but it doesn’t project a doubling in population within 50 years or so and its water projections for that year have two facets.

Specifically, the plan says that from 2010 to 2060, the state’s population is expected to increase from 25.4 million to 46.3 million. That would amount to an increase of 82 percent, about 4.5 million short of a doubling.

By telephone, Dan Hardin, the board’s director of Water Resource Planning, told us the plan’s population forecasts were devised in consultation with the Texas State Data Center, which disseminates state population estimates. The plan says the expected increases are the result of residents coming to Texas continuing to outnumber those who leave as well as in-state births outnumbering deaths. Hardin said, too, that the plan presumes even greater population gains for about a quarter of the state’s 254 counties, particularly counties with fast-growing suburbs.

Separately, we reached Lila Valencia of the San Antonio-based State Data Center, who told us by phone the center has not calculated when the state’s population will double and has not issued population projections past 2050. By phone, the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, told us that if one assumed state population growth at the same rate as the past decade, an ""aggressive assumption,"" the population would double by 2050 or so.

It could be that the population doubles by 2060 or later, Potter said, though that’s ""educated guesswork.""

Alternatively, we asked, might the 82 percent increase presented in the water plan be likened to doubling? Potter said he would not do so. ""It’s not consistent with ‘doubling.’ I personally would avoid using the word ‘doubling’ "" in reference to the 82 percent projection, he said, since a doubling would be 100 percent.

So, there are no projections of when the population will double.

Next, we took up Watson’s suggestion that ""our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now.""

Broadly, Scheibal said by email, the planet always has about the same amount of water, though it moves and changes form, from liquid to gas to solid, dependent on conditions. Hardin put it this way: ""In the very biggest picture, the water we have now is the water we will always have. It gets recycled.""

This is not to say that Texas will be home to the same amount of water even as its population increases. The state water plan essentially says that because less water will remain in underground aquifers, there will be less water available above ground.

Still, one section of the plan says that statewide, available surface water will only be slightly decreased by 2060. The surface water available in 2010, pegged in the plan at 13.5 million acre-feet per year, compares to a predicted 13.3 million acre-feet per year by 2060, the plan says. (An acre-foot is the amount of water that would cover an acre at a foot deep, or 325,851 gallons.)

That is, available surface water would be down less than 2 percent.

Hardin cautioned, however, that ""available"" water groups water easily accessed with water that is not easily conveyed. To gauge how much water Texas has (or will have) to do what Texas needs to do, he said, the board calculates the more-limited ""existing water supply.""

""Existing water supplies are those supplies that are physically and legally available now,"" the plan says. ""In other words, existing supplies include water that providers have permits or contracts for now and are able to provide to water users with existing infrastructure such as reservoirs, pipelines and well fields. Water availability, on the other hand, refers to how much water would be available if there were no legal or infrastructure limitations,"" the plan says.

As noted in an Oct. 18, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article pointed out by Scheibal, the plan also says, ""We do not have enough existing water supplies today to meet the demand for water during times of drought.""

The plan projects existing water supplies — folding in surface water, groundwater and reused wastewater — to decrease about 10 percent, from about 17 million acre-feet in 2010 to about 15.3 million acre-feet in 2060 as less water is available in the state's aquifers. Meantime, water needed statewide is anticipated to grow 22 percent, the plan says, due to a decline in irrigation water use and a slight decrease in per-person water use in towns and cities, which reflects ongoing shifts to more efficient plumbing, Hardin told us.

Upshot: State projections of ""available"" water and the more conservative ""existing"" water supply suggest Texas stands to have less water in 50 years.

Our ruling

The senator said the state’s ""population is projected to double in the next 50 years or so, but our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now.""

In fact, Texas is expected to have at least a tad less water by 2060, the latest state water plan says. Also, the population will not double until an uncertain date, but has been projected to increase 82 percent between 2010 and 2060.

Charlie Crist says Jeb Bush extended early voting
","
Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist emerged as a prominent critic of Gov. Rick Scott’s decision not to extend early voting before the presidential election.

Crist, a Republican-turned-independent who campaigned on behalf of President Barack Obama, joined Florida Democrats in asking Scott to give voters more time to cast early votes, citing long lines in Orlando and South Florida on Nov. 4, 2012, the last day of early voting.

Scott declined to extend early voting to Sunday, a move Crist denounced as ""unconscionable"" given the hours-long wait times. In an interview with Miami-based CBS 4, Crist pointed to his decision as a Republican governor in 2008 to extend early voting, a move that irritated Republicans who thought (correctly) it would help Obama voters.

""Got a lot of grief from Republicans, but you know, when you’re governor, you don’t just work for one party or the other, you work for the people of the state,’’ Crist said on Nov. 4, 2012. ""I saw the long lines. I saw that it was still hot in South Florida, a lot of senior citizens were waiting in those lines. And I realized it was an emergency situation where people needed to have the opportunity to vote.

""The same thing, or a similar thing, happened under Gov. Jeb Bush, and he extended early voting as well as governor,"" Crist said.

We wondered if Bush really extended early voting during an emergency-like situation.

Early voting

Bush actually signed into law the statewide maximum of 14 days for early voting in 2004. Election supervisors said it was highly popular and asked the Legislature to expand early voting hours and add more locations.

But Bush and the GOP-led Legislature went the other way the next year, passing a law that capped the number of hours for early voting and confined it to election offices, city halls and libraries.

Early voting remained popular -- especially with Democrats. In 2011, the Legislature and Scott enacted a new law that reduced the maximum early voting days to eight days. Democrats in the Legislature said the law was designed to depress voter turnout among people in their party.

The 2002 primary

Things were going haywire in South Florida during the primary election on Sept. 10, 2002, the first statewide election since the infamous 2000 presidential recount. It was the election that determined Bill McBride, and not Janet Reno, would be the Democratic gubernatorial challenger for Bush.

Some precincts in Broward and Miami-Dade counties opened hours after their scheduled 7 a.m. start. New, untested touch-screen voting machines malfunctioned. Some people walked away without casting a vote.

Bush issued an executive order that called for polls to stay open two additional hours statewide. That meant the polls stayed open until 9 p.m. for most of the state and 10 p.m. for the Panhandle, which is in the Central Time Zone.

Neither Bush nor his top elections official, Secretary of State Jim Smith, were pleased with having to make the call.

""I frankly wonder what in the hell have they been doing for two years,"" Smith was quoted as saying about the South Florida elections officials in an Associated Press report. ""I am hopeful that by November, at least they will be able to open the polls on a timely basis and the equipment will work.""

Bush ordered the extension ""out of fairness,"" according to the Associated Press.

""It's shameful. It's the responsibility of the supervisors of election to be prepared,"" Bush said. ""The state put up money - significant sums of money - for training, for machines. ... There's no excuse for not having precinct workers in a precinct for voting, no excuse for not turning on the machines."" 
In a phone interview with PolitiFact Florida, Crist said the point he was trying to make about Bush was that ""the guy had a heart"" amid chaos at the polls. 
""In a voting situation in Florida, when help was needed, he answered the call,"" Crist said.

Charley and 2004

Flash-forward to 2004, when Floridians faced an onslaught of hurricanes. Hurricane Charley walloped Southwest and Central Florida on Aug. 13, just days before the start of early voting for the Aug. 31 primary election.

Bush declared an elections emergency for 10 counties struck by Charley on Aug. 19, as the storm had ruined some voting equipment and made it difficult to locate and train poll workers.

In a letter, Bush authorized the state’s top elections official to waive election law to delay the start of early voting and help counties hurt by the storm with logistics, according to an Orlando Sentinel report. Early voting had begun in all but three counties affected by Charley.

""The letter gives counties that were affected by the hurricane and the secretary of state the flexibility they need to meet the needs of residents,"" Bush spokesman Jacob DiPietre told the Sentinel. ""That could be combining precincts if a building was destroyed. It gives them the ability to move polling places and to waive certain deadlines and fees.""

To be clear, this does not count as an example of Bush extending early voting. He was allowing for greater flexibility in counties affected by Hurricane Charley.

Our ruling

In his attempt to portray Scott as more concerned about politics than voters, Crist argued that even Bush, a popular Republican, extended early voting as governor.

Well, not exactly. In 2002, Bush extended regular voting by two hours because of malfunctioning voting machines -- not early voting. And in 2004, he gave supervisors a handful of counties more flexibility in starting early voting days after a devastating hurricane.

It’s important to note that both events were primary elections. Crist made it sound like Bush issued early voting extensions during a presidential election, as Crist did, to accommodate large turn-out.

Ad claims Mitt Romney made 'over a hundred million dollars' shutting down paper plant
","
A dramatic TV ad featuring an employee of a plant shuttered by Bain Capital is getting new life in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Virginia and Florida.

It claims Mitt Romney ""made over a hundred million dollars"" by shutting down a paper products factory in Marion, Ind.

Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, created the TV ad, which has also been viewed more than 2.7 million times on YouTube since its debut in June.

The ad, designed to portray Romney as an enemy of the middle class, tells the story of employees who built a stage — only to watch company officials announce they had all lost their jobs.

""Turns out that when we built that stage, it was like building my own coffin. And it just made me sick,"" says Mike Earnest, one of the workers.

Near the end of his story, Earnest claims: ""Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down our plant, and devastated our lives.""

It’s a heart-wrenching story. We wondered: Is it true that Romney ""made over a hundred million dollars"" by shutting down the plant?

As it turns out, there are several things wrong with this claim.

 Bain, Ampad and SCM Office Supplies

Romney was CEO of a private equity firm, Bain Capital. A Bain company called Ampad did buy the Marion paper plant in 1994, while he was on leave running for Senate, and shut it down in 1995.

At the time, Ampad was profitable. But there’s disagreement about the health of the Marion plant, known as SCM Office Supplies. Workers argued it was fine before Ampad came along, and the super PAC and the Romney camp marshal various documents to argue it made a profit, and that it didn’t.

Either way, it was quickly in trouble when workers, who had to reapply for their jobs after the Ampad purchase, decided to strike rather than accept lower-paid positions.

But what is clear is that no one made ""made over a hundred million dollars"" from shutting down a paper plant.

Bain and its investors made over a hundred million dollars from their entire investment in Ampad, which they purchased in 1992, before the company was liquidated in 2001. (They sold off most of their investment and gave up control of the company with a public offering in 1996, according to Bain spokeswoman Charlyn Lusk.)

A chart from the Boston Globe shows Bain and its investors made their money primarily through two main events: as part of Ampad’s borrowing to buy an envelope and stationery maker in 1995, and by selling Ampad stock in 1996. Under Bain, Ampad grew to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, far beyond the scale of the single Marion plant.

We contacted Priorities USA Action for support for its ad’s claim.

Spokesman Brennan Bilberry pointed us to evidence that Romney was directly involved with the decision to shut down the Marion plant, and to prospectuses and news articles showing Bain earned a more than 2,000 percent return in its Ampad investment — at least $102 million.

He argued that reducing costs from the Marion plant helped drive Ampad’s profit.

Still, the evidence he provided shows that was the profit for a much larger investment involving multiple acquisitions over years.

 Our ruling

A former plant employee in an ad from Priorities USA Action says, ""Mitt Romney made over a hundred million dollars by shutting down our plant.""

The Marion plant’s purchase and closure was part of a larger investment in paper products manufacturing that earned Bain and its investors over $100 million. It’s a sad tale for Marion workers: Their plant was sold. They lost their jobs, had to reapply to make less, and went on strike. Ultimately Bain closed the plant.

But shutting down the plant didn’t make Romney $100 million. That was the profit made by Bain and its investors, only some of which would have been earned by Romney. And it was earned for the entire Ampad investment — not as a result of closing a single manufacturing site.

William Batchelder claims Ohio has the most children's hospitals
","
Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder, up for re-election Nov. 6, 2012, recently sought the support of The Plain Dealer’s editorial board. 

During an endorsement interview on Sept. 18, 2012, the subject turned to healthcare in Ohio and the Medina Republican, among other things, noted the state’s impressive network of children’s hospitals was worth bragging about. 

For example, Ohio is the only state with a ""flagship, world-class children’s hospital within two hours of every child living in the state,"" according to the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association. 

During the interview, Batchelder noted that ""We (Ohio) have more hospitals that are children’s hospitals than any other state in the union."" 

That got Politifact Ohio’s attention. 

The Buckeye State is large, but not as populous as, say, California, New York or Texas. So, could it really have more children’s hospitals than any other state? 

PolitiFact Ohio asked Batchelder’s office where the speaker got this information. The speaker’s spokeswoman, Shannon Boston, directed us back to the website of the Ohio Children’s Hospitals’ Solutions for Patient Safety, a non-profit organization that works to align the vision of all of Ohio’s children’s hospitals. 

And how many hospitals does it list? Eight. 

Boston contends that Ohio is tied with Texas and California, which also each have eight children’s hospitals according to organizations in those states similar to the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association — the California Children’s Hospital Association and the Children’s Hospital Association of Texas.  

But a closer look found that the hospitals listed on those websites to which we were directed for hospitals in California and Texas only represent a portion of all children’s hospitals in those states. These state hospital associations are member-based organizations and not every hospital is necessarily a member and listed on the websites. 

In fact, Angela Krile, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association, when asked about Batchelder’s claim, said: ""I have never heard that we have the most children’s hospitals but we do have the highest rated system of children’s hospitals in the country."" 

The second part of her comment, about Ohio’s hospitals being highest rated, would indeed be  noteworthy. But it is the first part of her comment that PolitiFact Ohio is checking for this article. 

PolitiFact Ohio checked with the National Association of Children’s Hospitals. Spokeswoman Gillian Ray directed us to a state-by-state list of children’s hospitals on its website.

By its count, Ohio hardly has the most children’s hospitals in the country. 

Not even close. Here’s what we found:

The site includes the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Cincinnati and the Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital for Rehabilitation, two hospitals that are not members of the Ohio Children’s Hospitals’ Solutions for Patient Safety or the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association, which lists just six member hospitals. 

Ray said that the national list is all-inclusive, meaning it lists all the children’s hospitals according to their primary mission or duty: free-standing children’s hospitals, like Akron Children’s, specialty hospitals like Shriners in Cincinnati (which focuses on burn patients), or teaching hospitals, such as, Rainbow Babies and Children’s in Cleveland, which is affiliated with the medical school at Case Western Reserve University. 

For what it’s worth, Batchelder did get that endorsement from The Plain Dealer’s editorial board. 

But the organizations referenced by the speaker’s staff in support of his claim were not umbrella organizations that represent all children’s hospitals and their lists were far from complete. Even the two Ohio-based children’s hospital associations do not list the same number of hospitals, and neither lists every children’s hospital in the state. 

As an aside, there clearly appears to be a strong network of children’s hospitals in Ohio which draws the state high rankings in several areas of care, accessibility and amount of research taking place at the various institutions. But all that does not add up to having the most available hospitals of their kind as compared to other states, as Batchelder claimed. 

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C169100>],/factchecks/2012/nov/05/bill-batchelder/william-batchelder-claims-ohio-has-most-childrens-/

 Is education level tied to voting tendencies?
","
With the presidential election upon us this week, PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine a statement about national voting trends.

In a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article, political analyst Larry Sabato commented on the constituency of the political parties, particularly among white voters. We already checked part of his statement that ""Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia (voters’ educational level)."" We rated it true.

In the article, Sabato goes on to explain more of the characteristics of the political parties’ faithful.
""... The higher the education level, the more likely they are to vote Democratic,"" he said in the story.

We decided to take a closer look to determine whether there were facts to bear this out. And if so, did this claim include voters nationwide? And what about Georgia, where conservative, white voters have been a solid base for the GOP?

We asked Sabato about the basis for his comments. Like his first statement, Sabato used CNN’s 2008 exit polls to substantiate his claim, according to his political analyst and media relations coordinator, Kyle Kondik.

Based on the 2008 exit polls of Georgia, Virginia (where Sabato works) and nationally, whites with a college degree supported Barack Obama at a higher rate than whites without a college degree, Kondik said.

Looking at CNN’s 2008 national election poll of almost 18,000 respondents, 44 percent identified as college graduates. Of those college graduates, Obama had an 8 percentage point advantage over then-Republican presidential nominee John McCain.

Of voters with a postgraduate degree, Obama had an 18-point advantage over McCain.

In Georgia, the GOP maintained a strong foothold. All white voters at each education level -- except of course, white Democrats -- overwhelmingly voted for McCain. The GOP nominee had a 48-point advantage over Obama among Georgia’s white college graduate respondents. At the postgraduate level, the margin between the candidates shrunk, but McCain still beat out Obama by 1 percentage point. (The postgraduate voters were not identified by race.)

The Pew Research Center released data in August 2012 about GOP gains among working-class white voters that found: ""Lower-income and less educated whites also have shifted substantially toward the Republican Party since 2008."" 

Among whites without a college degree, the GOP now holds a 54 percent to 37 percent advantage among non-college whites, who were split about evenly four years ago. The partisanship of white college graduates, by contrast, has not changed, the analysis found.

Back in March of this year, political scientists and authors of the Monkey Cage blog examined the voting patterns of white voters in America. Their findings also support Sabato’s analysis.

When viewed in the context of educational attainment alone, without also examining income level, the blog authors concluded that high school graduates are more Republican than non-high school graduates. But after that, the groups with more education tended to vote more Democratic. At the very highest education level tabulated in the survey, voters with postgraduate degrees leaned toward the Democrats.

To reach the conclusions, the political scientists (professors at East Coast colleges such as George Washington University and Georgetown) used data from Annenberg pre-election polls for 2000 and 2004 and Pew pre-election polls for 2008. 

With white, highly educated voters being a key demographic for the Democratic Party, political observers, such as conservative columnist Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, are predicting Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could carry several swing states if he can sway these voters to the GOP.

But the Democrats seem intent on keeping this voting bloc. Last week the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), which conducts research on civic education and on youth voting and political participation, published an analysis of about 1,110 young voters based on their educational experience.

CIRCLE, which is based at Tufts University and was founded in 2001 by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, found that youths with college backgrounds were about three times more likely to have been contacted on behalf of the Obama campaign. The Romney campaign and supporters appeared to have contacted more non-college youths.

In Georgia, the numbers are harder to examine. The secretary of state does not keep statistics on voters’ education levels.

The GOP in the Peach State and in the Deep South in general still has a stronghold on the white voters, regardless of the education level, said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University and co-author of the book ""The Rise of the Southern Republicans.""

""In a state like Virginia where you have a lot of Northern migrants and people coming in from outside the state, things may be different,"" he said. 

The GOP stronghold in Georgia is evidenced by the overwhelming number of Republicans in power at  the state level, as well as the strong support for McCain four years ago and early polling data showing support for Romney this year.

Sabato said that ""the higher the education level, the more likely [voters] are to vote Democratic."" Sabato bases his claim on 2008 exit polls showing this national trend. Several polls and analysis done on data from presidential elections dating back at least a decade support Sabato’s claim. 

Still, looking at data for Georgia, the trend remains for white voters -- regardless of educational level -- to vote Republican. 

For many areas of the country, Sabato’s claim holds true. But in Georgia and the Deep South, the GOP is still firmly in control. We rate Sabato’s statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809671F0C0>],/factchecks/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/

Schools must get half the proceeds from county sales tax increase, says Stand For Children
","
Education funding issues often provoke emotional arguments, and a measure to increase the local option sales tax in Shelby County by a half cent has led to accusations that an education-advocacy group is trying to manipulate voter sensibilities with misleading claims about the benefits for school-children.

We've covered some education funding issues before, like the claim that the education burden on Tennessee and Shelby County taxpayers is among the lowest in the nation (Mostly True) and the assertion that local governments have not increased spending on schools over six budget cycles (True).

In this case, Stand For Children is leading the campaign to persuade voters in Memphis and unincorporated Shelby County to raise the local option sales tax levied by the county from the current 2.25 percent to 2.75 percent (the state sales tax rate is 7.0). The overarching message on expensive, glossy mailers -- the future of the adorable children smiling in photos will be brighter if voters approve the half-cent sales tax increase.

Stand is allied with a bi-partisan coalition of supporters, including Memphis Mayor A C Wharton and most of the Memphis City Council, Shelby County Commission chairman Mike Ritz, Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen and the majority of the unified Shelby County Board of Education. They argue the increase is necessary to help fund the $57 million shortfall that Shelby County's schools merger Transition Planning Commission says will occur if all their schools consolidation recommendations are approved by the unified county school board.

Opponents, including Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell and Memphis City Councilman Jim Strickland, contend that until a clearer picture is available for the exact budget needs of the consolidating school systems in Memphis and Shelby County, it is premature to levy an additional tax.

Stand is making a slew of claims, some of which elude the Truth-O-Meter process because they involve opinions, hypotheticals and interpretations about the will of elected officials. ""Small change can make a big difference for all of our kids"" reads one line, and another claims the revenue ""will make our schools better."" Both are clearly opinions.

Stand also says the money will allow for expansion of pre-kindergarten and training for teachers, while also possibly helping expand hours at libraries and community centers. Strickland especially objects to what he calls the pre-K ""promise,"" and indeed it remains to be seen whether the school board will follow through on the recommendations of the Transition Planning Commission and its own committees and staff to expand pre-K. There are budget and logistical issues that could delay or derail the plan to offer pre-K to all children who need it.

Stand in some cases has adjusted, for instance, by qualifying its language on pre-K. But on one issue it has only raised the volume -- that whatever else is argued about increasing the county sales tax, $31 million is guaranteed to flow to the county's schools because state law requires half of the proceeds of a local option sales tax to be spent on schools.

That's the claim we are examining here.

When we contacted Stand, its Memphis-based state director, Kenya Bradshaw, almost immediately emailed back a copy of Tennessee Code Annotated 67-6-712, ""Distribution of revenue"" under the ""The 1963 Local Option Revenue Act.""Bradshaw was a member of the county Transition Planning Commission that made pre-K for all who need it one of its highest priorities, and she carries around an actual copy of the statute.

It deals with the local option sales tax  and very plainly states that ""one-half (1/2) of the proceeds shall be expended and distributed in the same manner as the county property tax for school purposes is expended and distributed.""

It also says that the the proceeds can be pledged ""to the punctual payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness"" but doing so requires the approval of the local school board.

Estimates of the revenue expected to be raised from that county sales tax increase have run between $60 million and $62 million -- it depends in part on projections of future economic activity. So $30-31 million per year would, in fact, be guaranteed for schools. The half that does not go to schools is returned to the municipalities where they were collected, and of that non-schools portion $23  million is expected to flow to Memphis.

One core issue is that approval of the countywide increase would trump the votes in August referendums by suburban municipalities to apply a half-cent local option sales tax as a way to raise revenue to fund municipal school districts they hope to operate.

Opposition to the increase in some suburban municipalities is therefore fierce, because it would mean lower overall revenue than was expected for some municipal school districts. Some opponents argue that the vote is basically an anti-suburban municipal schools money grab by Memphis interests. Residents in those suburbs do not get a vote because they already have authorized sales tax increases for their towns.

Another argument by proponents is that a vote against the half-cent sales tax increase is essentially a vote for a property-tax increase to fund the expected budget gap created because of schools consolidation.

Our ruling

There is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of  public schools has created some confusion for voters.

On one of the most crucial issues, Stand For Children claims half the proceeds from the local option sales tax must go to schools. The statute is definitive and the claim is True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097179500>],/factchecks/2012/nov/04/stand-children-tennessee/schools-must-get-half-proceeds-county-sales-tax-in/
"['New Hampshire', 'Education', 'New Hampshire Democratic Party']","
Does Ovide Lamontagne want to get rid of kindergarten?
","
New Hampshire voters have almost made it to the Election Day finish line -- signaling a final push for campaigns to flood mailboxes and front doors with mailers.

Among the shower of flyers, the New Hampshire Democratic Party recently labelled Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne as ""radically backward,"" with an ad that features a photo of a frowning first grader ""already one year behind"" his classmates because he didn’t go to kindergarten.

""Ovide Lamontagne wants to eliminate kindergarten, which will leave our kids one year behind,"" the mailer states, scrawled in crooked font that looks like a struggling elementary school student could have written it.

Democrats have used lines like this throughout the campaign season to attack Republicans who oppose state-mandated kindergarten.

The New Hampshire Democratic Party mailer also cites examples from debates and media coverage that show Lamontagne’s ""radical agenda that will hurt our public schools.""

But since the flyer clearly aims at Lamontagne’s views on kindergarten, we’ll stick to that.

New Hampshire democrats backed up the flyer by pointing to a debate between Lamontagne and Kevin Smith in August, prior to the Republican primary, to prove Lamontagne wants to ""repeal the law ensuring all children can go to kindergarten.""

At the time, Lamontagne, who served as chairman of the state’s Board of Education, said kindergarten should not be state-mandated.

""I’ve always been for local control,"" Lamontagne said. """"The decision about whether or not to have kindergarten is a decision for the communities and school districts of our state, it is not
something that should be compelled, it's really not something that should be compelled by the state. … If you turnover that decision to the state, what other decisions are you going to turn over to the state -- or worse to the federal government?""

Press secretary for the state Democratic Party Collin Gately provided us additional back-up including endorsements from The Telegraph and the Concord Monitor for Lamontagne’s opponent, Maggie Hassan and a Telegraph story about a Lamontagne-Hassan debate at Rivier University, quoting Lamontagne: ""I support public kindergarten but those decisions should be made by parents and citizens at the local level, not mandated from Concord. Maggie thinks it should be mandated from Concord.""

Lamontagne spokesman Tom Cronin told PolitiFact New Hampshire that Lamontagne, a former schoolteacher, has ""no intention of trying to overturn the kindergarten mandate.""

""He opposed the original kindergarten mandate years ago because he believed it was the prerogative of local school districts to decided whether or not to offer and fund public kindergarten,"" Cronin said.

If elected governor, Lamontagne could face whether to sign or veto a bill to repeal the state mandating kindergarten. During the 2011, session, state Rep. Jonathan Maltz, R-Hudson, proposed H.B. 631 to repeal the state mandate requiring districts to provide kindergarten programs.

The bill specifically addressed repealing SB 530, which provides kindergarten construction grants for districts that do not currently operate kindergarten programs, until every district in the state has a kindergarten program, according to Stephanie Rose, an Associate Policy Analyst with the Education Commission of the States.

But Maltz’s bill didn’t gain much traction from House Democrats or Republicans.

(It’s worth noting, that some New Hampshire legislators oppose the mandate so vehemently they tried to correlate higher crime rates with towns that offer kindergarten).

There’s still the question of whether repealing the state mandate would mean the elimination kindergarten for New Hampshire families.

Not quite, history tells us.

For decades, New Hampshire was the only state in the country that didn’t require schools to offer public kindergarten. Even so, 140 New Hampshire towns-- more than 90 percent of New Hampshire districts -- already offered free public kindergarten.

Nashua, the second largest district in the state -- and where the Democrats’ flyer was mailed -- was one of the communities to offer kindergarten without being required to.

""If the state were to repeal the kindergarten mandate I can tell you we would not be looking to eliminate that grade level,"" Nashua Superintendent Mark Conrad said. ""I think it’s well-recognized as an essential part of the public school system throughout the United States.""

About a dozen districts, representing about 1,500 children, did not offer public kindergarten, until fall 2009, which is when the state officially required kindergarten to be part of an ""adequate education."" Those children either went to private kindergarten, to out-of-district schools or stayed home.

If the mandate was lifted, so could the number of public kindergarten programs in the state.  

""I also think it would be fair to say, without the mandate, over time, you might find some communities dropping (kindergarten) as they’re pressed for costs that we're all facing in these tough economic times,"" Conrad added.

Our ruling

A dramatized New Hampshire Democratic Party flyer tries to make Lamontagne out as a kindergarten abolisher.

Lamontagne acknowledges he opposed state-mandated public kindergarten -- and still doesn’t agree with it. But he has no plans to repeal it, which is a far cry from eliminating an entire school grade from public schools.

To say repealing the law would ""eliminate kindergarten"" and put a generation of New Hampshire students ""one year behind"" is over the top. But doing so would likely impact the families who can’t afford to send their children to private or out-of-district schools for kindergarten.

"['New Hampshire', 'Taxes', 'Republican Governors Association']","
Democrat Maggie Hassan's budget votes targeted by Republican Governors Association
","
With the election now days away, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ovide Lamontagne has been busy trying to paint challenger Maggie Hassan as a serial tax-and-spender.

This month, he found some help from the Republican Governors Association, which joined the fight for New Hampshire’s corner office by airing a series of ads that highlight Hassan’s spending history during her time in the Senate.

""After pushing 33 tax and fee increases as Majority Leader, (Maggie Hassan) was voted out of office,"" a narrator charges in the ad, ""Hiding,"" released this month on New Hampshire airwaves.

""She likes high taxes for us,"" the ad concludes. ""New Hampshire doesn’t.""

Throughout the campaign, Lamontagne has cited a higher number. In daily emails to the press, he accuses Hassan of supporting ""nearly 100 taxes and fees to help pay for her massive 24 percent increase in state spending."".

Last month, we looked into the 24 percent claim, ruling it Half True. So, we decided this time to look into the taxes and fees.

Lamontagne campaign officials declined to release their list of nearly 100 increases, which covered Hassan’s three two-year terms in office. Instead we looked at the governors association figure, which targeted her two years as Senate Majority Leader.

We approached the association, which pointed us to the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy in Concord, N.H.

In July 2009, the Bartlett Center, a conservative-leaning think tank, released an analysis of the state’s 2010-11 biennium budget. Hassan served as Senate Majority Leader at the time, during which the effects of the recession set in around New Hampshire. And, under her guidance, the Senate approved the $11.5 billion spending bill in June 2009, sending it on to the governor’s desk.

According to the Bartlett Center analysis, the budget, which went into effect July 1, 2009, included 35 new or increased taxes and fees, projecting to raise state revenues by about $306.4 million over the two-year budget.
Bartlett Center researchers didn’t develop the numbers themselves, but instead based them on research from the Office of the Legislative Budget Assistant, Arlinghaus said this week.

The nonpartisan budget assistant, charged with aiding the Legislature in its budget process, tracked the numbers in its review of the 2010-11 spending plan, and though the state numbers differ slightly from Bartlett Center, they remain in the ballpark.

In its assessment, the budget assistant reported that the 2010-11 spending plan, supported by Hassan both in its initial form and in the final version, included 33 total tax and fee hikes, the same number cited by the governor’s association ad.

But it also contained some big cuts, which the ad neglects to mention.

At the time the 2010-2011 budget was being written, Hassan and other legislators were warned state revenues were going to come in at 2005-2006 levels, leaving a gaping financial hole that needed to be covered through a blend of cuts and tax increases. The cuts contained in the budget included millions in reductions to state aid to communities, a freeze on out-of-state travel, a freeze on equipment purchases, and the elimination of 1,000 jobs-- 200 of which were occupied, among others.

On top of the loss in revenue, there was also an increase in expenses facing the state as more people sought government assistance. Budget writers also looked to tax and fee increases, some of which were sizeable. For example, the increase to the state rooms and meals tax was projected to raise $62.4 million for the state over the two years, and the increase to the tobacco tax projected to add $59.2 million.

Meanwhile, other increases were much less impactful. An increase to the driving records fees projected to add about $240,000, and an increase to the license fees for pilots, engineers and captains, among others, projected about $8,500.

Even Arlinghaus acknowledged in the Bartlett Center report, ""Using just the number of increases is an imperfect measure.""

Supporters of the 2010-11 budget applauded it for keeping state spending in line in the face of the struggling economy. But, as the recession continued to hit and state revenues came in lower than projected, legislators re-opened the spending plan to find further savings.

Over the coming months, legislators voted twice to amend the budget, reducing government spending by a total of $233 million. The budget adjustments included several increased taxes.

They amended the tobacco tax to include smokeless tobacco products, and they increased the marriage license fee, as well as the charge for selling animals and birds, which were projected to raise about $3 million between the three, according to Jeffry Pattison, the state budget assistant. But, they also voted to close a state prison and cut other state programs on the way to the $233 million savings, Hassan campaign manager Matt Burgess wrote in an email to PolitiFact NH.

PolitiFact noted previously that although total state spending increased about 20 percent during Hassan’s time in office, the funds spent from taxes and fees, which legislators have the most control over, actually went down slightly.

Our ruling

As the lead Democrat in the Senate, Hassan voted twice in 2009 in favor of the 2010-11 budget -- a spending plan shown by the nonpartisan budget assistant to include 33 tax and fee hikes, as claimed in the governors association ad.

The statement is numerically accurate, but it ignores all of the major cuts Hassan and other Democrats made to the budget, like eliminating state jobs and reducing state aid to communities. The state was facing a huge hole in its budget due to the sputtering economy, which simultaneously lowered revenues and increased the need for expenditures.   

On top of that, the ad fails to acknowledge that Democrats reopened the budget and further reduced government spending by $233 million.

And to say Hassan ""likes high taxes"" is a gross oversimplification that ignores the financial realities facing the state at the time.

We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D7D0C0>],/factchecks/2012/nov/03/republican-governors-association/democrat-maggie-hassan-votes-tax-increases-targete/

People's Majority: Sheldon Whitehouse got a secret briefing warning of the 2008 economic collapse
","A lot of people were hit hard by the 2008 economic collapse and its aftermath. U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is being accused in a recent television commercial of using insider information to avoid financial losses.

In the ad, Whitehouse pops up three times to utter the phrase ""fighting for the people"" as a female narrator says: ""September 08. An economic storm brews. Within months, millions of Americans will lose jobs, homes and life savings.

""In Washington,"" the commercial continues, ""Sheldon Whitehouse gets a secret closed-door briefing warning of the crash. After that secret briefing, certain stocks he owned got sold just in time. Some people go to prison for that. That's not fighting for us.""

To emphasize the insider trading allegation, the ad shows an image of Martha Stewart, who served time in prison for obstructing justice and lying to the government in an insider trading case. The YouTube version of the ad, posted Oct. 25, 2012, is titled ""Insider Trading.""

Did Whitehouse really get a secret briefing warning of the crash?

First, some background.

Questions about insider trading by Whitehouse and other members of Congress surfaced in November 2011 in ""Throw Them All Out,"" a book whose author, Peter Schweizer, was featured on the CBS news program ""60 Minutes"" on Nov. 13, 2011.

On Sept. 16, 2008, Schweizer reported, top congressional leaders were briefed by top Bush administration officials -- then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- about the unfolding financial crisis.

In his book, Schweizer says Whitehouse was one of many members of Congress who sold holdings after the briefing.

Over the next week, Whitehouse sold stock in eight companies involving a dozen trades valued between $425,000 and $950,000 (the total is uncertain because his disclosure form only gives price ranges), according to his disclosure form.

The timing of the trades raised questions of insider trading. Under the law in effect at the time, members of Congress couldn't be prosecuted for engaging in such activity, which is illegal for the general public. (The insider trading law has since been amended, with Whitehouse's support, to include members of Congress.)

But there’s a key problem with the ad’s central allegation that Whitehouse benefited from information he received at the briefing.

Whitehouse says he wasn't at the meeting, which was only for top Congressional leaders, and he was not in the leadership in 2008. The Schweizer book offers no evidence that he was there.

The ad comes from People's Majority, a super PAC whose address is a post office box in Alexandria, Va. Filings with the Federal Election Commission say it was formed to oppose Whitehouse. Its website doesn't give a location or a phone number, but it does say it was formed with ""the hope of restoring a Republican majority in the United States Congress.""

Whitehouse is the only candidate mentioned.

Federal documents have listed the treasurer as Ken McKay, a former GOP chairman in Rhode Island, chief of staff for former Gov. Donald L. Carcieri and later the chief of staff for former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele. Newer documents identify the current treasurer as Cabell Hobbs.

We sent an e-mail to the only recent address we could find on the FEC documents and asked for backup. We then got a call from Dave Owen, of Owen Communications, in Salt Lake City, a consultant acting as a spokesman for People's Majority.

So what evidence did People's Majority have that Whitehouse attended a secret closed-door briefing?

""We don't say he attended the briefing,"" said Owen. ""We say he gets a briefing, he gets the information from the briefing.""

""We were unclear on whether he denied being in the briefing,"" Owen said. ""Frankly, if you're going to do one of these things you push the envelope and walk a line.""

For the record, the Sept. 16 briefing came at a time when President George W. Bush had already signed the government rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Fannie and Freddie had been placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, their CEOs and board of directors had been dismissed, Lehman Brothers had declared bankruptcy and the Dow Jones Industrial average had lost more than 12 percent of its value since May.

On the day of the briefing, the government moved to bail out the insurance giant AIG. That week was the biggest trading week in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.

In short, the financial meltdown was already underway. The ripple effects were just beginning to unfold.

Whitehouse has said that the trades done from Sept. 16-22 were executed by a financial adviser who had the power to buy and sell stock without consulting him.

""I virtually never have a conversation"" with the adviser, he told The Providence Journal in November 2011. With all the turmoil on Wall Street at the time, ""It's presumably pretty obvious that they were trying to be defensive with my account, but I can't go back and read their minds,"" he said.

Our ruling

The super PAC People's Majority said Sheldon Whitehouse got ""a secret closed-door briefing warning of the crash"" and used the information to sell stocks before the crash.

But the organization couldn't provide evidence that Whitehouse was at any briefing where he got inside information warning that the financial meltdown, already underway, was going to get worse.

A People's Majority spokesman told us, ""We don't say [Whitehouse] attended the briefing"" and the ad was an attempt to ""push the envelope.""

In fact, the ad does say Whitehouse attended the briefing, not only pushing the envelope but shredding it.

With no evidence to back up its inflammatory claim, the People's Majority ad is worthy of a little inflammation of its own. We rate it Pants on Fire!

Progressive group says Thompson ""says he'll do away with Medicare""
","
In a new TV ad by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Tommy Thompson stands starkly accused of pledging to ""do away with Medicare.""

""I’ve been working in factories here in Wisconsin for 35 years,"" says a man standing in front of a plant gate. ""This work is tough on us. You see a lot of folks with bad wrists, bad shoulders. When we’re ready to retire, we’ll need Medicare.""

He concludes: ""Tommy Thompson has taken thousands of dollars from the insurance industry. Now he says he’ll do away with Medicare. I’m voting for Tammy Baldwin for Senate because she’ll never cut Medicare benefits.""

The liberal group’s TV spot dissolves into a video of Thompson speaking to a tea-party group in June 2012, and seemingly proves the group’s claim.

""Who better than me to do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"" Thompson asks in the ad.

We are quite familiar with the video clip.

The Journal Sentinel reported on it in June 2012. And Baldwin quoted Thompson’s statement from it while addressing a group of liberal bloggers. Now, as the tight Senate race draws to a close, the same clip is showing up in several anti-Thompson ads.

In evaluating Baldwin’s claim in June, we found that Thompson did utter those words at a June 4, 2012, appearance before the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty, an Oconomowoc-based group that decries excessive government and endorses ""demolishing the growing, socialist ‘nanny state’ and its programs and legislation...""

We also learned that’s only part of what Thompson said.

For starters, the brief video clip in the Progressive Change ad is edited for effect.

If you look closely, Thompson’s head jerks oddly during the ""Who better than me…"" statement. That’s because it’s spliced.

Here’s the full quote: ""Who better than me, (who’s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.""

In June, we rated Half True -- partially accurate -- Baldwin’s claim that Thompson ""said"" he wants to ""do away with Medicare.""

When we asked the Progressive Change Campaign Committee to back up the ad’s claim, spokesman Neil Sroka said Thompson’s words were clear. Thompson was speaking candidly about his real view of Ryan’s plan, in front of a conservative group whose support he was seeking, Sroka said.

Let’s take a fuller look, then, at Thompson’s June speech -- and see if anything has changed since our rating of the claim when Baldwin made it.

At the tea-party event, Thompson prefaced the remarks in question by saying Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government.

At that point, Thompson was fully endorsing U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to reform Medicare, but recently he’s emphasized a plan that modestly modifies Ryan’s. As we noted on Nov. 2, 2012, in giving Thompson a Half Flip, he now wants to offer future seniors who don’t pick traditional Medicare the option of picking a private plan in the federal employees’ health program.

In the tea-party speech, Thompson wrapped his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh.

First, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement.

He told the audience the United States should ""change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare."" (We previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that he ""ended welfare"" in Wisconsin.)

Then he said the line about who better than him to ""come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare.""

It’s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase ""doing away with Medicare"" in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program.

But there is another piece of background relevant to his views: Thompson didn’t say it at the event, but he told the Journal Sentinel in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan’s plan instead of government-run care. Of government-run healthcare, he said he’s ""always opposed"" it.

In his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it.

At the same time, it’s clear that deeper into the June tea-party speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in ""saving"" Medicare from fiscal extinction.

He also framed his views as wanting to ""change"" Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin.

Back in June, the Thompson campaign said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. Campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase ""doing away with"" in the context of ""changing"" Medicare, not eliminating it.

In early October, after another liberal group used the tea-party video clip, Thompson told reporters: I am here to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security but you have to make some adjustments.""

So, where does that leave us?

Same place as before. The PCCC ad leaves out important context from Thompson’s June remarks, just as Baldwin did. But Thompson did describe his reform plan, in that speech, as a way to ""do away with"" traditional Medicare.

GOP group says Tammy Baldwin proposed $3.9 trillion tax hike that Nancy Pelosi opposed
","In their efforts to lift Tommy Thompson to victory over U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, Republicans have tied Baldwin to a Democratic lightning rod, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

""You already know how extreme Tammy Baldwin is,"" begins a TV ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee released Oct. 15, 2012.

The ad goes on to make a number of claims, including this one:

""Baldwin even proposed a $3.9 trillion tax increase -- a tax increase so extreme, so destructive, even Nancy Pelosi voted against it.""

The group, which helps elect Republicans to the U.S. Senate, made the same claim in another TV ad released two weeks later.

Let’s check the record.

Thompson, the Republican former governor, portrayed Baldwin as on the political fringe even before he entered the Senate race.

In September 2011, we rated as Mostly True his claim that the Madison Democrat ranks as the most liberal member of the House. Based on votes she cast, three major rankings put Baldwin among a group of House members considered the most liberal.

We’ve already examined the proposed tax increase cited in the Republican committee’s ad. It was part of a 2012 federal budget proposal made by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group; Pelosi is not a member.

Thompson said the caucus’ budget proposal -- an alternative to plans submitted by President Barack Obama and House Republicans -- would have spent trillions of dollars more than Obama’s budget. We rated the claim False because the caucus budget would have spent less over 10 years than Obama’s budget.

But we pointed out that, according to experts, total tax collections under the caucus plan would have been some $5 trillion higher than under the Obama budget.

In an April 2011 vote, the caucus budget failed in the House, 347-77. Baldwin voted for it; Pelosi, the House minority leader at the time, was among 108 Democrats and 239 Republicans who voted against it.

The TV ad doesn’t cite any reasons and the GOP committee didn’t reply to our requests for more information.

We checked a transcript of the debate on the House floor about the Progressive Caucus budget proposal and it indicates Pelosi didn’t speak. We also checked the collection of news releases on Pelosi’s House website. We found she spoke on the House floor about the Republican budget proposal, but not about the Progressive Caucus budget.

Our rating

The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Baldwin ""proposed a $3.9 trillion tax increase -- a tax increase so extreme"" that ""even Nancy Pelosi voted against it.""

Baldwin backed a budget that included a $3.9 trillion tax increase. Pelosi voted against the budget and its tax increase, although her reasons aren’t clear.

We rate the claim Mostly True. Note: On Oct. 31, 2017, we edited this item to make it clear that experts had told us that tax collections would be $5 trillion higher in the caucus budget than in the Obama budget, not that the caucus budget would have raised taxes by $5 trillion more.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D8F280>],/factchecks/2012/nov/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-group-says-tammy-baldwin-proposed-39-trillion-/

Mitt Romney and Rick Scott both have Medicare fraud in their background, super PAC ad claims
","
The super PAC supporting President Barack Obama made a final pitch to Florida voters before Election Day: a TV ad comparing Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Gov. Rick Scott.

Showing a picture of the two men locked in a handshake, the ad urges viewers to ""connect the dots.""

""Scott ran a company that paid a record fine for committing Medicare fraud, then as governor Scott cut millions from health care,"" a narrator says. ""Romney was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare. Now Romney’s plan would end Medicare as we know it.

""We’ve seen this picture before. Just connect the dots: If Mitt Romney wins, the middle class loses.""

PolitiFact has investigated claims against both Scott and Romney about Medicare fraud during their business careers. Here’s a look at what we found.

‘Scott ran a company that paid a record fine for committing Medicare fraud’

In the spring of 1987, Scott purchased two Texas hospitals to start a company first known as Columbia. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals to create a large and profitable network.

In 1994, Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. Columbia/HCA grew to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations, employing more than 285,000 people.

Scott resigned as chief executive officer in 1997, the year that federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country.

In time, it became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA bilked Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and for attaching false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals.

Scott resigned as CEO in July, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said that if Scott had remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. At issue, Scott said, was that he wanted to fight the federal government accusations. The corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle.

And settle Columbia/HCA did.

In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement, which all apply to when Scott was CEO, were that Columbia overbilled Medicare for unnecessary tests and false diagnosis codes.

The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total fine: $1.7 billion.

As part of the 2000 settlement, Columbia/HCA agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. A corporate felony comes with financial penalties but not jail time, since a corporation can’t be sent to prison. Scott himself was never indicted.

‘Romney was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare’

Romney’s record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded, came up frequently during the Republican primary. This claim refers to Bain’s history with a company charged with Medicare fraud in the 1990s.
   
The Boston media investigated the facts of the case when Romney ran for governor in 2002. It’s also addressed in The Real Romney, a biography by reporters with the Boston Globe.
   
The story begins in 1989, when Romney was the head of Bain Capital, which specialized in buying troubled companies, turning them around, and then selling them for a profit. That year, Bain invested in Damon Corp., a medical testing company based in Needham, Mass.
   
Bain took the company public in 1991, and Romney served on the company’s board of directors. In 1993, Bain orchestrated a sale of the company to Corning Inc., getting a handsome return on its investment and earning Romney himself $473,000, according to The Real Romney. After the sale, Corning closed the main facility in Needham, laying off 115 people.
   
In October 1996, federal prosecutors announced that Damon was agreeing to pay $119 million in both civil and criminal fines after pleading guilty to defrauding Medicare. The company was providing doctors with forms that didn’t make clear what tests included, so doctors were checking off additional tests that weren’t necessary, according to the Globe’s summary of the government’s case.
   
The overbilling went from 1988 through 1993, prosecutors said. ""This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok,"" U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said when the settlement was announced.

Romney was never implicated in the case. He claimed that he helped uncover the fraud, but Globe reporting put that claim into question. The Globe reported that court records showed fraudulent activity occurred under Bain’s watch, and that prosecutors gave the credit to Corning for stopping the fraud. 
The Romney campaign, though, pointed us to Globe stories noting that Bain officials began investigating the billing practices when a competitor lab pleaded guilty to the same type of fraud. The campaign also emphasized that Bain was never a majority owner in Damon -- its ownership share peaked at 8 percent and was just 2.8 percent went the company sold to Corning.

Are Romney and Scott’s cases similar?

By telling viewers to ""connect the dots"" between Romney and Scott, the Priorities ad implies that the Medicare fraud cases in their pasts are parallel. But in some important ways, the cases are different.

Scott was the top boss at Columbia/HCA during the years prosecutors found fraudulent activity, and his role as the face of the company is undisputed.

Romney’s position at Damon Corp. is a different story. As a member of the board of directors, Romney had a part in overseeing the company’s general direction. That’s not like being the CEO, who directs day-to-day activities.

The ad muddies that fact -- and it’s misleading to say Romney served as ""director"" of Damon Corp., not ""a director.""

Also, Columbia/HCA faced much larger fines and penalties than Damon did -- $1.7 billion versus $119 million.

Our ruling

The Priorities ad says Romney ""was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare,"" comparing him with Scott.

Scott’s hospital company, Columbia/HCA, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid a total of $1.7 billion in fines related to Medicare fraud. Even though Scott had resigned by the time the case settled, prosecutors said the widespread fraud occurred while he was at the helm.

But the fraud case at Damon Corp. doesn’t point straight to Romney. His firm bought the company that was later found guilty of fraud, but Romney was not running the show while crimes were being committed.

The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That fits our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B2D980>],/factchecks/2012/nov/02/priorities-usa-action/mitt-romney-and-rick-scott-both-have-medicare-frau/
"['National', 'Economy', 'History', 'Jobs', 'Michael Moore']","
Michael Moore said U.S. lost millions of jobs per month under Bush
","
On the day of the final release of jobs numbers before the presidential election, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted a comparison of how the job market has fared under President Barack Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush.

""Under Bush we were LOSING MILLIONS of jobs per month; under Obama we have 3 yrs of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per mo,"" Moore tweeted to his 1.2 million followers.

Were Moore’s figures correct? No -- in fact, Moore conceded so himself when he sent a corrected tweet about five hours later. Let's look at the numbers.

Job losses under Bush

We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official collector of employment numbers. Since Moore didn’t specify what types of jobs he was referring to, we took the most basic measure -- private sector jobs combined with government jobs, not counting farm jobs or the military.

During Bush’s final year -- the year with the heaviest job losses during his tenure -- the monthly net change in jobs bottomed out in the fourth quarter. Between October 2008 and November 2008, the economy shed 803,000 jobs. Between November 2008 and December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 jobs. And between January 2009 and December 2008, the economy lost 818,000 -- the highest number of Bush’s tenure (and higher than any monthly loss under Obama).

That’s a huge number, but it’s not ""MILLIONS."" In fact, it’s not even 1 million. So Moore’s tweet exaggerated the size of the losses under Bush.

Job gains under Obama

The job picture did eventually improve under Obama, but Moore exaggerates when he says the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for the last three years under Obama.

During 2010, the job market expanded by an average of 85,000 per month. In 2011, the average rose to 153,000 per month. And in 2012, the average rose again, to 157,000 per month.

Those numbers are a whole lot better than what the nation experienced in 2008, but these rises don’t qualify as ""hundreds of thousands,"" which we would define as at least 200,000.

What about increases above 200,000 during individual months? Looking at the 34 months since January 2010, the net increase has exceeded 200,000 jobs a total of 10 times, or less than one-third of the time. And several of those were months where the job numbers were boosted only temporarily due to a flurry of hiring for the once-a-decade U.S. Census. 
Moore's correction 
About five hours after Moore's original tweet was posted, and after we had contacted his office, he sent a tweet correcting the record. ""Thx for tweets on job loss - worst month w/Bush was 800K+ jobs lost, most months since '10 have had 100K+ jobs gained http://mmflint.me/QbEkPM."" 
Moore's second tweet was correct. 
Our ruling

Moore's initial tweet was incorrect when it said the nation was ""losing millions"" of jobs per month under Bush, since even the weakest month under Bush saw the economy lose less than 1 million jobs per month. And he was also incorrect to say that the economy has been ""gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs"" per month for three years under Obama. The economy has averaged well under 200,000 jobs per month during that period and only exceeded the job-gain threshold of 200,000 in 10 months. We applaud his correction, but we still rate his initial tweet False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809676ED00>],/factchecks/2012/nov/02/michael-moore/michael-moore-said-us-lost-millions-jobs-month-und/
"['Stimulus', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson said Connie Mack asked for stimulus money for his district
","
Make no mistake, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fort Myers, opposes the federal stimulus.

He’s decried President Barack Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which poured $787 billion into the economy, a ""waste of money"" and a move ""to ignore the will of the American people.""

He’s released media statements and ads accusing Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, whom he wants to unseat from the U.S. Senate, of pushing a stimulus that wasted ""millions in taxpayer dollars"" on things like cocaine-addicted monkeys. (PolitiFact pegged that ad as Mostly False.)

""I’ve said time and time again, we cannot spend our way to prosperity,"" Mack said in a 2010 media release about the stimulus.

That’s why, on the night of the Oct. 17 Senate debate, Nelson was prepared to use Mack’s own political weight against him.

""(Mack) rails against the stimulus bill, he didn’t tell you he wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation in order to get $29 million in stimulus for his congressional district,"" Nelson said.

Mack, perhaps prepared for the comment, absorbed Nelson’s punch unruffled. But he also didn’t refute it.

That’s why we decided to fact-check for ourselves.

We started by asking Nelson’s campaign for evidence.

Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin gave us a copy of a letter Mack wrote to Secretary Ray LaHood at the U.S. Transportation Department asking for the money on behalf of Charlotte County.

Mack’s letter, dated September of 2009, asked the federal government for $29 million to build the Southwest Florida Intermodal and Logistics Center, a project to introduce high-speed rail transportation to Southwest Florida.

To read the letter, you’d think Mack not only approves of the stimulus, but believes it’s a potential boon to Southwest Florida’s economy.

""This project will establish a connection between Southwest Florida economic centers and the seaports of Tampa and Manatee counties, advancing the region’s economic competitiveness,"" Mack wrote.

The letter continued: ""This project is shovel-ready and will facilitate the transportation of goods and people throughout Southwest Florida, spurring economic development in a region crucial to the economic health of the state. These aspects make Charlotte County’s project an excellent candidate for funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was designed in part to encourage economic growth through investments and infrastructure.""

The Transportation Department denied the grant, and the project never got off the ground, said Charlotte County administrator Jason Stotzfus.

But Mack also sent at least two other letters to help the county apply for different stimulus grants.

""Chances are better if we have the support of our legislators,"" Stotzfus said.

Pietro Nivola, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Mack’s approach to the stimulus is common.

""Constituent services is all about responding to appeals and requests,"" Nivola said. "" If people in (Mack’s) neighborhood were thinking here's some money, here's an opportunity...it's incumbent upon him to follow up.""

In fact, Vice President Joe Biden used a similar gotcha against Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during the Oct. 11 vice presidential debate. Ryan, looking flustered, replied that all representatives ask for stimulus money for their constituents.

Mack political consultant Gary Maloney had a similar analysis, and he offered this analogy.

In 2001 and again in 2003, Nelson voted against tax cuts. But when Floridians wrote him for help on tax issues, Nelson didn’t tell those constituents to take a hike because he opposed those bills, Maloney said.

""In 2009, Mack voted against the stimulus on principle. Nelson voted with Obama, and the Democrat majority prevailed,"" Maloney said. ""Once the stimulus bill was the law of the land, Mack still represented his constituents. And when Charlotte County applied for funds, Connie naturally helped the taxpayers of his district.""

Our ruling

During the U.S. Senate debate, Nelson accused Mack of denouncing the stimulus but asking for money.

It’s no secret: Mack frequently bashes the stimulus as an impediment to economic growth.

Yet, his letters suggest he thinks the stimulus money would boost his area’s economy.

We rate Nelson’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0ADE00>],/factchecks/2012/nov/02/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-said-connie-mack-asked-stimulus-money-/
"['Message Machine 2012', 'Florida', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney campaign says Obama's EPA sent emails with Che Guevara for Hispanic Heritage Month
","
A Spanish-language TV ad from Mitt Romney starts off with a question for South Florida voters:  ""Who supports Barack Obama?""

The ad provides three notorious answers: Chávez, Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara.

The Miami Herald translated the ad, ""Chávez Por Obama,"" which aired on three Spanish-language TV stations on Oct. 30, 2012. The ad mixes footage from interviews with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and the niece of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro with news headlines about a provocative email.

Narrator: ""Who supports Barack Obama?""

Chávez video: ""If I were American, I’d vote for Obama.""

Narrator: ""Raúl Castro’s daughter, Mariela Castro, would vote for Obama.""

Castro video: ""I would vote for President Obama.""

Narrator: ""And to top it off, Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month with a photo of Che Guevara.""

Chávez: ""If Obama were from Barlovento (a Venezuelan town), he’d vote for Chávez.""

Romney: ""I’m Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.""

The Chavez clips are from a September 2012 interview in which he also called Obama ""a good guy."" Mariela Castro, a supporter of gay rights, said she would vote for Obama in May 2012 following Obama announcing his support of gay marriage.

Here, we wanted to check the claim that the EPA sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, with a picture of Guevara, a guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary. He played a major role under Castro during the revolution and carried out the execution of more than 150 prisoners without a fair trial.

We also wanted to examine the connection to Obama. It’s not the first time someone tried pin Obama, born in 1961, to the revolutionary, who was assassinated in 1967. During Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, bloggers responded to video of a Guevara flag in a volunteer field office with iterations of ""Obama loves Che Guevara."" PolitiFact rated that Pants on Fire.

Romney’s team declined to explain their strategy of invoking Guevara. But for many Cubans, it doesn’t get much worse than Guevara.

""When you talk about dislike among the Cubans across the board, Che Guevara might be a notch below Fidel,"" said Andy Gomez, senior fellow at the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies. ""He was the henchman. Che Guevara was the one that carried the heavy hand.""

The EPA email in question caused a stir about a month before the Romney ad appeared.

An EPA management analyst sent an email containing a picture of a horse and buggy passing a wall with Guevara’s portrait next to his famous slogan, ""Hasta La Victoria, Siempre!"" (Until Victory, Always).

It also contained several passages about Hispanic culture, religion, general manners and family values under the headline ""Hispanic news you can use!"".

""Hispanic people are vibrant, socializing and fun loving people. Among various facts associated to this culture is that they have a deep sense of involvement in their family traditions and culture,"" the email said.

BuzzFeed obtained a copy of the email sent from a management analyst to EPA staff and posted it on its website Sept. 13, 2012.

The text presented another problem for the agency. It matched word-for-word, without attribution, text from the website Buzzle, BuzzFeed reported. Still, the plagiarism played second fiddle to Guevara’s picture in news stories that picked up on the email, including the Miami Herald and Fox News Latino, which were the headlines cited in the Romney ad.

The agency quickly apologized for the email. A spokesperson explained it was sent ""without official clearance.""

""The email was drafted and sent by an individual employee, and without official clearance. Shortly after sending the email in question the individual apologized to her colleagues for the inadvertent error,"" the spokesperson told Buzzfeed in a statement. 
An EPA spokesman could not tell us the number of employees who received the email, but confirmed that it was an internal message and not released as a statement to the general public. Specifically, it was sent to the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response. 
The employee was not fired for sending the email, the spokesman said.

The apology did not quell outrage. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, and chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, issued a scathing statement that said, ""The image of Che is an insult to countless people who lost family members because of his evil and twisted acts.""

""Surely, the EPA could have chosen the image of a Hispanic person who really possessed the attributes that showcase our proud Hispanic heritage,"" said Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba but fled the country with her parents in 1960. ""This sad and unnecessary episode encompasses all that is wrong with this Administration: Their priorities are backwards and their allegiances border on the fringe of society with a leftist fanatical slant that is worrisome and not descriptive of our great nation.""

Is it fair game for the Romney campaign to pin the email on ""Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency""? Yes and no, experts told us. Even though it came from that agency during Obama’s tenure, the ad makes it sound like an official policy message, when really it was the unapproved work of one employee farther down the food chain.

""The fact is that individuals are free to make choices about what they do while on the job, and that includes individuals that work in the government,"" said Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor who specializes in Cuba policy.

Our ruling

Romney’s ad said, ""Obama's Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage Month with a photo of Che Guevara.""

The claim is partially accurate. Yes, an email from the EPA under Obama’s tenure marked the start of Hispanic Heritage Month with a picture of Che Guevara. But the message did not go through official clearance, and it was quickly retracted. That makes the assertion that ""Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency"" is responsible a little dubious.

Allen West ad connects Patrick Murphy's case being dropped and donations by his dad
","The battle between U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, and Democratic opponent Patrick Murphy has featured dueling ads in which they portray each other as criminals.

And now West has reloaded his attack with a dramatic ad that suggests that when Murphy was arrested when he was a college freshman after a night of drinking and swearing at a police officer, his well-to-do Daddy got the case dismissed.

Earlier in the campaign, West ran an ad that attacked Murphy for an arrest about 10 years ago -- the charge was ultimately transferred to traffic court where it was dismissed. And Murphy attacked West for an incident during his Army career, when West fired over the head of a detainee in Iraq and prompted a military investigation. That led to a fine and reprimand, and West retired from the Army. You can read more about our analysis of those ads in our earlier fact-checks in the race for congressional district 18 in Florida’s Treasure Coast.

Here we will focus on West’s latest attacks about Murphy’s 2003 arrest in this ad: 

The narrator begins: ""Patrick Murphy isn’t being honest about his drunken assault of a police officer.""

The ad then shows Murphy saying: ""I took responsibility and it was dismissed.""

The narrator then continues: ""The truth is after Murphy’s charges were dropped, Murphy’s father gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation."" On screen, two men in suits shake hands in a stairwell; another image shows someone pushing stacks of cash across a table. ""Now Murphy is hiding behind his dad again using his money to fund a negative campaign. ... ""

The ad paints a portrait of Murphy as relying on his Daddy’s big bucks to get him out of trouble and support his campaign. (West has called Murphy a ""spoiled brat."")

Here we will focus on West’s claim that that after the charges against Patrick Murphy were dropped, his father ""gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation."" We will also briefly explain West’s reference to the role of Murphy’s father’s money in the campaign.

Murphy’s 2003 arrest

We previously fact-checked a West ad that accused Murphy of trying ""To hide his drunken assault of a police officer."" We ruled that claim Mostly False, because Murphy wasn’t charged with assault, the case was ultimately dropped, and there was no evidence that he tried to hide the 2003 incident.

At the time, Murphy was a 19-year-old college freshman at the University of Miami; he’s now 29.

According to the police report, Murphy and a friend were fighting and disrupting others at a Miami Beach bar, Club Crobar, and escorted out by security. The two men had been drinking, were ""soaking wet"" from alcohol and had ""eyes bloodshot, slurring speech.""

An officer asked Murphy for his I.D., but Murphy refused to turn over the fake New Jersey driver’s license. ""Defendant refused shouting ‘(expletive) you,’’’ and was arrested, the report stated.

To be clear, we saw no evidence in the officer’s narrative or court records that Murphy physically assaulted a police officer.

Murphy was charged with felony possession of a stolen driver’s license. He entered a plea of ""not guilty"" Feb. 26, and the criminal case was closed March 10 with a charge transferred to traffic court.

Court records also list ""misdemeanor disorderly intoxication"" based on the arrest report, but court records show ""no action"" on this count, and he wasn’t charged for that by prosecutors.

The charge for altering a driver’s license was dismissed by the state attorney’s office in June 2003. The online record doesn’t explain the reason for the dismissal.

Donations by Thomas Murphy to Katherine Fernandez Rundle

West’s new ad continues the focus on the same incident, this time looking at campaign donations made by Patrick’s father Thomas P. Murphy and his construction businesses to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle.

Fernandez Rundle has been the county’s top prosecutor since March 1993.

The West campaign cited three $500 donations by Coastal firms for a total of $1,500 in 2004 -- the year after Murphy’s case was dropped.

We also searched state contribution records and did not find any additional donations from Thomas Murphy or Coastal Construction for Fernandez Rundle, a Democrat, in 2004. But we also found that Thomas Murphy gave $500 in 2000 -- a few years before his son’s arrest. Coastal firms gave a total of $2,500 to Fernandez Rundle’s campaign years later, in 2012. (She didn’t face an opponent in 2008.)

In each race, the donations were a small drop in Fernandez Rundle’s six-figure war chests -- she raised about $800,000 in 2004. Fernandez Rundle easily won her races in 2004 and 2012.

We asked West campaign manager Tim Edson if he found any evidence that Murphy’s father and his donations influenced his son’s case being dropped.

""In the TV ad we ran, we just laid the case out,"" Edson said. ""If you are fact-checking the ad, the ad does not say there was any direct correlation. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide. Somebody’s charges were dropped inexplicably, yet campaign contributions were made. It is a fair question to be asked. The public can make a decision for themselves.""

But we found there wasn’t anything particularly special about the donations from Thomas Murphy or his companies to Fernandez Rundle. State and federal records show that Thomas Murphy or his firm has donated to dozens of candidates or political groups for both major parties for a variety of offices including presidential, U.S. Senate, statewide positions and the state Legislature since the late 1990s.

State records show Coastal Construction donated a total of about $136,000 to candidates and political committees between 1997 and 2012. Two of the largest state donations by Coastal Construction were $25,000 to the Republican Party of Florida in 1998 and $50,000 to a committee that supported Democrat Alex Sink’s 2010 bid for governor. Coastal Condominiums also gave $50,000 to the RPOF in 2002.

In a business story in the Miami Herald about Coastal Construction, it states that Patrick Murphy’s campaign did cause his father to stop some political activity: fundraising for Republican Mitt Romney for president.

Murphys’ relationship with Fernandez Rundle

Thomas Murphy didn’t respond to our interview requests, but we did contact his son’s campaign and Fernandez Rundle’s office.

Murphy campaign consultant Eric Johnson said that Thomas Murphy has known Fernandez Rundle for several years through the ""political world.""

Fernandez Rundle said that she knew Thomas Murphy for years but had never met Patrick Murphy until recently. She had seen Thomas Murphy at community or charitable events for years.

Both Johnson and Fernandez Rundle said that Thomas Murphy did not contact her about his son’s arrest.

""This recent focus on a case from 2003 is the first I’ve heard of the matter...,"" Fernandez Rundle wrote in an email. ""Based upon the assistant state attorney’s interview with the arresting police officer, it was determined that the facts of the specific case could not support a belief that the charges could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As a result, the disorderly intoxication charge was dropped and the possession of a stolen driver’s license (for the false I.D.) was directed to traffic court.""

Thomas Murphy’s PAC

West’s ad also says, ""Now Murphy is hiding behind his dad again using his money to fund a negative campaign.""

That’s a reference to the American Sunrise PAC that is largely funded by Murphy’s father who gave $250,000.

The PAC aired an ad depicting a caricature of West, who is African-American, in boxing gloves punching an old white woman, a younger white woman and grabbing money from a black family. The ad was intended to depict West socking it to constituents over Medicare, health care and tax cuts. West and his supporters argued the ad was racist, but the NAACP disagreed. (A Palm Beach Post editorial said the ad wasn’t racist but criticized Murphy for saying he had nothing to do with an ad created by his father.)

West’s ad says ""After Patrick Murphy’s charges were dropped, Murphy’s father gave the prosecutor a huge campaign donation.""

There is a sliver of truth here: After the 2003 case against Murphy was dropped, his father’s companies gave $1,500 to Fernandez Rundle’s re-election campaign. Murphy’s father also gave $500 to Fernandez Rundle in 2000.

But there are two significant problems with this claim. First, we wouldn’t call $1,500 in donations ""huge."" They weren’t huge for Fernandez Rundle, who raised about $800,000 in her 2004 campaign. And the amount wasn’t huge for the companies, either. They had given five-figure donations to the Republican Party of Florida in the past -- and $50,000 to Sink since then.

West’s campaign emphasized that the ad simply lays out the facts for the viewers to decide. But the ad’s images of shadowy meetings and large piles of cash leave viewers with the impression that there was an exchange of campaign donations for Murphy’s case being dropped. We see no evidence to prove that connection.

We rate this ad Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DE7280>],/factchecks/2012/nov/02/allen-west/allen-west-ad-connects-patrick-mur/

Radio ad says Mitt Romney wants to ""get rid of Planned Parenthood”
","
In the final days of the 2012 presidential campaign, the Planned Parenthood Action fund released a radio ad in which a female narrator explains why she is supporting President Barack Obama.

""I’ve been giving my vote a lot of thought,"" the ad says in part. ""For me, it all comes down to who I can trust, and who’s best for my family’s finances. And I just don’t think Mitt Romney is looking out for us. Plus, his views on women seem like they’re from the 1950s. He won’t say if he supports equal pay. That’s real money to us. And he says he wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade and get rid of Planned Parenthood. I know women who go to them for health care and affordable birth control.""

In this item, we’ll focus on the ad’s claim that Romney wants to ""get rid of Planned Parenthood.""

Abortion opponents argue that federal funds should not go to a group like Planned Parenthood that provides abortions, even though federal funds are used for services other than abortion.  

Romney made a pledge to target Planned Parenthood several times -- but that pledge has never been as sweeping as the ad indicates.

In October 2012, for instance, Romney told reporters in Ohio, ""I think I’ve said time and again that I’m a pro-life candidate and I’ll be a pro-life president. The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget.""

And in March 2012, when asked by a Missouri interviewer what he would cut from the federal budget, Romney gave some examples. ""Of course you get rid of Obamacare,"" Romney said. ""That’s the easy one. But there are others. Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak. We would eliminate that.""

Campaign officials clarified after the Missouri interview -- and confirmed to PolitiFact for this story -- that Romney’s position is to eliminate federal payments to Planned Parenthood, but not to eliminate the organization.

So the ad is wrong to say that Romney wants to ""get rid of Planned Parenthood.""

But is there a case that federal funding is so crucial to Planned Parenthood that it would be essentially crippled if federal funding went away?

Planned Parenthood comes close to making this case.

""If a ‘President’ Romney makes good on what he’s promised during the campaign — after he ends safe and legal abortion, cuts off funding for women’s preventive health care services, repeals the Affordable Care Act, and enacts abstinence-only sex education — there wouldn’t be much left of Planned Parenthood,"" said a statement provided to PolitiFact attributed to Dawn Laguens, executive vice president, Planned Parenthood Action Fund.

We can’t predict the future, but we can provide some financial data that gives a sense of how important government funding is to Planned Parenthood.

According to the group’s most recent annual report, covering the year ending in June 2010, ""government health services grants and reimbursements"" amounted to $487 million, or 46 percent of the group’s total revenue of $1.048 billion. (This figure includes both Planned Parenthood’s headquarters as well as its affiliates.)

The other sources of revenue listed were ""non-governmental health services revenue"" (31 percent), ""private contributions and bequests"" (21 percent) and ""other operating revenue"" (2 percent).

There are some important caveats about these figures. Romney was talking about the federal budget, but the ""government"" line in Planned Parenthood’s revenue statement includes funding from all levels of government, not just the federal government.

Planned Parenthood did not provide PolitiFact with a more detailed breakdown of its government revenues, but we can obtain some clues from a 2010 study by the Government Accountability Office.

In 2008, the most recent year for which GAO had full data, Planned Parenthood reported federal spending totaling $88.7 million. The biggest single amount was for services funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration, which directly funds low-income and rural health centers and runs such programs as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. Smaller amounts included funds for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 2008, according to that year’s annual report, Planned Parenthood reported receiving about $349 million in government grants. By this measure, then, the federal funds cited by GAO accounted for about one-quarter of all government funds reported by the organization that year.

The percentage may actually be higher. As we have previously noted, the GAO report counts only direct federal funding and does not appear to include reimbursements for patient services made through Medicaid or other federal health care programs. The group said that Medicaid patients account for about half of its patients, and if you include those who are funded by other federal programs, the percentage rises to two-thirds.

Figuring out how much ""government funding"" could conceivably be eliminated by Romney if he wins office is mostly guesswork. But the hit to Planned Parenthood from Romney’s elimination could range from a 12 percent reduction in its entire budget to perhaps a 35 percent cut.

Would cutting that amount of funding from Planned Parenthood’s budget effectively end the organization? That would be speculation -- but that speculation runs contrary to what Romney has said on multiple occasions.

Our ruling

The Planned Parenthood Action Fund aid said that Romney wants to ""get rid of Planned Parenthood.""

That directly contradicts what Romney has said -- that he wants to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, not abolish the organization -- and his staff reaffirmed that position. There’s no question that an end to federal funding would be a significant blow to the organization’s operations, potentially chopping 12 percent to 35 percent from its budget. But it’s an exaggeration to say that Romney would act to ""get rid"" of the organization. We rate the claim Mostly False. 
UPDATE: After our story appeared, Planned Parenthood provided some additional statistics about how many Medicaid patients use their services. The story has been updated to include that data.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBEBC0>],/factchecks/2012/nov/02/planned-parenthood-action-fund/radio-ad-says-mitt-romney-wants-get-rid-planned-pa/
