Warren says US broadband lags compared to other nations. She's close
","To Elizabeth Warren’s list of plans, add improving rural broadband. In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Warren wrote that over 21 million Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. She blamed the major internet service providers, such as Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and Charter, for profiting at the expense of rural communities and others. ""We lag behind many other developed nations in connectivity and speed, while also paying more for that service,"" Warren continued. We decided to see where the United States stands compared with its peers. Trying to measure this is challenging but Warren’s comments are broad enough that experts say it’s generally accurate. The United States does lag behind other nations by some measures, but rarely is it among the worst performers and it has also gained ground in recent years when it comes to its high speed offerings. Warren cited the latest numbers from the Federal Communications Commission. The agency looks at speed, price and the reach of broadband in 26 countries, plus the United States. The list includes Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Some things to note when making international comparisons: The United States is less densely populated than Europe, which raises costs here. Fixed broadband and mobile broadband are measured separately, and rankings can vary. The 21 million figure Warren cites in her claim refers to those without a fixed, on-the-ground connection. Michael J. Santorelli, director of the Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute at New York Law School, urged caution when comparing nations on this topic.  ""Each country’s broadband market is highly unique, having been shaped by factors like regulatory regime, population density, income, and consumer demand, among many others."" With that in mind, here’s some of what the FCC found based on 2016 numbers. For fixed broadband, the United States ranked 10th on download speed. The tiny country of Luxembourg was way out in the lead with a median download speed of 358 Mbps (megabits per second). After Luxembourg, the speed drops fast. No. 2 Iceland posted a speed of 96 Mbps. The United States was in a tight cluster in the 55 Mbps range, with Spain and Denmark a little faster, and Norway and Portugal a little slower.  Rankings are always a little dicey, because sometimes, tiny differences in speed put one country above another. University of Pennsylvania law professor Christopher Yoo, who specializes in communications and information technology matters, noted that the United States has gained ground over the years. In 2012, the United States ranked 25th for fixed broadband. ""We seem to be in the top half and getting better,"" Yoo said. On a similar measure for mobile broadband, the United States ranked 24th. With a speed of about 41 Mbps, the Netherlands was the winner. The United States clocked in about 19 Mbps, below Portugal, Italy and Czech Republic. The FCC has three ways to come up with prices to compare across all the countries. It uses average prices, and two other approaches that factor in the value of the service as well as variables like population size and density. The results from the different methods vary widely: When it comes to average price, the United States ranks 18th. But when measured using the FCC’s more nuanced methods, it ranks 7th for fixed connection and 10th for mobile.   Penn State telecommunications professor Rob Frieden generally agrees with Warren’s summary, but he says the big picture can mask that some American customers do better than their foreign counterparts. ""For so-called bandwidth hogs who stream lots and lots of video, the U.S. offers some of the lowest cost per megabit transmission speed and megabyte data delivered,"" Frieden said. A British firm called, appropriately, Cable, also collects broadband price information worldwide. In its 2018 survey, based on average monthly cost, the United States ranked 23rd among a list of countries that is similar, but not identical, to the FCC’s list. This is the area where the FCC report delivers more mixed signals. The United States ranks 10th overall for the percentage of the population reached by its fixed broadband networks. For rural areas, the country ranks 9th. But the FCC has no breakdown by country for mobile broadband. Instead, the study compares the United States to a group of 21 European nations. In that light, the United States does better overall, but especially in rural areas: 98% of rural U.S. households have high-speed service. For the 21 EU nations, the fraction slips to 83%. But, using this FCC snapshot as a guide, we don’t have a clear picture of how the United States’ population using mobile broadband stacks up against countries that are not mentioned in this section of the report.  Warren said that the United States lags ""behind many other developed nations in connectivity and speed, while also paying more for that service.""  Her words are sufficiently broad to fit the government report she cited, but the numbers show the United States generally in the middle of the pack for speed, price and reach.  While the top performing nations might stand out, in many cases, small differences in values determine their placement in the rankings. Warren’s statement is generally accurate, but it needs context. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967AC080>],/factchecks/2019/aug/29/elizabeth-warren/warren-says-us-broadband-lags-compared-other-natio/

Evers wrong on texting and driving stat
","Pushing safe driving on Twitter, Gov. Tony Evers urged state residents to buckle up, ditch distractions, drive sober and obey traffic laws. Those phrases appeared in a graphic that accompanied Evers’ Aug. 20, 2019, tweet saying ""safe driving is everyone’s job."" The graphic, created by Evers’ office, used a series of statistics in an attempt to drive home the point. It noted, for example, that seat belt use reduces injuries and that the blood-alcohol limit in Wisconsin is 0.08. But this distractions stat stood out: ""1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving."" Amid all the potential causes for a crash — weather, impaired driving, other technology-related distractions — does texting really account for a full 25%? Let’s see if Evers’ took a wrong turn.  The National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress, says distracted driving of any kind is difficult to track since local authorities don’t consistently record crash data. The council used to track texting and driving, but stopped doing so in 2015 with the proliferation of in-vehicle technology (such as entertainment systems, navigation and phone-linked operating systems). ""The nature of distracted driving has changed with the explosion of built-in dashboard systems,"" said Ken Kolosh, the safety council’s manager of statistics. The council has long used crash stats from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which compiles crash reports from local police agencies around the country. But those reports have not kept up with changes in technology. A safety council report identified Wisconsin as one of a handful of states that require police to enter detailed information in each crash report showing how technology was involved. But that’s the exception rather than the rule. Twenty-six states don’t even have a report field to identify texting as a cause of a crash. Only three states have crash report fields addressing built-in technology in vehicles. A 2013 safety council study of fatal crash reports found that even when drivers admitted phone use to police, the officer listed cellphone use as a cause only half the time.  ""There are no reliable estimates of the number of crashes caused by distracted drivers,"" the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports on its website. ""Statistics based on police-reported crash data almost certainly underestimate the role of distraction in fatal crashes."" The insurance group said there is a clear connection between cellphone use and crash risk, based on several studies conducted over the last decade using in-vehicle cameras and sensors to monitor a sample of drivers. Drivers manipulating a cellphone were two to six times more likely to crash compared to when they weren’t distracted. But none of the available data shows a crash rate like the one Evers cited. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — while noting data concerns about inconsistent reporting between police agencies — reported in April 2019 that distracted driving accounted for 9% of fatal crashes in the U.S. in 2017. Their analysis of crash report data showed 1.2% of fatal crashes were related to cellphone use as a distraction (401 out of 34,247). The last statistics the safety council compiled on texting also fall well short of Evers’ claim. A 2015 safety council analysis, based on 2013 data, found cellphones were a factor in 26% of all crashes, the same as the prior year. But texting accounted for only 6% of crashes. The other 20% were classified as ""talking."" More recent data focuses on driver behaviors rather than connecting them directly to crash frequency. The traffic safety administration reports the number of drivers visibly manipulating a cellphone — based on an observational survey  — has risen slightly since then. But overall observed use of a handheld cellphone (not counting hands-free devices) has dropped from 4.6% in 2013 to 2.9% in 2017. A 2016 safety council survey found 32% of drivers were willing to occasionally review or send text messages, and 20% to 25% said they were willing to review or send email, check social media or surf the Internet. An Evers spokeswoman did not provide any evidence to support the texting and driving claim. Evers said in a tweet that texting and driving accounts for 1 in 4 crashes nationwide. The general point is right that distracted driving is a significant and deadly problem. And cellphone use is a core piece of that. But the statistic he used to make that point is wrong. Experts say we don’t have enough data to show how many crashes are currently related to texting. And the latest attempt to do that using 2013 data found only 6% of crashes were directly tied to texting — far short of what Evers’ claimed. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A69C0>],/factchecks/2019/aug/28/tony-evers/evers-wrong-texting-and-driving-stat/

Donald Trump misleads on Russia, Crimea, Obama and the G-8
","  President Donald Trump entered the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, urging his fellow members to re-admit Russia to the group, from which it had been expelled in 2014. Other G-7 members gave the idea a cool reception.  During a post-summit question-and-answer session with journalists, Trump was asked about it. Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked Trump, ""Why do you think it’s appropriate to invite Russia to the G-7, given that they’ve meddled in the 2016 election? And are you worried that if Russia does come to the G-7, that it might hurt you politically, because it’s only going to be a couple months before the 2020 election? Trump said it was better to have Russia inside the room than outside, but he then turned his focus to his predecessor, President Barack Obama. ""A lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama,"" Trump said.  Trump cited Crimea, a peninsula located on the Black Sea. Following the ousting of Ukraine’s pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014 and officially absorbed it into Russia. (Until 1954, Crimea had previously been part of Russia.). ""It was sort of taken away from President Obama,"" Trump said. ""Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the ‘G-8.’ And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama."" Experts contacted by PolitiFact said Trump’s statement is filled with misleading assertions. For starters, Russia did invade and, eventually, annex Crimea during Obama’s presidency -- in February and March 2014. But Russia didn’t take Crimea away from either Obama or the United States – it took the region away from Ukraine, of which it which it was an internationally recognized part. Trump’s statement is ""a very odd way of thinking about Crimea and the United States’ role in Ukraine,"" said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. ""It is highly misleading and factually incorrect. The U.S. exercised a certain influence among certain Kiev and Ukrainian politicians – how much and whom is disputed – but the U.S. never ‘had’ Crimea."" In addition, Trump’s phrasing – ""sort of taken away"" – soft-pedals Russia’s coercive actions in seizing Crimea, said Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""This is not what you call a military occupation,"" Åslund said. It’s also worth noting that, despite Trump’s focus on his predecessor, Obama wasn’t alone in opposing Russia’s annexation. Virtually the entire global community refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. ""Europe, the United Nations and other U.S. allies opposed the invasion and annexation,"" said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. ""It wasn’t just Obama who opposed it."" Trump’s statement is problematic for other reasons. While the Obama administration did support Russia’s expulsion from the G-8 over the annexation of Crimea, it did not do so unilaterally, and in fact could not have acted unilaterally. ""The G-7 was united behind the decision to kick out Russia from G-8, so it was a common consensus decision,"" Åslund said. In a communique dated March 24, 2014, the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Council and the European Commission jointly wrote that they ""strongly condemn"" Russia’s actions in Crimea. The signatories agreed that they would not participate in a scheduled G-8 meeting in Sochi, Russia, and that they would ""suspend our participation in the G-8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G-8 is able to have a meaningful discussion."" To date, the G-8 has not invited Russia back into the fold. All in all, Trump ""seems to find it hard to believe that there could be any reason other than embarrassment to oppose aggression and territorial dismemberment of a major European state,"" said Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Trump said that Crimea ""was sort of taken away from President Obama. … And he wanted Russia to be out of what was called the G-8. And that was his determination."" Obama did oppose Russia’s annexation of Crimea and back its expulsion from the G-8, but Trump’s view leaves out much of the story. Trump’s remark ignores both widespread opposition to Russian’s actions within Europe and among U.S. allies, as well as the strongly worded decision by the remaining G-7 nations to expel Russia from the group. It also ignores that Crimea was ""taken away"" from Ukraine, not Obama.

Donald Trump miscasts the money and the terms in the Iran nuclear deal
","The G7 meeting closed with a possible sign of reduced tensions between Iran and the United States. After months of charges and counter charges, both President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani floated the idea of meeting with each other. In May 2018, Trump pulled out of the multinational agreement that had rolled back Iran’s nuclear program and opened its facilities to international inspectors.  In a post-G7 news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said the United States had ""made a ridiculous deal"" with Iran. ""We gave them $150 billion,"" Trump said Aug. 26. ""We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing."" We’ve checked this before and on the numbers, the $150 billion is sketchy at best, while the $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. But it’s important to remember that however much money was involved, it started out as Iran’s. It had been frozen by sanctions since 1979.  As for whether the United States ""got nothing"" from the deal, that view puts a value of zero on rolling back Iran’s nuclear program, which the agreement accomplished. The 2015 agreement, promoted by then President Barack Obama, freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. Called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal included Iran and the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  The agreement only affected sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear program. Iran has other frozen assets that were untouched by the deal. Some conservatives have put the amount released as high as $150 billion, which is the highest of estimates we have seen. Another estimate from Iran’s Central Bank topped out at about $29 billion in readily available funds, with another $45 billion tied up in Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of Iran’s Oil Ministry. After talking with officials at Iran’s Central Bank, Nader Habibi, professor of economics of the Middle East at Brandeis University, told PolitiFact in 2018 that the actual total is between $25 billion and $50 billion. In July 2015, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told lawmakers Iran would gain access to $56 billion. Even though Trump said that ""we gave"" Iran the money, little of that money was under the control of the United States or any U.S. bank. Most of it, Habibi said, was in central and commercial banks overseas. Furthermore, it was Iran’s money to begin with, not a payment from any government to buy Iran’s cooperation. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed the cash transfer of $1.7 billion in a 2018 report.  That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, and it was never delivered. As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount, which is a lot of money — but 25 years is a long time for interest to build up the balance. Trump’s claim that we got ""nothing"" in return misses the point of the deal: blocking Iran from building a nuclear bomb. ""We got major restrictions and intrusive transparency on Iran's nuclear program. Beyond being not ‘nothing,’ this is the entire reason why we put the sanctions on in the first place,"" Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told us in 2016. ""Reasonable people may disagree whether we got enough for the sanctions relief, but it wasn't nothing."" ""There’s a long list (of things we got), such that even the Israeli intelligence community has concluded that, for the duration of the deal, Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon,"" said George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Under the deal, Iran agreed to lose 97% of its stockpile of enriched uranium and give up 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, which are needed to enrich uranium. It also agreed to curb production of plutonium (the other element that can be used to build a bomb) and dismantle its one plutonium reactor. To make sure Iran held up its end of the bargain, the deal also permitted international inspectors to ""implement continuous monitoring."" What that means and whether it was enough are up for debate. Trump said that under the 2015 nuclear deal, the United States ""gave"" Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion, and ""got nothing"" for either. The $150 billion — which was not a gift, but an unfreezing of Iran’s assets — is the highest estimate we've seen, and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower. The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion.  As for ""getting nothing"" out of the deal, while some people will disagree that the United States got enough, it prevented Iran from getting enough fuel to build a bomb and allowing international inspectors. That’s more than nothing. The official record backs up just one out of the three elements in Trump’s statement. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A0700>],/factchecks/2019/aug/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-miscasts-money-and-terms-iran-nuclear/

Bernie Sanders is right that South Carolina spends more on prisons than schools
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., accused South Carolina of spending too much on prisons and not enough on schools, keying in on the issues of mass incarceration and education with an eye toward the early primary state. ""Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student,"" Sanders wrote in an Aug. 26 post. ""We should be investing in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration."" South Carolina’s situation is not unique. Across the country, states spend more on average to lock people up than to educate students. Sanders may have focused on the Palmetto State because its Feb. 29 Democratic primary vote represents the first real test case of candidates’ strength with black voters, who cite criminal justice and education as critical issues. In 2016, Sanders lost the African American vote to Hillary Clinton by an astonishing 50 percentage points. Sanders’ numbers checked out. But the gap between South Carolina’s spending on prisons and schools is nowhere near the biggest disparity among the states.  Sanders is correct: South Carolina spent an average of $21,756 on each of its roughly 20,000 inmates in 2018, according to a South Carolina Department of Corrections budget sheet that Sanders’ campaign referred us to.  During the 2017-18 academic year, the Palmetto State spent an average of $11,525 per student. That data comes from the National Education Association’s annual assessment, which Sanders’ campaign pointed us to.  That’s a difference of about $10,000 more on prisons than schools. We heard from a South Carolina Department of Corrections official who pushed back against Sanders’ claim, saying that comparing inmate cost-per-year versus students ""is not an apples to apples comparison."" ""Inmate cost includes 24-hour care, housing, clothing, feeding, medical care, mental health care, programming, 24-hour security, plus education costs,"" the spokesperson said. But other experts we spoke to said the comparison is a reasonable way to gauge a state’s priorities.  ""It’s hard to argue that spending twice as much on prisons as on schools doesn’t reflect some distorted priorities,"" said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. ""By international standards, the U.S. has an inordinate number of people in prison, and by international standards is underinvesting in education."" The disparity between prison and school spending is not unique to South Carolina — in fact, it’s the same across the country. We compared the most recent data on state prison spending from the Vera Institute of Justice, a criminal justice think tank, with state-by-state public school expenditures from the National Education Association.  Every state averaged more spending on inmates than students, based on the available data from 2015, which included 45 states. On average, these states spent $11,709 per student, and $33,274 per inmate, or nearly three times more on prisons than schools.  Among the states we compared, South Carolina had the ninth lowest disparity between inmate and student spending. If Sanders had wanted to highlight the largest disparity — $53,497 — he should have turned to deep blue California. In 2015, Sacramento spent an average of nearly $65,000 per prisoner, almost double the statewide average. That same year, California spent close to the statewide average on education per pupil, just over $11,000.  ""I think this is generally a reasonable comparison of state priorities,"" said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project. ""In many states spending on corrections has increased at a far higher rate than for education over the past several decades."" Sanders said, ""Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prison inmate and $11,552 per student."" Sanders is correct that South Carolina averaged more spending per inmate than student last year. But the disparity in prison versus school spending is true across the country, and in most states the gap is wider than in South Carolina.

Facebook post makes inaccurate comparison of family separations under Trump, Obama
","A Facebook post falsely claims that a significantly higher number of children were separated from their parents during the Obama administration than under President Donald Trump’s administration. ""Did you know 89,000 children were separated from their parents under Obama? ONLY 1,900 children have been separated under Trump. This PERFECTLY exposes the bias of the media,"" said the Facebook post from Aug. 25, with nearly 400 shares. ""Good to know,"" wrote one commenter. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post doesn’t specifically say ""immigrant"" children — but the national discussion on separated families has centered on children and parents separated at the southwest border as a consequence of Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. The policy called for the prosecution of immigrants who crossed the border illegally; when adults came in with children, they were separated by immigration officials. Children were transferred over to the care of Health and Human Services Department, and adults taken into federal custody for prosecution. Generally, under Trump and other administrations, immigration officials separate a child from an adult under three conditions: when authorities cannot establish the custodial relationship, when they believe that the custodian may be a threat to the child, or when the custodian is being detained for prosecution. Immigration experts have told PolitiFact that immigrant family separations at the border during the Obama years did not happen at the scale that have under Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy. In November, Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, told PolitiFact that the Obama administration did not count the number of families separated. We don’t know where the Facebook post got its 89,000 figure. It’s possible that it’s a reference to a different set of children — children who arrived at the border alone without a parent or a guardian rather than those separated from their parents. A 2016 Senate subcommittee report said that since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, Health and Human Services had placed almost 90,000 unaccompanied immigrant children with sponsors in the United States. ""According to HHS, it places the majority of those (unaccompanied alien children) with the child’s parent or legal guardian,"" the report said. Overall, family separations did not happen under the Obama administration as a result of a ""zero-tolerance"" policy like Trump’s, despite Trump’s false claims that both presidents ""had the exact same policy."" The total number of children separated from their parents under Trump’s administration is unclear because of faulty record-keeping. In June 2018, officials said that at least 2,342 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9 of 2018 as a result of the ""zero-tolerance"" policy. Under a court order, around 2,800 children have been reunited with their parents or otherwise discharged from federal custody. Our ruling A Facebook post claimed that ""89,000 children were separated from their parents under Obama"" and ""only 1,900 children have been separated under Trump."" Immigration experts have told PolitiFact that family separations under Trump happened at a larger scale than they did under Obama. The Obama administration did not have a ""zero-tolerance"" policy that led to systematic family separations, as did Trump’s administration. A spokeswoman for Homeland Security previously told PolitiFact that the Obama administration did not track the number of families separated. The Facebook post’s 89,000 number might be a reference to a number of children placed with sponsors during Obama’s administration — but those children arrived alone without a parent or guardian. That doesn’t mean they were separated from their parents. The exact number of children separated under Trump is unclear, but based on previous data provided by Trump officials, the number at least surpasses 1,900. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

No, Robert E. Lee was not ‘against slavery’ as Facebook post claims
","As debate continues over the call to remove statues and monuments memorializing the Confederacy and its leaders, an eyebrow-raising claim about the army’s famous commander, Robert E. Lee, is circulating online.  It says that Lee was ""against slavery"" – even though he commanded the army that fought to uphold the barbaric institution. A viral Facebook post displays a painting of the Islamic prophet Muhammad next to an image of the Confederate commander with accompanying text that says: ""Muhammad owned many slaves. Robert E. Lee was against slavery. So why are we tearing down statues instead of mosques?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Yes, the prophet Muhammad owned slaves – but so did Lee. Muhammad, who lived more than 1,000 years before Lee, reportedly taught that ""slaves were to be regarded as human beings with dignity and rights and not just as property, and that freeing slaves was a virtuous thing to do."" That said, Muslims in the 7th century, when Muhammad lived, still deemed slavery as legal. According to an article posted by American Civil War Museum on its website, Lee personally owned slaves he inherited upon the death of his mother, Ann Lee in 1829. Then, in 1857, following the death of his father-in-law, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people working between two estates. Interestingly, Lee’s father-in-law specified in his will that all the family’s slaves be freed within five years of his death.  But Sean Kane, then the museum’s interpretation and programs specialist, reported that Lee, as executor of the will, ""drove his new-found labor force hard to lift those estates from debt,"" and concerned it would take longer than five years, ""petitioned state courts to extend his control of enslaved people."" That didn’t happen, as Lee freed them in accordance with the will in 1862 (and three days before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect). However, in response to the brutal workload during those last years, many of the slaves attempted to escape.  ""In 1859 Wesley Norris, his sister Mary, and their cousin, George Parks, escaped to Maryland where they were captured and returned to Arlington,"" the museum said. In a later testimony in 1866, Norris reportedly said they were immediately taken before Lee, whose punishment was ordering them to be tied up to receive 50 lashes each, excluding Norris’ sister, who got 20.   Regardless of that account, historians continue to argue over Lee’s position on slavery. Some of Lee’s letters and post-war statements paint an ambiguous picture of a man with a lukewarm opposition to it, but his own actions, slave-owning practices and other statements contradict that position.  One of the most prominent letters that Lee’s defenders point to is one he wrote to his wife on Dec. 27, 1856: ""In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.""  But he goes on to say that slavery was ""a greater evil to the white man than to the black race"" and ""while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former."" Lee wrote that African Americans were ""immeasurably better off"" in America than in Africa and that the ""painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race..."" PolitiFact reached out to Eric Foner, a Civil War historian and Columbia University professor, on the veracity of the claim. Foner referred us to a passage he wrote on Lee’s connection with slavery: ""During his lifetime, Lee owned a small number of slaves. He considered himself a paternalistic master but could also impose severe punishments, especially on those who attempted to run away. Lee said almost nothing in public about the institution. His most extended comment, quoted by all biographers, came in a letter to his wife in 1856. Here he described slavery as an evil, but one that had more deleterious effects on whites than blacks. He felt that the ‘painful discipline’ to which they were subjected benefitted blacks by elevating them from barbarism to civilization and introducing them to Christianity. The end of slavery would come in God's good time, but this might take quite a while, since to God a thousand years was just a moment. Meanwhile, the greatest danger to the ‘liberty’ of white southerners was the ‘evil course’ pursued by the abolitionists, who stirred up sectional hatred. In 1860, Lee voted for John C. Breckenridge, the extreme proslavery candidate (a more moderate southerner, John Bell, carried Virginia that year)."" ""I would not say that this qualifies Lee as ‘against slavery,’"" Foner added in an email.  John Reeves, author of ""The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee"" wrote a post on some of the most popular myths attributed to the general – the first being Lee’s opposition to slavery. Reeves explains that after losing the war, Lee attempted to present himself as always being against slavery. In an interview after his surrender, Reeves says, Lee said that ""the best men of the south"" were eager to do away with it, and in a testimony in 1866 he had ""always been in favor of emancipation — gradual emancipation."" But, as Foner said, Reeves writes that the historical record doesn’t support these statements, as Lee and his family owned and managed slaves for decades and benefited ""tremendously"" from the institution. A Facebook post says that the prophet Muhammad owned many slaves while Robert E. Lee was against slavery. Both men owned slaves. Meanwhile, Lee, besides serving as commander of the army that fought to uphold slavery, imposed harsh punishments when his slaves disobeyed and said he thought the ""painful discipline"" was necessary for the ""instruction of the race,"" and that the end of slavery would come when God willed it.  While Lee made some mixed statements on his feelings toward slavery, his actions and political positions contradict that he opposed it.

White Catholics are more likely to vote Republican, and Hispanic Catholics ""overwhelmingly back Democrats.""  Republican and Democratic Catholics both used to admire Pope Francis, according to Pew, but he’s become an increasingly polarizing figure in the church.

No evidence to support this Clinton body count hoax
","Rumors have smoldered online for years that the Clinton family murders its political enemies. We’ve debunked some, such as the claim that investigators found the remains of missing women in steel barrels on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s property. Or that a doctor was murdered after criticizing the Clinton Foundation. (There are more.) On Aug. 13, a Facebook post alleged yet another victim of the political family.  ""I’m Suzanne Coleman,"" reads the text above a black-and-white photo of a woman. ""After having an affair with Bill Clinton I became pregnant. Then my body was found with a gunshot wound to the back of my head. It was ruled a suicide and no autopsy was allowed. I was 7 months pregnant.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because there’s no credible evidence supporting the idea that Coleman was killed after having an affair with Bill Clinton. In fact, the rumor was discredited as early as the 1992 presidential campaign. Here are the facts. Susan Coleman, not Suzanne Coleman as the Facebook post says, was a former law student of Bill Clinton at the University of Arkansas. Clinton taught there after earning his law degree in 1973. Coleman committed suicide in 1977, according to numerous published reports.  During the presidential election that year, a young conservative named David Bossie ""was dispatched to sniff around Bill Clinton’s sex life by the Republican operative Floyd Brown, the founder of Citizens United,"" according to a 2016 story in the Atlantic. Bossie and a retired police officer named Jim Murphy were working for Brown as they tried to confirm Coleman shot herself ""following a love affair with her law professor, Bill Clinton, that left her pregnant,"" CBS reported, according to the Washington Post.  Murphy and Bossie, who helped run Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, followed Coleman’s mother to an Army hospital in Georgia, according to CBS, and ""burst"" into the room where her husband was being treated for a stroke ""and began questioning the shaken mother about her daughter’s suicide.""  CBS Evening News reported that the investigation stemmed from an anonymous letter mass mailed to news organizations but that Coleman’s family ""maintained there was no truth to this, and said reporters who had investigated the letter found it to be a nasty hoax,"" according to UPI.  After reading a transcript of the CBS News report, then-president George H.W. Bush ordered his campaign to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Brown, ""the hard-ball political ad man who has gone from being seen as (an) asset to a liability,"" UPI reported.  Searching the Nexis news archive for stories that could corroborate the allegations made in the Facebook post, we found none.

Biden wrong when he says Trump hasn’t condemned David Duke
","Joe Biden said that President Donald Trump has failed to condemn racist leaders like David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, and white nationalist Richard Spencer. In a speech in Iowa Aug. 20, Biden said: ""David Duke, head of the Ku Klux Klan, former head of the Klan. When that group came out of the woods, the fields, carrying those torches he said, ‘That’s why we voted for Donald Trump.’ He said he would take the country back. The white nationalist, Richard Spencer, he hailed Trump. He said, ‘This is the white nationalism we have been looking for.’ Did you hear him condemn either one of those people? Ever utter a word of condemnation?"" Biden didn’t answer his own question, but he was clearly stating Trump hasn’t condemned either racist leader. Biden accurately quoted Duke’s comments about Trump, and Spencer did hail Trump.  But Biden exaggerates when he says Trump hasn’t condemned Duke at all. Trump’s condemnation of Duke goes back decades, though sometimes Trump has been more forceful than other times. Trump has also criticized demonstrations in which Spencer participated. But then Trump also said that there were ""very fine people, on both sides"" at the Charlottesville, Va., march. In 2016, we fact-checked a claim that ""Trump refuses to denounce the KKK."" We rated the statement Mostly False.  The ad distorted Trump’s record by cherry picking one interview in which CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Trump about Duke in February 2016. Duke founded a Louisiana chapter of the KKK in 1974, but left in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence. Since then, Duke has been a noted white supremacist.  Tapper asked Trump if he would condemn Duke and say that he didn’t want the vote of white supremacists. Trump replied: ""Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.""  Trump later blamed a bad ear piece, saying he could barely hear the questions. In the days that followed, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a ""bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years."" The Biden campaign pointed to that interview when we asked them for evidence to support Biden’s claim. The campaign also referred us to instances when Trump denied knowing anything about Duke or gave testy disavowals. We found Trump denounced Duke years before his interview with Tapper. In 1991, CNN’s Larry King asked Trump what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented. Trump replied: ""I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States."" In 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted Duke’s support. Trump also called Duke ""a bigot, a racist, a problem.""  During his 2016 bid, Trump disavowed Duke, but it was not as strongly worded as some of his earlier rebukes. In 2015, when asked about a quasi-endorsement by Duke, Trump replied that he wouldn’t want his endorsement. Asked if he would repudiate Duke, he replied: ""Sure, I would do that, if it made you feel better. I don’t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. Actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all of the candidates."" In 2016, when asked about Duke’s endorsement of him, Trump said he wasn’t aware of it. ""I didn’t even know he endorsed me,"" he said. ""David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?"" Sometimes Trump sounded exasperated by the question. ""I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan,"" he said in a debate. ""I totally disavow David Duke. I’ve been doing it now for two weeks, ... you’re probably about the 18th person that’s asked me the question."" We didn’t find any instance when Trump was asked to denounce Spencer by name. But Trump has criticized events where Spencer, the head of a white-identity think tank, played a key role. In November 2016, a New York Times journalist asked Trump about a recent conference in Washington D.C. of people who pledged allegiance to Nazism. Trump said, ""Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn."" At the conference, Spencer saluted supporters with, ""Hail Trump.""  Spencer was one of the leaders behind the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017 where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her. Trump’s statement on Aug. 12, 2017, cast blame on ""many sides"", detracting from his overall message condemning bigotry. ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,"" he said. ""It's been going on for a long time in our country.""   In the following days, Trump condemned bigotry and neo-Nazis and white nationalists. But in the same breath he also told reporters, ""You also had people that were very fine people, on both sides."" In other instances, Trump has condemned hate groups or racism without singling out any racist leader. Following the mass shooting in El Paso, Trump condemned the shooter, who he said posted a manifesto ""consumed by racist hate."" Biden said Trump hasn’t condemned Duke and Spencer. That’s an exaggeration. Trump didn’t condemn Duke when asked about him in an interview with Tapper on CNN in 2016. But decades before, he had clearly condemned the former KKK leader -- and he did so after the Tapper interview, too. Some of his disavowals have been brief. We can’t find an example of Trump condemning Spencer by name or being asked to do so, but he has criticized gatherings where Spencer, a white nationalist, played a major role, including Charlottesville.  But Trump has at times detracted from his own denunciation of racism. Most notably, Trump said there were ""very fine people, on both sides"" at the Charlottesville march. At other times his denunciations have seemed reluctantly made. But he has made them.

Instagram post misconstrues food companies’ support for Donald Trump
","A popular social media hoax is trying to link about a dozen chain restaurants to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. According to the rumor, which has been shared widely on social media platforms, businesses like In-N-Out, Taco Bell and Olive Garden are supporting the president in the 2020 presidential election. The photo lists 12 such companies. ""Not much of a fast food eater but just in case I get a craving this is motivation to eat healthier for sure!"" one Instagram caption reads. (Screenshot from Instagram) This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram’s parent company.) The Washington Post wrote about this fast food rumor Aug. 9 after a college student’s tweet of the list went viral. It amassed nearly 250,000 retweets, helped partially by a quote tweet from Chrissy Teigen, a model and TV personality. ""So if you see me starting to get thinner and toned don’t ask me why,"" the original tweet reads. In a reply to his original tweet, the original poster, whose real name is Zuriel Sanders, linked to five webpages as evidence. None of them back up his claim that 12 restaurants are directly supporting Trump in 2020. Two links are from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks political donations. The first shows that Chick-Fil-A employees, owners or their family members donated $36,530 to candidates during the 2016 election, with the bulk of the money going to Republicans. But that’s money from the last election cycle, it went to all national politicians (not just Trump) and, as a note on the website states, none of that money was donated by the company itself. The second link shows the top contributors in the food and beverage industry to candidates in 2019-2020. McDonald’s Corp. tops the list with $238,220, the majority of which has gone to Republicans. Waffle House, Inc. also made the top 10 with $68,950 going to Republicans and other conservatives. McDonald’s did not respond to our request for comment. But a closer look at the company’s political contributions show that there’s no evidence to suggest it’s directly supporting Trump in 2020. RELATED: Does a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase go to Trump re-election efforts? Not exactly The Center for Responsive Politics does not have data to indicate that individuals and PACs associated with the company have donated to Trump so far this election cycle. Numbers from the 2016 election show that Hillary Clinton was the candidate with the most single contributions. What the data do show about 2020 contributions is that the McDonald’s PAC has contributed $98,500 to federal candidates so far, with the lion’s share going to Republicans. None has gone to Trump so far, according to the Center’s data. We looked at political contributions from the other 10 companies, and their associated PACs, listed in the Instagram post. We found that only one of them, Taco Bell’s TACO PAC, supported Trump in 2016. And only a PAC affiliated with Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns the energy drink Bang, has contributed money to Trump’s 2020 re-election, as we noted in a previous fact check. Finally, Trump isn’t the top recipient of money from the food and beverage industry so far. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is. The other three links the original tweeter included as evidence for his claim are three news stories. They speak to the political leanings of fast food restaurants’ owners and operators, but they don’t prove the claim that 12 companies are supporting Trump in 2020. The first link is to an article from a site called The Cheat Sheet. It claims to reveal the political leanings behind several popular restaurant chains. Chick-Fil-A, Pizza Hut, Waffle House, KFC, McDonald’s, Wendy’s and IHOP are conservative, the site says. As evidence, the article points to news reports about each company’s past political contributions, which have mostly gone to Republican candidates. But those stories don’t mention the companies’ PACs contributing to Trump directly. A 2016 Eater story cited by the Cheat Sheet even says so: ""Restaurant PACs — at least those on Eater’s list — aren’t donating to Clinton or Trump. Instead, PACs tend to work for the best interests of the company as a whole,"" reads the story, which analyzed political contributions from PACs supported by Wendy’s, Chick-Fil-A and Yum! Brands (which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut), among others. Jim Fortier, left, and Mark Toomajian, kiss as they join about two dozen members of gay rights groups and others protesting outside the Decatur, Ga., Chick-fil-A restaurant Friday, Aug. 3, 2012. (AP Photo/David Tulis) The second news link the tweeter shared comes from Food & Wine. It reported in 2016 that TACO PAC had ""maxed out its giving to the Trump campaign."" As evidence, the article cited data from the Center for Responsive Politics. They show that TACO PAC gave $5,000 to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election cycle. That PAC has not contributed any money to federal candidates so far this cycle. The last news story the tweeter linked to comes from Salon. It reported on five ""radically conservative fast food companies,"" which included Chick-Fil-A, Carl’s Jr. and Waffle House. That article points to other media accounts and interviews with the company’s founders and executives that elucidate their views. For example, Salon wrote about how Chick-Fil-A President Dan Cathy has spoken out in support of the ""traditional family"" and operating by ""biblical principles,"" which echo conservative values. But none of the stories cited prove that the companies in question are directly supporting Trump’s 2020 campaign. PolitiFact reached out to each of the companies listed in the original tweet, save Bang, which we fact-checked before.  We rated as Mostly False the claim that the energy drink company gives a portion of each energy drink sale to Trump’s campaign. But the fact-check noted that Bang’s leaders have been outspoken in support of Trump and Bang’s parent company did make a donation to a pro-Trump super PAC this year. Of the 11 companies we contacted, six responded. Here’s what they told us:  Chick-Fil-A: ""Chick-Fil-A does not make political contributions. We don’t contribute to a (political action committee)."" IHOP: ""We’re about pancakes, not politics. IHOP as a brand is not involved in providing financial support to either side of the aisle."" In-N-Out: ""At In-N-Out Burger, we have always taken pride in providing the freshest, highest quality food to all of our customers regardless of political party and, as such, we do not take a position on, nor support, individual political candidates."" Olive Garden: ""We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates."" Pizza Hut: ""Pizza Hut does not make donations to presidential political campaigns, and we do not endorse any political parties or candidates. Pizza Hut has no involvement with or control over donations made by our franchisees, who are independent business owners and, like all Americans, are free to donate to or support whomever they wish."" Taco Bell: ""Taco Bell Corp. does not make donations to presidential political campaigns and has no involvement with or control over donations made by franchisees. Our franchisees are independent business people and, like all Americans, are free to donate to or support whomever they wish."" While it’s true that most of the companies named in the Instagram post have contributed money to PACs in the past, including those that mostly support Republicans, we found no evidence that all of them have donated or endorsed 2020 candidates directly. Only Bang’s parent company has contributed to a pro-Trump PAC so far. An Instagram post claimed that 12 food companies are supporting Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. Campaign contribution data show that, while many of their employees and affiliates give money to Republican candidates, none of the companies mentioned have donated to Trump’s re-election effort directly. One company is associated with a PAC that gave to the president in 2016, and one is associated with a PAC that has given to Trump during this election cycle. News stories speak to the companies’ political views and past contributions, but they don’t prove support for Trump. Six companies denied making direct political contributions and/or endorsing presidential candidates. The post is not accurate.

At the age of 10, Obama moved back to his birthplace of Hawaii and stopped using the last name.  This is wrong. California Sen. Kamala Harris was named Kamala Devi Harris when she was born on Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, Calif. She has a younger sister named Maya Harris. No. U.S. Rep. Ihan Omar’s ""real"" name is Ilhan Abdullahi Omar. The Minnesota congresswoman married, and divorced, a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. (Not Elsi, as the post spells it). Bill de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. on May 8, 1961, in Manhattan. But in 1983, he petitioned a New York court to change his name to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm because he said his father was largely absent and he wanted to embrace his mother’s Italian heritage. He formally adopted the name Bill de Blasio in January 2002.  Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s real name is Elizabeth Warren. She was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City to parents Donald and Pauline Herring. ""Liz,"" of course, is a common shortened nickname for the name Elizabeth. (Her childhood nickname, Betsy, is what her mother called her.) She kept the last name Warren after she and her first husband, Jim Warren, divorced in 1980. This is weird cherry-picking. The South Bend, Ind., mayor’s full name is Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg (not ""Buttigeig"" as the post spells it). He is the only child to Joseph Buttigieg and Jennifer Anne Montgomery Buttigieg.  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ real name is Bernard Sanders. His parents were Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders and Dorothy Glassberg. The misconception that the senator’s surname is actually Gutman appears to come from a 1921 U.S. immigration record when his father arrived from Poland. The record lists Sanders’ father as Eliasz Gitman, though he was naturalized under Elias Sanders. The recording lists Bernie Sanders’ grandmother as Jetti Gutman, which was her married name. A viral Facebook post claims a list of prominent Democratic politicians are concealing their true identities from the public and shares what it says are their ""real names."" The names the candidates are accused of faking are, in fact, their legal names.

Trump family ‘disallowed’ from operating charities in New York? No.
","UPDATE, Nov. 7, 2019: New York Attorney General Letitia James on Nov. 7, 2019, announced that the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald J. Trump to pay $2 million in damages ""for improperly using charitable assets to intervene in the 2016 presidential primaries and further his own political interests."" As part of the settlement, other stipulations in the lawsuit were resolved, including one related to the Trump family’s involvement with charities. The settlement required mandatory training for the three elder Trump children and imposed restrictions on Donald J. Trump should he join another charity as director.  Any charity for which Trump serves as a director must have a majority of independent directors (meaning no one in his inner-circle). Also, it must engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law. And it has to use the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization’s grants and expenses. If Trump starts a new charity, that charity must also comply with those requirements and report to the New York Attorney General for five years. The settlement includes a ""total ban on any self-dealing,"" as the lawsuit had charged that Trump repeatedly used his foundation's money for his own personal, business, and political interests. The settlement, however, does not ban the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, as this original Facebook post claimed. Our ruling on this statement remains unchanged. What follows is the original post: A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York. But a Facebook post takes it further by claiming that the family has already been ""disallowed."" That hasn’t happened. ""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity,"" said the Oct. 8 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 43,000 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In June 2018, the New York Attorney General (then Barbara Underwood) filed a lawsuit against Trump and three of his adult children — Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump — and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three eldest children were on the board of directors. ""This pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law,"" the lawsuit said. As a result, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service in New York not-for-profit or charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit wants to ban Trump’s involvement for ten years and the three Trump children for one year. The Trump children’s ban would be subject to suspension if they undergo training on related fiduciary duties. The Donald J. Trump Foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve. But the legal case is still ongoing. A spokesperson for the Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James said the office could not comment on the pending case. The Facebook post includes a picture of Trump and his son, Eric, posing for what appears to have been an event for the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. St. Jude treats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The Eric Trump Foundation raised money for St. Jude.  Eric Trump’s foundation has also come under scrutiny, but the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps’ involvement in New York charities is not tied to the Eric Trump Foundation. Forbes has reported that Eric Trump’s foundation gave donors the impression that all funds it raised at an annual golf event went to St. Jude, yet more than $500,000 went to other causes; and that at least four groups that received donations from Eric Trump’s foundation later paid for golf tournaments at Trump-owned courses. Eric Trump in December 2016 resigned from his own foundation, and the foundation restructured and rebranded itself as Curetivity. A Facebook post said, ""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity."" A lawsuit does seek to temporarily ban Donald Trump and his three eldest children from being part of charities in New York. But that case is still pending.  The lawsuit relates to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, not to a kids cancer charity. The lawsuit alleges that Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations of entities he controlled, to promote his hotels, to buy personal items, and to support his presidential election campaign. Trump’s son, Eric, led a foundation that raised money for kids with cancer, and that foundation has come under scrutiny over its own handling of funds. But the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps from participating in charities isn’t pegged to Eric Trump’s foundation.

"['National', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Andrew Yang']","
Andrew Yang's claim of support among Trump voters rates Pants on Fire
","  Democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang has regularly touted his cross-partisan appeal, and he usually cites a particular data point to make that case. ""I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general,"" Yang said in a sit-down with the Washington Post on Oct. 22. Earlier, he said something similar to CBS News and in a tweet. A reader asked us to check whether this was true, so we took a closer look. When we checked with Yang’s campaign, they pointed to a survey by the Economist and YouGov conducted from July 21-23. The survey asked voters whether they planned to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus; if they said yes, they were asked who they would vote for. Out of 1,500 total adult respondents, 460 said they were planning to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. Separately, poll respondents had been asked who they voted for in 2016, Trump or Hillary Clinton. Of those 460, 41 said they had voted for Trump in 2016. Of those 41 voters, 10% said they would support Yang, ranking him second to Bernie Sanders at 14%. Other candidates close to double digits were Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Julian Castro at 8%, while 12% said they weren’t sure. This tracks with what Yang said. But coming from the guy who says he wants to ""Make America Think Harder,"" Yang needs a course in how polling works. The Economist/YouGov poll has asked the same question every week since the July 21-23 survey Yang cited. The later polls squash any notion that Yang has high support among Trump voters.  Here’s a rundown of every Economist-YouGov poll with enough responses since late July, showing Yang’s percentage among past Trump voters compared to other top finishers. We located these in the fivethirtyeight.com polling archive. Of the 11 subsequent polls, Yang only matched or exceeded 10% twice. More often, Yang’s share of the Trump vote was much lower than that. In the most recent poll, Yang’s share of the Trump voter support was zero. In fact, the July poll Yang cites is the only time Yang finished in the top two among Democrats.  And while Yang says he was only one of two candidates to surpass 10%, if you look across all of the polls, eight candidates actually achieved that — Yang, Biden, Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, Michael Bennet and Steve Bullock. The full breakdown of the polls is attached at the bottom of this fact-check. Ignoring all of the above (even though you shouldn’t), polling experts say the figure Yang cites is meaningless, because of the small sample of participants surveyed. In most of the Economist/YouGov polls, roughly 30-40 people said they voted for Trump in 2016 but would be voting in a Democratic primary or caucus in 2020. Ten percent of that (which is near Yang’s high water mark) would represent three to four people. Steve Smith, a Washington University political scientist who runs his own online panel survey, said that corresponds to a standard margin of error of about plus or minus 15 percentage points. That renders the question useless to anyone who cares about statistics, polling or math. When we checked with Joe Williams, the YouGov director of polling, he said he agreed with our overall analysis of Yang’s assertion.  When we contacted the Yang campaign, they said they stood by their talking point. Yang said, ""I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general"" election. This claim comes from one poll in July that sampled 41 Trump voters who said they planned to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. The question has been asked by the same pollster weekly since July, and those results have never been replicated. Even if they had, the margin of error for a sample size that small is about 15 percentage points, rendering them essentially meaningless. The math isn’t hard on this one. We rate Yang’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB8540>],/factchecks/2019/oct/24/andrew-yang/andrew-yangs-claim-support-among-trump-voters-rate/

No, food companies are not selling products that contain ‘aborted fetus cells’
","A post shared on Facebook makes a disturbing claim that many popular food and drink companies use ""aborted baby fetus cells"" to enhance the flavor of their products.  The post features text around a collage of popular food and drink items such as Pepsi, Doritos, Lays, Fritos, Aunt Jemima and Gatorade. It says: ""If only sheeple knew .. that there’s a flavor enhancement company called senomyx that puts aborted baby fetus cells in their food and drinks."" The post also has a lengthy caption that appears to be taken entirely from a 2015 blog post by Rich Swier, in which Swier includes this excerpt from a Conservative Post story:  ""Kraft, PepsiCo, Nestle, work with Semonyx, a California-based [company] that uses aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals. The aborted human fetal cell line is known as ‘HEK-293,’ and it is used to see how the human palate will react to synthetic flavors. Since most of today’s processed food lacks flavor, companies like Semonyx are hired to develop flavors on their own..."" Swier, according to the blog, holds a doctorate of education from the University of Southern California. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s just start off by saying that no —neither Kraft nor Pepsi nor any other U.S. food company is selling items to the public that contain ""aborted baby fetus cells."" The Conservative Post story that Swier’s blog and the Facebook post reference no longer exists on the website, but we traced the controversial claim back to a 2011 dispute involving Senomyx, a San Diego-based biotechnology company, and a pro-life group called Children of God for Life.  According to an archived version of a March 29, 2011, press release from Children of God for Life, the group called for a boycott of food companies that contract with Senomyx. The organization pointed to an April 2002 report by Senomyx researchers as proof that the company was adding HEK 293 — Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells — in its research and development to enhance flavor. HEK 293 is a line of cells originally derived from human embryo kidney cells and that were grown in a tissue culture. The first source of the cells was a fetus that was legally aborted in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The cell line has been widely used in biological and medical inquiry, especially for cancer research. Fetal stem cell research has been used in cell biology for over 30 years. But no company is manufacturing food or other products intended for human consumption that contain aborted human fetuses.  Senomyx has used the HEK 293 cell line in its flavor research to function as the mouth’s taste receptor cells, allowing the company to test hundreds of substances. But these cells are not in any of the actual food products that consumers would find on the market. CBS News wrote about this in 2011:  ""To non-scientists this may sound a bit strange, but the reality is that HEK 293 cells are widely used in pharmaceutical research, helping scientists create vaccines as well as drugs like those for rheumatoid arthritis. The difference here is that Senomyx's work for Pepsi is one of the first times the cells have (potentially) been used to create a food or beverage. (And it's important to note that no part of a human kidney cell are ever a part of Senomyx's taste enhancers or any finished food products.)"" Gwen Rosenberg, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications for Senomyx, described the process to the Miami New Times during the 2011 controversy and said the process is ""basically a robotic tasting system"": ""(Rosenberg) depicted rows of little plastic square dishes with hundreds of tiny indentations in each dish. A protein is placed in each indentation, then a flavor. If the protein reacts to the flavor, the results are charted. If the new flavor (of which the company has more than 800,000) is successful with the protein test, the company then conducts taste tests with (live) adult humans."" Science and medicine writer Matthew Herper also broke down the process in a 2012 Forbes article: ""This is 35-year-old technology. And it is widely used in cell biology. And there is no way you'll consume them or that the cells would cause any health problems. ""... The kidney cells were forced to take up bits of DNA using a technique invented in 1973 that used a calcium solution. The resulting cells don't act much like human cells at all, but they are very easy to work with and have become workhorses of cellular biology. That's why they're used in the development of drugs and vaccines. (Here's the original paper on the creation of the HEK cells.) No new fetal tissue has been used to keep the cell culture going; the use of this cell line isn't leading to new abortion."" A Facebook post claims several popular food companies add ""aborted baby fetus cells in their food and drinks"" for flavor enhancement. The post mischaracterizes the use fetal stem cell research by biotechnology companies such as Senomyx. HEK 293 cells, a cell line from an aborted fetus from the 1970s, has been widely used in cell biology research for over 30 years in multiple areas, including food and pharmaceutical development. But none of these cells are found in the food products available to consumers.

"['Education', 'Wisconsin', 'Jeremy Thiesfeldt']","
No, the “vast majority” of Wisconsin students are not below grade level
","Are the vast majority of Wisconsin students failing to achieve at grade level? That was the claim made in a recent radio address by state Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt. The Fond du Lac Republican — a former teacher and principal — chairs the state Assembly Committee on Education. That makes him a key player in any school-related changes the Republican-controlled Legislature brings before Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. In the Republicans’ statewide weekly radio address on Sept. 19, 2019, Thiesfeldt said Wisconsin has to ""do better"" on education, especially given the amount of money the state spent there in the eight years of Republican control under former Gov. Scott Walker. Then he said this: ""The vast majority of Wisconsin students cannot even read, write, or do math at grade level."" That’s an alarming stat if true. Assessing his claim takes us deep into state and national testing thresholds and some shifting definitions. Let’s get started. As proof, Thiesfeldt’s staff pointed to the most recent Wisconsin Student Assessment System results. The annual tests include the Forward Exam for grades three to eight and ACT-related tests for grades nine to 11. In the 2018-19 tests, 39.3% of students were rated as proficient or advanced in English Language Arts, and 40.1% reached those levels for math, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. For starters, calling 60% the ""vast majority"" is overstating things quite a bit.  But let’s focus on the ""grade level"" part of Thiesfeldt’s claim. Is it reasonable to say anyone below proficient is also below grade level? That’s a very complicated question. DPI breaks the assessment scores into four categories of student achievement: advanced, proficient, basic and below basic. We’ll focus on the middle two since that’s where this claim is centered. Proficient – Student demonstrates adequate understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness. Basic – Student demonstrates partial understanding of and ability to apply the knowledge and skills for their grade level that are associated with college content-readiness. Katie Scott, a policy adviser in Thiesfeldt’s office, highlighted the ""adequate understanding"" element of the proficient definition. ""For an exam taken in the final months of the school year, we are confident that parents, teachers, etc. would not prefer the achievement of students at grade level to be described as a ‘partial understanding,’"" she said in an email. Scott also asserted that proficient ""has always meant at or above grade level."" So Thiesfeldt’s argument is that proficiency = grade level. But both sides of that equation are moving targets. The term grade level is used at times to refer to how students perform relative to a standard set by officials, which is how Thiesfeldt uses it. But it can also refer to what students typically learn in a grade, in other words the median test score for that age level across the state. We’ll stick to the idea that grade level is some kind of threshold. But it’s tricky equating it to proficiency since the definition of proficient has changed over time in Wisconsin. In the past, the term was indeed roughly equivalent to what many consider grade level, said Alan Borsuk, a senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School and longtime education reporter and columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But that changed in 2013 when Wisconsin dramatically raised the achievement level needed to reach the ""proficient"" threshold. The state was aligning its standards to match the National Assessment of Educational Progress — also called the Nation’s Report Card. In other words, proficient no longer means what it once did in Wisconsin. Can it still be equated to grade level as Thiesfeldt does? ""The answer is quite emphatically no,"" Borsuk said. He elaborated in his Sept. 13, 2019, Journal Sentinel column. ""I’m increasingly willing to lump ‘basic’ with ‘proficient’ and ‘advanced’ to get a rough measure of whether kids are on grade level,"" Borsuk wrote. ""And if you do that, you come up with — to give one example — about three-quarters for Wisconsin public school students in third through eighth grade rated as basic or better in English language arts (often just called reading), which certainly looks better than saying well below half are proficient."" Tom Loveless, a former senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who authored the group’s annual report on education trends for 16 years, said he agreed with Borsuk that a basic rating on the state’s assessment system tests is roughly equal to what the proficient rating was years ago. But there’s still more evidence to consider. A Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction spokesman didn’t take a position on proficient vs. grade level beyond the definitions cited above. But the go-to source for national testing sheds some light on the matter. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a congressionally authorized project of the U.S. Department of Education that measures student achievement in select subjects across the nation. Remember, Wisconsin made changes to its scale get in sync with NAEP. An August 2019 study by the NAEP found the state was quite successful in doing so. The analysis scored each state from 0 to 500 in two subjects at two grade levels to show how high the bar was to achieve proficiency. That could then be compared to other states and the national scale used by NAEP. For grade four math, the state and national standards were exactly the same at 249.  For grade four reading, the score for NAEP proficiency was 238, while Wisconsin’s was 229. The eighth-grade scores were also very close, with the state and national threshold separated by two points for reading and four points for math. And here’s what the NAEP has to say about conflating proficiency with grade level: Myth: The NAEP Proficient level is like being on grade level. Fact: NAEP Proficient means competency over challenging subject matter. This is not the same as being ""on grade level,"" which refers to performance on local curriculum and standards. NAEP is a general assessment of knowledge and skills in a particular subject. ""NAEP proficient means mastery over challenging subject matter,"" said NAEP spokesman Grady Wilburn. ""We don’t use any terms in NAEP to equate achievement level to what may be grade level in a state. … The achievement level proficient, for example, is aspirational. We don’t define that as something necessary to proceed from one grade to the next."" So the Wisconsin proficiency standard is largely in line with the national standard, and the people behind the national standard warn it should not be conflated with ""grade level.""  Therefore, Wisconsin should be similarly careful, Loveless said. ""Wisconsin set its cut point at the NAEP proficiency level on purpose,"" he said. ""So it should carry with it all the warnings that go with the NAEP proficient cut point."" For the record, Wisconsin students ranked about average in the latest NAEP data. In 2017, 40% of students nationwide tested at or above the proficient level using the NAEP standard. Wisconsin came in at 42%. The NAEP study also showed Wisconsin has one of the highest bars for proficiency in the nation. The grade eight ratings were third- and fourth-highest among the states in the study, and grade four ratings came in 10th and 18th. Thiesfeldt used state test results to claim the ""vast majority"" of Wisconsin students are below grade level in math and English. Experts say proficient was once roughly equal to some definitions of grade level, but a dramatic shift in 2013 means that is no longer the case. Wisconsin raised the bar and — predictably — more kids then failed to clear it. Today, Wisconsin’s definition of proficient is almost identical to that of a key federal testing agency that explicitly warns against conflating proficiency with grade level. They say proficiency is more akin to ""mastery"" of a subject. We rate Thiesfeldt’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097229C00>],/factchecks/2019/oct/23/jeremy-thiesfeldt/no-vast-majority-wisconsin-students-are-not-below-/

Vermont's AG misses mark with claim that 'most' records requests come from private firms
","Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan began enforcing a new public records rule this month that sparked criticism from transparency advocates and politicians on both sides of the aisle.  The rule prevents members of the public from photographing records they are examining unless they pay a fee to reimburse staff for the cost of preparing the documents.  Gov. Phil Scott and Secretary of State Jim Condos have said that there is no legal basis for the government to charge members of the public to take photos of records. The attorney general says he interprets the law differently. Defending his new policy, Donovan has argued that taxpayers should be reimbursed for the time it takes his staff to locate, scrutinize and redact records before inspection—particularly when the majority of requests don't come from members of the public, or the press, but private entities.  ""Most of the requests for records possessed by the Attorney General’s Office are from private law firms and companies,"" Donovan wrote in an op-ed published by VTDigger last week.  ""There is a cost to Vermonters associated with diverting attorney time and resources from my office’s mission,"" he added. ""More to the point, should we provide free legal work to law firms and companies that may take an adverse position to the policies of our state?""  VTDigger has already asked Donovan’s office to reverse its policy on photographing records. But his justification for it raised even more questions. Do ""most"" requests to his office really come from companies and law firms?  On Thursday, a day before Donovan's op-ed was published, his office reported that 49% of the public records requests the attorney general's office received this year have come from companies. As of Monday, the office said that number had dropped slightly, to about 45%.  Out of the 126 requests submitted to the attorney general this year, 32 came from members of the press, and 37 came from citizens acting independently, according to a review of the requests submitted to the office which are publicly available online.  The remaining 57 requests—45.2%— came from companies, law firms and non-profits, which the attorney general's office lumps into one category, ""firms,"" when it tracks incoming records requests, according to Charity Clark, Donovan's chief of staff.  Within this category, it’s true that law offices and private companies filed most of the requests. But nine of the requests in this category came from non-profits, interest groups and, in one case, a law school.  Four of the requests came from Energy Policy Advocates, a conservative-leaning non-profit dedicated to bringing ""transparency to the realm of energy and environmental policy.""  Also among the requesters categorized as ""firms"" were the National Consumer Law Center, a non-profit that focuses on legal and policy work for low income citizens; the Public Rights Project, an organization that advances civil rights and economic justice policies; and Judicial Watch, another right-leaning non-profit focused on government transparency. A request from Vermont Legal Aid and another from a student at the University of Chicago School of Law were also included in the ""firms"" category.  Clark said that the attorney general's office has been tracking public records requests like this for years, starting before Donovan took office.  ""Something that's not a citizen and not a member of the press is going to be in this other group,"" she said.  However, Donovan referred to this entire class of requesters as ""private law firms and companies,"" a description that should not encompass universities, non-profit public interest groups and legal support clinics. If the ""firms"" category excluded non-profits, there would be nine fewer requests: meaning the total number of from private law firms and companies would only be to 38% of all requests.  Donovan is correct to say that private law firms and companies frequently ask his office for records—dozens have placed requests this year.  Technically, their requests don't make up the majority of those the state has received in 2019, although requests from ""firms"" (as defined by the AG’s office) came only one percentage point short of 50% when Donovan made his statement last week.  But because of the attorney general's methodology for tracking records, non-profit interest groups, a well-respected university, and a legal aid clinic are also included in his tally of  ""private law firms and companies"" seeking documents.  The way Donovan’s office classifies record requesters and his public statements regarding those entities don’t square up.  We rate this claim mostly false.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3E6240>],/factchecks/2019/oct/22/tj-donovan/vermonts-ag-misses-mark-claim-most-records-request/

","A recent Facebook post criticizes President Donald Trump for ""a uniquely American take on dictatorship.""  ""Wow,"" begins the Oct. 20 post, a screenshot of this Oct. 18 tweet. ""Trump is suing CNN over ‘pro-impeachment bias’ and he demands a ‘substantial payment.’ So basically the news can’t report the news because if it does, the president of America will sue.""  This post, which has been shared more than 8,900 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because Trump hasn’t sued CNN — but he’s threatened to.  In an Oct. 16 letter, lawyers for Trump and his re-election campaign threatened ""to sue CNN for what they said was the network falsely advertising itself as a news organization,"" Reuters reported. The letter calls on executives to ""discuss an appropriate resolution of this matter"" that would include a ""substantial payment"" to cover damages. ""Never in the history of this country has a president been the subject of such a sustained barrage of unfair, unfounded, unethical and unlawful attacks by so-called ‘mainstream’ news, as the current situation,"" the letter says. ""My clients intend to file legal action against you to seek compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, reimbursement of legal costs, and all other available legal and equitable remedies, to the maximum extent permitted by law."" The letter doesn’t mention ""pro-impeachment bias"" though the Washington Examiner among others described the president’s charges against CNN that way.  The letter to CNN was signed by attorney Charles Harder, who represented Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that took down Gawker and who has sent similar threats to other media for Trump. Last year, Harder suggested the president would sue the New York Times for what he called a ""highly defamatory"" story. He threatened to sue author Michael Wolff for libel over Wolff’s book, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House."" So far, though, no lawsuits have been filed. And Rebecca Tushnet, a professor of false advertising law at Harvard Law School, told Reuters that Trump’s latest salvo has ""no merit"" and that she doubted a lawsuit would ever be filed.

McGurk right that Trump has sent 14,000 troops to Middle East since May
","President Donald Trump has insisted that his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border with Turkey is a step toward getting the United States out of ""endless"" wars.  But one critic of the move says Trump is breaking his own promise by sending troops back into other parts of the Middle East. The Pentagon has said it will shift about 1,000 American troops from Syria to western Iraq. Brett McGurk, Trump’s former special envoy for the coalition to counter the Islamic State, said leaving Syria opens the door for Russian and Iranian aggression in the Middle East. ""That is one reason we're seeing so much increased tension in the region and that President Trump has sent 14,000 American troops to the region since May,"" McGurk told MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press"" Oct. 20. ""So he can't tell his political rallies that he's getting troops out of endless wars when he's sending 14 times the amount back into the region."" We wanted to check if McGurk, who also served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was right that Trump has shipped 14,000 troops to the Middle East since May. Spoiler: McGurk’s claim is spot-on. McGurk said he got his numbers from the Pentagon, which touted its troop commitments in an Oct. 11 press release announcing the deployment of about 3,000 U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia.  The press release said the Pentagon had ""increased the number of forces by approximately 14,000 to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility"" since May. Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeated the same figures while briefing reporters that same day. The Pentagon told us the term ""area of responsibility"" refers to ""the entire Middle East,"" while Will Todman, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it also includes Afghanistan and other parts of central Asia. (Definitions of the Middle East vary.) But Todman said the recent reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan likely means more have been deployed to the Middle East anyway.  So yes, Trump has sent 14 times as many soldiers to the Middle East as the approximately 1,000 troops that he pledged to remove when he announced his decision to pull out of Syria. ""Trump is using the rhetoric of ending endless war, but in reality he is waging more war,"" said Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank. ""In the Middle East, he is simply moving troops from one region to another. But relocation is not departure."" On Oct. 19, Esper said the soldiers in northeast Syria would be relocated to western Iraq where they would ""help defend Iraq"" and fight against ISIS.  More recently, Esper said the United States was considering leaving some troops behind to secure the region’s oil fields, according to the Associated Press. Troops began withdrawing to Iraq on Oct. 21, per the Wall Street Journal. Experts told us it’s difficult to determine how U.S. forces are distributed in the Middle East, in part because of changes former Defense Secretary James Mattis made to reduce transparency.  According to June data from the Pentagon — which omits numbers for countries with ongoing operations such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan — there were at that time 283 total U.S. forces in Egypt, 76 in Israel, 20 in Lebanon, 1,750 in Turkey, 84 in Jordan, 2,077 in Kuwait, 535 in Saudi Arabia, 19 in Yemen, 17 in Oman, 374 in the United Arab Emirates, 636 in Qatar, and 4,865 in Bahrain.  Those numbers include active duty personnel, national guard and reserve personnel and civilian personnel. According to the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a London think tank, they do not include temporary forces or classified special forces operating in secret.   The June numbers are also outdated. The Pentagon told us it would not identify the recently deployed personnel by country, but it said more than 6,500 of the 14,000 soldiers sent out since May are at sea as part of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group. Still, experts told us the largest numbers of U.S. forces currently stationed in or near the Middle East are likely in Bahrain, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Afghanistan. McGurk said, ""President Trump has sent 14,000 American troops to the (Middle East) region since May. So he can't tell his political rallies that he's getting troops out of endless wars when he's sending 14 times the amount back into the region."" His number matches what the Pentagon has publicly reported in press releases and briefings.

Online ads claiming AARP backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood are wrong
","In Facebook ads that launched in August featuring Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, and conservative radio talk show host Dennis Prager, older Americans are urged to forgo their AARP memberships for another organization: the Association of Mature American Citizens, otherwise known as AMAC.  The ads say they were sponsored and paid for by AMAC, and they challenge the idea that AARP is a ""nonpartisan organization."" ""But you need to understand WHAT you are supporting if you are an AARP member,"" they continue. ""AARP backed Obamacare, strict gun control, and federal funding for Planned Parenthood. AMAC fought AGAINST all of these things.""  We found a number of other posts on Facebook in which users claimed AARP ""supports abortion,"" a service many Planned Parenthood clinics provide.  We wondered if the AMAC ads were correct to say that AARP backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood.  In an email, AMAC political liaison Ellen Cora told us that as an American over the age of 65 — and an AARP member herself — she recalls AARP bulletins that spoke ""positively about Planned Parenthood,"" adding ""we often refer to ‘AARP Beyond the Veil’ for more information about AARP."" ""Behind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn’t Know,"" was a 2011 report prepared by U.S. Reps. Wally Herger, R.-Calif, and Dave Reichert, R.-Wash. It was released as a House subcommittee opened a hearing examining AARP’s tax-exempt status. CNN then reported that Republicans were targeting the group in the wake of the report that claimed to expose ""the conflict between AARP’s drive for profits, the best interests of its members and the organization’s tax-exempt status.""  Democrats argued the attacks stemmed from AARP’s support of then-President Barack Obama’s health care bill, according to CNN. But the report makes no mention of Planned Parenthood. When we followed up, Jeff Szymanski, another AMAC political liaison, said he recalled ""it was a radio personality that made the claim you cite, not AMAC."" The language in the ad featuring radio personality Dennis Prager is virtually identical to the ad featuring Sebastian Gorka. They both link to AMAC’s website and say they are sponsored and paid for by AMAC.   We asked Szymanski if AMAC didn’t write the ads but he didn’t reply. Instead, he directed PolitiFact to a page about AARP on the website 2ndVote.com, which calls itself the ""conservative watchdog for corporate activism."" Under a section labeled ""life,"" the page says: ""AARP is a corporate supporter of the National Women’s Law Center, which is a pro-abortion organization."" It links to the National Women’s Law Center’s 2013-14 report, which lists AARP among the organizations that contributed $25,000-$49,999 to the center in the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2014. 2ndVote.com also links to a fact sheet the center produced about marriage equality. It doesn’t mention abortion, though.  The National Women’s Law Center advocates for gender justice, according to its website, ""working across the issues that are central to the lives of women and girls."" Its issues include child care, racial justice, and health care and reproductive rights. Abortion, according to the center, ""is a key part of women’s liberty, equality, and economic security.""      In 2013, the center produced a fact-sheet called ""The Hyde Amendment Hurts Women."" The amendment says the federal government can’t pay for abortions except when the mother’s life is in danger or if she became pregnant as a result of rape or incest, and the center calls it a ""hurtful ban"" that harms low-income women.  We emailed AARP to ask about AMAC’s claim and supporting evidence. Spokesman Jason Young confirmed that AARP made a donation to the center and pointed us to an IRS filing that says AARP donated $25,000 that year ""to support the protect and improve Social Security for women project."" Social Security is another of the law center’s issues. On its website, it says it works with lawmakers to develop proposals to strengthen Social Security and increase benefits to improve women’s retirement security. In 2013, Young said, AARP, the law center and and other groups opposed ""chained CPI,"" which the Washington Post describes in this explainer as ""a way to index spending and taxes — including Social Security benefits — to the rate of inflation, or the rise in prices over time."" Social Security benefits would have increased at a slower rate using this index and AARP, among others, considered it an unjustifiable cut to Social Security benefits. AARP ""does not have a position on abortion,"" Young said. ""AARP does not fund and has not funded Planned Parenthood. AARP has not supported or lobbied for federal funding for Planned Parenthood.""  He also noted that JPMorgan Chase, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citi among others contributed to the National Women’s Law Center the same year AARP did.  Planned Parenthood Federation of America was another of the center’s supporters that year, kicking in $5,000-$9,999. The organization historically received federal funding through Medicaid reimbursements for preventive care and Title X, a Health and Human Services grant program that funds comprehensive family planning services. However, Planned Parenthood and others are banned from using federal funds for abortion services except in instances of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is in danger. And, recently, because of a Trump administration rule that would deny Title X funds to any health clinics that refer women for abortions, Planned Parenthood has opted — for now — not to participate in the program.   The Affordable Care Act, the comprehensive health care law known as Obamacare, did not designate any funds to Planned Parenthood in particular, said Benjamin Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Rather, he told us, it expanded health insurance to 20 million people, and some of those people may have gotten care at Planned Parenthood.  ""But it seems a stretch to argue that AARP support for the ACA was directly advocating funds to Planned Parenthood any more than it was advocating sending funds to any qualifying health care provider nationally — of which there are thousands,"" he said. ""I think the more reasonable interpretation is that AARP was supporting expanded health insurance, not advocating for any particular health care provider."" Gretchen Ely, a professor at the University of Buffalo’s School of Social Work, echoed that sentiment.  ""It seems especially far-fetched in this particular example, given AARP’s focus on folks who are aging into retirement,"" she said. In November 2009, when AARP endorsed the Affordable Health Care for America Act — the House’s version of the health care reform legislation — Barry Rand, then AARP’s CEO, said in a statement, that the bill contained ""critical components AARP has been fighting for on behalf of its members and all older Americans to improve health care for them and their families.""  He cited examples, including ""protecting and strengthening Medicare for today’s seniors and future generations of retirees"" and ""lowering drug costs for seniors."" He doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood, family planning or abortion. More recently, in 2017, AARP opposed the American Health Care Act, the GOP health care bill that would have repealed a large swath of Obamacare. Among its provisions, the measure also effectively blocked Planned Parenthood from securing reimbursements from Medicaid for a year. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska., and Susan Collins, R-Maine — who alongside Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joined Democrats to kill the bill in the Senate — had cited Planned Parenthood funding as one of the conditions of their support for the bill. AARP published a post on its website in June 2017 titled, ""5 ways the Senate health care bill would hurt you."" But it focused on ""skyrocketing insurance premiums,"" coverage and Medicare services, not Planned Parenthood funding.   To claim they opposed the bill because of Planned Parenthood is a ""fully misleading assertion,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor at George Washington University. What’s more, Rosenbaum told us, while AARP has advocated for health benefits and women’s preventive health services, she’s unaware of any specific lobbying or advocacy AARP has done for Planned Parenthood.  ""It would be so totally unlike them to advocate for another organization,"" she said, ""it doesn’t make any sense."" Our ruling AMAC claims that AARP has backed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. It’s tenuous to say an organization wants to use taxpayer dollars for Planned Parenthood because it once donated to a law center that supports abortion access in addition to seeking fair pay equity, family tax credits, affirmative action and fighting cuts to Social Security. AARP does not have a published position on abortion, or federal funding for abortion. Its health care advocacy centers on issues relevant to older Americans, like Social Security benefits, prescription drug pricing and elder abuse in nursing facilities.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978901C0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/22/association-mature-american-citizens/online-ads-claiming-aarp-backed-federal-funding-pl/

25,000 uses for hemp, including a replacement for concrete and plastic? Not so fast
","Hemp has been used inside a BMW electric car, as fiber in jeans and in the walls of a Tarpon Springs, home. Now Florida’s lone statewide elected Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, will oversee a new state industrial hemp program. Fried, a former lobbyist for the marijuana industry, says that hemp has a massive number of uses and will replace some common materials. ""What most people don’t understand is that hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages,"" she said at a Florida Democratic Party conference in Orlando. ""That means it is going to be something that is going to replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete.""  That’s a giant heap of hemp. But is Fried’s claim accurate? While hemp and marijuana are from the same species of plant, hemp is nonpsychoactive and is used for a variety of products. Industry-friendly legislation has helped to grow the hemp market in recent years. But don’t expect it to replace plastics or concrete anytime soon. Vast research and development — and money — is needed before widespread utilization. ""Industrial hemp products offer an alternative to materials like plastic and concrete in certain applications, but will never be able to fully replace them due to differences in the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials,"" said Tai Olson, who works for US Heritage Group, which works with suppliers for hempcrete projects.  Fried’s claim about the number of uses for hemp comes from a magazine story published 80 years ago. In 1938, Popular Mechanics magazine declared hemp the new ""billion dollar crop.""  ""Hemp is the standard fiber of the world. It has great tensile strength and durability. It is used to produce more than 5,000 textile products, ranging from rope to fine laces, and the wood ‘hurdes’ remaining after the fiber has been removed contains more than 77% cellulose, and can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to cellophane."" The magazine story, however, did not account for government regulation that stymied hemp development. In 1937, Congress passed a law, which required hemp farmers to register and pay a tax. But the 25,000-uses statistic lived on, even earning a mention in a 2018 Congressional Research Service report.  Fried’s spokesman noted that report as well as other citations by news outlets including the Tampa Bay Times, Florida government and academic works. (PolitiFact Missouri also cited the figure, we found.)  We sent Fried’s citations to four academic experts on hemp, and none was swayed. ""Just because a number is repeated over and over does not make it true,"" agriculture scientist Jennifer Gilbert Jenkins told us. Gilbert Jenkins is a professor at the State University of New York at Morrisville. Hemp has multiple uses within agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverages, paper, construction materials, and personal care.  A few experts in hemp told us the math behind 25,000 uses (and especially 35,000) is empty.  ""Of course it’s misleading, since defining what a ‘use’ is is arbitrary, and most uses would be economically insignificant,"" said Ernest Small, a research scientist in Canada. ""But the same could be said about numerous things, so it’s not exactly untruthful. With some imagination, I think you could find 25,000 uses for a car, or for many common things."" Back to the source, Popular Mechanics. Jared W. Nelson, a mechanical engineer at SUNY New Paltz, told us he thinks the reported number of uses does not specifically refer to hemp, but instead refers to cellulose. Dynamite and cellophane are derived from cellulose. While hemp could provide sugars through the enzymatic breakdown of cellulose, it’s a lot easier and cheaper to get those sugars from corn starch or sugar cane, said Cornell professor Lawrence B. Smart. ""The 25,000 products is a great number, but please put it in context,"" Smart said. ""Since we get most of our paper products from eucalyptus and lumber products from pine, how many products can you make from eucalyptus and pine?""  What matters most, said Gilbert Jenkins, is ""for the first time in a generation we are able to innovate around this versatile crop."" The 2018 farm bill legalized industrial use of hemp and removed it from the federal list of controlled substances, opening up the market to new products. According to Vote Hemp,  the number of acres of grown hemp tripled between 2017 and 2018, and hemp-based product sales have also climbed. Fried’s spokesman Franco Ripple pointed to examples of hemp being used in hempcrete to build homes, composites to build products like cars, and hemp-based packaging and plastic alternatives. Hemp-based products should increasingly replace specific uses of Styrofoam, plastic, and concrete, he added. ""Her forward-looking statements on the future of hemp and potential uses are intended to inspire the industry’s development,"" he said, citing predictions about the future growth of hemp.  But there are challenges to using hemp in the United States. For example, Gilbert Jenkins is partnering with the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York to make hemp jeans.   ""We are in the process of sending a bale of hemp fiber to Poland to be processed into yarn because that capability does not exist in the United States currently,"" she said. ""Our textile industry is set up to work with cotton short fibers, not long hemp fibers."" As for Ripple’s examples, they don’t represent the majority of current hemp use. About 80 percent of hemp grown in the United States is for hemp extracts including cannabidiol, or CBD, said Eric Steenstra, Vote Hemp’s president.  Experts also told us that hempcrete is intended to replace other components within a wall, such as sheetrock, and not the concrete itself. Also, hemp won’t replace plastics. Hemp fibers can be used to strengthen plastics and other composite materials. Hemp oil can replace the petroleum oil raw material for the plastic, which ""is still plastic with all of its downsides,"" said Gilbert Jenkins. Hemp has scarcely penetrated the building and plastic replacement markets, Small said. ""The future seems limited, albeit not impossible."" Fried said, ""Hemp has 25,000-35,000 known usages. That means it is going to be something that is going to replace plastics, and styrofoam and concrete.""  The number comes from a Popular Mechanics article in 1938 about the number of potential products that creates an overly optimistic picture of the number of uses. Just because a use exists does not mean that it is commonly available. Most hemp grown now is for CBD. Fried said that hemp products will ""replace"" such common materials as plastics and concrete, but we found no evidence that hemp has the physical properties to truly replace these materials. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DFBB40>],/factchecks/2019/oct/22/nikki-fried/will-hemp-replace-plastics-and-concrete-florida-de/

Cox ad distorts Bynum-Coleman statement on police in schools
","House Speaker Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, has been running a TV ad accusing his opponent, Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman, of wanting to remove police from public schools. The ad starts with a narrator saying ""Sheila Bynum-Coleman said…"" and cuts to a tape of the candidate saying, ""We need to get the police out of the schools. Get the police out of the schools."" Then the ad shows four ""real moms, not actors,"" sitting at a kitchen table, holding coffee mugs and disagreeing with Bynum-Coleman. ""That’s scary,"" the first woman says. ""I don’t want my kids in an environment where they’re not going to be safe."" The second woman says police are ""heroes."" The third says the officers are at schools  ""as an added layer of protection."" The fourth says, ""I just want my daughter to be safe."" The ad returns to the first woman, who says, ""As a mom, I wouldn’t vote for Sheila Bynum-Coleman. I just wouldn’t."" During much of commercial, there’s type on the screen saying, ""We need to get the police out of the schools - Sheila Bynum-Coleman."" Bynum-Coleman says Cox has distorted comments she made two years ago. So we fact-checked Cox’s ad claim. The commercial cites as its source an Oct. 9, 2017 podcast interview of Bynum-Coleman by Marcello Rollando, a performing arts director and liberal activist. Bynum-Coleman was asked for her thoughts on the ""school to prison pipeline,"" the trend of a disproportionate number of black students being expelled from schools or arrested. In a lengthy reply, Bynum-Coleman said many schools were relegating  routine student discipline to on-site police and security guards. She did say ""we need to get the police out of the schools,"" as Cox claims in his ad. But the commercial omits Bynum Coleman saying in her next breath the officers are needed to provide safety.  Here are her expanded remarks: ""But now we have police in the school who are policing our children, you know we don’t want children to get into fights, we don’t want them walking into class late, we don’t want them being disruptive in the classrooms, but do we want to send them to prison? ""I think there’s an alternative here and I think we need to get the police out of the schools. The police need to be there for safety measures and to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions, and that’s what’s taking place."" A few minutes later, Bynum-Coleman said, ""I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safer and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school."" Rob Silverstein, Bynum-Coleman’s campaign manager, sent us an email calling Cox's ad ""incredibly misleading and deceptive, and it presents a clearly false impression of what she said."" Parker Slaybaugh, spokesman for Cox, stood by the ad. ""It's pretty hard to be a misrepresentation of Ms. Bynum-Coleman, when the ad uses a recording of her own words,"" he said. Our ruling Cox’s ad says ""Sheila Bynum-Coleman said, ‘We need to get the police out of schools.’"" Bynum-Coleman used those words in a lengthy answer she gave to a question about the ""prison-to-school pipeline,"" affecting many black students.  But in her next sentence, she explained that police ""need"" to be on hand ""to make sure the school is safe, not to incarcerate the children and deal with disciplinary actions and that’s what’s taking place."" And she elaborated a few minutes later, ""I think that the police should only be there to make sure the school is safe and secure. They should not have any dealings with disciplinary actions within the school."" Cox ignores this easily available context and, in an era of mass shootings, misleadingly creates the impression that Bynam-Coleman said she would leave schools unprotected.  We rate Cox’s claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809711FEC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/22/kirk-cox/cox-ad-distorts-bynum-coleman-statement-police-sch/

No, drinking tonic water isn’t a proven method to alleviate restless legs syndrome
","A Facebook post that’s been shared over 55,000 times claims that a little trick before bed each night may cure your restless legs syndrome.  The post reads:  ""Restless Legs Syndrome: Drink a 6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed until symptoms go away. Tonic water contains quinine, which stops repeated muscle contractions -Paul Lyons, MD."" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While medical experts say it’s probably not harmful to consume a small cup of tonic water each night, it’s not scientifically proven to help cure or alleviate restless legs syndrome, a condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move your legs, usually at night or while lying down. Prevention Magazine, a healthy lifestyle magazine published by the Hearst Corporation, is listed as the source of the post. We found a 2016 article from the magazine titled ""14 Natural Ways To Deal With Restless Legs Syndrome."" (We also came across a 2008 story by ABC News that mirrors the post’s wording.) About halfway through the Prevention Magazine article, the tonic water method is mentioned: ""... The FDA has banned the sale of quinine because it reportedly caused some serious side effects (though rare), but it's still available in one form, Qualaquin, for the treatment of malaria, and it's still available in very small amounts in tonic water. So even though studies show it doesn't work, and even though tonic water contains only a token amount of quinine—an 8-ounce glass of tonic water has about 20 mg, compared with the 200 to 300 mg dose you'd need to quiet leg cramps—some patients swear by it.""  It continues to cite a medical consultant from the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation who said that although it may not be supported by science, a home remedy that couldn’t hurt and could help is worth a try. But while the low amount of quinine found in tonic water is not considered harmful, the Food and Drug Administration has warned that the research for the use of quinine products for leg cramps or similar conditions is out-of-date, and that ""there has been significant concern regarding its unfavorable risk/benefit ratio.""  Most medical professionals also say people shouldn’t rely on the tonic water tactic. Dr. Mark Buchfuhrer, a restless legs syndrome expert and member of the RLS Foundation's scientific and medical advisory board, told PolitiFact that quinine has no benefit for treating the disorder. ""The typical dose of Quinine for leg cramps is more than 200-300 mg. A 6 ounce glass of tonic water contains less than 15 mg of quinine. One would have to drink close to a gallon of tonic water to get the therapeutic effect for leg cramps,"" Buchfuhrer wrote in an email. ""It is one of these ‘Urban Legends’ that may possibly be true for one leg condition then gets spread to other conditions that may affect the legs ...There are likely many patients who believe that both treatments are effective for RLS but they likely work through the strong placebo effect."" While clinical evidence shows that quinine helps leg cramps, Buchfuhrer said, few decent medical studies back that up. He recommended other treatments such as regular exercise, avoiding exacerbating drugs like antihistamines, antidepressants; increasing iron levels if they are low, and avoiding alcohol. Doctors Hope Ricciotti and Hye-Chun Hur also wrote for Harvard Medical School about the lack of science behind the tonic water method and list other ways people can alleviate RLS symptoms:  ""Drinking a few ounces of tonic water shouldn't be harmful, but it isn't likely to prevent your leg cramps.""  They instead recommend ""making sure to get enough fluids, avoiding caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, stretching during the day or before bed, and, when a cramp starts, standing on the affected leg, applying ice or heat and gently massaging the affected muscle."" A Facebook post claims that drinking a 6-ounce glass of tonic water each night before bed can help alleviate symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome. It’s not considered harmful to consume a glass of tonic water, but the home remedy is not scientifically proven to help with RLS. Medical experts usually don’t recommend the treatment and instead suggest the people take other action to relieve symptoms, including talking to their doctors.

These photos are of Palestinian and Syrian children, not 'Kurdish kids' after Turkey’s invasion
","President Donald Trump has drawn bipartisan condemnation after withdrawing American forces from the Turkish-Syrian border, a move that allowed Turkish forces to invade a Kurdish-held territory.  Turkey launched a ground and air assault on Oct. 9, according to the New York Times, causing terrified civilians to flee south in ""trucks piled high with possessions and children.""
