Napolitano: Lincoln tried to arm the slaves
","In the libertarian view, it is the right of the oppressed to rise up against their oppressors. Accordingly, while Andrew Napolitano argued with host Jon Stewart on The Daily Show that President Abraham Lincoln should have avoided war with the Confederacy, he said the slaves should have fought. Napolitano: ""If the slaves had gone to war against their slave owners, and I had been alive, I would have been with them. I would have helped finance, fund and lead that revolt."" Stewart: ""Are you familiar with slavery?"" Napolitano: ""I am very familiar with it."" Stewart: ""That is not the option."" Napolitano: ""No, no, no. Lincoln tried to arm the slaves."" We tried to find out what lies behind Napolitano’s claim that Lincoln tried to arm the slaves, but we never heard from the judge or his staff. We turned to Bruce Levine, a Civil War historian at the University of Illinois. ""I know of no evidence -- have never even heard it said -- that Lincoln himself tried to arm those who were still slaves to enable a slave insurrection -- and I very strongly doubt that any such evidence exists,"" Levine said. Levine said an early draft of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation included the idea that if the slaves rose up, Union troops would do nothing to stop them. But that disappeared from the final version. ""Because even that was considered too politically incendiary,"" Levine said. There is one way that the statement might be said to have some truth, though it's a stretch. As the war got underway, some people in slavery were able to get away and seek refuge with Union troops. This created a legal quandary for some commanders because under federal law, these people were still the property of their owners. Congress provided legal cover in two steps. In 1861, it passed the First Confiscation Act, which allowed Union soldiers to treat these people as property seized by the government. The act did not set them free but it did strip the owners of any claim to them if they had been put to work on ""any fort, navy yard, dock, armory, ship, entrenchment, or in any military or naval service whatsoever."" In 1862, Congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which went further. For slaveholders who sided with the Confederacy, any slave that came under Union control ""shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves."" This step actually troubled Lincoln who was uneasy about its constitutionality. The act went further and authorized Lincoln to ""employ as many persons of African descent as he may deem necessary and proper for the suppression of this rebellion, and for this purpose he may organize and use them in such manner as he may judge best for the public welfare."" Columbia historian Eric Foner, who appeared on the The Daily Show with Stewart and Napolitano, told PunditFact that Congress’ intent was clear. ""Congress authorized Lincoln to use blacks in any capacity he chose -- laborers, soldiers, etc.,"" Foner said. ""In the fall, the War Department authorized raising black troops on the Sea Islands of South Carolina, under the command of the white abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson."" Because this preceded the Emancipation Proclamation by several months, it could be argued that these newly liberated people were slaves armed by the Union, but that seems like a legal stretch and hardly what people hearing Napolitano’s comments would conclude. In one interesting twist, the Confederacy did try to arm slaves, Levine said. It took place late in the war and was extremely controversial. A month before the South surrendered, the Confederate Congress allowed slave owners to donate their slaves to the cause. In contrast to the Union laws, these people would not become free. The effort remained small and went nowhere. Our ruling Napolitano said that Lincoln tried to arm the slaves. Napolitano provided no supporting proof and no historian we contacted knew of any such effort by the president. The Union efforts to strip Confederate slave owners of their legal claims to enslaved people ultimately led to the formation of units of black soldiers. While these men might not have enjoyed clear legal status as free men, they could not be called slaves.

Napolitano: Lincoln enforced the Fugitive Slave Act
","Andrew Napolitano’s contrarian view of the Civil War is that it did not need to be fought. In their Daily Show debate, host Jon Stewart rejected that conclusion in the strongest terms. ""If there is ever any use of federal power that is justified, would it not be to end the most horrific, abhorrent practice in the history of mankind?"" Stewart asked. ""After it had tried everything else,"" Napolitano replied. ""Like abolishing the Fugitive Slave Act, which Lincoln enforced and his judges enforced and his federal marshals enforced until the Civil War was over and Lincoln was nearly dead."" We are fact-checking several claims from the Civil War debate between Napolitano, a libertarian pundit and former judge, and Stewart. Here we’re looking at Napolitano’s claim that Lincoln enforced something called the Fugitive Slave Act until the Civil War was over. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it easier for slave owners to use the federal government to get back the people who had escaped bondage. If a person found refuge in a free state, the act expanded the number of federal officials who could order their rendition back into slavery. The act also simplified the legal steps required by the owner to prove his claim and required the state to bear any costs involved. The law was part of a package of changes designed to ease tensions over slavery known as the Compromise of 1850. It’s clear that federal officials enforced the Fugitive Slave Act before the war, but Napolitano said it continued during the war and that enforcement took place under Lincoln himself. That specific claim is oversimplified. (Napolitano did not respond to our request for comment.) The picture is a bit complicated because federal policy changed over time as Congress and Lincoln navigated through the challenges of undermining the Confederacy, keeping peace within Union border states and ending slavery. By the time Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven states had seceded but war had not yet broken out. That came a month later. Lincoln’s first inaugural address offered the slave states, a group that included states still within the Union, full enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Lincoln said that so long as the law was on the books, he would follow it. In a further effort to stave off war, he said ""there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere."" It would be difficult to overstate the importance Lincoln placed on the rule of law. In many of his writings, he expresses a keen tension between his personal values and the laws of Congress and the Constitution. When the war started, two policies emerged, one for the South and one for the North. By August 1861, Congress had passed the First Confiscation Act, which authorized Union forces to seize any slaves used by Confederate forces. Military commanders in the field, however, had different policies. Even though the Secretary of War at the time ordered officers to provide protection to slaves, some refused them sanctuary. At about the same time, escaped slaves from Maryland (a border state) and unionists living in Virginia (a Southern state) were coming into the District of Columbia. Historian Edna Greene Medford wrote that Lincoln advised local authorities to allow Virginia owners to reclaim their slaves. The marshal for the district, Ward Lamon, a close friend and Lincoln appointee, supported the policy, arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act required it. University of Massachusetts historian Manisha Sinha, who appeared alongside Stewart and Napolitano on The Daily Show, told us that Lincoln balanced a desire to end slavery with his desire to win the war. ""In the first two years of the war he was willing to respect the rights of slaveholders in the border slave states simply to prevent them from seceding,"" Sinha said. In July 1862, Congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which was a broader statute and allowed Union forces to shelter escaped slaves from owners in any of the Confederate states. That still left slaves in Union states at legal risk if they got away from their owners. Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in the Confederate states in January 1863, but it wasn’t until passage of the 13th Amendment in January 1865 that the United States abolished slavery everywhere within its borders. In June 1864, Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act. The Civil War ended a year later, in spring 1865. Our ruling Napolitano said Lincoln, his marshals and his judges enforced the Fugitive Slave Act until the war was over. The record is much more complicated. Lincoln and other federal officials did enforce the law in some instances in the Union states in the early part of the war but not in every state and not consistently. The policy was quite different for the Confederate states. In that same period, Lincoln’s military and Congress moved to protect slaves who escaped from Confederate owners. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation mid-way through the war, freeing all slaves in Confederate states. Napolitano repeated the word ""enforced"" three times for emphasis. The record is much more mixed and certainly, Napolitano gets his dates wrong. Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act in 1864, a year before the war ended. The judge’s words have a sliver of accuracy but overall, we rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/18/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-lincoln-enforced-fugitive-slave-act/

Jon Stewart: Slave trade caused 5 million deaths
","Every war is filled with grim statistics, and Andrew Napolitano took a debate with Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart down that road when he brought up the Civil War’s casualties. President Abraham Lincoln, Napolitano argued, could have undone slavery ""without causing the deaths of 785,000 human beings."" ""How many deaths of human beings were caused by the American slave trade?"" Stewart shot back. ""Unfortunately, a million and a half,"" Napolitano said. ""Try 5 million or more,"" Stewart said. We are fact-checking several claims from the Civil War debate between Napolitano, a libertarian pundit and former judge, and Stewart. Here we are looking at if the American slave trade, the process by which people were acquired and sold into slavery, resulted in the death of 5 million people or more. (Statistics focus on the slave trade, because experts say it's impossible to know the overall death toll caused by slavery in America.) We asked Comedy Central for Stewart’s source and did not hear back. But it seems likely Stewart got his information from another Daily Show guest. Historian Manisha Sinha from the University of Massachusetts was part of a panel in a mock game show called The Weakest Lincoln. Asked during the game to estimate the number of deaths, Sinha said 2 million to 5 million might have perished. So that would put Stewart on the high end of one estimate. But Stewart made an error in his characterization. Sinha was talking about the Atlantic slave trade, which included slaves bound for South America, the Caribbean as well as North America, while Stewart focused on the American slave trade. So what's the American share? Starting in the late 1960s, historians began culling hard numbers on the slave trade from shipping manifests and other original documents. The result is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Database. It has tabulated an estimated 80 percent of the traffic in human beings and found about 10.7 million people survived the passage from their homeland between 1500 and 1866. Of that, about 390,000 made it to North American soil. This was about 3 percent of the total. Historian Herbert Klein of Columbia and Stanford universities, who worked on the database, said that the data suggest about 85,000 people destined for North America did not survive the trip across the Atlantic -- far below 5 million. (The same data show deaths caused by the slave trade in all of North and South America at about 1.8 million.) However, as exact as this information might be, it only goes so far. Much data is missing, either because it was lost or because no records were kept of the illegal shipments of slaves to North America that took place after 1808. That was the year when the United States banned the importation of slaves from Africa. Plus, as we noted, the database counts only the deaths due to the capture and transport of slaves and says nothing about the people who died in bondage from brutality, disease and deprivation. When the Civil War began, about 4 million people lived in slavery. According to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, half of all their babies died in the first year of life. That was twice the rate for white babies. Stanford Medical School cites the statistic that in 1850, the life expectancy of slaves was four years less than for whites. Our ruling Stewart said the American slave trade caused the deaths of at least 5 million people. Stewart appears to be using an estimate for deaths associated with the slave trade in North and South America. America's portion is much smaller, an expert told us.

John Boehner says more people are uninsured since Obamacare took effect
","For a law that will be judged, in part, by how many uninsured Americans gain coverage, it’s a pretty bold statement when the most powerful Republican in Washington claims the Affordable Care Act is leading to more people without coverage. In a press conference on March 13, 2014, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, claimed ""there are less people today with health insurance than there were before this law went into effect."" A reporter later asked him if he really meant that. Boehner doubled down. ""I believe that to be the case,"" Boehner said. ""When you look at the 6 million Americans who've lost their policies, and (government officials) claim 4.2 million who've signed up — I don't know how many have actually paid for it — that would indicate to me a net loss of people with health insurance. And I actually do believe that to be the case."" There are a lot of holes in the administration’s data for new signups. Further clouding the stats are fluctuations in the existing insurance market caused when insurance companies canceled plans that didn’t meet Obamacare’s coverage standards. But to say that has resulted in a net loss is a stretch. The Washington Post Fact Checker beat us to the punch on this. He gave Boehner’s comment Four Pinocchios, his worst rating. We have looked at similar claims before. We mostly heard it late last year, when several million Americans received notices from their insurance provider that their current policies would no longer be offered. Since it came from Boehner, though, we decided it was worth looking into again. Polls and projections We took the issue first to Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. He offered this explanation: ""The speaker explained the statement at the presser: More people have had plans canceled than signed up, especially when considering how inflated the enrollment numbers appear to be."" But that's not what Boehner said. He twice claimed that the number of people with insurance overall is down since the health care law went into effect, a considerably more audacious statement. While there isn't a final tally that looks at those numbers yet, Boehner's assertion goes against a recent Gallup poll, which said the number of uninsured Americans declined from 17.1 percent at the end of last year to 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the lowest level since 2008. Also, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan policy scorekeeper, estimates over time that the percentage of insured Americans will rise as a result of the health care law. Boehner claimed the math, though, is simple. According to him, there were 6 million people told their policies were canceled because they didn't meet the health law's minimum benefits and coverage. And the administration announced that through February, 4.2 million had purchased insurance through the state and federal marketplaces. (A few days after Boehner spoke, the administration announced enrollment through the marketplace surpassed 5 million.) By that logic, 1.8 million people must have lost insurance. But Boehner misses a lot of important factors. We'll go through them one by one. What happened to canceled plans There were many Americans notified that their insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet Obamacare's standards of coverage, despite promises that wouldn't happen. Boehner puts this at 6 million. It's a hard figure to pin down exactly. Through an extensive reporting project, the Associated Press found at least 4.7 million Americans received notices about canceled policies; it could be higher. Some of those policies, about half, were restored when Obama administratively allowed canceled plans to continue for another year and later through 2016. Many others were moved to new plans, either through their insurance company or by purchasing a new policy on the marketplaces set up for Obamacare. The administration estimated that of the people with canceled plans, just 500,000 were left without coverage, and catastrophic coverage was extended to those individuals. That's not to say this wasn't a difficult ordeal for people who lost their plans, especially if they thought the law would allow them to keep their coverage. But most of them were able to find new plans, meaning Boehner's 6 million uninsured people basically vanishes. We could probably stop there, but let's dissect the rest of the numbers, since this is a debate that won't subside any time soon. Marketplace signups Boehner also casts doubt that the administration's figures for new insurance purchases is inflated, which they put at 4.2 million (now 5 million). He does have a point there. First, many of the people who lost coverage due to Obamacare were shifted to the marketplace to buy coverage. Just as those individuals shouldn't be included in Boehner's figure of people without insurance, they also don't count as a net gain, since they previously had insurance. It's ultimately difficult to tell how many people who bought insurance didn’t have coverage last year. A survey by McKinsey & Company found that 27 percent of the people who reported buying a new policy in February for 2014 were previously uninsured. It's equally difficult to know how many of the people who bought plans actually paid their premiums. The New York Times reported that 20 percent of people buying insurance on the exchanges never made their first payment. The McKinsey & Company survey reported similar results for the previously uninsured. So Boehner's skepticism toward that 4.2 million figure is not misguided. But even if it includes a lot of people who didn't pay their premiums or people who were previously insured, there were some previously uninsured people who found and paid for policies. That alone makes it a net gain. It also doesn't include the people who are buying insurance directly from insurance companies or through other Obamacare approved third-party sites. In Washington state, for example, 184,000 of the 300,000 projected new enrollees bought coverage outside the marketplace. Medicaid Boehner also completely ignores individuals who gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health care program. The administration says 4.4 million people were deemed eligible for Medicaid when signing up for coverage through the marketplace. That doesn't count all of the people who signed up through local state offices, not through an exchange. But it also includes those who were assessed as eligible but didn’t complete the sign up. There could be duplication in the process as well. But whatever the actual number is, it still points toward a net gain in insured Americans. Kids up to 26 One of the earliest provisions of the law to take affect allowed children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26. The administration has estimated 3.1 million young adults took advantage of this change. The Washington Post Fact Checker noted the number hasn't been updated for a number of years and questioned whether it was that high. Not all of those children were previously uninsured. And presumably some of those initial sign ups could have aged out of their parents insurance by now. It's possible many were included among the previously insured who transitioned to the marketplace. But like the Medicaid number, for the purpose of this check the actual number isn't as significant as knowing there are a lot of young adults that gained insurance through this provision. Our ruling Boehner said the Affordable Care Act so far has caused ""a net loss of people with health insurance."" Boehner's logic is based on reports that about 5 million had their insurance policies canceled while 4.2 million signed up for policies on the state and federal marketplaces. It's bad math for two reasons. First, most of the people who lost their insurance have seen those policies extended to them through an administrative fix, or they received new coverage through their previous insurer or they bought a new plan. Second, he ignores the millions of people who bought coverage off the exchange, those who gained coverage through Medicaid and the under-26 crowd able to remain on their parents' insurance. We don't yet know how many new Americans will ultimately gain coverage. But every indicator right now suggests it will be a net gain. We rate Boehner's statement False.",/factchecks/2014/mar/18/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-more-people-are-uninsured-obamac/

Jon Stewart: Lincoln tried to buy slaves to free them
","Buying slaves to set them free is a much better fit with libertarian thinking than the use of force. That’s why in his recent debate with The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart, libertarian pundit Andrew Napolitano argued that Lincoln ""could have bought the slaves."" ""Buying the slaves’ freedom is not as true as you might believe,"" Stewart rebutted. ""He offered them money for their slaves, in the border states -- those are the ones that hadn’t even seceded yet -- and they refused."" We’re checking several claims from the debate between Napolitano and Stewart. Here, we’re looking at Stewart’s claim that  Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves freedom in border states, but the states ""all rejected it."" We asked Columbia University historian Eric Foner. ""During the first two years of the war Lincoln repeatedly offered ‘compensated emancipation’ to the border slave states that remained in the Union and any Confederate states interested,"" Foner said. ""But they all rejected it. Lincoln was willing to pay but Southerners were not willing to give up their slaves, for money or for any other reason."" We enlisted the help of historians, and history buffs on reddit, and they pointed us to Lincoln’s request to Congress in 1862 for money to buy the freedom of slaves. Here’s how that proposal began: ""Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences public and private, produced by such change of system."" Republicans passed that over the objection of Democrats. Richard Striner, professor of history at Washington College, wrote that this resolution was Lincoln’s second attempt to pay slave owners to free their slaves. A year earlier, he had tried to get Delaware to pass a bill that would have cleared the way for Washington to spend $719,200 to free the state’s entire slave population, about 1,800 at that time. The bill failed in the Delaware Legislature. In one odd case, Lincoln personally offered to buy a slave from an owner in Kentucky. Kentucky was on the Union side but was unwilling to emancipate the slaves that lived there. In late 1862, when an escaped slave found refuge with a Union army regiment, and the Kentucky owner demanded his return, Lincoln wrote to the owner, ""I will pay you any sum not to exceed $500."" Unusual circumstances surrounded this move by the president. The owner was a former member of Congress and former Kentucky Supreme Court justice. Lincoln had issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation two months earlier and wanted to head off a dispute in Kentucky. As it turned out, the owner refused Lincoln’s offer. The slave was not returned. Our ruling Stewart said Lincoln tried to free slaves in the border states by buying them. The record bears this out. Lincoln tried in Delaware and won congressional approval to apply the principle to all states. But with no slave owners willing to come to the table, the effort failed. The result was the Emancipation Proclamation. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/18/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-lincoln-tried-buy-slaves-free-them/

Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia says he supported George Bush more than Barack Obama
","Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976, but this fall, he will be fighting for his political life. Rahall -- whose district supported Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by a 33-percentage point margin in the 2012 presidential race -- is deemed no better than a tossup for re-election this fall against Democratic-turned-Republican state Sen. Evan Jenkins. A Republican poll in March 2014 had Jenkins up by a whopping 14 points. Given that in 2012 West Virginia gave Obama his fifth-worst showing of any state in the nation, it’s understandable that Rahall has been seeking to put some distance between himself and the president. During a March 12, 2014, interview with The Hill newspaper, Rahall said he will support Obama ""when he’s good for West Virginia"" and will ""oppose him when he’s bad for West Virginia."" Asked if Obama had been good for his state overall, Rahall said, ""Probably not."" He continued, ""I probably have supported George Bush more than I have Barack Obama, Am I going to switch parties because of that? No. I’m a Democrat, born a Democrat, am a Democrat and will die a Democrat."" Was he correct about his support for the last two presidents? We took a look. (Rahall’s office did not respond to two inquiries for this article.) So what do Rahall’s vote patterns look like? We turned to Congressional Quarterly, which has tracked House members’ voting records since the 1950s in a number of ways, including how close they are to the president's stated policy stances.   Year President Rahall’s presidential support 2013 Obama 58 percent 2012 Obama 64 percent 2011 Obama 65 percent 2010 Obama 88 percent 2009 Obama 94 percent 2008 Bush 18 percent 2007 Bush 9 percent 2006 Bush 47 percent 2005 Bush 33 percent 2004 Bush 45 percent 2003 Bush 35 percent 2002 Bush 28 percent 2001 Bush 33 percent Average during Obama’s tenure 74  percent Average during Bush’s tenure 31 percent   So Rahall’s memory was decidedly faulty. His ""presidential support"" score has been more than twice as high during Obama’s tenure than it was under George W. Bush. In fact, Rahall’s highest support score for Bush (47 percent) was lower than his lowest support for Obama (58 percent) by a double-digit margin. In the unlikely event that Rahall was referring to former President George H.W. Bush, we checked that possibility as well. As it turned out, Rahall’s average presidential support for the elder Bush was even lower -- 30 percent. Christopher Plein, an associate professor in the public administration department of West Virginia University, said that while it is important to look at the raw metrics, it’s also important to look at the substance of the votes themselves. He said that on issues of urgent importance to his constituents, such as regulations that are perceived to be a threat to coal mining, Rahall has not been hesitant to vote at cross purposes to Obama. ""My sense is that you would find Rep. Rahall’s positions showing variation across policy areas that might not align with common assumptions about Democratic stances on these matters,"" Plein said. However, while Rahall's level of voting support for Obama was lower than it was for all but 10 other Democrats in 2013, even that weak level of support is more than 27 percentage points higher than the most pro-Obama Republican in the House -- Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina, who supported Obama about 31 percent of the time in 2013. So it's a stretch for Rahall to portray his voting record as being virtually Republican. Our ruling Rahall said, ""I probably have supported George Bush more than I have Barack Obama."" He’s wrong: According to Congressional Quarterly, his average voting support for Obama has been 74 percent, compared to just 31 percent for George W. Bush, and his weakest support for Obama exceeded his strongest support for Bush by double digits.

"['Georgia', 'Taxes', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal seeks credit for ""lowest taxes"" in U.S.
","Gov. Nathan Deal has two Republicans, one Democrat and one Libertarian running against him. His initial re-election strategy: tell voters that he’s the ""real Deal"" in the race and the candidate who has produced ""real results."" In a recent campaign flier, Deal cites one of those ""real results."" Georgia, the flier points out, is ranked as the state with the ""lowest taxes per capita""  by the nonpartisan, Washington-based Tax Foundation The campaign accurately quotes the Tax Foundation’s latest published report. It has Georgia at 50th out of 50, with state tax collections averaging $1,639 per person, well below the national average of $2,441 and far below No. 1, Alaska at $7,708 per person. But is that something that Deal can take credit for? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look further. The foundation’s report was published in 2013. But it was based on state tax collections for the fiscal year that runs from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011. Deal only became governor Jan. 10, 2011. He was in office less than six months during the period that was the basis for the foundation’s rankings. We asked Jen Talaber, the communications director at Deal for Governor, to provide evidence that Deal, in fewer than six months, had influenced the state’s ranking and could claim that as  one of the ""real results"" of his term. She made three points. First, one of his early executive orders put a freeze on the gas tax. Second, he could have adjusted the tax rate or allowed agencies to implement something like a tobacco tax, but did not. Lastly, the governor controlled his revenue estimate in the amended budget for Fiscal Year 2011 to limit state spending and rebuild the state’s reserves, or savings. ""We don’t’ take credit for anything we haven’t done,"" Talaber said in an email. ""This is about now and the future. We think it’s a good thing that we have the lowest tax burden, and we’ll fight to keep it that way."" Our research confirmed that Deal signed an executive order freezing the state gas tax.That stopped a scheduled 1.6 cent-per-gallon tax increase that was forecast to collectively cost motorists $40 million. But the freeze took effect July 1, 2011, and had no impact on state tax collections in the fiscal year ending one day earlier, on June 30, 2011. To the second point, that’s a tougher one. It’s hard to say how something the governor didn’t do affected state tax collections. Some type of tax increases are regularly floated during the annual sessions of the General Assembly. But such proposals can go nowhere and likely wouldn’t have in a year when the state and Georgians were still struggling to dig out from the crippling economic downturn. Even if a tax increase or tax cut had been pushed by Deal, it’s very unlikely that it would have affected Fiscal Year 2011 tax collections, longtime Capitol observers say. To address the third point, we turned to Teresa MacCartney, director of the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget. She said the governor lowered the general fund revenue estimate for the amended 2011 budget by $27.7 million.   ""The reduction in estimated general fund revenues supported the governor’s position of not introducing nor supporting any proposed tax increases during the 2011 legislative session,"" MacCartney said. The governor’s conservative revenue estimates allowed the state to build up its revenue shortfall reserve by $212 million, a 183 percent increase over the previous year’s balance, she said. But rebuilding reserves wouldn’t have changed the per-person state tax collections in Fiscal 2011. Norton Francis, a senior research associate with the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said Georgia’s ranking as 50th in state tax collections is the result of the tough economy more than anything. ""It had nothing to do with anything the governor did or the General Assembly did,"" Essig said. ""It had to do with the nature of the economy and the nature of the impact of the recession, which hit Georgia harder than other states, comparatively, because of housing, our economy and all of that."" Francis, who specializes in state and local finance issues, including tax policy and revenue estimating, said it’s simple logic. ""If your population continues to grow and your income goes down, your taxes per capita are going down,"" he said. Both point to the Tax Foundation’s rankings as evidence that Georgia has traditionally been a low tax state. Georgia was 42nd in the Tax Foundation’s rankings for per-capita state tax collections in Fiscal 2007. As the recession hit, it sank to 45th in Fiscal 2008, 48th in Fiscal 2009 and to 49th in Fiscal 2010.The state’s ranking fell to 50th in FY 2011, the first year of Deal’s term, even though tax collections actually increased to $1,639 per person from $1,529 in FY 2010, according to the Tax Foundation’s website. ""If the governor is bragging (about Georgia being ranked 50th), then he has to take responsibility for the outcome -- and that’s the shortfall in funding for education, one of the highest numbers of uninsured and the critical condition of child welfare services,"" Essig said. ""You can’t have it both ways."" Deal’s only Democratic opponent, Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, brought up the same data last year. He was saying that Georgia is fostering a smaller state government but at the same time relying heavily on federal funds. PolitiFact ruled his calculations were slightly off but his claim was mostly true. There’s one more piece of data. We contacted officials at the Tax Foundation to confirm that the FY 2011 rankings on their website were the latest available. They said their report for 2014, which is based on new data from FY 2012, the first full year of Deal’s administration, is due out in a week or two. It shows Georgia rising one spot to 49th in per capita tax collections. Additionally, it shows state tax collections up $41 per person, to $1,680. So where are we in truth-testing the campaign claim that Deal deserves credit for Georgia having ""the lowest taxes per capita of any state?"" We don’t know how to answer the argument that he could have adjusted the tax rate or allowed agencies to implement something like a tobacco tax. As the campaign points out, he did neither. But we find no other evidence that in Deal’s first six months in office, he had any impact on the state’s ranking on sales tax collections per capita. The campaign’s overarching point seems to be that Georgia has low per capita taxes under Deal. That is true. But it also had low taxes under his predecessor. Under the latest ranking, Georgia is still near the bottom, but it will move up a notch to 49th-lowest. Deal’s campaign has a point. But a lot of context is needed to fully understand the claim. We rate the statement Mostly False.   -",/factchecks/2014/mar/18/nathan-deal/deal-seeks-credit-lowest-taxes-us/

Activist Janet Murguía calls Obama 'deporter-in-chief,' says he has deported more immigrants than other presidents
","Editor’s note: After we published this report, we got questions from readers about why we didn’t rely on more current numbers used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, opting instead to use other numbers from the Department of Homeland Security. So we expanded parts of this report to explain our reasoning in more detail. The rating remains the same.  Last week President Barack Obama told immigration reform activists he would look into reducing deportations of illegal immigrants. This follows criticism that Obama is falling short of his promises on comprehensive immigration legislation. Not only that, but over the last few years, some have gone as far as to call him ""deporter-in-chief."" On Univision’s talk show Al Punto, a Spanish-language political talk show, host Jorge Ramos interviewed a political activist on March 9, 2014, about her choice to use that nickname in a recent speech. ""The truth is we’re at the point of reaching 2 million deportations,"" said Janet Murguía, National Council of La Raza president, in an interview PolitiFact translated from Spanish. ""For us, this is a historic level, more than any other president of the United States. Our community is in crisis, and this isn’t acceptable."" PolitiFact has looked into deportation statistics under the Obama administration, but not since he’s started his second term. Let’s see how deportations under Obama compare to those under previous presidents. Laura Vazquez, a senior immigration legislative analyst at La Raza, told us that Murguía was referring to deportation numbers from the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE publishes yearly immigration statistics. However, ICE numbers lump together two separate statistics: removals and returns. Removals are formal orders to leave the country issued by a judge. A return is a more desirable option for Mexican nationals that allows them to leave the country without a restriction on when they can re-enter with a visa. There aren’t formal consequences attached with returns, and returns technically don’t count as ""deportations,""according to Homeland Security themselves. Media outlets routinely cite ICE numbers. Here, we chose not to. Those numbers aren’t an accurate count of deportations, because they include returns. Also, ICE numbers don’t include deportations conducted by Border Patrol officers. So when we hear the word ""deportations,"" the public’s definition doesn’t line up with how ICE defines the action. Instead, we elected to reference the other common source for deportation numbers, Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. Here, we can count all the removals by fiscal year. This isn’t a perfect assessment, because presidents’ terms don’t start on the same day new fiscal years do. We only have access to this data through fiscal year 2012, so we can’t track Obama’s most recent deportations. The more comprehensive Homeland Security data dates back to 1892. Here, we’ll take a closer look at deportations under Obama and other recent presidents. Deportations ramped up starting during the Clinton years.   On average, Obama is outpacing Bush by year. But since Obama hasn’t yet served two full terms, Bush has still overseen more deportations than any other president. Because ICE data is a year ahead of this chart, we can see how Murguía pegged Obama’s deportations at closer to 2 million. The most recent spike in deportations started at the end of the George W. Bush administration, said Pew Research Center associate Ana Gonzalez Barrera. In 2007, Bush increased the consequences for people illegally crossing the border, a strategy Obama has continued so far. Our ruling Murguía defended her ""deporter-in-chief"" nickname for Obama by saying he’s deported more people than any other president. Her office pointed to a set of statistics that counts departures in a different way than what most people would think of as deportations. We looked at statistics that used more a literal definition of deportation. By that standard, Obama is on track to outpace Bush by the end of his term, but he’s not quite there yet, according to Homeland Security data. At nearly 1.6 million deportations, that's still some distance from ""approaching 2 million."" It’s too soon to say that Obama has deported more people than any other president. But with the information available, it looks like he’s on track to do so. We rate her claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/mar/17/janet-murguia/activist-janet-murguia-calls-obama-deporter-chief-/

Half of millennials don't associate with Democrat or Republican party, Rock the Vote says
","Millennials are not big fans of professing commitment, according to a recent poll. They’re not ready to declare a lifelong love for a political party (or a spouse, for that matter). In Facebook lingo, they might say ""It’s complicated"" or claim to be in an open relationship with political parties. ""They should call us the ‘party pooper’ generation,"" tweeted Rock the Vote, an organization focused on increasing young registered voters, on March 11, 2014. ""50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party."" After hearing about the youth vote helping elect President Barack Obama, we wondered if that statistic could be correct: Do half of millennials not associate with a political party? Identification and voting aren’t the same In the tweet, Rock the Vote linked to a study released by Pew Research Center in March. Pew conducted the telephone survey of 1,821 adults nationwide in February, including 617 millennials ages 18 to 33, and analyzed previous surveys. This survey asked a variety of questions, ranging from whether they know what a ""selfie"" is to their thoughts on the tea party. As for millennials, Pew concluded: ""They are relatively unattached to organized politics and religion, linked by social media, burdened by debt, distrustful of people, in no rush to marry — and optimistic about the future."" The survey showed that 50 percent of millennials describe themselves as political independents, up from 38 percent in 2004. Meanwhile, 27 percent identify as Democrats and 17 percent as Republicans. But a follow-up question shows how they tilt: The 50 percent who self-identified as independents were then asked if they leaned more to either party. Among those 50 percent, 44 percent lean Democratic and 31 percent lean Republican. That leaves about 25 percent who either mentioned another party or say they are independents and don’t lean. When Pew included ""leaners,"" they found that half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican. A Democratic leaner ""behaves like a Democrat, thinks like a Democrat, votes like a Democrat,"" John Petrocik, a University of Missouri political science professor, told PolitiFact Florida. Many voting experts told us that when stated in isolation, describing half of millennials as independents is misleading because it omits their partisan leanings and voting behavior. ""A substantial proportion of self-described independents vote consistently Democratic or Republican; they just don’t like to use a party label,"" said Peter Levine, professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts. ""True independents -- those who really don’t know which party they’ll support -- are few, and they tend to have low turnout."" In the past, millennials have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. In 2008, 66 percent of voters age 18-29 voted for Obama -- that fell to 60 percent in 2012. Other surveys The Pew survey isn’t the only recent poll to look at millennial party identification. A 2012 survey done by American National Election Studies, a collaboration of Stanford University and the University of Michigan, divided respondents into strong and not very strong Democrats and Republicans; independents who lean Democratic or Republican; and flat out independent. Not surprisingly the number of true independents drops -- and it’s far below 50 percent for respondents ages 18-33.   Strong Democrat 16.47% Not very strong Democrat 19.77% Independent-Democrat 11.81% All Democrats and leaners 48.05% Independent 16.36% Independent-Republican 11.26% Not very strong Republican 13.37% Republican 10.96% All Republicans and leaners 35.59%   Partisan leanings and voting behavior, ""demonstrate quite clearly that millennials are by far the most Democratic age group in the American electorate today,"" said Alan I. Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. Independents in Florida So what about here in Florida, where about 25 percent of the electorate is independent? In the ages 18-29 category, 40 percent were registered Democrat, 27 percent Republican and 29 percent no party affiliation as of August 2012, according to University of South Florida professor Susan MacManus. ""They see themselves as neither (Democrat or Republican) but when push comes to shove, depending on the candidate, they tend to lean Democratic,"" MacManus told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Rock the Vote said ""50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party."" The group quoted a Pew study that showed half of millennials don’t self-identify with either major political party. However, that statement could create a misleading impression that their vote is up for grabs and they have no leanings, and that’s not the case. Half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican, Pew found. Other data and polling experts suggest millennials lean decisively toward Democrats, even when they identify as independents.

Climate change skeptic Patrick Moore says Earth has 'not warmed for the last 17 years'
","Fox News pundit Sean Hannity set the stage for a screaming match on climate change when he invited liberal Bob Beckel of The Five to debate Patrick Moore, a former Greenpeace activist who says there is no proof man is contributing to a warming planet. Beckel criticized Moore for his work as a spokesman for the nuclear energy industry and for saying carbon emissions go back into trees and food rather than the atmosphere. ""Come on, Patrick. You know better than that,"" Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity. But Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather. ""Basically, they're just saying weather these days,"" Moore said. ""They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis."" PunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change. We found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive. Lately it’s been hot a lot President Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out ""the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."" PolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it’s 13 or 14 of the last 15.) But that doesn’t necessarily rule out Moore’s claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context. Moore’s claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn’t real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth’s dramatic temperature increases over the last century. NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index. 
 (The index shows the temperature anomaly of each year. The temperature anomaly shows how a year's land-ocean temperatures compares with the longterm average. A higher anomaly, such as 0.67 degrees Celsius in 2010, shows how much warmer a year was than the longterm average. A negative anomaly, last seen in 1976, indicates a cooler year than the referenced period.) As you can see, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. Since then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat. That’s the basis for Moore’s claim. There are several problems with his analysis, however. Data for 2014 isn’t available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong. The years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore’s statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently. Moore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. ""What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal,"" said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA’s Goddard Institute. Moore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that. ""If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat,"" said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. ""You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there’s an upward trend,"" said  Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ""It’s cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires."" Moore’s response While Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn’t happening, he told us the figure ""does not prove much."" Moore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet’s temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for ""most of life history,"" he said. ""It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years,"" Moore said. Hamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore’s qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is ""unprecedented over decades to millennia."" Moore’s Greenpeace ties A final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a ""founder"" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that. Greenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore’s lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group’s early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don’t Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test. Moore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group’s founders include seven people, but not Moore. Greenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013. Our ruling Moore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because ""it has not warmed for the last 17 years."" It’s true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998. Moore’s statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record. And Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that. Moore’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Then, in the silence, he started to slowly clap his hands once every few seconds, holding the audience in total silence. Then he said into the microphone, 'Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence.' Then, little Darrell, with a proud South Carolina drawl, pierced the quiet and said, ‘Well, dumb a--, stop clappin’!’"" The reader wanted to know: Did this really happen?

The narrator, Liam Neeson, explains that a child dies unnecessarily due to extreme poverty every three seconds.

Dan Patrick once called for regular gas tax increases and consistently advocated higher sales taxes to pay for lower property taxes
","State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, the conservative radio talk-show host who led Republican primary balloting for lieutenant governor, has not been stumping on a raise-your-taxes platform. Yet his opponent in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the nomination, incumbent David Dewhurst, aired a TV ad before the March primary in which the narrator declares that Patrick ""called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax."" He did? By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us a backup document for the ad including excerpts from news stories published in 2009 and 2011 quoting Patrick as supportive of higher gas and sales tax rates. Also by email, Patrick campaign spokesman Logan Spence pointed out entries on Patrick’s campaign website characterizing the tax claims as misrepresentations. Hiking either tax would be a big move. Lawmakers last raised the state gas or motor fuels tax, of 20 cents a gallon, in 1991 and last increased the statewide sales tax, to 6.25 percent, in 1990, the House Research Organization noted in a March 11, 2011, report. We searched the Nexis database for relevant news stories on Patrick's positions on the taxes. Gas tax In the 2009 legislative session, Patrick resisted a push by Sen. John Carona, R-Dallas, and others to offer voters in Dallas, Harris and other urban counties the option of raising gas tax rates by up to 10 cents a gallon locally toward paying for local transportation projects. During Senate floor debate, Patrick told colleagues the option would burden taxpayers. ""I didn't come to Austin to be in this Senate to raise taxes over and over again on my constituents,"" Patrick said, the Dallas Morning News reported in an April 9, 2009, news story. That day, Patrick was on the losing end of a Senate vote for a proposal including the local-option tax increase, but the tax option never did make it into law. Five months later, as noted by Dewhurst’s camp, Patrick told a forum of Houston-area residents he would back regular statewide gas-tax hikes. Specifically, a Sept. 17, 2009, Houston Chronicle news story quoted Patrick as saying that he supported a slight increase to the state's gas tax and then annual one-cent increases to generate money for state transportation projects. ""I want the whole state involved"" in paying for transportation needs, Patrick said. We found no evidence of Patrick raising that idea again, while in February 2013, he declined to opine on increasing the gas tax after Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, R-Killeen, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, said he was going to be brave by supporting an increase. According to a Feb. 26, 2013, Associated Press news story, Patrick, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, ""passed on the question, saying his head had been buried in education."" During a February 2014 candidate forum, Patrick floated another way to raise money for transportation projects by saying he favors dedicating revenues from the state’s vehicle sales tax to future highway funding, the Chronicle reported Feb. 6, 2014. Sales tax From June 2008 into May 2012, news stories show, Patrick spoke in favor of increasing the state sales tax. Almost always, he said money generated by such increases should be spent to reduce property taxes. A June 24, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news story, echoed in a Jan. 8, 2009, Chronicle news account, quoted Patrick as saying: ""We need to fund our schools for the long term, and the best way to do this is through sales tax."" The Statesman story said Patrick had previously called for repealing the state’s business margins tax while boosting the sales tax 2 percentage points and also charging sales tax on some items then exempt from the tax. The story did not list particular items. Such an increase would generate an estimated $6 billion a year, the Statesman said. The story also said: ""Many Republicans, including Patrick, have long embraced the idea of relying more on the sales tax to pay for government services. At its convention this month, the Texas Republican Party included abolishing the school property tax--to be replaced with the sales tax and spending cuts--in its platform."" Patrick told the paper: ""The fairest way to tax people is on what they consume and their ability to pay, not on where they live."" Another instance: Patrick said during a 2010 committee meeting that he favors a sales tax increase to fund public education instead of relying on property tax revenue, the Chronicle reported Sept. 17, 2010. ""The homeowners and the commercial business owners can't stand much more,"" Patrick said, noting that all consumers would directly contribute to public education if the funding source shifted from property to sales taxes. According to a Sept. 6, 2011, Chronicle news story, as noted by Dewhurst's camp, Patrick suggested a two-cent state sales tax increase, which he said would generate enough revenue to make up for $5 billion in school-related reductions put in motion by the 2011 Legislature. According to the story, Patrick told a local group he wouldn't suggest more of an increase because if the rate goes too high, it begins to affect commerce in the border counties. ""Right now you have 4.5 million homeowners paying for education,"" Patrick said. ""I'd rather have all 21 million (residents) contributing to the cost of education."" Reporters for the Houston newspaper wrote conflicting interpretations of Patrick’s remarks with a Sept. 2, 2011, Chronicle news blog post stating that Patrick wasn’t saying to the local group that revenue from increased sales taxes should be spent making up for cuts in school aid. According to the blog post, Patrick was proposing ""to tie a sales-tax increase to a property-tax reduction of somewhere between 5 and 10 cents"" per $100 valuation. A May 18, 2012, news story in the Morning News mentioned Patrick’s earlier call for a two-cent sales tax increase to cover lowered school property taxes. ""What we have seen over the years is that tying the system to the property tax has not worked very well,"" Patrick said. ""We have to find a steady stream of revenue that keeps up with the growth and the needs of our state."" We did not spot more recent news stories about Patrick pitching higher sales taxes to lower property taxes, while a video posted by his campaign suggests he’s not seen a sales tax plan that he would champion. In Patrick’s video, posted online Feb. 9, 2014, Patrick reads aloud a voter question about why he doesn’t favor eliminating property taxes entirely by raising the sales tax. ""We need to move more to sales tax, away from property taxes, for really our main source of funding our government and our schools,"" Patrick says. But he also says there are ways to achieve as much solely by eliminating existing sales-tax exemptions while preserving exemptions on food and medicine. ""If there’s a model presented to me and the Legislature where we think we can actually do that, then I’m all in favor of that,"" Patrick said. ""I haven’t seen the model yet, but I’m a sales tax, I’m a sales/consumption tax guy. So, let’s move away from property taxes."" Summary Summing up: Patrick opposed a local-option gas tax proposal before calling--in a 2009 appearance--for regular statewide jumps in the tax to bolster transportation projects. Far as we can tell, he did not repeat that call. From 2008 into 2012, meantime, Patrick consistently advocated higher sales taxes to pay for lowering property taxes, though he recently said he hasn’t warmed up to a particular tax-swap plan. We failed to win an interview with Patrick to discuss his tax views over the years. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick ""called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax."" Both parts of this claim are correct, but clarifications are missing. Patrick piped up once for regular gas tax increases, in a 2009 talk, also making it clear that related revenue should pay for transportation projects. Similarly, his consistent calls for higher sales taxes have almost always been linked to reductions in property taxes, a detail this claim doesn’t cover. Finally, Patrick has not made increasing either tax a theme of his campaign for lieutenant governor. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

Dan Pfeiffer says Obama's approval rating is up from recent months
","Here’s a smattering of headlines from the last week on President Barack Obama’s polling numbers: Time: ""Poll: Obama’s Approval Rating Sinks To New Low."" Politico: ""Poll: Obama approval at record low."" Wall Street Journal: ""WSJ/NBC News Poll: Obama's Approval Rating Hits New Low."" Des Moines Register: ""Obama job approval hits record low."" So you can imagine our surprise when White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer claimed Obama’s numbers are actually up during an interview with Meet the Press host David Gregory. Here’s the exchange. Gregory: ""We had a big poll out, Wall Street Journal/NBC News, this week. Here’s what it found. Overall job approval for the president: 41 percent. Handling the economy: 41 percent. Same number when it came to foreign policy. And here’s what’s striking: Approval is 74 percent among Democrats. Sounds high, but it’s the lowest that the president’s had. ... The president has really slipped."" Pfeiffer: ""Public polls are a little bit all over the map. On the same day your poll came out, another poll came out that showed the president gaining 6 points in the last couple months. I’ve looked at a lot of data and let me tell you what we see. There’s no question that everyone in Washington, the president included, took a big hit from the double whammy of a shutdown and the problems of healthcare.gov. We have stabilized and we’re working our way back. If you look at the aggregate of public polling, we’ve gained 3 points in the last couple months."" We checked in with the White House to see where Pfeiffer got his numbers. A spokesman pointed us to Real Clear Politics, a political website that aggregates polling data and calculates an average. Obama’s job approval has been underwater for some time. Since May of last year, more Americans polled expressed disapproval in Obama’s job performance than approval. The gap has widened considerably since then. While the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this week has Obama hitting a new low with an approval rating of 41 percent, the White House noted the Real Clear Politics average had Obama bottom out in December with an approval rating of 39.8 percent. That came on Dec. 3 after several weeks of bad headlines about healthcare.gov’s botched rollout. On March 17, Obama’s aggregate poll numbers put his approval rating at 42.9 percent. That accounts for the 3-point jump that Pfeiffer claimed. The recent ""surge"" in the average seems to be skewed largely by two outlier polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports and Bloomberg. In a survey from March 13-15, Rasmussen Reports said 49 percent of Americans approve of Obama, while 50 percent disapprove, a statistical dead heat. Bloomberg between March 7-10 found an even split among those surveyed -- 48 percent both approved and disapproved of Obama. That’s a six-point improvement from December, when Bloomberg put his approval rating at 42 percent. The remainder of the polls included in the Real Clear Politics average showed Obama’s net approval rating ranging from -8 (Public Policy Polling) to -16 (Fox News) percentage points. John McIntyre with Real Clear Politics said the average from Dec. 3 likely included six or more polls taken between mid to late November as well as daily tracking polls, but it's possible they weren't from the same pollsters as the current average (at press time McIntyre was looking into which polls were used and we'll update the post when he gets back to us). He added that a quick look at the numbers showed, based on Real Clear Politics' average, Pfeiffer was right, though he noted that the December average captured a weird time period as some polls shut down around the Thanksgiving holiday. Other poll aggregation methods, meanwhile, show much more modest gains by the president. Huffington Post, for example, tracks 88 polls and takes a snapshot of the daily tracking polls from Gallup and Rasmussen every three days. According to their model, Obama’s aggregate approval rating was 42.5 percent on Dec. 2 (his low point) and has jumped just a bit to 43.3 percent. That’s less than 1 percentage point, a considerably smaller improvement than Real Clear Politics’ average. Charles Franklin, co-founder of pollster.com (which the Huffington Post now owns) and director of the Marquette Law School Poll in Milwaukee, walked us through his own aggregation of Obama’s poll numbers. According to Franklin, Obama’s low point came Dec. 2 when he registered an approval rating of 41.98 percent. He currently estimates the number at 44.38, a gain of about 2.4 percentage points. So all three poll averages show Obama’s low point actually came in early December, but his bounceback varies depending on the methodology. ""There are various ways of ‘averaging’ or aggregating polls to estimate trends,"" Franklin said. ""My bottom line: There has been some gain though it appears to be not as large as 3 points when using all available polls and a standard trend estimate. There may be a specific pollster you could find that has shown a 3 point gain, but that is cherry picking the one with a larger gain, rather than using all the polls as I and HuffPost do."" Our ruling When asked about Obama’s approval rating, Pfeiffer said, ""We’ve gained 3 points in the last couple months."" He’s right that the aggregate of polling data suggests that Obama’s low point was December, not early March, as the new WSJ/NBC poll said. But there’s some variation in how big of a rebound Obama’s approval rating has seen. While Real Clear Politics says its 3 percent (buoyed by two outliers), Huffington Post put it at less than a percentage point. Franklin said it was somewhere in between those two. Pfeiffer’s correct that the president’s poll numbers are up slightly over the past few months. But they remain low (and underwater), and the gains depend on how you run the numbers. We rate Pfeiffer’s claim Mostly True. Correction: Charles Franklin said President Barack Obama's aggregate approval rating bottomed out at 41.98 percent in December 2013. An earlier version of this fact-check included a different figure.",/factchecks/2014/mar/16/dan-pfeiffer/dan-pfeiffer-says-obamas-approval-rating-recent-mo/

Chain e-mail claims Muslims will be a majority in U.S. in 20 years
","Recently, a PolitiFact reader forwarded us a chain e-mail warning about Muslims in America, particularly the threat that the extremists could seek to impose the religious law known as Sharia in the United States.Here's one typical passage from the e-mail, with its original syntax intact: ""It is too bad that so many are disillusioned with life and Christianity to accept Muslims as peaceful.. some may be but they have an army that is willing to shed blood in the name of Islam.. the peaceful support the warriors with their finances and own kind of patriotism to their religion. While America is getting rid of Christianity from all public sites and erasing God from the lives of children the Muslims are planning a great jihad on America."" The e-mail cites the work of Nonie Darwish, an Egyptian-born American critical of Islam who founded a group called Arabs for Israel. But when we contacted Darwish, she said she had not written or approved the e-mail.As a website that focuses on politics and policy, we zeroed in on one passage that had been marked in red: ""In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President by themselves! Rest assured they will do so... You can look at how they have taken over several towns in the USA .. Dearborn Mich. is one... and there are others.""We thought it would be worth checking to see whether the e-mail is right about how fast the Muslim population is growing.Since the U.S. Census Bureau doesn't ask questions about religious affiliation, there's actually quite a bit of debate over how many Muslims live in the U.S. Without a solid count, studies are often reliant on assumptions and estimating techniques that have prompted skepticism in one quarter or another. The largest estimate we found was 7 million, the number used by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, which is an advocacy group for Muslim-Americans. Academic population experts have produced lower estimates -- between 1.8 million and 2.8 million.We won't wade too far into the debate, because even if the number is on the higher end of this range, the statement in the e-mail is still far off-base.  Currently, the total U.S. population is estimated to be roughly 308 million people. Assuming current rates of immigration, the Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population in 2030 -- 20 years from now -- will be 358 million.Of course, minors don't vote, so if you look only at those 18 and over, the current voting-age population is 234 million, a number projected to grow to 276 million by 2030. And if you reduce this number by the proportion of voting-age population that actually votes -- 64 percent in 2008 -- the population actually voting in 2030 would be 177 million.So if you assume that every Muslim living in America (1) would be eligible to vote and (2) would all vote for the same candidate -- assumptions that by themselves aren't the least bit plausible -- there would still need to be more than 88 million Muslims in America in 2030 to be able to ""elect the president by themselves,"" leaving aside the fact that the president is elected indirectly through the electoral college, so a Muslim majority would have to be spread broadly and decisively across the country. The number would actually need to be higher than that to account for Muslims who were eligible to vote but who didn't bother to cast a ballot, but to give the e-mail author the benefit of the doubt, we'll use the smaller figure here.So, even using 7 million as the current figure for the Muslim population -- and the easier-to-reach target of 88 million -- the Muslim population would have to grow roughly thirteen-fold in the space of 20 years to account for a majority of the voting-age population that actually votes. That means adding as many new Muslims in the U.S. as there are today every 19 months until 2030. If you instead assume that Muslims currently account for 2 million of the population, the number of Muslims would have to grow 44-fold in 20 years. That means adding as many new Muslims as there currently are in the U.S. roughly every 5 months until 2030. And if you assume that the Census Bureau's projection for total voting-age population in 2030 remains unchanged at 276 million -- in other words, that the ethnic makeup of the population in 2030 is a zero-sum game -- then the nation's population of non-Muslims would have to plunge by as many Muslims are added, something that could only happen through a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions that killed off tens of millions of Americans yet somehow managed to spare Muslims. Neither the laws of biology nor the laws of immigration would make any of this possible.""Muslims are less than 1 percent of the adult population, and a fair number are non-citizens -- students from foreign countries, or refugees,"" said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. ""While their number grew appreciably from the 1970s to the 2000s, their growth was no greater than that of a number of other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. Even if previous rates of growth continued, Muslims would still remain in the single digits even decades from now.""The idea that Muslims will be an electoral majority in 20 years ""is absurd,"" added Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for CAIR, agreed, saying that ""it sounds very far-fetched to me.""We agree.

Chain e-mail says three presidents deported a total of 15 million illegal immigrants
","In the hot-button immigration debate, some who oppose crackdowns on illegal immigrants suggest that it would be logistically and economically impossible for federal authorities to deport perhaps 10 million people to their country of origin.We recently received an unsigned chain e-mail in our inbox that took that argument head-on, suggesting that there's ample precedent in American history for mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Here are excerpts of the e-mail, with original syntax intact.""What did Hoover, Truman, and Eisenhower have in common? ... Back during The Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover ordered the deportation of ALL illegal aliens in order to make jobs available to American citizens that desperately needed work. Harry Truman deported over two million Illegal's after WWII to create jobs for returning veterans. And then again in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower deported 13 million Mexican Nationals! The program was called 'Operation Wetback'.. It was done so WWII and Korean Veterans would have a better chance at jobs. It took 2 Years, but they deported them! Now. ... if they could deport the illegal's back then -- they could sure do it today.""We checked with a range of experts, including historians of American immigration, to see whether the e-mail was accurate. Here's what we found:•  On President Hoover: The e-mail is partly correct, but somewhat exaggerated. During the early 1930s, there was a ""repatriation"" campaign in which some cities and counties, such as Los Angeles and Detroit, returned illegal aliens to their country of origin, mostly Mexico. The biggest impetus was the Great Depression and its impact on the availability of jobs.""In the 'repatriation,' about 1 million persons of Mexican ancestry, at the encouragement/coercion of state and local governments, with federal support, were 'returned' to Mexico,"" said Kevin Johnson, an immigration specialist who is dean of the University of California (Davis) School of Law. ""Persons who 'looked' Mexican in public places, such as parks and plazas, were arrested and taken in buses, trains, and cars to the U.S.-Mexico border.""Our experts estimated that between 400,000 and 1 million people were shifted across the border as a result of this effort, including an unknown but likely significant number of American-born dependents of illegals who were actually U.S. citizens, as well as other people who were in the U.S. legally.Because the motivating force was local rather than national, some of our experts said it was a stretch for the author of the e-mail to primarily cite Hoover as the leader of the effort (or his successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who initially continued the effort before cutting off federal funds). Still, the federal government was involved. Beyond that, the e-mail's description of this period is not far off.•  On President Truman: Our experts were unaware of any evidence to back up the assertion that Truman deported over 2 million illegal immigrants after World War II in order to create jobs.From 1946 to 1952 -- from the end of the war until the end of Truman's presidency -- the U.S. government recorded the entry of less than 1.5 million legal immigrants, many of them persons of European origin fleeing the war or the Holocaust. Experts we spoke to said that it wasn't credible that an even larger number of people could have been deported during that period.•  On President Eisenhower: ""Operation Wetback"" was real, but the numbers of deportations cited in the e-mail are wildly high.Beginning in World War II -- during a severe shortage of workers on the home front -- the federal government instituted the Bracero program, which brought Mexican workers into the United States to fill jobs that would not otherwise be filled. The Braceros, as they were called, were in the U.S. legally, but the government often looked the other way when companies illegally brought their own Mexican workers into the country. Workers brought in outside the Bracero program, combined with Mexicans who had crossed the border illegally on their own, were the targets of ""Operation Wetback.""In 1953 and 1954, under Eisenhower, the federal government undertook the operation, which mirrored the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s. The intention was to target illegal immigrants, but as with the earlier expulsions, some U.S. citizens of Mexican ancestry were also caught up in the dragnet.Determining the number of people who were removed from the U.S. as a result of ""Operation Wetback"" is tricky because some people who would have otherwise been subject to deportation left the country ""voluntarily,"" a step ahead of the authorities. The estimates we've seen ranged from 100,000 forced removals to 1.3 million. But no expert we spoke to said that the 13 million figure was credible.""I have never seen an adequate explanation"" of even the 1 million figure, said David G. Gutierrez, a historian at the University of California (San Diego). ""It is much more likely in my view that the stepped-up enforcement of the border increased apprehension numbers for a time, but that the status quo was soon restored and unauthroized labor was simply working more completely underground.""Official federal statistics show that during the whole decade of the 1950s, the federal government formally removed 150,000 illegal aliens and recorded about 3.9 million ""voluntary departures."" So even a whole decade worth of deportations, calculated in the most generous way possible, gets us to less than one-third of the total cited in the e-mail.Scott Wong, a Williams College historian, said that there is ""some truth in this post -- that the government has deported illegal immigrants in the past -- but it was never 13 million over two years. The author is very sloppy and loose with the facts, and completely ignores the historical context as to why there are illegal immigrants.""Even Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group critical of illegal immigration, said that while ""the idea of the e-mail is correct, the numbers are way, way too high.""In all, then, the e-mail is fairly accurate about the policy under Hoover, flat wrong about the policy under Truman, and dramatically exaggerated when talking about Eisenhower. If you look at the core historical facts the e-mail seeks to communicate -- that Presidents Hoover, Truman, and Eisenhower collectively ordered the deportation of at least 15 million illegal aliens -- all the evidence suggests that its numbers are nowhere near correct.  The official total from 1930 to 1960 is 477,000 formal removals and 5.4 million who left voluntarily. That 30-year period includes the entirety of Roosevelt's terms, not just the three presidents cited in the e-mail. Added together, the number who left would be just under 6 million -- less than half of what the e-mail claims -- and about 90 percent of them were not deported. It would be too generous to call the e-mail Barely True. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/10/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-three-presidents-deported-total-/

Dallas lawyers say Cornyn among Republicans keeping U.S. attorney slots from having Obama's appointees
","Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn draws fire in a recently published opinion piece pointing out that the four chief federal prosecutor positions in Texas have yet to be filled by lawyers of Democratic President Barack Obama's choosing. Two Democrats, Dallas lawyer Thomas Melsheimer and Craig Smith, a state district judge, said in an op-ed article in Monday's Austin American-Statesman that Cornyn's insistence on holding sway over the U.S. attorney appointments in Texas has kept them from happening. ""Obama should be allowed to select a competent nominee of his choice without Cornyn's blessing on the front end,"" they write. Other Senate Republicans are similarly thwarting the president, they suggest. ""Across the country,"" they write, ""more than half of the U.S. attorney seats remain without a prosecutor chosen by Obama."" Really? We reached Melsheimer, who said he based the less-than-half claim on information provided by the interim U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, James T. Jacks. We couldn't reach Jacks, but Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, told us Obama appointees have been confirmed as U.S. attorneys for 51 of the nation's 93 districts. A U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary web page lists the U.S. attorneys nominated by Obama and confirmed by the Senate. Fifty-one of 93 equals 55 percent, not ""less than half."" According to the Senate committee list, the last time that Obama appointees occupied less than half the U.S. attorney slots was early May. His 47th U.S. attorney nominee was confirmed with others May 5; three more nominees were confirmed May 25, nearly two weeks before the oped was published. Still, we wondered if there's a legitimate beef with Cornyn, who serves on the judiciary committee, and if it matters when the leadership posts are filled by civil-service lawyers instead of presidential appointees. Some perspective: Traditionally, the U.S. attorney posts turn over with each change in president. Though nationally, a handful of the top prosecutors appointed by President George W. Bush remain in place, the Bush appointees in Texas are gone, replaced by career Department of Justice lawyers considered temporary holders of the plum posts pending the arrival of Obama's choices. Cornyn said Wednesday he's falsely accused of blocking nominees and that the president has been slow to put names forward. Generally, he said, ""we're working in good faith together to try to fill as many of these vacancies as we can."" It's the Senate's role to confirm each president's nominees. For judicial-related appointments, Cornyn and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, rely on their own advisory committee to guide them on who to recommend the president name to federal judgeships and U.S. attorney posts in Texas. Last year, the committee was expanded to include Democratic-leaning lawyers. But the White House earlier said it would not choose anyone without a sign-off from the state's Democratic House members, who have elected as their chair U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin. In a March 2009 statement, the White House said Cornyn and Hutchison ""will be accorded a full opportunity to share their views about each candidate whom the president proposes to nominate."" But the statement also said: ""No federal judge, U.S. attorney or U.S. marshal will be nominated by the president, however, unless that person has the confirmed support of the Texas Democratic delegation."" Doggett said this week that a tradition hearkening to Republican Ronald Reagan's presidency grants appointment sway to House members from the president's party in states lacking members of the president's party in the Senate. The House Democrats have recommended various Texans to Obama for federal judgeships, U.S. marshal positions and each U.S. attorney slot. With competing groups seeking to be the clearinghouse for nominees, the situation seems ripe for standoffs. One element: House Democrats favor one candidate to be U.S. attorney for the state's Dallas-based Northern District, while Cornyn and Hutchison have aligned behind another. Meanwhile, the president's only announced choice for a U.S. attorney post in Texas, nominated in February, withdrew in April, telling a Beaumont TV station he'd decided to remain a state district judge, indicating impatience with the process. ""There is no timetable for a decision on the nomination,"" the station quoted John Stevens, the nominee, saying. ""It's just sitting there. It seems like there ought to be a quicker method."" Far as we can tell, the White House has not spoken out lately about its Texas appointments. This week, an Obama spokesman didn't immediately have a comment. Doggett noted that besides the lack of Obama's U.S. attorney appointees in Texas, seven Texas judicial posts wait to be filled. Doggett said Cornyn has played a delaying role, though the White House shares blame. ""As long as the White House doesn't put a high priority on (filling the openings), the (GOP) senators are only encouraged to be obstructive,"" Doggett said. UPDATE, 2:38 p.m. June 11, 2010: After we posted this article, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told us that Obama, in consultation with state congressional delegations, has nominated a steady stream of candidates for U.S. attorney posts ""at a pace similar to that of previous administrations."" He said that through June 9, Obama had nominated 72 individuals as U.S. attorneys, with 51 confirmed by the Senate and two having withdrawn. Bush had made 83 nominations by the same point in his first term, with 75 confirmed and two having withdrawn. And at the same point of his first term, President Bill Clinton had nominated 83 U.S. attorneys with 81 confirmed. Nobody we queried had objections to staff lawyers filling in as U.S. attorneys until the political appointments are made. Does the delay make a difference? It matters, Doggett said, because a presidential appointee can be counted on to carry out administration priorities. ""If a U.S. attorney has consistently under the Bush administration ignored violations concerning polluting our waterways and oceans,"" Doggett said, ""and somebody under the Obama administration thinks it's time to give that attention and prioritize, that's a good example of why it makes a difference."" Attorney Richard Roper, Bush's appointed U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas through 2008, agreed, saying political appointees -- ""somebody on the president's team and the attorney general's team"" help make sure ""all priorities of the attorney general are being carried out."" As for the lawyers' statement, it misses the mark: Obama choices were confirmed for more than half the nation's U.S. attorney slots as of early May. Yet it's not off by much. Obama still doesn't have appointees in place in nearly half the posts. We rate the statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/10/thomas-melsheimer/dallas-lawyers-say-cornyn-among-republicans-keepin/

Perry says $18 billion budget gap estimate is plucked from air
","Seven months before the Texas Legislature convenes to begin work on the state's next two-year budget, Gov. Rick Perry was asked his assessment of the state budget gap likely to confront lawmakers. ""How big do you estimate that the state's budget shortfall will be?"" reporter Martin Bartlett of Austin's KVUE-TV asked in an interview posted online June 4. ""... We've heard that estimate, $18 billion. That is a big number."" Perry replied: ""It is a big number. And I think it's a number that somebody just reached up in the air and grabbed."" Perry, noting he's been around state government for a spell, went on: ""May of 2011 is when we are really going to get down to the lick log, and to be trying to estimate what the Texas economy is going to be, particularly in this economic climate that we're in, I think is an effort in futility and not very wise by those who are trying to do those estimates."" We wondered what the heck a lick log is -- oh, and whether Perry was on the mark when he characterized the $18 billion estimate as free-floating, so to speak. For starters, we're presuming that ""budget gap"" refers to the expected gulf during 2012-13 between state spending demands and revenue the state can count on to meet them. As for lick log, the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang says a lick log is a “salt lick for cattle.” The phrase “down to the lick log” means to get “down to business.” So, Perry’s perspective appears to be that the financial picture won't be clear until May 2011, about when negotiators for the House and Senate are likely to draw up the final budget that ends up being sent to the governor. When we contacted Perry's office about his ""up in the air"" statement, spokeswoman Allison Castle pointed out that state Comptroller Susan Combs has not yet released a 2012-13 revenue estimate and also agencies have not made appropriation requests. Some budgetary background: Every odd-numbered year, lawmakers start drafting the budget with instructions from the state comptroller on how much revenue the state expects to earn during the next two years; that forecast determines how much the state has to spend. Unlike the federal government's, the budget has to balance, with the state spending no more than it takes in. When Perry was asked about the $18 billion figure on KVUE, Bartlett did not mention a source for the number. The Austin American-Statesman's budget reporter, Kate Alexander, nudged us to review the May 11 meeting of the House Appropriations Committee, whose members will get first crack at writing the budget. At the meeting, according to a video recording posted online by the Texas House, committee Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, quizzed Wayne Pulver, assistant director of the Legislative Budget Board, about the reasons that the state is facing a budget gap. Pitts introduced Pulver by noting the board does forecasting and is keeping the committee informed about ""what we might be looking at as far as the shortfall."" Established in 1949, the board is charged with many budgetary responsibilities, including preparation of a draft of the budget bill for legislators each session; its analysts produce the numbers that inform legislative spending decisions. At the hearing, Pulver signed off on Pitts' conclusion that lawmakers will start with a budget gap because of funds that will no longer be available from sizable sources that helped balance the 2010-11 budget: $6.4 billion in federal stimulus money and $5.6 billion in one-time state funds. Those figures jibe with an analysis the budget board produced in March for the committee and was laid out by John O'Brien, the board's executive director. O'Brien pegged the budget gap at $11 billion, but cautioned that his figure assumed no growth in state spending or revenue. At the May hearing, Pulver detailed factors expected to increase the shortfall, including that revenue could fail to meet projections and that spending may increase to accommodate growth in demand for programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Pitts then asked: ""So that could add up to between $15 and $18 billion?"" Pulver called that number ""reasonable."" At a May 25 meeting of the House Ways and Means committee, Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, got into more nitty-gritty. Citing a staff analysis, Oliveira said the expected gap could be reduced thanks to $1.2 billion in cuts to the current budget ordered by state leaders. Also, he said, the state could reap more than $3 billion in additional revenue transferred from the state's public education endowment and in federal Medicaid aid. But Oliveira also said the state could be facing new costs, such as: * $2.5 billion for Medicaid, primarily because of increased enrollment linked both to the economic downturn* $3.4 billion for public and higher education, primarily because of projected enrollment increases* $200 million for prisons, including increased health care costs A final factor in Oliveira’s analysis: revenue collections that he said could leave the state $3 billion to $6 billion short of projections. When all is said and done, Oliveira's budget gap estimate ends up at about $18 billion. J.J. Garza, Oliveira's chief of staff, later told us that he prepared Oliveira's analysis in consultation with the staff of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, the Legislative Budget Board, and government and private-sector economists. Straus has also cited the budget gap, writing in a June 1 opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman that ""recent estimates project the state budget shortfall could be as much as $18 billion."" Tracy Young, a spokeswoman for Straus, told us the speaker was referring to the same figures discussed by Pitts and Pulver. She described the source of the numbers as a combination of information from the LBB, state comptroller's office and the speaker's policy staff. As for the legitimacy of the $18 billion figure, we found a common cautionary caveat. There is still a lot of time for the number to change, especially if the economy takes a dramatic turn -- in either direction. In prepared remarks for the May 25 committee meeting, Oliveira said ""the numbers can move by hundreds of millions over the next few months."" He continued: ""If the recovery is stronger, then (tax) collections would improve, our Medicaid burden would probably shrink ... and the revenue estimate for next session would be higher,"" which would shrink the gap. Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told the San Antonio Express-News in April that the budget gap couldn't yet be defined ""because you don't know -- when you say shortfall, you imply some sort of mandatory spending level and some sort of predetermined revenue level, neither of which we have. There's no shortfall if you don't spend it. And we don't know yet what our revenue projections are."" Despite that, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association -- which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms -- said that making budget projections is a ""healthy part of the process; we do need to constantly be looking forward."" Craymer said that without projections, for example, state leaders might not have decided to call for the recent cuts to the state's current budget. So how does Perry's statement shake out? It's downright flighty. Projections may be uncertain, but that doesn't mean they're pulled from the air, as Perry told KVUE. The $18 billion budget gap figure has been cited by state leaders using the best information they now have available. And an official at the budget board, whose staffers are longstanding experts on number-crunching, called that figure ""reasonable"" before Perry piped up. We rate Perry's statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/10/rick-perry/perry-says-18-billion-budget-gap-estimate-plucked-/

Chain e-mail says U.N. treaty would force U.S. to ban, confiscate guns
","A chain e-mail making the rounds warns that President Barack Obama's administration is pursuing a United Nations treaty that would be the ""first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States."" Given the controversial nature of both gun-rights policy and United States sovereignty, we decided to do a fact-check.Here are excerpts from the version of the e-mail forwarded to us by a reader, with original capitalization and syntax intact:""While you were watching the oil spill, the New York failed terrorist bombing and other critical crises, Hillary Clinton signed the small arms treaty with the UN.""OBAMA FINDS LEGAL WAY AROUND THE 2ND AMENDMENT AND USES IT. IF THIS PASSES, THERE could BE WAR....""On Wednesday the Obama administration took its first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States. The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for US citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the US State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress. Once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.... The laws are designed and intended to lead to the complete ban and confiscation of all firearms....""We will wake up one morning and find that the United States has signed a treaty that prohibits firearm and ammunition manufacturers from selling to the public. We will wake up another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that prohibits any transfer of firearm ownership. And then, we will wake up yet another morning and find that the US has signed a treaty that requires US citizens to deliver any firearm they own to the local government collection and destruction center or face imprisonment. This has happened in other countries, past and present! THIS IS NOT A JOKE NOR A FALSE WARNING.""There's a lot to digest here, but we'll start by explaining what treaty the e-mail is referring to.Though the e-mail calls it the ""small arms treaty,"" it's been referred to in official U.N. documents as the Arms Trade Treaty. In 2006, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution that established a path toward a ""comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms."" Backers argued that a treaty would safeguard international peace and security by curbing the international flow of weapons -- especially to ''make it more difficult for guerrilla movements, insurgents and irresponsible governments'' to obtain small arms, in the words of Mark Leon Goldberg, who writes for the liberal magazine the American Prospect and blogs for the publication UN Dispatch.The United States has not always fully supported the process. The administration of George W. Bush voted against resolutions supporting it in the General Assembly, arguing that nation-by-nation safeguards are superior to international agreements. Gun-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association also opposed participation in the treaty.But in October 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the Obama administration was open to negotiating a treaty, as long as the final text was arrived at by consensus -- a process that would effectively give every participating nation a veto. ""Consensus is needed to ensure the widest possible support for the treaty and to avoid loopholes in the treaty that can be exploited by those wishing to export arms irresponsibly,"" Clinton said in a statement.That announcement disappointed some backers of the treaty, who said giving every nation a veto would effectively water down the substance of the agreement while also producing major procedural hurdles. But gun-rights advocates were unhappy for a different reason, saying that rejoining the talks could open the United States to one day having to adjust its own gun laws to mirror those in the new international standards. John Bolton, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under Bush, echoed the arguments of the chain e-mail when he told the Washington Post after Clinton's announcement that ""this has little or nothing to do with the international trade in conventional arms. This will strengthen the hand of a government that wants to regulate private ownership of firearms.""No final treaty text exists yet. As a result, it's impossible to say definitively that the final version of the treaty will, or will not, impinge upon domestic gun rights in the U.S. Also, the e-mail is incorrect that the treaty would be operative once it is signed. Rather, it would become operative once it is signed and the Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds margin. (For that matter, the e-mail is also wrong to say that the Secretary of State has signed it -- that hasn't happened yet.)But let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the final treaty did include provisions that ran counter to the Second Amendment of the Constitution -- the one that protects ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms."" And let's assume that an administration was actually bold enough to sign that treaty, and that the U.S. Senate mustered the two-thirds vote required to ratify it, even though doing so would inspire a popular backlash among Americans who believe strongly in gun rights.Even if all of that happened, a half-dozen constitutional and international law experts we spoke to agreed that there is solid Supreme Court precedent guaranteeing that those provisions could not be enforced domestically.This fail-safe mechanism is the 1957 Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert. In that case, the majority ruled, among other things, that if a provision of a U.S.-ratified treaty were to run counter to the U.S. Constitution, it could not be enforced.The majority wrote that the Supreme Court had ""repeatedly taken the position that an act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.""Our experts -- including scholars from across the ideological spectrum -- added that Reid v. Covert has attracted little dissent in subsequent years, so they consider it a strong bulwark against the kinds of threats envisioned by the author of the chain e-mail. ""No treaty can validly abridge a constitutionally-protected individual right,"" said Kal Raustiala, a UCLA law professor. ""That issue was decided long ago. So the scenario laid out here is simply not accurate.""We found wide agreement that a ""complete ban and confiscation"" of guns, as the e-mail darkly put it, is not in the cards anytime soon. But some of our experts added that over a much longer period, a U.N. treaty could indirectly shape the course of U.S. gun control policy.This could happen if new standards set by an international treaty begin to influence how courts in the U.S. interpret the Second Amendment. The legal positions of other countries have occasionally been cited in court decisions, as recently as May 17, 2010, when the Supreme Court decided in Graham v. Florida that it's unconstitutional to sentence a juvenile offender to life in prison without parole for a crime other than homicide. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority that ""there is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in continuing to impose life without parole sentences on juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over. This observation does not control our decision. The judgments of other nations and the international community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth Amendment. But 'the climate of international opinion concerning the acceptability of a particular punishment' is also 'not irrelevant.'""It's possible to imagine the Supreme Court at some future date using an international gun control standard as one piece of evidence when writing a majority opinion on the Second Amendment, though that's hardly a foregone conclusion.""Over the really long term, do (gun-rights advocates) have something to worry about? The answer is absolutely yes,"" said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. ""It's smart for the NRA to be mobilized on an international level.""But even scholars who agree with this position make clear a difference between the e-mail's claims, which they consider overheated or worse, and something that could, theoretically, happen many years from now. Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said that ""while this is a serious long-term problem, it is not a matter of gun confiscation tomorrow,"" as the e-mail suggests. The possible long-term evolution of how the Second Amendment is interpreted ""points in the same general direction as this e-mail,"" Bromund said. ""But the difference between what is going on and the claims (it makes) are considerable.""Ultimately, then, it's possible -- if a treaty is passed, and if Supreme Court justices use the treaty as a foundation for overturning longstanding interpretations of the Second Amendment -- for the treaty to influence U.S. gun laws. But it is simply not true that, in the e-mail's words, ""once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments."" Rather, in the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that banned guns and required their confiscation from ordinary Americans, a longstanding Supreme Court precedent would make those provisions unenforceable within the United States.

Halliburton, KBR, and Iraq war contracting: A history so far
","We have a hard time resisting when people on national television ask us to fact-check them.

The latest instance began with Arianna Huffington, founder of the liberal Huffington Post, talking on ABC's This Week about the causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

""The truth is that right now we have precisely the regulatory system that the Bush-Cheney Administration wanted -- full of loopholes, full of cronies and lobbyists filling the very agencies they're supposed to be overseeing,"" she said, adding a bit later, ""Right here, we have the poster child of Bush-Cheney crony capitalism. Halliburton (was) involved in this, and we haven't said (anything) about that. They after all were responsible for cementing the well. Here's Halliburton, after it defrauded the American taxpayer (of) hundreds of millions of dollars is involved again...""

That's when conservative pundit Liz Cheney interrupted.

""Arianna, I don't know what planet you live on ..."" she said, starting interruptions and crosstalk that finally ended with this:

Cheney: ""Her assertion that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government --""

Huffington: ""It did. It did.""

Cheney: ""-- that it was Bush-Cheney cronyism -- these are the left's talking points --""

Huffington: ""It did -- hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq.""

Cheney: ""Arianna, it is absolutely not true. It is absolutely not true.""

Huffington: ""Okay, I'm so glad PolitiFact is going to be checking this. I'm so glad.""

Cheney: ""Good, good.""

There is no dispute that Halliburton was a contractor on the Deepwater Horizon rig, which is what Huffington was alluding to when she said Halliburton was ""involved"" in the oil spill. Host Jake Tapper affirmed that, then Cheney indicated she was objecting specifically to the claim of fraud. So we decided to fact-check Huffington's statement that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government of ""hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq.""

We first want to note something not explicitly stated on the show: Former Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton before becoming vice president, and Liz Cheney is his daughter. And we'll also stipulate that there is a mountain of evidence that many American companies profited off of the government's inefficient contracting system during the rebuilding of Iraq.

Dick Cheney was secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993, during the administration of President George H.W. Bush. A few years after leaving office, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Halliburton, a Houston-based oil services company. He led Halliburton until 2000, when he left to run for vice president on a ticket with George W. Bush. The Iraq war began a few years later.

Most of the allegations of waste involving Halliburton focus on a subsidary company that Halliburton acquired in 1962, then known as Brown & Root. A series of mergers under Halliburton's ownership led to its current name, Kellogg, Brown & Root, or KBR.

Halliburton's KBR held one of the largest contracts given during the Iraq war effort, the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LOGCAP, which was part of the trend of government outsourcing traditionally military duties to the private sector. (We're focusing on the LOGCAP contract in this report because it's the contract that has the potential for ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in fraud. There have been other isolated allegations of fraud that involved significantly smaller amounts.)

The history of KBR's LOGCAP contracts are documented in Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience, a 2009 report prepared by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction:

""Just as USAID had outsourced much of its work in the years after the Cold War, the military also had turned to the private sector to perform work once done by its own personnel. Under the LOGCAP contract, which KBR held for all but a few years since the program's inception in 1985, contractors provide services ranging from building bases to cooking food and doing laundry. LOGCAP grew out of the post-Vietnam downsizing of the armed services, reflecting the government-wide growth of outsourcing, which would dramatically affect the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. In World War II, one contractor was deployed for every seven soldiers. During the 2003 invasion, that number had increased to one for every 2.4. By 2006, contractors outnumbered soldiers in Iraq.""

The report noted that some government officials raised the concern of a potential conflict of interest because of Cheney's former position with Halliburton, but that ""White House officials said the mission took priority over whatever political fallout might occur"" from awarding contracts to KBR. Since winning the latest version of the LOGCAP contract in 2001, the government has ordered work from KBR worth more than $31 billion.

Government officials have raised many questions about KBR's fulfillment of its contracts, everything from billing for meals it didn't serve to charging inflated prices for gas to excessive administrative costs. Government auditors have noted that KBR refused to turn over electronic data in its native format and stamped documents as proprietary and secret when the documents would normally be considered public records.

Over the course of several years, the Defense Contract Audit Agency found that $553 million in payments should be disallowed to KBR, according to 2009 testimony by agency director April Stephenson before the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Commissioner Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore Law School, said that amount represents a small portion of everything that auditors examined as potentially questionable.

""The DCAA is known for cautious conclusions about contracting,"" Tiefer said. ""The large majority of those auditor findings get actually withheld from the contractor."" 

KBR itself acknowleges it may not get paid for all of its contract services. In its most recent annual report filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, it acknowledged that the Defense Contract Audit Agency was recommending withholding $289 million in contract costs not yet paid and asking for the return of $121 million already paid. ""We continue to work with our administrative contracting officers, the DCAA and our subcontractors to resolve these issues. However, for certain of these matters, we have filed claims with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Claims,"" the report states.

But there is one notable allegation where KBR is being accused of fraud, that KBR ""knowingly included impermissible costs"" in its bills. In April 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil fraud case against KBR over the issue of using private security forces in Iraq to protect its workers and subcontractors. Private security wasn't allowed under the LOGCAP contract because the U.S. military was supposed to provide protection.

The lawsuit alleges that internal documents showed KBR executives knew private security wasn't allowed but charged for it anyway. While the lawsuit doesn't put a dollar amount on those billings, the director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency said the total could come to $99 million or higher.

KBR has denied wrongdoing and said in a response to the lawsuit that the government has known for years that KBR was hiring private security, and KBR only did so because its employees were being left unprotected by the military.

""KBR believes the costs incurred and actions taken by the company and its subcontractors to provide support and to protect its employees and subcontractors were reasonable, necessary and appropriate under the contractual arrangement between KBR and the Army. ... The Army breached the contract by repeatedly failing to provide the necessary force protection,"" the statement said.

""Since 2001, KBR and its employees and subcontractors have worked diligently, and at often times at great sacrifice, to support American troops serving in Iraq,"" it also said. We should note here that KBR workers have died in Iraq. Company officials said 74 people working on the LOGCAP III contract have died in Iraq between 2003 and 2010.

Halliburton sold KBR in 2007. Halliburton officials said KBR's war contracts weren't adding much to the oil company's profits. The same year, Halliburton opened a ""second headquarters"" (their words) in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to emphasize its identity as a worldwide oil services company. But Halliburton did own KBR during the height of KBR's activities in Iraq. The Department of Justice fraud lawsuit specifically stipulates that KBR was overcharging between 2003 and 2006, years that Halliburton owned the company.

We asked Halliburton for comment on this report, and they sent us this statement: ""Halliburton cannot comment on activity that relates to KBR's work in Iraq and Afghanistan as it would be inappropriate for Halliburton to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of KBR.""

The U.S. government continues to use KBR for contract work in Iraq.  In fact, the U.S. Army recently granted additional work worth $568 million to KBR in May. Military officials said it would be too disruptive to change contractors at this point in the process. Indeed, one defense of KBR's work is that they take extra steps -- which some might call excessive -- to keep troops happy with extra amenities at the request of military commanders.

Recently, government officials have warned that KBR is dragging its feet on withdrawing its personnel from Iraq; the company's withdrawal rate significantly lags that of the military itself. If KBR doesn't reduce its employees in Iraq quicker, the U.S. government could be overbilled by as much as $193 million in 2010, officials said during hearings held by the Commission on Wartime Spending in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In evaluating Huffington's statement, we're most bothered by her use of the word ""defrauded."" Some of the overbilling in Iraq appears to have been done from haste or inefficiency, or even in a desire to please military officials in the field without regard for cost. Whether the waste in contracting constitutes fraud is still being examined.

""It's a lot money being spent in a region of the world where we don't have a lot of infrastructure for accounting for how the money is being spent. It will take years before we fully determine how we spent the money,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

In ruling on Huffington's statement, we find much in the public record to support her statement, most notably the Justice Department lawsuit. Certainly there have been hundreds of millions of dollars that Halliburton's KBR attempted to charge the government that have been denied. Government audits of KBR's work in Iraq will likely continue for some time, and we do not expect a final accounting on these fronts anytime soon. Huffington glossed over some of these points in her back and forth with Liz Cheney. There's also much evidence that makes us believe that hundreds of millions of dollars were lost to waste and inefficiency, not deceitful fraud. So we rate Huffington's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/09/arianna-huffington/halliburton-kbr-and-iraq-war-contracting-history-s/

Bud Chiles says 1 million Florida children are without health insurance
","Lawton ""Bud"" Chiles III, son of the late Gov. Lawton Chiles, announced his independent run for governor on June 3, 2010, by saying he'd be a voice for those who traditionally have been cut out of the democratic process.""I'm here to speak for 1 million Floridians who today are out of work, for almost 1 million children who have no health insurance in this state and for millions of Florida citizens like me, who believe that Florida can and must do better by its families and by its communities,"" Chiles said.Chiles, previously a registered Democrat, said he opted out of a Democratic primary with Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink after he spoke on the phone with Sink and she told him she plans to raise $30 million in the race. Sink denies using that figure.In this item, we wanted to check Chiles' claim that almost 1 million Florida children are without health insurance.The number is particularly surprising, given that the state operates a program called Florida KidCare, which provides free or heavily subsidized health insurance for many uninsured children under 19. To qualify for Florida KidCare you must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-U.S. Citizen (read the eligibility information here). The Florida Department of Health says that 1.8 million children are currently enrolled in the program.To begin to assess Chiles' figure we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy.In October 2009, they produced a report called ""The Uninsured, a Primer,"" which details the number of people insured and uninsured by race, gender, age and state.The report is based on Census information and averages 2007 and 2008 calculations to provide state-level data. Kaiser says the data comes with a margin of error between 5 and 7.9 percentage points.According to Kaiser, 18.3 percent of Florida's 4.3 million children under 19 are without health insurance, or about 787,000 children. Only Texas has a higher percentage of children uninsured, Kaiser found.Families USA, a national consumer health care group, said in an October 2008 study that 797,000 children in Florida were without health care (18.8 percent of all children). The study, like Kaiser's, relied on Census data and counted children under 19.Families USA found that over 60 percent of Florida’s uninsured children come from low-income families who likely are eligible for Florida KidCare.A third group, The Commonwealth Fund, found in a 2009 study that 18 percent of children 0-17 in Florida were without health insurance -- the highest percentage of children uninsured in the country. The Commonwealth Fund study did not attach a raw number like the Families USA and Kaiser surveys, but 18 percent is in the same range as the findings of the other two studies.In his announcement as a candidate for governor, Chiles said that almost 1 million children in Florida don't have health insurance. The most reliable and recent studies put the number at close to 800,000. Chiles uses the word ""almost,"" which gives him some leeway. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/09/bud-chiles/bud-chiles-1-million-children-health-insurance/

Fulton County says teen pregnancy is down
","As part of Teen Pregnancy Prevention Month, Fulton County hosted a day of awareness events May 27 at the Neighborhood Union Health Center in Vine City. A news release announcing the effort said the following: ""Fulton County has successfully reduced the number of pregnancies among 15-19 year olds [sic] in the County. The number of teen pregnancies dropped from 2,608 in the year 2000 to 1,831 in 2006.""In the spirit of the awareness campaign, we at PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Fulton County's news release.Fulton County teen pregnancies are indeed down. Way down. Between 2000 and 2006, the number of pregnancies among Fulton County females age 15 through 19 dropped just as the news release stated -- about 30 percent.In fact, the figures Fulton County published downplay the decrease. Consider its pregnancy rate, a measurement that takes into account changes in population size. When you use this figure, the drop is even more dramatic. In 2000, the rate was 97.1. per 1,000 females in the specified age group. By 2006 it was 58.1 -- a decrease of about 40 percent. But is this truly a ""success,"" as the news release said? ""Success"" suggests to us that the decrease is unique or greater than average. For instance, if Fulton teenage pregnancy dropped 30 percent while the state's rate dropped by 90 percent, Fulton's decrease would look more like failure than success. ""Success"" also implies that county government had something to do with it. The claim was made in a Fulton County news release, after all. To determine whether Fulton's decrease in teen pregnancy is unusual, we looked at county, state and national statistics for females 15 through 19 between 2000 and 2006. Nationally, the pregnancy rate for teens dropped from 48 to 42 per 1,000, or 12.5 percent. Across Georgia, the drop was about 14 percent -- 81.3 to 67.6 per 1,000. For Georgia's nonrural counties, it fell from 79 to 66 per 1,000, or about 16 percent. In the metro area, Clayton County (at 83.4 per 1,000), DeKalb County (at 67.5 per 1,000) and Gwinnett County (at 62.1 per 1,000) all had higher pregnancy rates in 2006. And while Cobb County's pregnancy rate was lower than Fulton's at 51.5 per 1,000, its decrease between 2000 and 2006 was less than half of Fulton's, at about 17 percent.There you go. Fulton County's 40 percent drop was unique. Now, did Fulton County government have anything to do with it? Probably. We interviewed three experts who said it is extremely difficult to measure the exact effect of a community's teen pregnancy prevention efforts. However, it's reasonable to assume that a county that implements programs with a proven record of success has something to do with the drop in the pregnancy rate. Fulton does a share of that work. For years, it has provided pregnancy tests, contraceptives, counseling, health education classes, abstinence-based education, community outreach and five health centers that focus on adolescent health and development. Nongovernment organizations in Fulton do a lot, also. Grady Memorial Hospital, which is located in Fulton County, provides clinical services and outreach. Its clinic saw just under 2,000 teens in 2009. Its educational outreach program reached 3,000 teens. The Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University develops and researches successful sex education methods and disseminates information to teens and professionals. While Grady, the Jane Fonda Center and other resources have likely played a major role in the reduction of teenage pregnancy rates, it's fair to give credit to Fulton County as well.

Whoomp! There he ain't! - No, that's not Obama in video
","No need to go to Hawaii (or Kenya) to verify this Internet rumor. The evidence is on VH-1 (and now YouTube). Bumping and bouncing through the blogosphere Tuesday was the claim that President Barack Obama appeared in the 1993 music video for Whoomp! (There It Is), the catchy ode to raucous dancing and sexual promiscuity that became a fixture at sporting events. It includes the refrain ""Can you dig it?... We can dig it."" The speculation centers on an Obama doppelganger who appears in the video by the Atlanta rap duo Tag Team. He appears for just a few seconds during a scene where a wad of cash is shown resting next to a game of dominoes. (Not a campaign contribution, we hope, because the FEC frowns on cash.) With a Compton cap on his head, a stud in his earlobe, an array of gold rings on his hand and an antiquated, huge cell phone attached to his ear, the young black man flashes a wide grin that evokes Obama's toothy smile. But much of his face is obscured by a pair of wayfarer sunglasses.The image stirred impassioned debate on hip-hop and political sites such as Tha Corner, Gawker, The Huffington Post and Something Awful, with commentators overwhelmingly declaring that the unidentified baller must be a young Obama, or, at the very least, a passable look-alike. ""Pay close attention to his ears poking out, the shape of his nose, and skin color,"" said a posting on Tennessee Sons of Liberty, a Tea Party blog. The discourse follows years of intense scrutiny and disagreement over Obama's background. Critics have claimed he continues to misrepresent his religion, country of birth and political beliefs despite evidence to the contrary, such as his birth certificate from Hawaii. The Tag Team postings were mostly good-natured musings. Many noted that Obama is a self-professed hip hop fan who drew wide support from rap artists during his presidential campaign, but some critics accused the bloggers of perpetuating racial stereotypes.""Are you sure that's not him? Because all black people look the same,"" deadpanned one Huffington Post commentator. We wondered: Could it be him? To paraphrase the Tag Team, we decided to go upside-down and inside-out and show you folks what it's all about. We tracked down half the Tag Team, the rapper DC the Brain Supreme who also goes by the name Cecil Glenn. He first heard of the Obama video rumor on Saturday, and has since received calls from New York magazine and Inside Edition. ""This is like an episode of South Park,"" Glenn said. ""You can't pay for that kind of publicity.""Glenn recounted the taping of the video in Atlanta, saying he gathered extras through word of mouth. A friend also put out an open invitation on a local radio station. The video was filmed at an Atlanta fairground. Glenn said he doesn't think the man in the video is Obama. ""It doesn't add up. It's hard to say he was in Atlanta and said, 'Ooh, I want to be in the Whoomp! (There It Is) video.' ""But, Glenn said, ""I can't be for sure because that was a real big video shoot and thousands of people showed up."" Tag Team's label, DM Records in Miami Beach, said no one on staff could recall the name of the extra who showed up for the video shoot nearly two decades ago. President Mark Watson said he had seen the debated image on YouTube and could confirm its authenticity. ""It doesn't look like it has been tampered with,"" he said. We tried to pin down Obama's whereabouts during the June 1993 video shoot. We didn't have a detailed calendar, but the timing didn't mesh with Obama's biography. In June 1993, Obama, a recent law school graduate, was working at Miner, Barnhill and Galland in Chicago, said Judd Miner, a firm partner. Miner didn't recall Obama, then 31, taking time off to travel to Atlanta that month.""I've never heard of this before,"" Miner said.Miner also couldn't link the earring-clad man in the video to the young lawyer that served for years at his firm. ""Barack never had an earring."" Finally, the White House put the issue to rest. Spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield declared the rumors untrue.  ""It is not him,"" she said.So alas, that's not the leader of the free world with the wayfarers and the three-pound cell phone. But we've got the meter shakin'!

"['Agriculture', 'Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'George LeMieux']","
George LeMieux says USDA is employs 1 person for every 30 farmers
","U.S. Sen. George LeMieux's crusade against the national debt has become the hallmark of his short stint in Congress.The Florida Republican, appointed in August 2009 to fill Mel Martinez's seat, has been touting a plan to roll back and then cap federal spending levels. LeMieux says returning federal spending to 2007 levels could cut the now $13 trillion national debt in half by 2020.PolitiFact Florida previously rated LeMieux's claim that his plan would halve the national debt True, but we wondered loudly at the time how the government could make the massive, necessary spending cuts.In a meeting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board on June 4, 2010, LeMieux presented some ideas and gave us more numbers to crunch.LeMieux said no program could be shielded from potential cuts, whether it be an across-the-board 10 percent cut in every federal agency, or raising the Social Security retirement age, or making higher-income seniors pay more for Medicare services.When pressed further, LeMieux singled out the U.S. Department of Agriculture.""There's more than 100,000 people working at the Department of Agriculture,"" LeMieux said. ""That's 1 employee for every 30 farmers.""In his mind, that's clearly too many. ""Fiscal responsibility is nothing but background music in Washington,"" LeMieux added.We wanted to check LeMieux's statistics about the number of USDA employees and the ratio between employees and farmers.USDA press secretary Caleb Weaver said the agency currently employs 105,000 people scattered across the country and in dozens of countries across the world. Weaver said the number varies slightly because many of the workers are seasonal, particularly those that work for the Forest Service, which is a branch of the USDA. We'll note immediately that there are lots of things the USDA does that wouldn't traditionally be considered in support of farmers. Dale Moore, who served as chief of staff to the Secretary of Agriculture during President George W. Bush's two terms, gave us the lay of the land. (Employment figures come from USDA budget documents.)The primary group that deals with farmers is called the Farm Service Agency, which employs a little over 5,000 people and has regional offices all over the country. Besides that, the USDA is made up of more than a dozen other agencies and work groups. Among them: ""The USDA I would say is the most diverse federal department in terms of the scope of what it does,"" said Moore, who now works for Policy Directions, a Washington lobbying firm.Getting back to LeMieux's claim, the number of USDA employees is one-half of his equation. The other is the number of farmers, tracked by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2008, farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers held more than 1.2 million jobs, according to the BLS. Nearly 80 percent are self-employed farmers and ranchers. LeMieux's office provided PolitiFact Florida with a different figure from the USDA’s Economic Research Service. According to them, the number of farmers is more than 2.6 million. The numbers were so different we contacted Steve Crutchfield, the assistant administrator at USDA Economic Research Service for an explanation. Crutchfield said the 2.6 million figure comes from a 2008 Department of Commerce economic analysis measuring farm employment -- which is defined as ""the number of workers engaged in the direct production of agricultural commodities, either livestock or crops; whether as a sole proprietor, partner, or hired laborer."" The same Department of Commerce study lists “Farm Proprietor’s Employment” as 1.9 million. That number counts ""non-corporate farm operators, consisting of sole proprietors and partners."" Crutchfield says there are a number of different ways to calculate the number of farmers, based on whether you're including hired laborers or hobby farmers or people who farm but have a different primary source of income. That makes creating a proper ratio of USDA employees (a number that varies depending on budget years and the seasonal workforce) to farmers (a number that varies based on how you define a farmer) difficult. Watch: Using 105,000 total USDA employees and the BLS figure of 1.2 million farmers and farm workers -- you get a ratio of 1 employee for every 11.4 farmers.If you exclude Forest Service employees (who have very little to do with farming) in the same calculation, there remains 1 USDA employee for every 17.6 farmers.But if you count just the Farm Service Agency, the main agency that works with farmers, the ratio becomes 1 Farm Service Agency employee for every 235 farmers under the BLS numbers or 1 employee for every 510 farmers under using the Department of Commerce figure LeMieux cited or 1 employee for every 373 farmers using the other Commerce figure Crutchfield provided. If you use LeMieux's 2.6 million figure and count all USDA employees, the ratio is about 1 employee for every 25 farmers. We're not sure any of these ways is a valid ratio. ""The senator’s point is to highlight the growth of employment at government agencies even in light of declining areas of responsibility."" LeMieux spokesman Ken Lundberg said. ""According to the USDA, the number of farms in the U.S. in 1935 was 7 million. That number has since declined to estimates around 2 million (depending on how a farm is identified). Anecdotally, the senator is informed that a similar shift in employment of those in charge of agricultural-related roles at USDA has not seen a similar reduction."" In pushing for cuts to federal government spending, LeMieux singled out the U.S. Department of Agriculture, noting that the agency has more than 100,000 employees and 1 employee for every 30 farmers in America. The USDA currently employees about 105,000 people but that actually translates to 1 employee for every 11 or so farmers based on one calculation, not 1 in 30. That's strike one (though we should note that the correct ratio better makes LeMieux's point).But our point is that you should give that ratio little thought, because it appears to rely on an oversimplification of the USDA's mission. The USDA does a lot more than just deal with farmers, from managing the national forest system, to overseeing the school lunch and food stamp programs, to inspecting meat and poultry products heading to the grocery store. That's enough of playing with the numbers in our mind to warrant a rating of Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/08/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-says-usda-employs-1-person-every-30/
"['National', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'This Week - ABC News', 'John Kerry']","
Sen. Kerry says every legitimate study concludes his cap-and-trade bill would create jobs
","The latest version of cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging a shift to more sustainable energy sources was unveiled by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on May 12, 2010. It's called the American Power Act.

One of the biggest knocks on the bill from conservative opponents is that the bill would be a job killer.

Sen. Kerry addressed that claim on ABC's ''This Week'' on June 6, 2010:

""Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon.""

Kerry accurately cited the findings of the May 20, 2010, analysis of the American Power Act's job impact by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.

According to the report, ""The American Power Act prompts $41.1 billion in annual electricity sector investment between 2011 and 2030, $22.5 billion more than under business as usual. Given that the United States is currently below full employment with most economists projecting a slow labor market recovery, this investment is more stimulative than inflationary in the first decade, resulting in an average annual increase in U.S. employment of 203,000 jobs above business as usual, with the net of the jobs lost in fossil fuel production and as a result of higher energy prices between 2001 and 2020. In the second decade of the program, higher energy and product prices offset the employment gains from new investment.""

But was Kerry right that every other major study done by a legitimate group came to the same conclusion that the bill would create hundreds of thousands of jobs?

First of all, we couldn't find any other studies that specifically analyzed the employment impact of the American Power Act. It was only introduced less than a month ago. Several economic groups have studies underway, but the Peterson Institute appears to have reached the clubhouse first.

But there are plenty of economic studies of generic cap-and-trade plans, as well as ones that specifically analyzed the version passed by the House last year. And some of their conclusions about job impact contradict the findings of the the Peterson Institute.

In fact, on May 5, 2010, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on how policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could affect employment. The CBO's analysis of research ""concluded that total employment during the next few decades would be slightly lower than would be the case in the absence of such policies. In particular, job losses in the industries that shrink would lower employment more than job gains in other industries would increase employment, thereby raising the overall unemployment rate.""

CBO reached its conclusion based primarily on the review of three economic modeling studies, by analysts at Resources for the Future (RFF), the Brookings Institution and the consulting firm CRA International.

The CBO ""basically found that most of the studies found there's likely to be a small decrease in employment levels, relative to not doing anything, with the cap-and-trade policy,"" said Adele Morris, policy director of Climate and Energy Economics at the Brookings Institution. They aren't the only ones. Last year, for example, the Marshall Institute produced a report that found ""estimates of job losses (due to cap-and-trade legislation) range from hundreds of thousands to millions."" Said Morris: ""It is certainly not the case that every major study done by a legitimate group found that there would be hundreds of thousands of jobs created. I would like to consider Brookings to be a legitimate group.""

The primary difference for the disparate findings, said Trevor Houser, who led the Peterson study, is that the Peterson study specifically evaluated the effect of the American Power Act, while the reports in the CBO did not. The Peterson report also assessed the bill given the real-time reality of a U.S. economy with unemployment near 10 percent and economists predicting a slow recovery. The reports cited by CBO are ""full employment"" models designed to assess the long-term impact (30 to 50 years), Houser said.

Whitney Smith, press secretary for Kerry, also stressed that the three studies cited in the CBO report were not about Kerry's American Power Act specifically. And Smith cited a Peterson Institute response to the CBO study, which argues that the ""methodological approach of the studies included in the CBO report arguably overstates potential job losses.""

So what other reports was Kerry referring to when he said ""every major study that has been done by a legitimate group, most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics...""?

According to Smith, Kerry was also referencing a report from Third Way, which describes itself as a ""moderate think-tank of the progressive movement."" The report concluded that job losses in ""old industries"" will be more than offset by an increase in clean energy jobs so that ""that carbon pricing will result in net job growth"" of somewhere between 118,000 to 1.1 million jobs.

But the Third Way report isn't a study of the American Power Act either. It's a review of two dozen studies over the last three years of various plans to put a price on carbon. Third Way rejected reports from the ideological left and right and considered just those ""in the middle.""

While the Third Way review did not specifically address the American Power Act, there is nothing in this latest cap-and-trade bill that would make it differ much with regard to the projections about the broad impact on the economy and the number of jobs gained, said Josh Freed, director of the Third Way Clean Energy Program.

If Kerry is going to hang his hat on the fact that none of the other studies (such as those cited in the CBO report) looked at the American Power Act specifically, then we are really only talking about one study, the Peterson Institute study. We aren't aware of any others. Neither are the folks at the Peterson Institute. And the Third Way study cited by the Kerry spokesman isn't an analysis of the American Power Act either.

So the question then is whether the American Power Act is so different from past versions of the cap-and-trade bill, or the generic versions modeled by various economists, that it would render their conclusions irrelevant in analyzing the American Power Act. And many economists we spoke to said that's not the case, that the earlier versions are substantially similar to Kerry's, especially for the purpose of analyzing the bills' jobs impact. And the fact that Kerry's spokesman included the Third Way study suggests they think it's fair game to consider older versions of cap-and-trade legislation for comparative purposes as well.

Economists at the Peterson Institute, the Brookings Institution -- or for that matter at, say, the conservative Heritage Foundation, which projected a cap-and-trade bill could cost millions of jobs -- certainly disagree about each others' methodology. Various economic models employ different assumptions about everything from the viability of doubling the number of nuclear power plants to the prospects for the economy. They all look at different timelines. You may agree or disagree with the findings and methodology of the Peterson Institute study, but the fact is that other ""legitimate groups"" have performed studies and reached different conclusions.

Kerry's statement suggests there is some unanimity of opinion among legitimate organizations about cap-and-trade's effect on jobs. And that's just not so. There is quite a bit of disagreement. So we rate Kerry's claim False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/08/john-kerry/sen-kerry-says-cap-and-trade-bill-would-create-job/

Baker says test scores show Georgia failing students
","When you're a candidate for governor from a party out of power, you look for the ruling party's weak spots.So when Democrat Thurbert Baker recently made his kickoff speech for his run for governor, he mentioned a litany of problems in the state, including Georgia's low educational ranking.""Now, we may be No. 1 in bank failures, but our school test scores are right at the bottom,"" Baker said. ""This isn't the fault of our teachers or our students. It's the fault of our leaders who talk a good game about education but do nothing. In fact, they do worse than nothing. Whenever the politicians go looking for money to fund their pet projects, guess where they get it? They cut education!""In his speech, the outgoing attorney general gave us plenty of red meat to chew on. We decided to take a look into his claim about school test scores. Is Georgia ""right at the bottom""?Baker campaign official Edward Chapman was happy to tell us where his boss came up with that statement: an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article last year reporting how Georgia's students fared on the SAT.""Georgia finished ahead of only South Carolina, Hawaii, Maine and the District of Columbia,"" the Aug. 30, 2009, article reported. (That may not be something to boast about, but Georgia's students ranked last in the nation in 2004, so they've improved.)So, with the caveat that educators often warn against state comparisons because of wide variations in the types of students who take the tests, yes, the SAT alone indicates Georgia is close to the bottom. But we decided to look at scores on another college admission test -- the ACT. (There's a caveat with this one, too, because a smaller percentage of Georgia students take it than in many other states.)Georgia fared better here. It ranked ahead of 10 states and the District of Columbia in the average ACT composite score. Another element of the ACT measures the percentage of students who passed its benchmark scores in English, math, reading and science. On this one, Georgia finished 38th, ahead of 13 others states, and just below students in the District of Columbia.Baker campaign officials still contend their candidate's statement is true because more Georgia students take the SAT as opposed to the ACT. ""We have always been at or very near the bottom among the states,"" Chapman said.So overall, Georgia's test scores on the two main college entrance exams paint different pictures. On the SAT, the state ranked 47th. But on the ACT, the state was 38th or 40th. So it's not, as Baker said, ""right at the bottom.""

"['Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says Democrat Bill White sent President-elect Obama a message on selling cap and trade
","On May 19 in Houston, Rick Perry revisited his objection to proposals to cap carbon emissions nationally, saying such a change would devastate the energy sector and the Texas economy, according to an online write-up by The Houston Chronicle.

Referring to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, Perry said: ""My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.'""

To date, there’s no evidence of White supporting the ""cap-and-trade"" scheme. So his advising the Democratic president-elect on how to sell the idea amounts to rich campaign fodder for Perry.

Does Perry recap White's message to Obama accurately?

Some background: Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available to industry. Companies can trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they’re allowed. The House passed a bill last year to start such a system, but the legislation has not advanced through the Senate.

To our request for elaboration, Perry’s campaign pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2008 e-mail sent by White, then mayor of Houston, to Rahm Emanuel, who was slotted to become Obama’s chief of staff. The eight-paragraph e-mail, later noted by Perry's campaign in blog posts and an online video advertisement, surfaced on a Chronicle blog on May 18, 2010. White's campaign confirmed the e-mail's authenticity.

Several times, White’s message to Emanuel, under the subject line ""Energy Policy at the Beginning of an Administration,"" refers to the cap-and-trade possibility. Each mention advises against an early push.

White’s e-mail says Obama should focus on ""several high-impact objectives during his first year to make steady progress to meet energy policy goals while also stimulating the economy. But he should not try to do something ‘comprehensive’ on domestic carbon emissions until these tools are in place.""

Later, the e-mail says: ""Avoid during 2009 wading into the mire of cap-and-trade or user taxes on carbon before the new Administration and Congress has made progress"" on White’s energy-related recommendations.

White’s e-mail says: ""A carbon-based tax or sales (scheme) could be characterized as intrusive government increasing costs or simply another scheme to extract money from the public unless there is a clear ‘path forward’ on (a) transportation fuel efficiency; (b) efficiency of electrical power use; and (c) affordable clean power alternatives.""

The message continues: ""The public can understand why we need to lower energy costs, reduce emissions, and cut imports. We can accomplish that goal while reducing carbon emissions. But do not allow the concept of reducing carbon emissions to drive this process. Lowering energy bills with clean domestic energy is a much better approach.""

White’s recommended to-do’s? His e-mail says Obama should accelerate the use of vehicles that use 40 miles per gallon or more. More advice: fund a program to retrofit 1 million homes and apartments occupied by low-income residents. And, he writes, Obama should encourage new power plants to use cleaner-than-coal natural gas, among steps.

White’s campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, said White referred to the cap-and-trade prospect because the idea was debated during the 2008 election year. In his campaign, Obama committed to creating a cap-and-trade system — a promise that PolitiFact has lately rated ""in the works."" Next, we contacted an Austin advertising firm to get another take on whether White's e-mail reads like advice on how to sell cap and trade, as Perry puts it. Patrick Cline, a partner at JH&A Advertising, credited White's message with couching in step with an understanding that a cap-and-trade plan could wreak havoc with the state's petrochemical plants. But, Cline said, White's note stops short of being a primer on selling cap and trade to the American people. Our conclusion: White's e-mail is not close to the ""how-to"" guide Perry claims. Indeed, White's message urges the incoming administration not to push a carbon emissions proposal until after it has advanced other energy-related ideas. Nowhere does the e-mail offer guidance on pitching cap and trade. Perry floats a politically potent but inaccurate, ridiculous characterization.

White says Perry fast-tracked unncessary coal-fired power plants until a judge stopped him
","
Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor, recently blasted his opponent's environmental record, saying in a May 17 press release: ""Rick Perry attempted to fast-track unnecessary coal-fired power plants, which degrade air quality and would cost billions. Fortunately, a court stopped him."" 
We wondered if White's salvo is on target. 
Some history: Perry issued his so-called fast-tracking order Oct. 27, 2005, ""to encourage diversity of energy supply."" The order told the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which is responsible for judging requests for permits to pollute the air, to ""prioritize and expedite the processing of environmental permit applications that are protective of the public health and environment and propose to use Texas' natural resources to generate electrical power."" 
The order, issued as natural gas prices climbed and after Hurricane Katrina disrupted natural gas production, shortened administrative hearings on permits, which normally took about a year, to six months. At the time, Perry said he was hoping to spare electricity consumers from rate shocks due to the surging price of natural gas. 
A few months later, TXU Corp., a Dallas-based energy company, announced plans to double its power production by building eight coal-fired units. Company executives were joined by Perry at their April 2006 press conference, according to the Dallas Morning News. The company, which had submitted a permit application for two new coal-units in July 2005 and had plans to build another unit permitted by the state in 2003, said it would cost $10 billion to complete all 11 units. TXU also promised to cut emissions of pollutants including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide and mercury by 20 percent, saying it would spend $500 million on equipment to control pollution at three of its existing coal-fired units in Texas. 
In a Sept. 8, 2006, press release, Perry defended his order and TXU's proposal, saying ""the TXU plants are important to diversifying our energy supply so Texans do not face rate shock every time natural gas prices spike up."" 
TXU was then the state's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, one of several greenhouse gases widely thought to be fueling global warming. The utility acknowledged the proposed plants would emit 78 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, in addition to the 55 million tons per year company plants were already emitting, according to the Morning News. 
Where was White as Perry aligned with TXU? As Houston's mayor, White opposed the eight proposed units as a member of the Texas Cities for Clean Air Coalition, which was formed by then-Dallas Mayor Laura Miller in August 2006 to challenge coal-fired power plant pollution. In September 2006, the Houston Chronicle quoted White saying: ""We need to make sure that power plants built for today have minimal emissions and contributions to global warming, the greenhouse gases, where we will see increasing regulation in this country, and in other countries, in the future."" 
TXU and anti-coal groups faced off for and against the proposed plants, while four groups consisting of people living near proposed plant sites sued Perry, calling his executive order unconstitutional. And in February 2007, a state district judge blocked it, saying Perry overstepped his constitutional authority in ""directing a hearing officer to hold a hearing and reach a decision by a particular deadline."" The judge issued an injunction that restored power to administrative law judges to delay a hearing on TXU's permit application. The judges then postponed the hearing until June of that year. 
Next came a big twist. In the following months, TXU was bought out by private owners, who quickly withdrew requests for permits to build eight of the 11 coal-fired units. In June 2007, the commission granted a permit for the two surviving units, going against an administrative judge's recommendation that the agency reconsider its approval after TXU failed to prove that technology to be used at the plant would effectively control emissions. 
Of late, Texas utilities — not including Luminant (formerly TXU) — are seeking permits for five more proposed coal-fired and petroleum coke-fired plants. 
So, Perry issued his speed-up order, which was canceled by a judge, as White says. Also as he says, the 11 coal-fired power units that TXU wanted to construct were expected to cost billions. 
Finally, let's circle back to White's contention that the plants were unnecessary. That's debatable. 
In 2006, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the power grid that serves most of Texas, forecast that the state needed fuel diversity to offset its dependence on natural gas, and new sources of energy to keep up with electricity demand — a tenet of Perry's 2005 order. 
However, anti-coal opponents who led the lawsuit against Perry's order argue that even if the state needed to generate more electricity, it should have come from cleaner energy sources such as wind power. Nathan Melson, president of Citizens Organizing for Resources and Environment, a nonprofit that organized in 2006 against TXU's proposed coal-fired plant in Savoy (about 70 miles north of Dallas), and one of the groups that sued Perry said: ""We've all got to have electricity and we all have to live, but we ought to be looking at other technology out there."" 
Another indicator: Whether electricity demand would have been met without the requested plants. Generally, ERCOT says, a reserve margin of at least 12.5 percent above the state's peak electricity demand is necessary to spare Texas customers frequent power outages. 
Theresa Gage, an ERCOT representative, told us she didn't know of any instance when ERCOT has operated below the reserve margin. ""However, in 2006, projections showed that by 2009, with no new generation brought online... ERCOT would drop below the 12.5 percent margin,"" she said. ""The 11 TXU plants — the three that were built and the eight that were not — would all have contributed to pushing the reserve margin to and above 12.5 percent."" 
In the meantime, other power sources have filled the gap. Some 127 units have come online since 2006, adding 14,494 megawatts of power to the state's grid. About half of the added capacity is coming from wind energy, which generates 7,318 megawatts of power, trailed by gas (4,251 megawatts) and coal (2,913 megawatts). 
""We're where we need to be,"" Gage said. And On White's campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon said that because Texas has generation capacity greatly exceeding ERCOT's recommended reserve margin, the state never needed the eight plants contemplated by TXU. 
In contrast, Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, said that ""construction of some of those (TXU-sought) plants is precisely why we're not looking at power shortages today."" The three TXU coal-fired units that ended up getting built provide a combined 2,141 megawatts of power, according to ERCOT. ""If you remove them from the calculation, then we are below the 12.5 percent margin starting in 2013, and below the 10 percent margin by 2015,"" Frazier said, citing ERCOT's projections. 
Unsaid: One of those units Frazier referenced had a permit two years before Perry issued his order and TXU had already applied for permits for the other two. His order didn't affect the first plant, but the other two stood to benefit from the expedited process, according to the TCEQ. 
Where does all this leave White's statement? 
Perry tried to speed up the environmental-permitting process for utilities and his order was later blocked by a court. Also, those plants would have cost billions. 
Whether the plants were unnecessary, as White puts it, depends on whose argument rings your bell. White is right in that plants fueled by other sources helped satisfy the state's electricity needs. Yet he's wrong if the few coal-fired plants that were completed helped Texas avoid a demand crisis. We're calling it a draw. 
The standoff on the question of necessity leaves White's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/07/bill-white/white-says-perry-fast-tracked-unncessary-coal-fire/

Fanelli's video suggests 'Obamacare' will cut off treatment for elderly
","Dan Fanelli, a retired airline captain and Republican running against U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who represents the Orlando, Fla., area, has a catchy video on his website related to the health care bill dubbed ""Obamacare.""Set in a doctor's office with somber orchestral music as the backdrop, a sympathetic doctor rolls up his chair to talk to an elderly white-haired man in a patient's gown. ""I'm sorry. I've tried everything,"" the doctor says.""But doctor, I've already waited over six months,'' says the patient. ""I can't bear this any longer.""""It's not that it's ...,"" the kind doctor hesitates, placing his hand on the patient's shoulder. ""They denied you because you passed the age limit for the treatment.""The depressed old man's gaze averts downward -- perhaps a hint that he realizes he will die?Will the new health care bill approved by Congress translate to denying treatment to sweet old men like the one featured in the video? Will somber-faced doctors be telling grandpa that he is too old for treatment? We had to check this out. First we contacted Fanelli, who said he posted the video on his website in late March. We asked if he could point us to any documentation -- such as a section of the bill, a position paper from an organization -- to support his conclusion about age limits. The simple answer: no.""You are asking for substantiation. I can't go to a page in the bill but what I can tell you is the country is over $13 trillion in debt. ... The medical program increases the number of recipients substantially. When you increase the number dramatically ... where is the money going to come from? It is obvious it's going to have to be only certain people are going to get certain coverages. ... The commercial is to show what is going on in other countries with socialized medicine. You can't add more services when you don't have enough money to pay the government bills currently, and that's what we've done.""Fanelli said he has his own family experience to draw his conclusions. ""My aunt lives in France and had been denied for a procedure,"" to get a pacemaker, he said. ""The reason she was denied was because she was too old. Common sense tells me when you increase the number of people covered, and you don't have enough money to go around ... there's eventually going to come to point where we say what can we afford, what we can't afford."" Ultimately his French aunt was able to get the procedure, according to Fanelli.Fanelli said the video ""is a metaphor for what is used in England where they use age to determine what services people are going to get.""Our friends at FactCheck.org researched a question about age limits and health care in England in July 2009. The article quoted a nonprofit in England, Age Concern and Help the Aged, that ageism does occur -- for example a doctor refusing to refer an elderly patient to a consultant. But the nonprofit also stated that a national organization was created to improve health care for the elderly and one of its standards was ""rooting out age discrimination.""Steve Ullmann, professor and director of Programs in Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami, said ""there is some limitation in provisions of care of people based on age in England,"" for certain treatments though ""you can buy them out of pocket outside of the National Health Service.""Back to health care in the United States. We asked specifically if Fanelli had found an age-limit in the health care bill.""I have tried to look at that bill and it's a masterful mess,'' said the 54-year-old retired airline captain and Navy reserves retiree. When we asked about whether Fanelli had read about an age cutoff in news articles, he replied: ""I have been at lectures."" He heard one from a brain surgeon. ""I don't remember the name. I wasn't anticipating getting a phone interview on this."" We contacted him again the next day to clarify if he had read any news articles about an age limit and he said: ""There are various articles. I can't quote verse, page and date. ... We arrived at the claim because there is not enough money generated in tax revenue to pay for the current expenses for the U.S. government and this is going to be an additional expense.""Among Fanelli's claimed sources is his wife's dermatologist, Dr. John Meisenheimer of Orlando. He said the doctor saved his wife's life when she had skin cancer. Meisenheimer also is the doctor starring in Fanelli's video.""Meisenheimer has discussed they are going to be picking and choosing,"" Fanelli said. ""It is generally accepted by medical health professionals there will only be limited amount of money. Most people believe it will be younger people as opposed to older people.""We called Meisenheimer, a board-certified dermatologist for more than 20 years, to get his explanation of the video.""The ad is a metaphor for ageism,"" Meisenheimer said. ""This isn't about 'death panels.' Death panels do not exist.""(PolitiFact agrees with Meisenheimer about death panels. That was a claim made by Sarah Palin in August 2009 that we rated Pants on Fire.)But the health care bill makes cuts to Medicare, he said, and that will lead to less care for the elderly.""It can be a very slippery slope. It's not going to happen like in the commercial,'' said Meisenheimer, whose office website states that he accepts Medicare patients. ""Doctors will have to make a decision: where is the best use of money? Do I use it for a 95-year-old who has skin cancer or for somebody younger? ... There is not enough money there in the can for everybody."" The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Medicare provisions are estimated to result in a net reduction of $428 billion between 2010 and 2019. It also states that the bill supports ""comparative effectiveness research"" to compare the clinical effectiveness of treatments, but that the findings ""may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage."" So that seems to say that even if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, that can't be used to create an age limit for that treatment.We also contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicare. Spokesman Peter Ashkenaz told us in an e-mail that there are no age limits for treatment under Medicare.""There are no eligibility changes to Medicare in the new law,"" he wrote.Fanelli said his video hasn't aired on television, though it's on his campaign website and on YouTube. We sent links to Fanelli's video to experts on the health care bill: Ullmann at the University of Miami; Alwyn Cassil, director of public affairs for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research organization; and Len Nichols, Director for the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University. All three said there is nothing in the bill that would cut off treatment based on an age limit.The video ""has no basis in reality whatsoever,"" Cassil said. ""There is nothing in that bill that I am aware of, or certainly every reporter who has combed every inch of it that mentions anything about 'age limits.' '' So to recap, Fanelli's ad offers a dramatic scene that has no solid facts behind it. He claims it portrays ""Obamacare,"" but he cannot cite any provisions in the health care bill -- other than vague fear of a European system -- that could cause such a tragic scene. He referred us to his wife's dermatologist -- who also happens to be the star of the commercial -- but the dermatologist did not produce any conclusive evidence, either. So the ad has lots of melodrama but no facts. We find the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2010/jun/07/dan-fanelli/fanellis-video-suggests-obamacare-will-cut-treatme/

Kerry says U.S. imports more oil now than before 9/11
","During a June 6, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week, Sen. John Kerry -- who is sponsoring a comprehensive energy bill -- discussed the nation's energy future against the backdrop of the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.During an interview with host Jake Tapper, Kerry said, ""Here's what's important -- not to be throwing the blame around, but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil. ... The United States is losing a major economic transformational moment. Until we begin to do something -- you know, since 9/11, we now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11. It's insulting to common sense.""We decided to check whether Kerry was correct about whether the United States imports more oil today than it did before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The answer is complicated, because there are at least three possible ways to measure it.• The number of barrels of crude oil imported. The U.S. imported 3.32 billion barrels of crude oil in 2000 and 3.40 billion barrels in 2001. Both figures were higher than the number imported in 2009 -- 3.31 billion barrels. By this measure, Kerry is incorrect, although just slightly. • Imported crude oil compared to domestic production. We wondered whether imported crude oil was still increasing as a percentage of all oil in the U.S., even as it dropped in absolute amounts. In fact, that's exactly what happened.In 2000, oil imports accounted for 61 percent of the total of imports and domestic production, and in 2001, imports accounted for 62 percent. In 2009, the percentage of imports was 63 percent -- slightly higher than it was in either of those years. The underlying cause was that domestic oil production declined between the start of the decade and the end.By this measure, Kerry is correct, though once again, the difference is modest.• Imported crude oil plus imported unfinished oils. William Brown, who analyzes energy data for the federal government's Energy Information Administration, told PolitiFact that in recent years, there's been a rise in imports of unfinished oils, which are partially refined, taking the place of pure crude oil imports. So he sent us data that combined those two sets of imports.In 2000, the combination of crude oil and unfinished oils accounted for 9.54 million barrels per day, and in 2001, they accounted for 9.71 million barrels per day. In 2009, that figure was 9.86 million barrels per day.Adding in unfinished oils to the previous measure of crude oil turns an incorrect statement into a correct one.Bottom line: There are three ways to analyze the question, and with two of them, Kerry is right that imports have grown. Using the other statistic, he's wrong -- imports have declined. So we rate Kerry's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/07/john-kerry/kerry-says-us-imports-more-oil-now-911/

Rail opponent claims penny tax for commuter rail would give Hillsborough state's highest sales tax
","Hillsborough County commissioners last month approved a November ballot issue asking voters if they support raising the county's sales tax by a penny. The proceeds would pay for a new commuter rail system, expanded bus service and roadwork. Critics have attacked the proposal with a variety of arguments. One of the early and persistent assertions is that the increase would give Hillsborough County the highest sales tax rate in the state. Rail and tax opponent David Caton was among the first to make this claim, which has frequently been repeated in debates and forums in the months since. In a Nov. 5, 2009, e-mail, he outlined some concerns about the proposal. Caton is executive director of the Florida Family Association, a group that fights against pornography and gay rights and addresses other social concerns. ""This tax increase will have harmful economic consequences which include: •   ""Taking more money away from struggling families. •   ""Taking on average $250 MILLION each year away from consumer spending, thereby exacerbating unemployment in Hillsborough County. •   ""Giving Hillsborough County the highest sales tax of all Florida counties. Our rate will be 8 percent, compared with the 6.83 percent average of all other Florida counties."" We wondered, could a county commission whose members regularly tout their fiscal conservatism really be allowing a vote that could give Hills­borough a highest-tax distinction? First, a primer: The state levies a 6 percent sales tax on purchases of goods and services, with exceptions for certain groceries and many other specified items and services. The rate has remained the same since 1988. On top of that, state government allows counties and school districts to charge additional sales taxes. There are a variety of these discretionary sales taxes, with state law specifying how each type of tax can be spent, and capping how much each tax can be raised for each purpose. And not all counties are allowed to charge the same types of local sales taxes. Every county can charge up to 1 percent on goods and services to pay for things like roads, jails and schools — building stuff — and 21 counties do so. Most counties are allowed to tack on up to a half-penny to pay for health care for the poor. There are two variations on indigent care taxes, and only five counties, including Hillsborough, use one or the other. There's another sales tax allowance of up to 1 percent for less densely populated counties, an acknowledgement that they typically don't have the industry that boosts property tax revenue. Counties that have charters — generally the larger ones — can add another 1 percent just for transportation needs. So the 70 cents of tax on that $10 wrench at the hardware store in Hillsborough County is, in fact, three separate sales taxes. You just see the bottom line, which in Hillsborough is a 7 percent tax. Hillsborough residents pay 6 cents to the state on each dollar spent. They pay an additional half-cent, known as the community investment tax, which voters approved in 1996, for roads, jails, schools, construction debt on Raymond James Stadium and other building projects. And then they pay another half-penny for indigent health care. If voters approve the transportation tax in November, the overall sales tax rate in Hillsborough County would rise to 8 cents on the dollar. The Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations tracks the various taxes charged by state and local governments. Its latest update of sales tax rates by county was published Dec. 31, not long after Caton put his assertion in writing. It showed that the highest sales tax rate in Florida was 7.5 percent, levied in Calhoun, Escambia, Gadsden, Jackson, Leon, Madison and Monroe counties. Nine counties have the minimum 6 percent, and the statewide average is 6.85 percent. Committee analysts got their numbers from the Florida Department of Revenue, to whom counties are required to report changes. An updated list of aggregate sales taxes by county showed that there were no changes among top sales-tax counties as of May 1. No counties have raised their sales taxes since then, according to the Revenue Department. The Revenue Department isn't required to track prospective sales tax hikes, but its officials are aware of at least six other counties where increases have been discussed this year. In Okeechobee County, the increase would take the sales tax to 8 percent, although those talks are preliminary. Pinellas County officials have been talking about seeking voter support of a 1 cent sales tax increase for transit, but nothing has been decided. That would take its sales tax rate to 8 percent. But PolitiFact has no means of reading the tea leaves on whether the Pinellas or Okeechobee county issues will make the ballot, let alone win voters' approval. And we are ruling now, not in the future. Caton said voter approval of a 1-cent increase would give ""Hills­borough County the highest sales tax of all Florida counties.""
