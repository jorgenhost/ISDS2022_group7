Reince Priebus says Americans pay more in taxes than on groceries, clothing, shelter combined
","
A reader sent us a fundraising e-mail sent to supporters by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus on April 14, 2011, just days before federal taxes were due. In it, Priebus offered a striking statistic.

""The tax hikes President Obama wants will only fuel Washington's addiction to spending rather than help curb it,"" he wrote. ""More importantly, they will hurt one of the strongest engines of growth and job creation in our economy: small businesses. And they will harm middle-class families by taking more money from their pockets at a time when Americans need every dime to cover their expenses. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation, Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on food, clothing and housing combined -- and it's still not enough for Barack Obama.""

The reader wondered whether it was really true that ""Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined."" So we decided to look into it.

Before we checked with the Tax Foundation, the source Priebus cited, we did our own math.

First, we’ll note that no one -- including Priebus -- knows for sure how Americans will allocate their money in 2011, since more than half the year hasn’t happened yet. The best we can do is extrapolate from previous years. Given the data available, the last year for which we can do it accurately is 2009.

We began by measuring expenditures on groceries, clothing and shelter. For this, we turned to statistics collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an office within the U.S. Commerce Department. In a data series known as National Income and Product Accounts, the bureau tracks how Americans spend their income.

For 2009, Americans spent almost $778 billion for food and beverages consumed at home. For clothing, the figure is $322 billion, and for housing, it’s $1.582 trillion. Total expenditures: $2.682 trillion.

For taxes paid, we had to look in two places. The amount of federal taxes paid is included in the historical tables for the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. In 2009, the federal government took in $2.105 trillion in revenues.

As for the states and localities, the Tax Foundation found a total of $1.282 trillion in taxes collected.

Add both of these tax categories together and you get $3.387 trillion in taxes. So in 2009, Americans did indeed pay more in taxes than they did for food, clothing or shelter. By that calculation, Priebus is correct, as is the Tax Foundation, the source of his information. (It would have been closer if Priebus had said ""food"" rather than groceries, since Americans spent an additional $513 billion for food in restaurants. But he didn’t.)

Some economists, however, say this is not the only way to calculate it.

The Tax Foundation calculation shows that the average American pays more for taxes than for food, clothing and shelter. But there are wide variations in what individual Americans pay.

One chart published by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center shows what percentage of income is paid in taxes by Americans of different income levels. There are wide differences.

Households with less than $10,000 in annual income actually get a small amount of money back from the federal government, often through the Earned Income Tax Credit, a refundable federal income tax credit for low to moderate income working individuals and families. For Americans with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, only three-tenths of 1 percent of income goes toward taxes. For those between $20,000 and $30,000, less than 6 percent went to taxes. And for those between $30,000 and $40,000 in income, less than 11 percent is spent on federal taxes.

Now let’s compare that to patterns of spending. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, for taxpayers of all incomes, groceries accounted for about 8 percent of personal consumption expenditures in 2009, while clothing accounted for 3 percent and housing accounted for 16 percent. Combined, that’s 27 percent. Meanwhile, ""Personal consumption expenditures"" accounted for about 89 percent of total personal income. So food, clothing and housing probably account for roughly 25 percent of personal income.

While we couldn’t find these statistics for different income classes, lower-income Americans would probably spend a larger percentage of their incomes on these items, since these are necessities, and they have less overall to spend.

So, for those toward the the bottom of the income scale, the tax burden -- even when adjusted for state and local taxes -- is probably less than 20 percent, while spending on food, clothing and shelter probably accounts for 25 percent or more.

By contrast, the higher you go up the income ladder, the more accurate Priebus’ claim becomes. Those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 pay 20 percent of their income in federal taxes. Between $200,000 and $500,000, it’s 23 percent, and between $500,000 and $1 million, it’s 25 percent. And for those over $1 million, it’s 27 percent. Add in state and local taxes and these percentages climb even higher. Meanwhile, the percentage spent on necessities is probably lower than 25 percent.

So, many people within these upper-income groups do likely pay more in taxes than in food, clothing and shelter.

The difference is that, according to the Tax Policy Center, these upper-income groups account for a smaller share of the population.

Approximately 44 percent of Americans have annual cash incomes at $40,000 or below -- the first category we looked at, in which people likely pay more in food, clothing and shelter than in taxes. By contrast, about 22 percent of Americans have annual cash incomes of at least $100,000, a level at which the tax burden likely outpaces food, clothing and shelter.

So while a substantial minority of Americans probably does pay more for taxes, the numbers suggest that there are more Americans whose food, clothing and shelter expenses exceed their tax burden.

This doesn’t mean that the Tax Foundation calculation is not useful. Kail Padgitt, a staff economist for the Tax Foundation, notes that the study ""is purposefully designed to take an aggregate look at the overall tax burden of the country, not any one individual person."" Among other things, the way the Tax Foundation calculates it is helpful for studying changes in the tax burden over time, and in comparing the United States’ tax burden to that of other countries.

J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls the dispute ""an age-old running battle."" He said ""The Tax Foundation is using averages. The purpose of averages is to summarize information.""

When Priebus says that ""Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined,"" his statement is vague enough to be read either as an aggregate measurement (in which case he’d be correct) or a description of the patterns for individual Americans (in which case he’d likely be wrong more often than he’s right). On balance, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BD4580>],/factchecks/2011/apr/18/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-americans-pay-more-taxes-groce/

Rick Scott cites Virginia drug database failure in congressional testimony
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott appeared before Congress on April 14, 2011, to testify about the state's problem fighting prescription drug abuse and the proliferation of so-called ""pill mills.""

One way Florida is hoping to combat the over-prescribing of pain medications like oxycodone, Scott said, is by implementing a statewide drug database that will track prescriptions that pharmacists fill for patients. The hope is that law enforcement officials can spot doctors who are prescribing too many drugs, or patients who are hopping from doctor to doctor satisfy their fix.

Scott initially opposed the database, saying he was concerned about the privacy rights of law-abiding patients -- and asked the Legislature to repeal a 2009 law that created the computer monitoring program.

But his position put him at odds with leaders in the state Senate, whose support would have been required to nix the database. So the database is moving moving forward.

In his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Scott repeated concerns about the privacy issues in such a system. He then highlighted a story about Virginia's prescription drug database to help make his point.

""As the database implementation moves forward, I must draw your attention to a serious risk that I believe databases like this pose to the privacy of individuals – most of whom are law-abiding individuals,"" Scott said, according to his prepared remarks. ""As you know, in 2009 the Associated Press reported a massive privacy breach when hackers broke into Virginia’s prescription-drug database. They obtained more than 8.2 million patient records and a total of nearly 36 million prescriptions.

""So, while the database in Florida is brought online, I continue working with my legislative partners to find solutions that protect patient privacy."" 
We wanted to know if hackers did indeed break into Virginia's database, and if they obtained 8.2 million patient records.

News of the break-in to the database first appeared on WikiLeaks, a website founded to publish classified, secret and otherwise private government information. On April 30, 2009, the WikiLeaks website reported that the Virginia Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) secure website was hijacked with a $10 million ransom demand. ""In my possession, right now, are 8,257,378 patient records and a total of 35,548,087 prescriptions,"" the hacker wrote on the site. ""For $10 million, I will gladly send along the password … If by the end of 7 days, you decide not to pony up, I'll go ahead and put this baby out on the market and accept the highest bid …""

The FBI acknowledged in a May 5 Associated Press article that it was investigating a breach of the system, and in a subsequent article said that WikiLeaks reported that 8 million patient records and 35 million prescriptions were accessed. The WikiLeaks report contained the ransom note, but did not include the posting of any patient records, said Diane E. Powers, a spokeswoman with the Virginia Department of Health Professions.

The following day, state officials confirmed that someone had hacked into the database. Virginia authorities said they would not pay the ransom.

""They really think they'll get anything out of this?"" said then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine. ""Not a chance.""

The ransom deadline came and went without noticeable incident, according to media accounts.

And most importantly for our check, state officials said it was unclear whether the hackers were able to view patient records, as they had claimed. Powers told PolitiFact Florida that the investigation remains open. No one has been caught in connection with the virtual break-in.

The Virginia Department of Health Professions did send a notification letter to all persons whose prescription records in the database contained a nine-digit number that could have been a Social Security number.

None of the database information was lost, Powers said, and the PMP continues to operate.

So a hacker did break into the database and posted a ransom note claiming to have obtained the records Scott referenced. But it's not clear whether the hacker really obtained access to the records. We rate Scott's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097006980>],/factchecks/2011/apr/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-cites-virginia-drug-database-failure-co/

Rev. Jesse Jackson says Milwaukee is the most segregated city in America
","
The legislative offensive launched by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker against public employee unions has galvanized national debate for months. Perhaps no national figure has engaged the controversy as consistently as the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Jackson and staff from his Chicago-based Rainbow PUSH Coalition have traveled to  Madison, Milwaukee and out-state Wisconsin to attend demonstrations and register voters.

On April 4, 2011, Jackson appeared on MSNBC-TV’s ""The Ed Show"" via satellite from Madison, where he was attending a workers rally held on the 43rd anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination.

In 1968, Jackson was with King, supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn., when King was killed.

In his interview with host Ed Schultz, Jackson said he supported collective bargaining powers for workers. Then, reiterating that he was in Wisconsin, he called Milwaukee ""the most segregated city in America.""

It was unclear why Jackson linked collective bargaining to segregation, but he repeated his claim about Milwaukee the next day on WMCS-AM (1290), which serves Milwaukee’s African-American community. And he repeated it the following day, in a news release cheering the election of liberal philanthropist Chris Abele to Walker’s former post as Milwaukee County executive.

Milwaukee as long been considered one of the nation’s segregated cities. But we wanted to know if Jackson’s claim, that Milwaukee is the most segregated, is true.

In repeating his statement to Milwaukee radio host Eric Von, Jackson cited data he said had been released the previous week. A Rainbow PUSH spokeswoman told us Jackson was referring to an article that was posted on the Chicago Tribune website on April 1, 2011.

The article was actually text from a story that aired the same day on WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee. The TV story mentioned new census data, but it actually relied on an article from Salon.com, a news and entertainment website.

Salon reported March 29, 2011, on segregation rankings made four days earlier by William Frey and John DeWitt of the University of Michigan’s Social Science Data Analysis Network, which analyzes census data, and the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal Washington, D.C. think tank.

The rankings used 2010 census data and a ""dissimilarity index"" for 102 metropolitan areas with a population of over 500,000.

Let’s pause here to be clear on what part of the Frey-DeWitt study that Jackson used in making his claim. 
The Milwaukee metropolitan area scored 81.5 in the Frey-DeWitt study. In other words, 81.5 percent of black residents in metro Milwaukee would have to move to other parts of the metro area in order to achieve ""complete integration.""

That score ranked Milwaukee No. 1 on the black-white segregation list.

The New York metro area was second at 78 and metro Chicago, which includes the Kenosha area in Wisconsin’s southeastern corner, ranked third at 76.4.

So, in using Frey’s definition of segregation, Jackson was correct in saying that Milwaukee ranked as the most segregated -- except the Frey rankings are not for all cities, but rather large metro areas.

What we’re testing, however, is not whether Jackson accurately quoted a study, but whether his statement is accurate -- that segregation is highest in Milwaukee.

So, let’s examine some other recent segregation rankings.

Another March 2011 study of 2010 census data, done by John Logan of Brown University and Brian Stults of Florida State University, also used a dissimilarity index. It found that the Milwaukee metro area tied for first with Detroit in black-white segregation.

Another Frey study using the dissimilarity index, done in December 2010 with 2005-2009 census data, put metro Milwaukee No. 1 in black-white segregation rankings.

So, in three studies from December 2010 through March 2011, Milwaukee ranked first in black-white segregation twice and tied for first once.

The dissimilarity index -- sometimes called the segregation index -- is also used by Harvard University’s DiversityData project, the Mumford Center at State University of New York-Albany and other universities.

It is the most common measure of racial segregation, said Frey, although he acknowledged it has its limitations and its critics.

Two critics, John Pawasarat and Lois Quinn, happen to be senior scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

Pawasarat and Quinn first took aim at the dissimilarity index in a 2003 research paper, published shortly after the Milwaukee metro area was ranked the third most segregated in the United States. They acknowledged that researchers have repeatedly used the dissimilarity index since it was popularized by two University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers in 1965.

The Pawasarat-Quinn paper argued that the index ""seeks an even distribution of the black population in the metro area as the ideal condition."" They wrote:

""For example, if the black population in a metro area makes up 10 percent of the combined black and white populations, the goal of the segregation index would be to have each census tract with a 90 percent white and 10 percent black population out of the combined black-white total. Under the one-way-movement approach, if a census tract has 1,000 black residents and 18 white residents, all but 2 of the black residents would be expected to move out of the tract so that the tract could be 90 percent white.""

Pawasarat and Quinn proposed in their paper an alternative measure of segregation, analyzing city blocks rather than metro areas. They said Milwaukee ranked 43rd with that measure.

The pair reiterated their criticisms of the widely used dissimilarity index to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Pawasarat said that even though the index is ""the Bible now,"" it would view an area as integrated if it is 80 percent white and 20 percent black, but as segregated if the percentages are in reverse. Quinn said that ""far more interesting"" are attempts, such as a 2008 study made by DePaul University in Chicago, to measure ethnic, income and age diversity by neighborhood.

Jackson’s claim, however, was strictly about white-black racial segregation.

Let’s sum up the evidence.

Jackson claimed Milwaukee is the nation’s most segregated city. He didn’t define what he meant by segregated, but he referred to a study that measured segregation among whites and blacks.

While some may disagree with the measure used in the study, the approach has been recognized as a standard for decades. By that measure Milwaukee ranked No. 1 in white-black segregation. Jackson’s claim was accurate, although it needed some clarification, particularly in that the segregation measure is for the metropolitan area, not just the city.

We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968A1080>],/factchecks/2011/apr/18/jesse-jackson/rev-jesse-jackson-says-milwaukee-most-segregated-c/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Jim Keffer']","
Texas Rep. Jim Keffer says costs of cancer and related issues are over $20 billion a year in Texas
","Opposing a proposal to reduce the amount of money that the state puts toward cancer research, Republican state Rep. Jim Keffer of Eastland focused on the financial impact the disease has on Texans. Addressing the measure’s author, GOP Rep. Rob Orr of Burleson, Keffer said in House debate April 3: ""Do you know … that the costs of cancer and all affiliated issues are over $20 billion a year to this state? So that is the reason that this is such a great program. We are having successes, and, really, to tamper with or harm it now … it’d be detrimental."" We wondered whether Keffer was right about cancer costs to Texas. First, some background: In 2007, with the backing of Gov. Rick Perry and bicycling superstar and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong, the Legislature voted to ask Texans to approve the sale of $3 billion in bonds over 10 years to finance cancer research grants. Voters gave the OK that fall, and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas was created to dole out the money. Orr’s 2011 measure, which the House rejected, would have reduced the annual sale of the cancer bonds by one-third over the next biennium. In response to our inquiry, Keffer’s chief of staff, Ky Ash, told us that the $20 billion cost statistic was a reference to May 2007 testimony by consultant and lobbyist Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller, before the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. During that hearing, which we reviewed online, Hamilton said he was not speaking for any group or agency in addressing ""the financial aspects"" of cancer in Texas. He pointed to a 2001 study commissioned by the Texas Comprehensive Cancer Control Coalition, a public-private group that is now known as the Cancer Alliance of Texas, and conducted by a research team led by David Warner, a professor of health and social policy at the University of Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs. The study estimated the total economic impact of cancer on Texas in 1998 as about $14 billion. According to the study, about $5 billion of the total represented ""direct costs,"" including hospitalization and other treatments, cancer screenings and medications, plus spending on research and other cancer-related programs by state agencies, nonprofit groups and private foundations. The remaining $9 billion reflected ""indirect costs"" — in this case, the value of the economic activity lost because someone was sick with or died from cancer. For example, the researchers estimated how much income and other economic benefits people who died of cancer in 1998 would have produced had they lived to their age group’s average life expectancy. So, Hamilton testified, the $14 billion total included numerous costs — including to the government, to families, in lost wages and in insurance — ""rolled together."" He then told the senators that he had drawn on the study to make a conservative estimate for the cost of cancer in Texas in 2008: ""just under $30 billion."" Noted: That’s quite a bit greater than Keffer’s aired figure. In an e-mail, Hamilton told us that he no longer has the original information that supported his analysis, but he said he reached his estimate by updating the 2001 figure using newer data on cancer incidence in Texas, plus demographic and economic figures and information on cancer costs. Hamilton said he believed his estimate was conservative because his price assumptions were closer to the general inflation rate than the increase in the costs of medical care, which is greater. Next, we looked for other research on the costs of cancer in Texas. Christine Mann, an assistant press officer at the Texas Department of State Health Services, pointed us to an analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. It put the 2007 cost number at about $22 billion: $10 billion in direct costs and $12 billion in indirect costs. The March 2009 report, commissioned by the Texas Cancer Registry, says the researchers’ methodology combined an adaptation of a recently published National Cancer Institute approach with methods used by the LBJ School’s Warner in 2001. From 1998 to 2007, the more recent report says, the cost of cancer in Texas increased for several reasons, including an increase in the number of older Texans, rising health care costs and more expensive treatments. For information about cancer trends in Texas, we turned to the Texas Cancer Registry, a collaboration between the Texas Department of State Health Services, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. A February 2010 report says that although cancer rates (the number of new cases per 100,000 people) have been declining in recent years, the number of new cancer cases has been rising because of ""the increasing size and aging of the Texas population."" According to the Cancer Registry, there were 95,607 new cancer cases in Texas in 2007, the most recent data available. That’s an increase of 3.6 percent from the year before. Finally, we found an analysis of the 2010 costs of cancer in the state. Done by the Perryman Group, a Waco-based economic analysis firm, the report updates the direct and indirect cost estimate to about $25.3 billion. However, the report, conducted for the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, says Perryman  ""developed a more comprehensive measure of the cost of cancer in terms of Texas business activity,"" including both losses stemming from treatment, illness and death — as the earlier studies measured — and ""spillover effects,"" which it considers ""further reductions in business activity."" Those additional reductions push estimated Texas economic losses to more than $150 billion and nearly 700,000 jobs, the Perryman report says. Finally, we looked for national expertise on the costs of cancer at the state level, finding none. Summing up: Keffer claimed that cancer and its related issues cost Texas upwards of $20 billion a year. Most of that figure is pegged to indirect costs. That said, the most recent research we found consistently pegged the total annual cost at considerably more than $20 billion. We rate Keffer’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E71E40>],/factchecks/2011/apr/18/jim-keffer/texas-rep-jim-keffer-says-cancer-and-related-issue/

Atlanta police chief says despite fears, crime is down
","
Worried about burglars kicking in your door and swiping your stuff? If you live in Atlanta city limits, you might find some comfort in crime statistics. 

The numbers are down, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said.  

""If you go strictly by the numbers, crime is down across the board. Last year we had a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes,"" Turner said in an April 4 article. 

""But perception means everything. Until our citizens feel safe, our work is not done,"" Turner added. 

Ten percent? What about that November crime spree that left one man dead in a Virginia-Highland robbery? Police said the gang was responsible for other crimes, including a home invasion, rape and robbery in Grant Park. 

Many city dwellers don’t think they’re any safer, according to a survey released April 4 by the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit that assists the Atlanta Police Department by providing resources and programs. Some 34 percent of respondents thought crime in their neighborhood was at least somewhat higher than it was five years ago. 

PolitiFact Georgia cruised the APD website, which posts crime statistics. Its crime map page said murder more than doubled from 2009 through 2010. That didn’t seem consistent with Turner’s statement. 

We alerted department spokesman Carlos Campos, who said they were incorrect and had them taken down from the website. (The statistics on their crime map page did not match up with federal numbers, so we accept the spokesman’s explanation.) 

The spokesman then directed us to the department’s official crime tallies, known as Uniform Crime Reports. The Federal Bureau of Investigation collects these figures from police agencies across the nation. 

Turner based his statement on data for seven types of crime: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. Because these crimes are usually well-reported, experts think these statistics are a good reflection of the actual number of offenses taking place on the streets. 

We checked the numbers and found that they confirm what Turner said. Overall crime in these categories is down 10.2 percent.  

Crime is down in all categories except for murder, which increased from 80 killings in 2009 to 93 in 2010. Campos said that last year was only the third time since 1963 that there were fewer than 100, and that murders are trending downward. 

The drop in crime is part of a broader trend. While some robbery, burglary, auto theft and larceny ticked upward for a time starting in 2007, crime in Atlanta during the past decade is down about by 30 percent. 

Since 2001, murder in Atlanta is down 35 percent. Robbery declined 50 percent. 

Nationally, violent crime decreased about 7.5 percent. 

Another statistic experts use to assess crime is the number of offenses per capita. Recent census figures showed that Atlanta’s population is far lower than estimates -- about 22 percent lower. Still, since incidents are down and the population rose slightly, crimes per capita have also declined -- though the figure is higher than previously thought. 

Chief Turner was named as interim head of the APD in December 2009, shortly after Kasim Reed was elected as mayor, and won the post officially in July. He told PolitiFact Georgia that his force is more closely focused on quality-of-life issues, making arrests and enforcing traffic laws to root out more serious crime such as car thefts.  

That said, the city’s crime statistics are difficult to cross-check, experts told PolitiFact Georgia. Independent researchers or agencies don’t typically perform separate tallies or check the quality of crime statistics.  

This can be a problem, said Lou Arcangeli, a retired APD deputy chief who teachers at Georgia State University. He criticized the department earlier in the decade for posting bogus figures. 

""It’s an organization with a history of under-reporting crime,"" Arcangeli said. 

For a period starting in 1999, the department failed to count about 6 percent of rape reports. In 2003, an audit found that police were unable to find about 20,000 reports from the prior year. Rapes and robberies went unreported in the late 1990s as well. 

So we dug deeper. We looked at a 2008 Georgia Bureau of Investigation audit of the agency’s crime statistics reporting, plus a 2010 quality assurance check. Of the nearly 170 offenses checked in the 2008 audit, the GBI found two incidents that were not reported according to FBI guidelines. Still, both checks found that the APD met federal standards.  

We also contacted residents on the city's west side, which has struggled with crime.

Residents in the West End, which pays off-duty police officers for extra security, and in the neighborhood surrounding Booker T. Washington High School, which does not, feel their streets are safer, though larcenies, car theft and prostitution persist in some areas.

""I feel much better about what we see,"" said Bill Cannon, head of the Booker T. Washington Community Association and Neighborhood Watch.

As Turner said, ""strictly by the numbers"" crime is down in Atlanta. Those numbers appear to reflect what is going on in area neighborhoods, and there is no evidence that the agency is improperly reporting its crime statistics.   

We therefore rule Turner’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978BE640>],/factchecks/2011/apr/18/george-turner/atlanta-police-chief-says-despite-fears-crime-down/

Rep. Dennis Kucinich critical over long reach of PATRIOT Act into American's lives
","
A vocal opponent of the PATRIOT Act since its passage nearly a decade ago, Rep. Dennis Kucinich has been in the thick of the discussion since Congress teetered on the brink of refusing to renew some key provisions.

With the help of Tea Party Republicans the Democratic minority in Congress did, indeed, preempt renewal when the vote went 277 to 148 for a nine-month extension of three key provisions. That was short of the two-thirds majority needed to keep the provisions alive through then end of the calendar year.

They came back Feb. 17 and voted for an extension for 90 days to allow further debate. And it passed.

Not surprisingly, Kucinich had many things to say, invoking among other things, ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" the spirit of the First Amendment and bi-partisanship in defense of basic liberties.

From the floor of the House and in a Feb. 10 press release, he said:

""What we have done with the PATRIOT Act, we've given the government enormous powers. We've given the government the right to reach deeply into people's private lives, into their business affairs, without a court order. We need to think about that.""

Given that the debate will soon be revived as the 90-day extension nears expiration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

The House was debating extensions of three provisions that already expanded the government’s ability to keep an eye on us, and Kucinich rattled them off by the numbers, citing sections 206, 215 and 6001.

House Republicans posted the three sections online at the official GOP website. Their legislative digest didn’t quote Kucinich, but didn’t disagree with his reading of the provisions either.

""Business Records Provision (the So-Called ""Library Provision""—Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act): This provision allows the FBI to apply to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court for an order granting access to tangible items—including books, records, papers, and other documents—in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases.""

""Roving Wiretaps Provision (Section 206 of the PATRIOT Act):  This provision authorizes FISA orders for multipoint or ""roving"" wiretaps for foreign intelligence investigations.  A ""roving"" wiretap applies to an individual and allows the government to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device that the suspect uses or may use.""

""Lone Wolf Provision (Section 6001 of Intelligence Reform Act): This provision amends the definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" to include individual foreign terrorists who may not be directly affiliated with a foreign power or international terrorist organization.  This provision would prevent terrorists who work on their own from escaping surveillance simply because they are not agents of a foreign power or avowed members of an international terrorist group.  This provision ONLY applies to foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power.""

So do the extensions of these three provisions allow the government to reach more deeply into people’s lives?

Yes, though the third one, the Lone Wolf provision, only applies to ""foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power.""

Language in Sections 215 and 206, two Kucinich specifically cited, enables federal investigators to gain access to things like library records, e-mails and financial papers and to wiretap multiple communications devices.

But can it be done without a court order, as the congressman said? Kucinich and other critics of provisions in the PATRIOT Act decry that the law allows for warrant-less searches. Federal law enforcement officials do not have to go the regular route to obtain court authorization to conduct searches and collect evidence. In those cases the court’s orders would ultimately become public.

The sections cited in the PATRIOT Act allow federal law enforcement to apply to a court for an order, but it’s through a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates very differently than other U.S. courts. In the case of these special courts, the proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and kept secret.

Kucinich is correct that the PATRIOT Act opens the door for government to conduct broad levels of surveillance into U.S. citizens’ lives and activities and that the surveillance can be without traditional law enforcement having to get the traditional warrant.

But the law does require an order from a court, albeit a special court that can do so secretly. That’s an important detail.

Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus says errors in tabulating votes in elections are common
","
It’s a safe bet no election clerk in Wisconsin history ever invited more questions about a vote count than Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus did on April 7, 2011.

With a possible statewide recount hanging in the balance, why did Nickolaus wait more than a day to report an error that had helped give the appearance of a narrow JoAnne Kloppenburg victory in the state Supreme Court race? How could she have left an entire city, Brookfield, out of the countywide vote tabulation she released to the media?

The mistake had the effect of masking a statewide lead of about 7,500 votes by Justice David Prosser in the ultra-close contest, if the now-revised totals are correct. (A statewide canvass completed April 15 gave Prosser a 7,316-vote margin of victory.)

State election officials are still investigating what happened, so questions remain about what led to the screw-up.

One statement Nickolaus, a Republican elected to the post in November 2002, made at her news conference got our attention.

""It is important to stress that this is not a case of extra votes or extra ballots being found,"" she said. ""This is human error -- which I apologize for -- which is common in this process, which is why the state requires us to conduct a canvass.""

Are errors in the election process ""common?"" And what about errors of this type?

Nickolaus did not return a call, and has not spoken much to the media since the news conference, but we checked news archives and national, state and local experts for perspective.

There’s unanimous agreement that human error is not unusual in the bustle of election day (and night), causing discrepancies between unofficial totals and the official canvassed totals produced in the days after an election.

Officials also stress that such discrepancies almost invariably have nothing to do with stolen votes, uncounted or lost ballots, or extra votes. In other words, the actual voting numbers were not affected -- just the early, preliminary, unofficial tally of them.

For example, in the city of New Berlin, as Nickolaus reported, a clerical error recorded a vote total for Prosser as 37 but the voting machine tape showed it was 237.

And in Winnebago County, the unofficial returns in the Supreme Court race were more than 1,100 votes short because of a modem malfunction in communicating municipal votes to the county from a few voting machines.

In all, more than 45 counties of 72 reported an official number -- after their canvass -- that differed from the totals they reported to the public on election night. In some cases they were off by a single vote.

In some cases, the difference is not an error at all. Sometimes overseas ballots are counted late. People who forget to bring proof of residence when registering to vote can cast provisional ballots that are not counted until after the election. Write-in votes can cause delays in tabulation.

Whatever the cause, the official vote canvass is where mistakes get corrected. That’s why state law sets up that process.

In the case of Brookfield, the 14,000 votes were accurately tabulated at the municipal level and transmitted correctly to the media and to Nickolaus. The numbers reported by Brookfield have been confirmed by state election officials. The problem was that Nickolaus left them out of her unofficial aggregated county-wide total.

That is far from common.

And that puts it on a different level right off the bat. When you add in the close margin in a widely watched race -- and Nickolaus’ decision to keep it quiet -- her error falls into a category almost by itself.

In fact, the Waukesha situation is so uncommon that observers have a hard time even agreeing how to describe the error. Among the descriptions: unreported votes, lost votes, unrecorded votes, discovered votes. ""Waukeshananigans,"" some Democrats called it.

Has anything remotely like this popped up in Wisconsin over the years? Here’s a look at some high-profile problems: 

So, it’s clear that big mistakes also occasionally happen.

Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s top elections official, took issue with Nickolaus using the word ""common"" while describing the alleged error she made.

""There are mistakes and we build in checks to catch them,"" Kennedy said. ""But this is unusual in its magnitude and the fact that it wasn’t brought to light (immediately). That is very unusual.""

Three other election officials or researchers agreed with aspects of Kennedy’s comments.

Kristine Schmidt, the Brookfield city clerk, said the situation was rare because Nickolaus waited so long to tell the state about the error.

Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a nonprofit group that advocates for cleaner elections, said a more transparent process in Waukesha County might have prevented the error from escalating into a big deal.

Diane Hermann-Brown, the Sun Prairie city clerk and president of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association, said human error was inevitable, but it was uncommon to have an entire community’s results left out.

Wisconsin’s unusual reliance on municipal-level election administration rather than county-by-county increases the possibility for errors, various experts noted.

For a national perspective, we turned to Lawrence Norden, who catalogues election errors for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School, a left-leaning advocacy and research group.

Norden said discrepancies between official and unofficial tallies are ""unfortunately very common."" He’s seen other instances of an entire community’s tally being left off -- but rarely in an area where the vote so heavily went to one candidate.

Let’s tally up the facts here.

Nickolaus talked about ""common"" human error in the election process. We think it’s fair to assume she was including her own error as one of the ""common"" mistakes.

History, and experts, confirm that human error is indeed not unusual in the tabulation of preliminary election results. It’s equally clear that her error, while not unprecedented, is on the extreme end of the scale and is a rarity.

Our definition for Barely True is: The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Same-sex marriage advocate says full marriage equality offers 1,700 rights
","
In the debate over same-sex marriage, proponents have argued that proposals to create civil unions and other arrangements to mimic marriage are unacceptable. They contend that such measures fail to provide for the same rights and benefits received by couples in traditional marriage.

One such proposal, which would allow any two unmarried persons in Rhode Island to establish ""reciprocal beneficiary agreements"" received a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee April 5.

Bill Fischer, spokesman for the advocacy group Marriage Equality Rhode Island, said in an interview with The Journal that the proposal wouldn't come close to providing the full benefits of marriage to gay couples. And, he said, there are lots of benefits.

""We've been asked a lot lately regarding full marriage versus civil union versus reciprocal benefits, what it actually means. And I think it’s important to note [that] reciprocal benefits would provide same-sex couples with approximately 15 rights, civil unions with about 600 rights, and full marriage equality with about 1,700 rights. There is a real distinction in approach,"" he said.

Supporters of same-sex marriage often cite a large number of federal rights -- usually 1,100 or so -- that they say are denied to same-sex couples because gay marriage is not recognized under federal law.

Many examples are substantive and well-documented. Gay couples lose out on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits that would normally go to a spouse. They can't transfer property between themselves without possibly incurring a tax penalty, a concern married couples don't face.

They aren't protected by the COBRA law or the Family Medical Leave Act the way the spouse of an unemployed person is. Death benefits don't automatically go to the partner in a gay marriage the way they go to a widow or widower.

But when we heard Fischer cite the 1,700 figure, we wanted to know if there really are 1,700 rights to be gained by being married.

So we asked for the list.

He said it was the combination of about 600 state and roughly 1,100 federal rights denied to gay couples in Rhode Island. To prove it, he sent us three documents.

The first was a 1997 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office that, in the wake of the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, identified ""1,049 federal laws classified to the United States Code in which marital status is a factor.""

Given the number of times the 1,100 number has been tossed around, we expected to see a specific analysis of each law cited, or at least some indication of what ""right"" was at stake.

Instead, we were surprised to discover that the GAO had simply done a search of the U.S. Code to identify laws that use words or word fragments like ""marr"" (for marriage), ""spouse,"" ""widow"" or ""survivor.""

In fact, the report itself cautions that ""some of these laws may not directly create benefits, rights, or privileges."" It also warns that ""no conclusions can be drawn … concerning the effect of the law on married people versus single people. A particular law may create either advantages or disadvantages for those who are married, or may apply to both married and single people.""

The second document was a 2004 update to that GAO report, which used the same methodology. The new tally: 1,138.

So already, given the GAO’s methodology and multiple caveats, we were skeptical. But we decided to examine a sample of the laws the GAO identified.

For this item, we are loosely defining ""rights"" to include benefits and privileges that people enjoy as a result of a law.

We looked at 35 laws -- particularly the ones where their titles made us wonder whether the statute offered a real right, benefit or privilege for being hitched. We discovered that the GAO's cautionary language was well warranted.

In most of the cases, 26 of the 35, the language, by our reading, does in fact give rights to people who are married, although some of the rights were pretty obscure:

* A section of Title 2, Chapter 16 gives surviving spouses of current, past or future members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and other officials, the right to ask for an advisory opinion from the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards.

* Title 15, Chapter 22, which deals with federal trademark law, does not allow anyone to trademark of the portrait of a deceased U.S. president as long as his widow survives, unless the former first lady gives permission.

On the other hand, our spot check identified three laws that limited the rights of married people. For example, when considering eligibility for free or reduced-price school lunches, the government must, under Title 42, Chapter 13, consider the income of the spouse, if there is one.

And six statutes, even if they mentioned marriage or spouses, didn’t seem to deny rights or benefits. Some examples:

* A section under Title 42, Chapter 7, which outlines that an abstinence education program should teach, among other things, that ""abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage [is] . . . the expected standard for all school age children.""

* The section under the immigration section of Title 8, which allows immigration officers to record whether a U.S. resident is married or single when they leave the United States via the border with Canada or Mexico. The provision also allows for the recording of whether the person can read or write, their occupation and other facts.

Next, we turned to the third document supplied by Fischer: a listing prepared by Karen Loewy, a senior staff attorney at GLAD, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, citing 669 provisions in Rhode Island law and court rules.

Here again, the list was compiled by searching for key words; in this case, the phrase ""next of kin"" and 16 marriage-related words. This time we randomly selected 10 items to check and applied the same standard.

Five appeared to offer no special benefits to married couples. One law says there is no right of patient confidentiality in suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. A second requires the state registrar of vital records to send copies of marriage certificates to municipal clerks before the 10th day of the month.

A third outlines how people can recover money from claims made in probate proceedings, and a fourth prohibits the sale, foreclosure or transfer of property in divorce proceedings without court approval if a child is receiving public assistance.

The fifth law wasn't even a law at all. It had been repealed. It was included in the list because it had the word ""divorce"" in the original title.

So out of the 45 federal and state laws we examined, 31 clearly offer a benefit for someone who is married. But under 3 other laws, a married person may actually face a disadvantage. And in the remaining 11 cases, it doesn't appear that the distinction affects people's rights at all, a fact the GAO itself acknowledged when listing federal statutes.

When we informed Fischer about what we were finding, he referred us to Loewy, who said: ""In every one of these statutes there's an equal protection violation.""

For example, the federal abstinence eduction program that talks only about traditional married couples could be jarring to the children of same-sex couples, she said. The fact that immigration officials aren't recognizing same-sex couples on a form (as they would traditional married couples) constitutes a difference in treatment.

In fact, Loewy said, the laws that impose restrictions on the spouses in a traditional marriage also reflect a denial of rights to same-sex couples.

We disagree. To assert that any law referring to ""marriage"" or ""spouse"" or ""divorce"" or a comparable term marks a point of discrimination and, as a result, warrants inclusion on the list strikes us as a stretch.

If gay marriage proponents simply stated that marriage-related terms appear in 1,700 (or even 1,807) sections of state and federal law, there wouldn't be any debate. Instead, they cite each reference to marriage, spouse or a similar term as an example of a right denied to a gay couple.

Fischer, in his defense, points out that he spoke of ""about 1,700 rights,"" leaving him some wiggle room, since we checked only a fraction of the statutes. But because we could validate only 31 of the 45 items we did check, that suggests the number of lost rights could be significantly less than 1,700.

Clearly, couples in a traditional marriage have benefits -- both significant and obscure -- that same-sex couples in a civil union or other arrangement do not. And even our spot-check of 45 statutes confirmed that in the majority of laws we checked.

But when numbers like these are thrown around, we expect advocates to have more to back them up than a rudimentary word search that fails to say what right or benefit might be at stake.

The assertion that federal law denies gay couples 1,100 federal and 600 state rights has not been proven because the technique used to reach the claim produced an unreliable total.

For that reason, we rate Fischer's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D6180>],/factchecks/2011/apr/17/bill-fischer/same-sex-marriage-advocate-says-full-marriage-equa/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says Tim Kaine proposed $6 billion in tax increases while governor
","
Hours after Democrat Tim Kaine announced he is running for Virginia’s open Senate seat in 2012, Republican George Allen, a rival candidate, was on the attack.

Allen’s campaign manager told supporters in an e-mail that Kaine was a ""big government"" liberal who proposed more than ""$6 billion in tax increases from the time he entered the Governor’s mansion until the time he left.""

We wondered if Kaine’s record as governor matched Allen’s claim. Kaine led the state from 2006 to 2010.

Katie Wright, Allen’s director of communications, sent us a breakdown of supposed tax-increases advanced by Kaine. The largest proposed hikes, from 2006 through 2008, were aimed at raising money for Virginia’s overcrowded roads.

Transportation has troubled state politicians for nearly a decade, as growing populations in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads face ever-denser gridlock. In other parts of the state, rural highways need expansions and arterial interstates are facing increased traffic loads. The Senate has wanted to raise taxes to build roads, arguing it is vital to establish a permanent source of new revenues.

In this year’s General Assembly session, GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell won approval for a $4 billion package that relies on borrowing and surplus funds found in an audit of the state transportation department. Critics say the plan provides only a small, short-term solution to transportation woes.

Allen’s statement is based on three tax proposals by Kaine.

The first came days after Kaine took office. He rolled out an unsuccessful plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Allen, factoring in the four years of Kaine’s term, calls this a $4 billion tax increase. That’s a misleading number. State tax increases are typically valued by the yearly revenues they produce. So this is more accurately described as a $1 billion tax increase.

Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees and imposing steeper fines on drivers who got tickets. The registration fees are similar to a tax, since all drivers must register their cars. But Allen takes license when he calls higher fines for traffic offenses a tax, since those payments can easily be avoided.   

The State Senate’s plan, proposed by the body’s Republican leaders, also raised taxes on vehicle purchases and proposed higher taxes on the price wholesale gasoline, which stations buy from distributors and then resell to individual customers, often passing along the tax to motorists in the form of higher prices.

Kaine’s second tax proposal came during the summer of 2008, when lawmakers gathered for a special transportation session. Ahead of the conclave, Kaine proposed a $1.1 billion plan that would increase the titling tax to 4 percent from 3 percent, and hike vehicle registration fees by $10. Kaine’s plan and competing proposals were again killed, leaving the state without a long-term transportation solution.

Kaine’s final tax proposal came during his last month in office, when he proposed raising the state’s income tax and wiping out the car tax. Between 1998 and 2000, the state phased out most of the local property taxes on vehicles. As of December 2009, the localities were receiving about $1.6 billion from vehicle taxes. The state originally covered 70 percent of that car tax income, with the rest coming from taxpayers in twice-a-year payments.

But as the cost of the reimbursement climbed, lawmakers set a $950 million cap on the payments to cities and counties. Kaine thought the car tax had become too complicated should be trashed. To offset the loss to localities, he proposed increasing the state’s 5.75 percent income tax to 6.75 percent. That would generate $1.9 billion a year, and Kaine wanted to give all the money to municipalities.

In reality, this $1.9 billion increase would be partially offset by the $650 million taxpayers would no longer pay to localities. By our math, this was really a proposal to raise taxes by $1.25 billion. Some low-income taxpayers would have seen lower overall payments, while other people would have paid slightly more. The state would not have received any new revenue from the deal, but it would have stopped paying $950 million to localities each year.

Having steered you though the twists and turns of state policy, let’s conduct an after-action review.

George Allen says Tim Kaine proposed ""over $6 billion in tax increases"" as governor. Kaine did suggest a $1 billion per year transportation plan, mixing taxes with new fees and fines, during 2006. But Republicans also proposed new taxes for transportation that year.

The 2007 transportation compromise between Kaine and Republican legislators left the taxing power with regional authorities and raised most of its other funding through debt financing and higher traffic fines. The 2008 plan contained another $1.1 billion tax proposal, but only because Kaine was unsuccessful in garnering new transportation funds in the prior two years.

In effect, Allen is trying to double-count Kaine’s transportation-related proposals. The governor had to keep crafting new plans because elected officials in both parties repeatedly failed to find a long-term solution. Had a deal been reached in 2006, Kaine would not have laid out new plans in 2007 and 2008.

And the governor’s 2009 proposal was really a move to replace one type of tax with another.

By our count, Kaine proposed raising about $4 billion in new taxes -- $1 billion in 2006, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $1.9 billion in 2009. Of those increases, the 2008 plan represented a second attempt to raise new road funding, and the 2009 proposal would have been partially offset by a $650 million reduction in local car taxes. So Allen’s campaign is right that Kaine proposed some tax increases, but inflates the number by 50 percent. The campaign also fails to acknowledge the offsets in Kaine’s final plan.

We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097881E00>],/factchecks/2011/apr/16/george-allen/george-allen-says-tim-kaine-proposed-6-billion-tax/
"['Oregon', 'County Budget', 'Jeff Cogen']","
Has Multnomah County had to cut for 11 straight years?
","
Multnomah County Chairman Jeff Cogen is in the midst of proposing his first real budget, after succeeding Ted Wheeler last year. For the chairman’s first state of the county speech in February, he described the current budget picture as challenging.

""This year we face yet another multimillion-dollar budget deficit … it’s the 11th straight year of cuts at Multnomah County. That’s right: 11 straight years of cuts. Our broken tax system means that in good years we cut services and in bad years we slash them.""  (from prepared remarks)


We believe the chairman when he says the county has faced some pretty lean years, especially with two recessions within the last decade.

But did the county really face 11 straight years of cuts? The statement needed checking out.

First, a little background. The county is responsible for some public safety, library, public health and human services. One third of the county’s total budget is the general fund, the bulk of which comes from property taxes, and then business taxes, car rental taxes, and so on. Because property tax rates are capped annually at 3 percent, while inflation, personnel and other costs are more like 4 percent or 5 percent (according to the county), budgeting can be rough going.

Now for the budget numbers, which go back about a decade. The first column lists general fund dollars; it includes the temporary county income tax for fiscal years 2004-06, about $32 million a year, but not the portion that went toward public schools. The figures are unadjusted for inflation. The second column shows ongoing and one-time money, adjusted for inflation, and excluding the temporary income tax. The third column shows general fund dollars adjusted for inflation but excluding one-time money. (The analyst didn’t go all the way back.) All three sets come from the county. 


You can see that the numbers have climbed steadily since 2006, no matter which column you pick, with the exception of fiscal year 2010, which saw a significant dip.

How then does the county justify the claim that it’s had 11 straight years of cuts? Well, it depends on how you think of ""cuts.""

People understand the concept of a pay cut: You have less money to spend or save. The county, though, has more money to spend so it hasn’t faced 11 straight years of that sort of cut.

But the county considers reducing services a cut. It rolls back services if there is a gap between projected ongoing revenue and projected ongoing expenses. Projected expenses means the money needed to maintain current service levels.

So even though the actual dollar amount available for FY 2012 is more than for FY 2011, the county budget people say they are facing cuts, either to direct services or to staff. The March revenue forecast shows a projected $4.4 million gap between revenues and expenditures -- or a difference of a little more than 1 percent -- in the operating budget for fiscal year 2012, which starts July 1.

No doubt the county has had to make cuts over the years, maybe in some department every single year, but Multnomah County also has added programs, has expanded programs and has paid more for raises, health insurance and cost-of-living increases for much of the past decade.

Cogen strenuously disagrees with our definition. He said most people see cuts not in terms of fewer dollars, but fewer services. Having more money does not mean the county avoids service cuts, he argues, mainly because the general cost of doing business goes up. He even pointed to language in stories in The Oregonian that say K-12 schools will get $80 million more over the next two years, but that won’t be enough to avert teacher layoffs or shorter school years. (That’s because educators say they need $1 billion more to cover inflation and student enrollment increases.)  

The bottom line for PolitiFact Oregon? Multnomah County has consistently received more money in the general fund with few exceptions. We don’t think of that as more than a decade of cuts.

We believe Cogen when he says he takes his integrity seriously. And we recognize that the county is restricted by the cap on property taxes. But we can’t agree with the chairman’s statement that the county has had 11 years of cuts. The statement may be accurate, in that there were service cuts, but it leaves out important details, such as the rising dollars in its budget. We rate this Half True.

"['Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Joaquin Castro']","
Joaquin Castro says if House-approved budget becomes law, ""43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance""
","
State Rep. Joaquin Castro says spending cuts in the Texas House version of the state’s 2012-13 budget will cause vulnerable Texans to suffer. For instance, the San Antonio Democrat said in House debate April 4, ""43,000 people are going to be kicked out of nursing homes or denied nursing home entrance.""

The House-passed budget, yet to be answered by the Senate, would reduce by about 10 percent reimbursement rates paid to nursing homes for residents covered by Medicaid, the state- and federally-funded health program for the poor and disabled.

Nursing home advocates say actual daily rates would effectively drop 34 percent — from $123 to $81 per resident — because the House-adopted budget also doesn’t account for projected increases in health care costs or in Medicaid-supported nursing home residents. Nor does it replace federal stimulus aid that ends this year.

Some perspective: Of about 90,000 nursing home residents statewide, 54,800 — 62 percent — are covered by Medicaid.

Starting in 1999,  Medicaid reimbursement rates to nursing homes have increased seven times, most recently going up 2.7 percent in 2009. Rates have been cut thrice, most recently 2 percent as of February.

The state’s reimbursement rate is 49th nationally, according to an April 9 Austin American-Statesman news article. Also, Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us that ""there’s widespread agreement that our rates don’t fully cover costs.""

When we sought backup for Castro’s statement, his office said he got his numbers from the Texas Health Care Association, which represents the state’s nursing home industry.

The group’s president, Tim Graves, told us that it analyzed the most recent data, covering 2008, to try to estimate ""the scope of the potential impact"" of the proposed cuts. Graves said at least 70 percent of the residents at about half the state’s nursing homes, or 550 facilities, are insured through Medicaid — figures we confirmed with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The association estimates that the average number of residents at these facilities is 83, suggesting that 45,650 residents live in heavily Medicaid-dependent homes that would bear the brunt of the House’s rate cut.

And how many nursing home residents would be kicked out or denied care? That number proved elusive.

A Feb. 16 association press release says the reduction ""will force local facilities to significantly cut staffing levels, cut pay — or worse — go out of business, leaving local seniors and local workers to make do with no care and no jobs.""

Graves told us: ""There’s no way I can predict the future, but I can tell you they’ll be in really bad shape. ... Our point is any facility that depends on Medicaid to that extent is going to be in very significant trouble, and that could affect a lot of folks.""

Graves said the association hasn’t asked every home if it would close upon the proposed rate cut, but conversations with nursing-home operators have persuaded him that widespread closures with residents getting displaced is a valid concern.

At his suggestion, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. President George Linial told us it now costs homes $140 to $150 a day to serve residents. Separately, the state health commission told us the average daily cost for nursing-home care in 2008 was $129 per resident and the state projects that average for 2012-13 to be $133.

Linial shared an association document titled ""Nursing Home Profile for Texas"" stating that if the House-approved rates become law, 896 of the state’s nursing homes will close and 63,616 residents will lose their care.

Linial, calling the group’s forecast ""an estimate... a guess,"" also said: ""It is tough to determine who will close because most nursing homes do not want to alarm their residents by saying they will close ... However, simply looking at their financial statements will tell you that closure is imminent with further cuts.""

How did the group reach its numbers? Association vice president David Thomason said he determined from cost data collected by the state health commission that an average of 71 residents lived in the state’s nursing homes in 2008 and that Medicaid-covered residents accounted for 65 percent or more of the occupants of 896 homes. Assuming those homes would close if the House-backed budget becomes law, Thomason said, 63,616 residents would be kicked out of the shuttered homes.

According to the health commission, 676 nursing homes in 2009 had 65 percent or more of their residents covered by Medicaid. Informed of this tally, Thomason replied by email that he’d ""rounded up"" in his analysis and the group ""will be happy to agree that at least 676 facilities will close at the current House version of the bill,"" with 47,996 residents kicked out.

We pressed Thomason on his assumption that this particular cut would force the homes to close, though their reimbursement rates had mostly risen over the past decade. Reminding us of the homes greatly depending on Medicaid, Thomason said: ""There’s no other way around it, you’re going to close.""

Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities,  told us that Castro accurately pinned the number of nursing home residents whose ""access to care is at risk."" Yet whether all those residents ""would lose coverage at once, that may be pushing it,"" she said.

Finally, spokeswomen for HHSC and the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, which administers long-term services, said their agencies have not assessed the impact of rate cuts on Medicaid-covered residents. Goodman said: ""We don’t doubt that deep cuts in Medicaid rates would mean that some nursing homes would close.""

All in all, Castro’s claim that the House-approved budget would effectively deny 43,000 people nursing home care was not confirmed by the group he cites as his source. Though a different group estimates a larger number, that’s acknowledged as an educated guess.

At this point, all such predictions are speculative. We rate the statement Barely True.

Look at Florida, he said.

Speaking via satellite, Scott noted that he has proposed a balanced budget for Florida (as he's obligated to do by the state Constitution) that cuts spending and reduces taxes. He left out, we should note, that the key parts of his budget proposal -- a cut to the corporate tax rate and cuts to school property taxes -- are currently not part of the plans being considered by either the House or Senate.

Regardless, Scott told Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade that President Barack Obama needs to extend the Bush-era tax cuts. If the tax cuts expire, businesses will move elsewhere, where the tax climate is more friendly, Scott said.

The message worked on Kilmeade -- who at the end of a four-minute interview said Scott's message and proposals are resonating with Florida voters. His proof? Scott's approval ratings.

""The states that have to balance the budget are making the tough decisions, and getting appreciation for it. Your approval ratings are up,"" said Kilmeade, who went on to say that approval numbers are also up for governors in similar positions -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat from New York, and Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican from New Jersey.

We don't know much about Cuomo or Christie, but we know Scott's positions have been pretty polarizing on some issues. So we were curious if Kilmeade had it right.

We found two different polls that have tracked Scott's approval rating since taken office -- Public Policy Polling, a firm associated with Democratic candidates, and polling from Quinnipiac University, a group generally considered independent. We found an isolated third poll from Viewpoint Florida, a polling firm run by longtime consultants with ties to Florida Republicans. We'll start with Public Policy Polling.

A PPP poll from December, before Scott took office, found that 33 percent of Florida voters liked Scott compared with 43 percent who disliked him.

A follow-up poll released March 29, 2011, revealed that Scott's negative numbers had gotten worse -- not better -- since taking office. In the March poll, 32 percent of voters approved of Scott's job performance, while 55 percent disapproved. ""You could say Rick Scott's honeymoon is over ... but that would suggest he had one in the first place,"" Tom Jensen, a Public Policy Polling analyst wrote last week. The Quinnipiac polls also show Scott's negatives climbing, not falling.

The number of Florida voters who disapprove of Scott has more than doubled since February, the polling group found. Scott had a positive 35-22 percent job approval in a poll released Feb. 2. In a follow-up poll April 6, 35 percent approved of Scott's performance, but 48 disapproved. ""Today, Scott is a four-letter word to many Florida voters, but political popularity can change with time,"" said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""The experience of Scott's predecessor, Charlie Crist, who had 70 percent approval ratings at this point in his tenure, shows how fickle public opinion can be."" The third poll, from Viewpoint Florida, paints a slightly better picture for Scott. Forty-seven respondents surveyed March 29-30 approved of Scott's performance, while 48 percent disapproved. Pollster Randy Nielsen said the polling group didn't have previous approval numbers to compare it to. Scott acknowledged his poor poll numbers in an Associated Press article on April 6. ""I didn't run to be the most popular governor. I ran to make sure this state is most likely to succeed,"" he said.

Kilmeade, on Fox and Friends, said Scott's approval numbers are going up. Not according to the publicly available poll numbers we found. We rate this claim False.

Peter DeFazio says “Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support”
","
During a House floor speech on April 13, 2011, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., took aim at a recent proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to change the way the Medicare system works.

As part of a plan for reducing the national debt, Ryan proposes that Americans 55 and younger today would not get traditional Medicare but rather qualify for a government ""premium support"" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (We recently fact-checked a characterization of the plan by one of Ryan’s fellow Republicans, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana; see it here.)

DeFazio, in his floor speech, decried Ryan’s plan, arguing that it would all but gut a popular program that works well.

""Before Medicare, 25 percent of the seniors in America lived in poverty, many driven there by the lack of affordable, decent health insurance,"" DeFazio said. ""Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support. It solved that problem. Seniors today are guaranteed quality, affordable health care. They pay about 27 percent of the cost. While under the guise of fiscal responsibility, the Republican budget wants to turn back the clock to the good old days: Throw the seniors into the private health care market again.""

We wondered whether DeFazio was right that ""Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support."" In 2009, we rated a similar statement by former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, and we will draw from it as we analyze DeFazio’s more recent statement. 
It turns out that a significant number of Republicans did vote in favor of the Medicare bill when Congress took it up in 1965.

The House adopted a conference report -- a unified House-Senate version of the bill -- on July 27, 1965, and passed it by a 307-116 margin. That included 70 Republican ""yes"" votes, against 68 ""no"" votes.

Then, on July 28, 1965, the Senate adopted the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor and 17 against. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it two days later.

So in the House, a slight majority of the Republican caucus voted for Medicare, and in the Senate, a significant minority voted in favor. Both of these strike us as more than ""virtually no Republican support.""

It’s true that the Medicare bill was unpopular in certain segments of the Republican Party. In 1961, Ronald Reagan, the future president, famously released an LP with a speech in which he demonized ""socialized medicine,"" citing proposals that sound a lot like the one passed four years later.

""Write those letters now; call your friends and then tell them to write them,"" Reagan said. ""If you don't, this program, I promise you, will pass just as surely as the sun will come up tomorrow, and behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country. ... And if you don't do this and if I don't do it, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.""

Other high-profile Republicans who opposed Medicare included Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater -- the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 1964 -- and future president George H.W. Bush.

And as the Medicare bill progressed through the House, Republican support was scant. No Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8. And all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill.

As the bill worked its way through the Senate, Republican support was somewhat stronger. In the final Finance Committee vote, the measure passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it.

""The political parties were very different in 1965 than they are today,"" said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the U.S. Senate. ""Both had strong conservative and liberal wings, so most votes were bipartisan because the conservatives in the two parties voted against the liberals in each party. You had Republicans like Jacob Javits (N.Y.) who were more liberal than most Democrats, and Democrats like James Eastland (Miss.) who were more conservative than most Republicans. So there were Republicans who supported Medicare and Democrats who opposed it.""

When we contacted DeFazio’s office, a spokeswoman noted that the congressman has a background in gerontology and offered links to articles, including this one, to show that Republicans ""fought against the creation of Medicare starting with the Truman administration."" 
It’s true that some of the biggest opponents of Medicare early on were Republicans. But many big opponents were conservative Democrats, and ultimately, it’s wrong to say, as DeFazio does, that ""Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support."" His comment focuses on the period when the bill finally passed, and thanks to the GOP’s liberal-to-moderate wing -- which by now has largely disappeared -- a majority of House Republicans and a sizable minority of Senate Republicans voted in favor of Medicare. We rate DeFazio’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967AC680>],/factchecks/2011/apr/15/peter-defazio/peter-defazio-says-medicare-passed-virtually-no-re/

Tammy Baldwin's Half True claim that Donald Trump wants to take health care from thousands of kids
","Addressing the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s annual convention, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin laid into Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump. ""You know, I remember Donald Trump coming to Wisconsin during the campaign and saying the same things Republicans always say here: I’m on the side of the little guy, I’m for working families, I’ll fight for you,""  the Baldwin said on June 2, 2017. ""But it was another scam."" Baldwin, a Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, then criticized several proposals backed by Trump, including the GOP replacement plan for Obamacare. ""He wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare,"" Baldwin charged, echoing comments she made a few days earlier on MSNBC. ""Who would cut health care for children?"" Let’s see if she’s right. What is BadgerCare? BadgerCare (also known as BadgerCare Plus) provides health insurance coverage to low-income Wisconsin residents, including pregnant women, childless adults and children. It is funded through Medicaid. The latest enrollment numbers, from May 2017, show 790,189 residents enrolled, including 412,208 children. Several days after Baldwin’s speech, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed changes in the program for able-bodied adults, saying he wants to move them ""from government dependence to true independence,"" partly through drug testing. If the federal government gives Walker permission, Wisconsin would become the first state to do such drug testing. Under the plan, those who fail and refuse substance abuse treatment would have their coverage rejected. Baldwin’s evidence To back Baldwin’s attack on Trump, her campaign cited estimates made in May 2017 by two left-leaning research groups. The Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said in a blog post that a group of about 5,000 children in Wisconsin is particularly at risk of losing their eligibility for BadgerCare as a result of funding reductions to the Children’s Health Insurance Program that would be made under Trump’s 2018 budget proposal. Jon Peacock, the group’s research director, told us that while the budget would not dictate that children be removed from BadgerCare, Wisconsin would have to make up for the funding reductions in order to keep those children on BadgerCare. He said a total of 80,000 children would be put at risk of losing BadgerCare. The Washington, D.C.-based Center for American Progress made a longer-term estimate, saying 53,600 children would lose BadgerCare in 2026 because of Medicaid funding reductions proposed by the GOP’s replacement for Obamacare that has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. That figure was based on estimates done by David Cutler, a professor of applied economics at Harvard University who was a campaign adviser to Barack Obama; and Emily Gee, a health economist at the center who formerly worked at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Other evidence A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, which administers BadgerCare, said the department has not done a full analysis of Trump’s budget or the GOP health plan, but told us the state is committed to ensuring that  ""everyone living in poverty has access to affordable health insurance."" The two estimates, however, include people with family incomes above the federal poverty level. So, they would not be covered by such a commitment from the Walker administration. Zach Hunter, a spokesman for a House committee that wrote much of the GOP replacement bill, said the bill contains tax credits that would provide families up to $14,000 a year to purchase insurance. He also said the Center for American Progress estimate is based on projections made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which he said has ""repeatedly struggled to estimate coverage impacts with accuracy"" when it comes to Obamacare. Our rating Baldwin says Trump ""wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare."" The president’s budget proposal and the GOP replacement for Obamacare, which he supports, don’t dictate that children lose their BadgerCare health insurance. But both would make cuts to federal spending that two left-leaning research groups say would threaten the BadgerCare eligibility of thousands of children.

White House tweets misleading criticism of CBO analysis
","Seeking to bat down the news in a Congressional Budget Office report about the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act, President Donald Trump’s administration attempted to undermine the CBO’s credibility in a tweet. The official White House account tweeted an image that said, ""When Obamacare was signed into law, CBO estimated that 23 million people would be covered in Obamacare’s exchanges in 2017. They were off by more than 100 percent. Only 10.3 million people are covered by Obamacare."" Trump retweeted the message. FACT: when #Obamacare was signed, CBO estimated that 23M would be covered in 2017. They were off by 100%. Only 10.3M people are covered. pic.twitter.com/A7Kthh3gDQ We wanted to start by addressing that CBO was ""off by more than 100 percent,"" which wasn't very specific. The original prediction was 123 percent higher than actual marketplace enrollment. Another way to put it: Marketplace enrollment was 55 percent lower than what CBO estimated. (This would be the most natural way to calculate the projection accuracy, said Matt Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at Brookings.)  In this fact-check, we wanted to look at the broader attack on CBO’s accuracy. Was the nonpartisan agency’s original look at who would gain insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces off by 12.7 million people? We found that the CBO report written after Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010 indeed estimated 23 million people would participate in Marketplace exchanges. According to the latest figures, only 10.3 million currently participate in those marketplaces. The talking point neglects to mention, however, the CBO report’s accuracy in predicting the uninsured population at a historic low, which is what occurred. Given the information available at the time, the agency offered projections closer to reality than any other forecaster. The Obamacare exchanges are online marketplaces for health insurance, designed to give those who are not covered by employers, Medicaid or Medicare access to coverage from competing private health care providers. Some states set up their own marketplaces, while others defaulted to a federal-run Healthcare.gov shop. The CBO’s estimate for exchange enrollment was too high for a number of reasons, experts told us. The CBO originally predicted people would drop employer and non-group coverage to move into the exchanges, and that fewer people would enroll in Medicaid. Instead, fewer employers than expected dropped coverage. And the Republican-led Congress blocked funding for the risk corridor program, leading some insurers to exit the marketplace and to increases in some premiums. More people than expected also enrolled in Medicaid. Republican-led states also passed restrictions on some of the features designed to boost marketplace enrollment, including enrollment assistance and outreach efforts. The Trump administration continued in this vein, putting an end to all media outreach intended to boost last-minute signups prior to the Jan. 31, 2017 deadline. Already paid-for ads and emails to HealthCare.gov visitors were cut. ""It would have been hard for CBO to accurately anticipate how persistently hostile GOP state and federal politicians would be towards the ACA, which undoubtedly has helped suppress Marketplace enrollment,"" said Ben Sommers, an associate professor of health policy and economics at Harvard University. ​ The courts also threw a wrench in the CBO estimate about exchange enrollment. When CBO researchers made their original prediction about the Affordable Care Act, they did not know that the Supreme Court would rule against the law’s mandatory Medicaid expansion in 2012. The court determined it was up to the states to decide whether to expand coverage, and 19 states decided against the expansion. This affected the CBO’s estimate for the uninsured population. (Instead of a reduction of 32 million uninsured by 2016, the count was closer to 20 million.) But it had ramifications for the exchanges, too. ""The Supreme Court decision slightly changed the exchange estimates and substantially changed the overall estimates,"" said Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s graduate school of public service. One reason was that the growth of health care costs was lower than expected.   ""Because of the way the subsidies were designed, lower costs meant that fewer people were eligible for subsidies (since subsidies depend on the ratio of premiums to incomes),"" Glied said. ""That, in turn, likely meant that fewer people switched from employer coverage to the exchanges."" The CBO made another adjustment to its exchange enrollment projection in January 2016, from 21 million predicted at that time to 13 million. The estimate followed the Obama administration’s transitional policy that allowed people to hang onto their pre-ACA health plans through 2017. ''Most of the unsubsidized people who are no longer expected to purchase insurance through an exchange are expected to purchase insurance directly from an insurer instead,'' said the adjusted 2016 report. The Obama administration at the time said enrollment fell below projections because fewer employees went to the exchanges for insurance as more employers maintained coverage of employees. The 13 million-enrollment estimate is closer to the most recent estimate from a June 2017 news release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ""The Effectuated Enrollment Report shows that 12.2 million individuals selected a plan at the end of Open Enrollment, but only 10.3 million followed through to pay the premiums necessary to maintain coverage as of March 15, 2017,"" according to the release, to which White House spokesman Steven Cheung referred in response to our query. In addition to the tweet pointing at the CBO’s inaccurate projection on exchange enrollment, the White House criticized the office for a ""history of inaccuracy"" on ""coverage, premiums, and predicted deficit arising out of Obamacare"" in a statement. While the CBO overestimated enrollment in the exchanges, it still offered projections closer to reality than any of the four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group). ""The tweet is inaccurate in equating the exchanges with Obamacare, which implies that these numbers refer to the full coverage effects of the ACA. That ignores the role of Medicaid and employer changes, and CBO’s estimates on those were much closer,"" Sommers said. It also correctly estimated a significant drop in the uninsured population, leaving it at a historic low. ""The CBO's estimates of the overall change, and of each element of it, were closer to the mark than all other researchers who released comprehensive estimates at the time of enactment,"" Glied said. ""Nobody does it better."" The White House tweet was correct in saying that the CBO had originally estimated that 23 million people would participate in the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges, and that only 10.3 million people currently are participating in these. The White House chose to cite a report that has been updated by the CBO following significant legislation affecting its predictions. To make its case that the CBO is unreliable, the Trump administration cherry-picked a statistic that CBO got the most wrong. The forecasters were closer to actual results on other major components of Obamacare, including Medicaid and employer changes. We rate this statement Half True. Editor's note: We've updated this fact-check to clarify a point about the difference between CBO's projections and actual exchange enrollment.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CCFC0>],/factchecks/2017/jun/27/donald-trump/white-house-criticism-cbo-analysis-misleading/

Nunes gets it wrong; Trump hasn’t signed ‘more bills’ than any president at this point
","President Donald Trump is quick to list his accomplishments. On June 23, 2017, he tweeted ""I’ve helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills, mostly with no Democratic support, and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations. Nice!"" Trump was correct about the number. He omitted the fact, however, that few of these created substantive legislative change, as NPR reported. Fifteen of the bills ""reversed Obama-era rules and regulations. Others renamed federal buildings, provided for the creation of memorials or were related to personnel or government spending."" Some Trump supporters, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, also have made problematic claims about the president’s accomplishments. A reader suggested we fact-check this claim, made by Nunes on Fresno’s KMJ radio, about Trump’s bill signings: ""The news media hasn’t covered this. But we have actually got more bills signed into law, more bills signed into law, this Congress working with this president, than any president previously before at this stage in the game,"" Nunes said on June 19, 2017, in an interview with host Ray Appleton. He made this claim on Trump’s 150th day in the White House. By that point, Trump had signed 39 bills into law, according to GovTrack.us, a legislative research and tracking website. Nunes has gained additional attention in recent months, particularly for his actions as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In April, he announced he was temporarily stepping away from leading that panel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He cited ethics complaints that he mishandled classified information. That doesn’t mean, however, that Nunes has stayed silent on Trump. In fact, he’s continued to praise the president’s actions. We wondered whether the Nunes was right at the time he stated Trump had signed more bills ""than any president previously before at this stage in the game."" Our research PolitiFact California and our national partner PolitiFact have checked related claims. In April, shortly after Trump’s 100th day in office, we rated as Mostly True California Rep. Tom McClintock’s statement that ""President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman."" We found Trump had indeed signed the most bills, 28, since Truman signed 55 during the first 100 days of his first full term. We clarified that, as of that time, none of the bills Trump had signed were major pieces of legislation. That same month, PolitiFact rated False Trump’s claim that ""no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days."" It cited several presidential historians who said Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Truman and Barack Obama all accomplished more during their first 100 days in the White House. Outdated claim But as we noted earlier, Nunes made his assertion on Trump’s 150th day in office. He was specific about it, too, saying Trump had signed more bills than other presidents ""at this stage in the game."" That’s simply not accurate, based on the research by GovTrack.us. Not only did Roosevelt and Truman sign more bills through 150 days, so did Presidents Jimmy Carter, 48, and Bill Clinton with 41. President George H. W. Bush signed the same number as Trump, 39. ""I think it’s important that we all get the facts right,"" said Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us. ""When Nunes made that statement, his numbers were 50 days out of date."" Counting the number of bills signed is only one measure of a president’s accomplishment, Tauberer added, and perhaps an arbitrary one at that. ""If you count pages or words, Obama signed more than twice as much legislation at this point than Trump. It just happens that the legislation that went to Obama was grouped into fewer distinct bills,"" he said. Reporting by the Washington Post also shows Trump’s bill signings fall short of other presidents’ totals through 150 days. Asked about the claim, Nunes’ spokesman Jack Langer told us the congressman ""was referring to it being the most bills signed in the first 100 days of a new administration since Truman."" That would be accurate, if that’s what Nunes said. But it’s not. Of note, Trump has signed 36 executive orders, more than any president in recent history during his first 150 days, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. The orders do not require congressional approval. Our ruling California Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, said on Trump’s 150th day in the White House that Trump had signed more bills into law ""than any president previously before at this stage in the game."" Research from GovTrack.us and reporting by news outlets show Trump’s 39 bills signed into law trailed totals by Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Carter and Clinton. It tied him with President George H. W. Bush’s total through this period. The congressman’s claim would have been accurate had he cited the correct timeframe (the 100 day mark in office) and context (since President Truman).

"['Poverty', 'Florida', 'Rick Kriseman']","
Did south St. Petersburg's poverty rate fall as fast as Rick Kriseman said? Evidence thin
","Mayor Rick Kriseman is trying to win over voters in his reelection bid with a pitch about falling poverty in a lower income neighborhood. Kriseman, who faces former Mayor Rick Baker, says significant strides have been made since he took office, particularly in south St. Petersburg. ""We are seeing poverty being reduced in south St. Pete at a number larger than the national average, the state average, county or in Tampa, Jacksonville,"" Kriseman said after signing his qualifying papers inside City Hall. This area of town is significant to Kriseman, who helped with efforts related to the 2020 plan, a five-year plan to reduce poverty by 30 percent in a portion of south St. Petersburg. This isn’t the first time Kriseman has made this point, so we decided to find out if poverty really is going down in south St. Petersburg. Kriseman’s claim rests on shaky evidence that doesn’t tell the whole story. In order for this claim to be true, the poverty rate in south St. Petersburg would have to be dropping faster than in those other areas he named. But Kriseman’s evidence for the claim is imprecise. Instead of providing data for that area, Kriseman pinpointed the poverty rate of the African-American population in the entire city of St. Petersburg between two years. Kriseman’s staff relied on a 2013 Pinellas County report that highlighted south St. Petersburg as one of five at-risk communities, areas marked by ""high concentrations of poverty and a small return to the taxbase."" According to the report, approximately 48 percent of the population in this zone live in poverty. The demographic breakdown of those who live in poverty is as follows: 63 percent are African-American, 27 percent are white, 5 percent are Hispanic, and 5 percent are of another race. City staff said given that the majority of residents in that zone are African-American, addressing poverty among African-Americans is a priority for the mayor. So to support his claim, Kriseman compared the poverty rate for the entire St. Petersburg black population (which should go without saying, does not entirely live in south St. Pete) against the rates of other big cities, the state and the country. Even with that allowance, the numbers don’t hold up. Kriseman’s team sent PolitiFact Florida two sets of data from the Census Bureau’s 2014 and 2015 American Community Survey for the African-American population. (The 2016 numbers will not be released until September.) According to that data, the black poverty rate in St. Petersburg decreased by 8.5 percentage points between 2014 and 2015, from 34.9 percent to 26.4 percent. The other areas Kriseman mentioned — Pinellas County, Jacksonville, Florida, the United States, and Tampa — showed a smaller reduction in the black poverty rate, between a drop of 4.8 percentage points to a gain of .2 point, respectively. (The numbers listed on the graph represent percentage points — not the percentage.)  (Graph provided by city staff.) This data may look convincing, but it's not as certain as Kriseman describes. Most importantly, the data neglects the large margin of error in census data. Based on our calculations, the difference in the number of African-Americans in poverty — for St. Petersburg as well as the other locations — was statistically unchanged from 2014 to 2015. In other words, there's no way to know for sure if poverty went up or down, because the change in the poverty rate is within the margin of error. The margin of error fluctuates from year to year. In 2015, the margin of error for data from the Census Bureau was plus or minus 25 percent, or 4,131 people. For 2014, the margin of error was plus or minus 17 percent, or 3,459 people. Those margins are significant. The Census Bureau data shows that about 17,000 African-Americans were in poverty in 2015. With the margin of error, the estimated range is between 12,566 and 20,828. The range of African-Americans in poverty in 2014 is between 16,596 and 23,514. Taken together, the estimates show that the number of African-Americans in poverty could have held steady, or even increased from 17,000 to 20,000. We just don't know with a margin of error this wide. Joshua Wilde, an assistant professor of economics at the University of South Florida, said Kriseman was using the best data available despite its imperfections. While he couldn't say this for sure, he said there was a strong chance that poverty fell in south St. Petersburg among African-Americans between 2014-15. He calculated the p-value —  a statistical indicator based on the confidence interval — to determine the chance poverty fell based on numbers provided by the Census Bureau.  ""Once you peel back the layers of the onion on the numbers, it turns out the best numbers we have are just highly uncertain,"" he said. Still, Melissa Radey, a Florida State University professor who specializes in poverty research and data, said it would be better to have more years when looking at trends in poverty.  ""Making statements about trends is not appropriate with only two years of data,"" Radey said. Even looking at additional years for those locations, there really is no takeaway trend.  Kriseman stuck by his conclusion despite the uncertainty in the numbers.  ""To dismiss the year over year Census report about the number of people in poverty as statistically insignificant overgeneralizes the complexities of real-time poverty eradication,"" he said.  He cited a 2016 Tampa Bay Times article that highlighted Census Bureau data that showed that overall poverty rates in the Tampa Bay area have dropped to their lowest levels since the Great Recession. More specifically, the article said that poverty among African-Americans in Pinellas County dropped significantly from 2014-15. The article, however, did not specifically look at the south St. Petersburg population.  Kriseman said, ""We are seeing poverty being reduced in south St. Pete at a number larger than the national average, the state average, county or Tampa and Jacksonville."" The statement is flawed from the start. To support his claim about south St. Petersburg — which is not entirely comprised of black residents — Kriseman referred to data about the city's overall black population, not even narrowed down to the south side. That data has problems. At face value, 2014 Census data showed a decrease in the poverty rate for the city’s African-American population through 2015.

Bernie Sanders' projection of 'thousands' of deaths from lost health coverage is well-supported
","During an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., didn’t hold back in his criticism of Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act: He said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly. ""What the Republican proposal (in the House) does is throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance,"" Sanders told host Chuck Todd. ""What a part of Harvard University -- the scientists there -- determine is when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people will die."" Sanders continued, ""I wish I didn't have to say it. This is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is common sense."" Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would save lives, would it be on the scale of ""thousands,"" as Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that? When we contacted Sanders’ office, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis cited two sources. One is the ""Harvard study"" Sanders mentioned -- published on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American Progress. It was co-authored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology; two medical students who graduated from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for American Progress. To come up with their estimates, the authors of the Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts state health care law -- a law that was a model for the Affordable Care Act. The 2014 study was lead-authored by Harvard professor Benjamin D. Sommers. The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year. The second piece of evidence Sanders’ office cited was an op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with Harvard -- David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at Harvard Medical School. The op-ed -- published on Jan. 23, 2017, well before either chamber’s Republican health care bill was introduced -- used as its basis a different study lead-authored by Sommers. This 2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded Medicaid. Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in which 20 million Americans lost coverage -- which turned out to be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill -- Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be 43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP’s health policy changes. It’s worth noting, however, that both of these projections come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer national health insurance -- a proposal that is even further to the left than the Affordable Care Act. So can Sanders’ assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone? In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Here’s a rundown. • In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the study’s methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. • A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance ""is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease."" • Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found ""significant"" improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. (These were the two articles that formed the basis of the analyses cited by Sanders’ staff.) • A 2014 study published by the  blog of the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths. • A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act. • A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parent’s policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected.) We found two papers with results that were more equivocal. • A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronick’s study adjusted the data -- as the IOM had not -- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study. • A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health -- including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar -- did not improve in such patients. But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that having health insurance saves lives, and that not having insurance can lead to additional deaths. We asked several of the authors of these papers whether they believe Sanders’ assertion of ""thousands"" of deaths is generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back from three of them. "" ‘Thousands’ is completely fair,"" Dorn said. Baicker agreed. ""It is of course difficult to pin down an exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new policy,"" she said. ""But a number like ‘thousands’ does not seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence."" And Sommers -- whose work formed the indirect basis of the studies cited by Sanders -- concurred. ""I agree that it’s challenging to pin down an exact number on this,"" Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence ""certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths per year."" Sanders said, ""When you throw 23 million people off of health insurance -- people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes -- thousands of people will die. … This is study after study making this point."" Sanders’ statement on Meet the Press was phrased generally enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale of the House bill would produce ""thousands’ of additional deaths. That said, we can’t say with any specificity how many deaths will occur. It’s important to note that the studies provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly different result. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B29E80>],/factchecks/2017/jun/27/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-projection-thousands-added-deaths-g/

Fake news saga said Depp threatened Trump, died in federal custody
","A series of fake news posts that said actor Johnny Depp first threatened President Donald Trump’s life and then died after being caught by federal authorities is yet another fake news saga created by a well-known liberal troll. A June 24, 2017, post on Snoopack.com that read ""Johnny Depp Taken Into Custody By Secret Service"" said that Depp had talked about assassinating Trump, leading to the actor being detained. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.

There’s more to the entire saga, according to a number of posts that first appeared on June 22-23 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The website said that Depp, who was taken into custody and held under the Patriot Act, later died from his heart malady, although not before recanting his faith in Islam on his deathbed. None of this is real. TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which created the stories, is run by Christopher Blair.

Toomey ‘conflates two things’ in latest health care claim
","U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has made clear he supports the Senate’s new health care bill, which is expected to be voted on this week. The Republican said on CBS’s ""Face the Nation"" Sunday the plan would ""make permanent"" Medicaid expansion and that the federal government would ""pay the lion’s share of the cost."" ""Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility,"" Toomey continued. ""Working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We’re going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage."" What did Toomey mean by ""no one loses coverage?"" And how will the Senate plan affect coverage for people who became eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare? Steve Kelly, Toomey’s press secretary, said that when the Senator said ""no one loses coverage"" he was referring to federal eligibility for expanded Medicaid and was not saying no single person would lose coverage. Sara Rosenbaum, the Harold and Jane Hirsh Professor of Health Law at George Washington, said Toomey ""conflates two things."" She said the Medicaid eligibility category for adults below 138 percent of the federal poverty level was continued. ""But of course what he glosses over is what states will continue to cover these adults once the money starts disappearing,"" Rosenbaum said. Under the Senate plan — similar to the House plan — the federal government will shift from paying about 90 percent of the cost for this new class of adults eligible for Medicaid to paying the state average for other classes of Medicaid recipients, about 57 percent (it would be 52 percent in Pennsylvania). The shift happens gradually, staying at the current rate through 2020 before dropping gradually: 85 percent in 2021 80 percent in 2022 75 percent in 2023 57 percent in 2024 ""We think the Medicaid program is a generous partnership for states,"" said Theo Merkel, a Toomey legislative assistant. ""They are paid well over half of the cost for these individuals, and we think that over seven years if you phase in this transition and [the federal government] is still paying over half, it’s unlikely states are going to turn around and cut eligibility for like, in the case of Pennsylvania, 700,000 individuals.""     Under the Obamacare expansion, about 700,000 Pennsylvanians newly enrolled in Medicaid. The Urban Institute estimates the reduction of federal enhancement money to the state average in Pennsylvania to be about $1.75 billion annually under the AHCA plan, which senior research analyst Matthew Buettgens said would be comparable to the Senate plan. Buettgens said moving a greater amount of the cost burden to states would leave them with difficult choices. To make up for the shortfall, they’d likely either have to raise taxes, pay providers less or cut Medicaid benefits. He said failure or inability to do so could lead to a loss in coverage for some individuals. ""Basically if states aren’t willing to raise taxes, pay providers less or cut benefits they will have to cut enrollment,"" Buettgens said. Rosenbaum said some states would likely make up for the increased costs and others wouldn’t, as the CBO projected for the House health care bill. ""But the notion that these people will continue to have Medicaid is just absurd,"" Rosenbaum said. ""It rests on an assumption states will keep covering people as they are today once the enhancement money is gone."" Our Ruling  On ""Face The Nation,"" Sen. Pat Toomey said, ""Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility. Working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We’re going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage."" Toomey’s staff said the senator was referring to federal eligibility for that class of adults when he said ""no one loses coverage."" But Toomey did not clearly state nobody would lose eligibility under the Senate plan. He said ""no one loses coverage,"" leaving his comment open for multiple interpretations. As Rosenbaum said, ""Senator Toomey conflates two things."" So Toomey is correct that eligibility for a certain class of adults who qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare and previously hadn’t continues under the Senate plan. But it’s possible, even likely, individuals enrolled in Medicaid under the Obama expansion would lose coverage if states decline to cover the shortfall they’ll face after the federal government reduces its share of expanded Medicaid costs.

Kellyanne Conway's Mostly False claim that GOP bill doesn't cut Medicaid
","Politics and math don’t always get along, and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway raised a common complaint about how people talk about the future of Medicaid spending under the Senate Republican health care bill. In an interview Sunday, ABC news host George Stephanopoulos brought up the bill’s projected $800 billion in Medicaid savings and asked Conway if that undermined the president’s campaign promise to spare Medicaid from cuts. ""These are not cuts to Medicaid, George,"" Conway said on This Week on June 25. ""This slows the rate for the future."" Conway was weighing in on a long-running debate over what qualifies as a cut. And on one level, she has a point, we at PolitiFact found. Future savings are not always ""cuts."" But in the case of the GOP health care bill, there are indeed cuts that go beyond dollars spent. To first vet Conway’s statement that there are no cuts to Medicaid, we need to begin with a few basic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under current law, from 2018 through 2026, the federal government would spend about $4.62 trillion dollars on Medicaid. For the Senate bill, the CBO estimated that total Medicaid spending would be about $770 billion less. But you can also compare how much Washington spends in 2018 — the first year a health care bill would take effect — and what it would spend in 2026. If things stay as they are, spending goes from $415 billion to $624 billion. Under the Senate Republican bill, spending goes from about $403 billion to about $460 billion. Point being, spending increases under either scenario, it just increases at a far slower rate under the Senate bill. This graph from the CBO shows the trajectories for both.  The Senate bill takes several steps to restrain Medicaid spending. It rolls back who is eligible. Before Obamacare, Medicaid covered low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled individuals, and some parents, but excluded other low-income adults. Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 states and the District of Columbia exercised the option to make Medicaid available to anyone making up to 133 percent of federal poverty. For a family of three, that would be about $27,000 a year. The Senate bill eliminates that option as of January 2018. This shuts out the Medicaid option for over 2.5 million people in states that didn’t expand eligibility. The bill also makes federal payments to expansion states less generous. Under Obamacare, Washington covers at least 90 percent of the cost of covering people in the expansion group. That’s a better deal than the regular match, which can be anywhere from 50 to about 70 percent. The Senate bill phases out the higher rate for expansion states and by 2024, the match falls back to the regular rate. The bill further ends Medicaid’s days as an open-ended promise to cover a certain percentage of a state’s costs. Instead, the bill shifts the program to a capped amount. The cap might apply on a per-person basis, or states might opt to take their money as a block grant. In either case, the amount would rise each year, but using a lower inflation factor than is used today. It’s the specific nature of those changes that are more important than the total dollars spent. When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it included less money for Medicare over the years. In a mirror image of today’s debate, Republicans, notably House Speaker Paul Ryan, accused Democrats of cutting a vital health care program for the elderly. Democrats argued back that spending increased. We did a series of fact-checks about the back-and-forth and generally rated the Republican attacks Half True. Then, Democrats reduced payment levels to health care providers. Now, Republicans propose reducing payments to states. But at least in terms of the money trends, both situations follow the same general outlines -- with one key difference: The Democrats didn’t change the eligible population, and the Republicans do. That’s a cut. Fewer people will have access to Medicaid no matter how much money is spent. Conway, in fact, highlighted the Republican goal. ""Medicaid's imperative, its founding was meant to help the poor, the sick, the needy, the disabled children, some elderly women, particularly pregnant women,"" she said on ABC. ""We are trying to get Medicaid back to its original moorings."" Conway said that Republicans are not cutting the Medicaid program. The Republican health care proposals would slow the rate at which Medicaid spending increases, but spending would still increase. However, the proposals include policy changes that will leave fewer people eligible for Medicaid. That’s a cut. Conway’s claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C402840>],/factchecks/2017/jun/26/kellyanne-conway/does-senate-health-care-bill-cut-medicaid/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama blasts GOP Senate bill as tax cut for the rich at health care’s expense
","Former President Barack Obama has maintained a low profile since leaving the White House, but recently he took to Facebook to blast a Senate health care bill that threatens to dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislative achievement. The Senate bill ""hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else,"" Obama wrote in a Facebook post. We decided to look into the former president’s claim about the budgetary effects of the Senate Republican plan that repeals or reworks much of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Obama is right that the Senate bill contains a tax cut for wealthy Americans and medical-related businesses. The Congressional Budget Office has yet to put a number on the Senate bill’s tax cut. But the amount will likely be in the same ballpark as its scoring of the House bill, which cut taxes by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with high-income households and the health care industry gaining most of those benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center. The Senate bill repeals Affordable Care Act taxes that levy a 3.8 percent fee on investment income, as well as a tax on individuals making $200,000 or more ($250,000 for couples). The bill also eliminates ACA taxes that target health insurers, and makers of prescription drugs and medical devices. We should also note that middle- and lower-income consumers would likely see benefits from tax cuts in the form of lower prices and reduced fees on health savings accounts, as we pointed out in an earlier check of a House version of the bill. Obama is correct that tax cuts would be offset by cutting spending on health care. But it’s a stretch to say everybody’s health care would suffer, when what’s on the chopping block is federal funding for lower-income Americans. In the individual market, the Senate bill changes the formula for calculating how much help the federal government gives lower-income Americans to buy insurance. Compared with the Obamacare formula, the Senate GOP version would amount to a 15 percent across-the-board cut in premium subsidies, and result in low-income people paying higher premiums for bigger deductibles, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank. Starting in 2020, the Senate bill also repeals Obamacare’s cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income Americans defray the cost of deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. But the biggest cut in federal spending comes out of Medicaid, by changing the share carried by the federal government, relative to states. The Senate bill converts federal Medicaid funding to a per capita cap starting in 2020, placing a ceiling on the amount of funding a state gets per enrollee. Alternatively, states could opt for a block grant, a fixed amount of federal funds. Under either approach, the federal government would provide less to states than under Obamacare. Separately, starting in 2021, the Senate bill begins a three-year phase out of enhanced funding given to the 31 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. As we noted in a previous check of the House bill, reducing this funding would likely cause states to end expansion.   This graphic from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a side-by-side illustration of Obama’s claim that Republicans are rewarding wealthy Americans through a health care cut. The yellow bar shows $33 billion going to the top 400 highest-income households as a result of repealing the Obamacare tax cuts. The red bar shows how removing $33 billion in revenue translates to cutting off funding for Medicaid expansion population of four states―Alaska, Arkansas, West Virginia and Nevada. (Note: This graphic is based on the CBO’s earlier score of the House version, which will likely differ from its score of the Senate). Obama said that the Senate bill ""hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else."" The Senate bill does give a tax cut to wealthy Americans and medical-related industry. Assuming a budget analysis of the Senate bill is similar to that of the House version, the tax cut will be to the tune of $1 trillion. It’s a bit hyperbolic to say everybody’s health care would be cut to finance the tax cut; it’s mostly lower-income people who lose out as a direct result of the bill. He’s right that the Senate bill would deliver a tax cut as it reduces the amount of federal funding lower-income Americans would get to help buy insurance. The bill would also repeal funding to defray deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for those eligible. It also lessens the share of Medicaid funding carried by the federal government, relative to states. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

Trump wrongly calls Mueller's staffers Clinton supporters, employees
","Robert Mueller’s appointment as a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia has angered President Donald Trump, but he has so far restrained any urge to fire him. Trump has instead blasted angry tweets about the ""witch hunt"" and recently on Fox & Friends called into question the ability of Mueller’s team to do the job. ""I can say that the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton,"" he said of the special counsel staffers. ""There has been no obstruction. There has been no collusion. There has been leaking by Comey."" -@POTUS pic.twitter.com/tqpEuMNUJM We decided to look into the campaign contributions and employment history of the list of Mueller’s eight staffers that the U.S. Justice Department has made available so far. We found that of the eight, three have made campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton, none have worked for her, and one has defended the Clinton Foundation in court for WilmerHale, the law firm where Mueller was a partner, while another represented a Clinton aide, also for WilmerHale. ""Under the Rules of Professional Responsibility, attorneys are permitted to participate in matters involving their former firm’s clients so long as they have no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation,"" said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesperson. ""The department’s ethics experts have considered the relevant issues and determined that Mr. Mueller’s appointment as special counsel and those hired from his former firm are consistent with the rules of professional responsibility."" This is why Mueller was allowed to work on the case, in spite of WilmerHale’s representation of several key White House players, including Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. On the question of campaign contributions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in his testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on June 20 he saw no problems with the political donations from some special counsel staffers. When Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked whether political donations are a reason to disqualify someone from working on the investigation, Rosenstein answered, ""No, senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not."" According to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Congress has a longstanding concern about the possibility of partisanship in the federal workplace, leading it to place restrictions on partisan political activity through the Hatch Act. While the Hatch Act prohibits employees from campaigning for or against a subject of the investigation, financial contributions are permitted. ""The Hatch Act places federal employees under two different categories, and some employees are subject to tighter restrictions on their partisan political activities,"" Clark said. That includes those working on Justice Department criminal investigations. ""But even those folks … are permitted to make political contributions."" ""If someone has some kind of bias against someone or an association with or against, that’s not fair, and there’s a specific federal ethics regulation that requires federal officials who are participating in a proceeding like a criminal investigation to be able to be impartial and have the appearance of impartiality,"" she added. ""Even staffers who have represented Clinton don’t fall into that category."" Below, we’ve compiled a list of the special counsel staffers, their financial contributions and employment histories. Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s former FBI chief of staff, previously served as a senior counselor in the National Security Division, as an special agent in the FBI’s counterterrorism division, and as assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va. Following his various stints at the FBI, Zebley worked at WilmerHale, the same law firm as Mueller. There, he once represented Clinton aide Justin Cooper. FEC filings showed that Zebley did not contribute to any political campaigns. James Quarles, a former Watergate assistant special prosecutor, also worked at WilmerHale. He did not represent Clinton or any of her aides. He did, however, contribute $2,700 to Hillary for America, Clinton’s PAC, on Oct. 7, 2016. He also contributed $15,550 to Democratic congressional candidates since 2002; $2,000 to Democratic presidential candidates since 1999; $2,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; and $1,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2009. He is the only staffer who also contributed to a Republican congressional candidate. He gave $2,500 to U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in 2015. Michael Dreeben was the deputy solicitor general for the Justice Department, focusing on criminal matters before the Supreme Court and federal appellate courts. While a Michael W. Dreeben shows up in FEC files as having donated $1,000 to Hillary for America on June 27, 2006, this is a different Dreeben in Chicago. The deputy solicitor general has made no campaign contributions. Andrew Weissmann, the chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division fraud section, has also worked as the FBI general counsel, deputy and then director of the Enron task force, and an assistant U.S. attorney in New York. While he made no contributions to Clinton’s PAC, he gave a total of $2,350 to the Obama Victory fund in 2008. Jeannie Rhee was a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel and an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, prosecuting fraud and public corruption cases. She represented the Clinton Foundation for WilmerHale before a conservative legal activist who brought forth a racketeering lawsuit in June 2015. She also contributed a total of $5,400 to Clinton’s PAC in 2015 and 2016. Lisa Page served in the FBI’s general counsel office and as a trial attorney in the Justice Department’s criminal division’s organized crime and gang section. She made no campaign contributions. Elizabeth Prelogar is a former Fulbright scholar in Russia who served as an appellate attorney on detail for the Office of the Solicitor General and as an attorney at Hogan Lovells. She contributed $250 to Hillary for America in 2016 and $250 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2012. Adam Jed, an appellate attorney on detail from the Justice Department’s civil division, made no campaign contributions. Trump said that members of Mueller’s team are ""all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton."" Three of the eight available Mueller hires made campaign contributions to Clinton, which undermines Trump’s statement that all are Clinton supporters. Furthermore, none of them have worked for Clinton directly. Two represented either the Clinton Foundation or an aide, never her, and working for WilmerHale, which has also represented key members of Trump’s White House. The Justice Department has looked into the contributions and employment histories of all of their hires and determined them consistent with the rules of professional responsibility. Trump’s implication is that the investigation is politically motivated, but we see nothing to support that.

Facebook users flagged that post and others related to it as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news.

There was no date or context on the post, but it did note that ""the barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a ‘crude preservative.’ "" The story is fake, as are subsequent stories about the same investigation that followed the June 20 post.

Fake headline muddles real story of man cooked to death in tuna oven
","A news story that said a tuna fish recall came after workers at a canning company cooked a man and added him to the product is mash-up of two real stories under a fake headline. ""Massive Bumble Bee recall after 2 employees admit cooking a man and mixing him with a batch of tuna,"" read the headline on an April 6, 2017, post on BlueLineStrong.net. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The story itself isn’t entirely made up — but it has been repurposed with a bogus headline for a few years. The BlueLineStrong.net post is largely an excerpt from an April 28, 2015, Associated Press article. Here’s what happened. The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office charged two men at a Bumble Bee Foods plant for violating safety regulations in the death of a fellow employee. Jose Melena, 62, was performing maintenance inside a 35-foot-long oven at a plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 11, 2012. He was trapped and died when workers filled the oven with six tons of canned tuna and turned it up to 270 degrees to cook and sterilize the food. Angel Rodriguez, the plant operations director; Saul Florez, the safety manager; and Bumble Bee Foods all faced three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules. Bumble Bee Foods settled the case in August 2015 for $6 million. To be clear, no one chopped up Melena and put his remains in the meat. A website called TheRacketReport.com posted the story excerpt on April 28, 2015, the same day the AP story was published. It carried the headline, ""Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna."" The story doesn’t mention anyone being mixed in with the fish, despite the headline. The site’s About Us link noted that ""the articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways."" Fast forward to the following year. On March 16, 2016, Bumble Bee Foods did issue a real recall for ""process deviations,"" and not for the incident related Melena. Fake news site News4KTLA.com recycled the AP story about the workers being charged in Melena’s death the next day. The post also re-used the fake headline ""Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna."" The site attempts to look like a real media outlet, but does not give an indication it is fake, saying it covers ""southern Louisiana and the surrounding area."" The real KTLA TV station is based in Los Angeles. The fake headline has been passed around ever since.

"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'PunditFact', 'Kellyanne Conway']","
Does GOP health care include grandfather clause for Medicaid expansion?
","Proposed changes to Medicaid shouldn’t worry people currently using the health care program for the very poor, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said, because their coverage will continue. Conway and George Stephanopoulos discussed the GOP's health care plans on ABC’s This Week on June 25, 2017. Senate Republicans earlier in the week had released a bill to follow up the House plan passed in May. Despite a projected $800 billion in cuts to the joint state and federal program — which Conway characterized not as cuts but as ""getting Medicaid back to where it was"" — current enrollees would not be affected, she said. ""If you are currently in Medicaid, if you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in,"" Conway said. We reached out to the White House to try to get more details on Conway’s statement, but did not get a response. Conway appears to be talking about a provision in the House version of the bill that doesn’t appear in the Senate version. In either scenario, however, experts say current Medicaid enrollees will be in danger of losing funding and benefits. First, let’s review the Medicaid expansion and how it’s funded. As part of its efforts to obtain health coverage for as many people as possible, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid and help pay for it with more federal dollars. Thirty-one states plus D.C. currently have extended Medicaid benefits to all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The poverty line for a family of four is $24,600 in 2017. For states with expanded Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act said the federal government would cover 90 percent or more of the cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients. The money Washington kicks in to cover those patients is called the federal match rate. The House bill would lower the federal match rate for new Medicaid applicants, back to the pre-Obamacare rate, which depends on the state, but would average about 57 percent by 2020. That would shift more costs of expanded Medicaid to states, and almost assuredly result in drastic changes to state programs. ""In practice, this means tens of billions of dollars cut from the Medicaid expansion, and most states wouldn’t be able to cover that gap, so they’d have to reduce eligibility, benefits or both,"" said Ben Sommers, a Harvard University health policy and economics professor. Some states even would mandate changes by law. Seven ""trigger"" states — Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington — built requirements into their Medicaid expansions to protect them from the higher costs of covering so many more people. Those states would legally have to end or curb the expansion if the federal match rate goes down. Bottom line, while the House bill would allow for an expanded Medicaid system to continue, GOP lawmakers would put less money into it and allow individual states to change eligibility requirements. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in February 2017 that about 2.6 million expansion-eligible adults would lose coverage due to these trigger laws. The House bill does allow people covered by expanded Medicaid as of Dec. 31, 2019, to continue to qualify for the higher 90 percent federal match rate under Obamacare. The ""grandfathered expansion enrollees"" would have to maintain near-continuous coverage, with no breaks of more than a month, in order to get the higher rate. That’s not as simple as it sounds. Continuous coverage can be hard for Medicaid recipients to maintain. Medicaid patients have to continuously provide proof of income, and if a patient goes over the income limit, they lose coverage. This is a concept known as churning. Joan Alker, a public policy professor and executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said that even if the bill grandfathers in those people at Obamacare funding levels, there’s no guarantee they’ll be able to keep their Medicaid benefits. ""After a few years ... it is estimated that those people will mostly all have churned off, effectively ending that protection,"" Alker said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office detailed what would happen in a March analysis of the House plan. The CBO concluded ""that fewer than one-third of those enrolled as of December 31, 2019, would have maintained continuous eligibility two years later."" If the bill became law, the higher federal match rate would still apply to less than 5 percent of newly eligible enrollees by 2024, the CBO estimated. That would be translate to about 550,000 of the roughly 11 million enrollees who now qualify for the enhanced federal matching under Medicaid expansion. ""Even under the ACA, Medicaid is income sensitive and it is typical for people other than the elderly and people with disabilities to cycle on and off,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. ""Under neither the House nor Senate bill are current expansion beneficiaries guaranteed any coverage duration."" The Senate bill, meanwhile, continues to fund Medicaid expansion at the same rates until 2020. After that, the federal contribution shrinks to 85 percent in 2021, 80 percent in 2022 and 75 percent in 2023. In 2024, the federal reimbursement rate drops to the current average of around 57 percent. For states to maintain the Medicaid expansion as is, states would have to raise spending by $43 billion in 2024 alone, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Conway said, ""If you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in."" The GOP health care bill that passed the House, along with the ""discussion draft"" circulated in the Senate, make changes to Medicaid for people who acquired health care coverage through Obamacare. The House proposal includes a grandfather clause that allows people covered by expanded Medicaid as of Dec. 31, 2019, to continue to qualify for a 90 percent federal match rate. But the ""grandfathered expansion enrollees"" would have to maintain near-continuous coverage in order to get the higher rate. Experts say that is extremely difficult because of changes in income or because of changes states could choose to make. The Senate plan, which remains just a draft, continues the Medicaid expansion program largely as is until 2020, before beginning to reduce federal funding for all enrollees. That means either states will have to pick up a larger share of the cost or make changes to the program. In either scenario, changes are likely. It's just a matter of when and how. We rate Conway’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809764DDC0>],/factchecks/2017/jun/25/kellyanne-conway/house-health-care-bill-allows-some-stay-medicaid-n/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
Dan Patrick notes education absorbs 52 percent of budgeted state spending
","After Dan Patrick popped a statistic to back his contention that Texas state government spends plenty on education, a reader asked us to check the Republican lieutenant governor’s accuracy. Patrick, in a June 2017 commentary, extolled the state budget then about to be signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, specifying: ""Texas spends $60 billion on schools in our two-year budget, including both federal and state funds. Of that, $41 billion is state funding. That is on top of the estimated $28 billion to $30 billion annually paid by local property taxpayers. ""When colleges and universities are added,"" Patrick said, ""education spending is the biggest item in the state budget — about 52 percent of all state dollars. Health care is second, accounting for most of the remaining dollars. It is disingenuous to suggest that we are, somehow, holding back funding that we could spend on schools."" Our review of budget documents posted by the Legislative Budget Board led us to find Patrick’s figure solid though the percentage also proved historic in a low-end way not stated by Patrick. Patrick cites state budget summary Up front, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia responded by email to our inquiry about the basis of Patrick’s ""52 percent"" by pointing out a chart in the 2018-19 state budget, which takes effect Sept. 1, 2017. The chart shows that the budget puts $55.9 billion in general revenue toward public and higher education out of $106.7 billion in all such revenue — which breaks out to 52.4 percent of such spending. Next highest: Nearly $34 billion budgeted for health and human services accounts for 31 percent of state spending in the budget.  SOURCE: Document, ""Summary of Conference Committee Report for Senate Bill 1, Appropriations for the 2018-19 Biennium,"" Legislative Budget Board, May 2017 (accessed June 14, 2017) Some context: The chart shows that the nearly $41 billion in public school aid appropriated by the 2017 Legislature trailed $635.6 million, or 1.5 percent, behind what lawmakers budgeted for public schools the previous two years. On the other hand, the new budget increases state spending on higher education by $195.2 million, 1.1 percent, from the 2016-17 budget, according to the chart. We asked the Legislative Budget Board about Patrick’s percentage. By email, staff spokesman R.J. DeSilva responded by pointing out the same chart offered by Patrick. Separately to our emailed inquiries, Austin school-finance expert Joe Wisnoski, who works for a firm that represents school districts, and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials didn’t quibble with Patrick’s calculation. Wisnoski added, though, that the 52 percent conclusion ""may not be the whole story."" He also pointed out that from all funding sources--including federal aid--lawmakers devoted $80 billion to education, which represented 37 percent of the full $217 billion state budget. Alternate calculation For our part, we noticed one other way of gauging the share of state revenue budgeted for education. Another chart in the budget shows that lawmakers budgeted nearly $58.8 billion for public schools and higher education in state general revenue plus the smaller pot of money consisting of state revenue dedicated to particular expenditures. The combined amount, we found, also breaks out to 52 percent of the full budget’s $113.1 billion in state revenue and dedicated state revenue:  SOURCE: Document, ""Summary of Conference Committee Report for Senate Bill 1, Appropriations for the 2018-19 Biennium,"" Legislative Budget Board, May 2017 (accessed June 14, 2017) Other state funds? When we asked about Patrick's claim, Dominic Giarratani of the Texas Association of School Boards agreed it’s fair to focus on state general revenue to evaluate budgeted spending on education. By email, though, he also provided a calculation suggesting that public plus higher education accounts for 48 percent of non-federal spending in the budget. That’s correct, it looked to us, though it’s worth noting the additional spending captured by this alternate analysis folds in chunks of money not easily controlled by lawmakers--including $1.8 billion of earnings on the endowment that benefits institutions in the University of Texas and Texas A&M University systems; nearly $4.6 billion in local tax revenue  projected to be provided by property-rich school districts, including the Austin district, to support the state’s school finance system; and nearly $3.6 billion in payments driven by a 2006 state-mandated reduction in school property taxes. Historic low? Next, we wondered how the 52 percent cited by Patrick for 2018-19 compares to the share of state GR devoted to education in previous budgets. To get a fix on that, we checked spending on education from non-dedicated GR in the previous 10 budgets. Such funds comprise the bulk of each budget and are most directly controlled by legislative decisions. Our finding: In the budgets, which encompass 20 years, no Legislature devoted less than 53 percent of general revenue to education. On average, education’s share of state spending through the budgets was 58 percent. State Revenue Budgeted for Education, Texas, 1998-99 through 2018-19 (By Percentage) BUDGET YEARS SHARE OF REVENUE* BUDGETED FOR PUBLIC AND HIGHER EDUCATION 1998-99 61 % 2000-01 63 2002-03 59 2004-05 59 2006-07 56 2008-09 59 2010-11 61 2012-13 57 2014-15 53 2016-17 53 2018-19 52 *State general revenue, excluding revenue constitutionally dedicated to particular purposes. SOURCE: PolitiFact Texas calculations drawing on state budgets adopted by Texas Legislature, 1997-2017 as posted by the Legislative Budget Board (accessed June 14-15, 2017) Our ruling Patrick, saying it’s disingenuous to suggest lawmakers held back on education aid, said 52 percent of state spending in the 2018-19 state budget was appropriated to public plus higher education. That’s an accurate percentage. Unclarified: Education also accounts for the smallest share of budgeted state spending in at least 20 years, which is as far back as we checked.

Mark Pocan claim: Seven years later, Scott Walker has not met his jobs promise from first campaign
","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan blasted Gov. Scott Walker’s ability to keep his No.1 campaign promise during the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s annual convention. Pocan, D-Madison, attacked Walker and Republican lawmakers on job growth and other issues during his 15-minute speech, at one point focusing on the governor’s failed 2010 campaign promise to add 250,000 private-sector jobs within his first term. ""Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs,"" Pocan said halfway through his June 2, 2017 speech.  The convention took place as state Democrats seek to ramp up support among its base before the 2018 mid-term elections. Walker is expected to be on the ballot again, seeking a third term. So the promise is likely to come up again … and again. Here, we’ll briefly revisit Walker’s original promise, and see where the jobs tally currently stands. The promise In 2010, Walker first sought the governor’s office on the promise that he would bring 250,000 private-sector jobs to Wisconsin by the end of his first term. ""(Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses,"" his campaign said at the time. For the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. For this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office. We made comparisons using the fourth quarter reports from the QCEW. On the Walk-O-Meter, which we use to track the governor’s campaign promises, we rated Walker’s pledge as a Promise Broken when economists said in September 2014 that it was impossible to reach his the target by the end of his first term. The picture since Wisconsin’s economy has continued to add jobs throughout Walker’s second term, but at a much slower pace. The fourth quarter numbers for 2015 and 2016 from the BLS show Wisconsin added 38,077 and 11,548 jobs respectively. The 2016 growth numbers were the worst during Walker’s tenure and the worst since the economy rebounded after the 2008-’09 recession. In total, Wisconsin has added a total of 179,778 private sector jobs during Walker’s near seven years as governor, which puts him 70,000 short of the pledged 250,000 new jobs. Pocan spokesman David Kolovson said in an email that the congressman’s claim was based on a March 12, 2017  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which stated the governor’s promise ""remains elusive."" The Journal Sentinel story listed the total number of jobs under Walker as 185,208, which differs from the total offered here because that article was published before the BLS released final numbers covering the end of 2016. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson also pointed to the same story and Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development numbers, saying in email ""we don’t have anything to add."" ""Wisconsin’s business climate has consistently improved from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best under Governor Walker, and our state’s economy is in the best shape it’s been in 16 years,"" Evenson said quoted as saying in the March story. ""We’ve seen more people employed than ever before, wages are up, and Wisconsin’s labor force participation rate continues to be one of the best in the country."" And yet, the topic of job creation under Walker lingers. President Donald Trump ran on the platform of being a jobs president, famously saying ""I’ll be the greatest jobs president God ever created."" In a June 13, 2017 visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump hinted at a major manufacturer locating to Wisconsin. The Journal Sentinel reported on June 15 that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that assembles Apple’s iPhones and other electronics, is considering Wisconsin as the site for a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, which could generate thousands of jobs. Our rating At the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s state convention, Pocan said, ""Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs."" Pocan is right to say Walker hasn’t hit his first campaign promise. In 2014, we rated Walker’s campaign pledge as a Promise Broken. The number of jobs created still falls short of that promise. We rate Pocan’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C00EDC0>],/factchecks/2017/jun/23/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-claim-seven-years-later-scott-walker-ha/
"['Health Care', 'New York', 'John Faso']","
Maternity care coverage could be lost through state health care waivers
","The U.S. Senate health care bill would allow states to waive federal requirements for what insurance plans must cover. With state waivers, insurers could skip coverage of what the current Affordable Care Act now requires to be covered, known as essential health benefits like prescription drugs, laboratory services and hospitalization. Health insurance companies in those states would be able to sell lower-priced plans with less coverage. The House included the same provision in its Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act. Rep. John Faso, a Hudson Valley Republican, defended the provision in a radio town hall before the Senate version was released. ""I read this provision extremely closely, and I don’t believe many, if any, governors will actually seek these waivers. It’s an extraordinarily limited waiver,"" Faso said. ""It doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage."" A spokesperson from Faso’s office said he was talking about how coverage for maternity care would still be required in New York state even if the state sought a waiver. Iinsurers are required to cover maternity care under New York state law, a distinction Faso did not make in his claim. Is Faso right that the new waivers would not apply to coverage for maternity care? Law on maternity care coverage Maternity care is included in one of ten health care categories insurance plans have to cover under federal law. Those categories, the essential health benefits, were established in 2010 as part of Obamacare. The benefits only apply to individual and group plans with 100 or fewer members, known as small group plans in New York state. Most states define small group plans as those with 50 or fewer members. The House and Senate bills would allow states to waive the essential health benefits requirement. Insurers in those states would not have to cover any benefit not mandated by that state’s law. ""The waiver that was included in the American Health Care Act allows states to redefine essential health benefits as it applies to individual and small market groups in their state,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow in the Center of Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. ""Maternity coverage is one thing that’s considered an essential health benefit today so a state could eliminate maternity care coverage in their state,"" Fiedler said. Maternity coverage was not federally mandated before Obamacare. Only 18 states required it in small group and individual plans prior to the 2010 health care law according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization. Large group plans, those with more than 100 members in New York state, have been required to cover maternity care since the federal 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Will could happen? The Congressional Budget Office, a federal agency that provides nonpartisan fiscal analyses for Congress, predicted maternity care coverage would be lost in states that seek a waiver. ""Services or benefits likely to be excluded from the EHBs in some states include maternity care, mental health and substance abuse benefits, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and pediatric dental benefits,"" the agency said in a report on the American Health Care Act. ""If a state only waives the requirement that plans offer maternity coverage, then it’s unlikely any plan would voluntarily offer maternity coverage,"" said Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The CBO said maternity care may be offered by insurers in those states as a rider, or addition, to a plan. But that would not come cheap. ""Without maternity coverage, new moms could expect to pay about $17,000 out-of-pocket,"" Cox said. ""Or, if they tried to buy a rider, they could expect to pay more than $1,000 per month."" Congress included $15 billion in the American Health Care Act for maternity care, mental health care, and substance use treatment. The CBO predicts that money will go to health care providers to reduce costs for patients instead of insurers. Our ruling Faso said a waiver in the American Health Care Act ""doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage."" The waiver applies specifically to maternity coverage. If a state does not require maternity coverage and is approved for a waiver, insurers there would not be required to cover maternity care.

"['Economy', 'Poverty', ""The 2018 California Governor's Race"", 'California', 'Antonio  Villaraigosa']","
California: 6th largest economy in world and one of highest poverty rates in nation?
"," Before announcing his bid for California governor in November 2016, Antonio Villaraigosa said he went ""up and down this state"" on a listening tour. The former mayor of Los Angeles said he witnessed markers of the state’s economic vitality and also its extreme poverty. ""What I saw was two Californias,"" Villaraigosa said at the forum, hosted on June 6, 2017 in San Francisco by the Public Policy Institute of California. Villaraigosa then made a statement that included two bold claims PolitiFact California has examined individually in the past. ""What people don’t realize about California is that although we have the sixth largest economy in world, we have one of the highest poverty rates"" in the nation, Villaraigosa said at the event.  Villaraigosa makes his claim at about the 6:45 minute mark in this video by the Public Policy Institute of California. We’ll revisit our analysis on those claims below. First, here’s some background on Villaraigosa and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others already announced include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include State Assemblyman Travis Allen of Orange County; John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. A poll released in June 2017 showed a tightening race. Newsom was in the lead among all candidates, with 22 percent support from likely voters. Villaraigosa had 17 percent support, up from his 11 percent three months earlier. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race.  Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at [email protected], tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. We’ve already checked one of Villaraigosa’s statements at the June 6, 2017 forum. He made the False claim that California is currently home to one-quarter of the nation’s 300 poorest cities. He mischaracterized the results of a study, which relied on data from 2013, when many of the state’s cities had not yet recovered from the Great Recession. Today, many of those same cities have experienced strong economic improvement. Sixth largest economy in the world?  Turning to Villaraigosa’s bold claim involving the economy and poverty, we’ll start by checking the first part: that California has the ""sixth largest economy in the world."" This is a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages. We fact-checked this hypothetical comparison of the state’s economy against that of nations in July 2016 when State Senate Leader Kevin de León made the same assertion at the Democratic National Convention. We rated it Mostly True based on California’s 2.4 trillion GDP in 2015, which ranked sixth behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom and slightly above France and Brazil. The rankings came from the Brown Administration, which analyzed figures from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Database. The claim missed a completely True rating because it ignored California’s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley’s outsized role in the state’s economic growth, which speaks to Villaraigosa’s description of unequal economies across the state. In a separate set of rankings, the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, adjusting for the state’s high cost of living, reported in 2016 that the state’s GDP ranking dropped to 11th in the world. That placed it just below France and just above Mexico. The Brown Administration, not including cost of living, recently updated the GDP rankings for 2016. California’s now $2.60 trillion GDP remained in the sixth spot, though it was just a tick behind the United Kingdom’s $2.62 trillion economy.  Villaraigosa’s statement is accurate, but needs the same clarification about the state’s high cost of living. One of the highest poverty rates? The second part of Villaraigosa’s claim is that California has one of the ""highest poverty rates."" We interpreted this to mean compared with other states in the nation. We know the state has struggled mightily with poverty. As an example, we rated True a claim by Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes in January that California has ""the highest poverty rate in the nation"" when comparing states and considering cost-of-living. At 20.6 percent, California’s poverty rate in 2015 was well above the national average of 15.1 percent, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report that factors in cost-of-living. Florida’s 19 percent poverty rate ranked second. Unlike Mayes’ statement on poverty, however, Villaraigosa’s claim makes no mention of cost-of-living. Ignoring this factor, California would have the 17th highest poverty rate, not the first, according to the census bureau. Villaraigosa’s statement needs this key clarification. Our ruling Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed California has ""the sixth largest economy in the world"" and one of the highest poverty rates"" in the nation.
