Chart shown at Planned Parenthood hearing is misleading and 'ethically wrong'
","Congress may have avoided a government shutdown related to Planned Parenthood funding — at least so far — but the controversy over the women’s health organization looks like it’s here to stay. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sparred with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards during a high-profile hearing on Sept. 29. One of their face-offs originated with a chart Chaffetz flashed, indicating that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than ""life-saving procedures"" in 2013, a complete reversal from just seven years ago. The chart features a pair of lines crossing — one headed upward (abortions) and the other headed downward (cancer screening and prevention services). When referring to the chart in the hearing, Chaffetz said, ""In pink, that's the reduction in the breast exams, and the red is the increase in the abortions. That's what's going on in your organization."" ""This is a slide that has never been shown to me before,"" Richards responded. ""Excuse me, my lawyer is informing me that the source of this is actually Americans United for Life, which is an anti-abortion group. So, I would check your source."" ""Then we will get to the bottom of the truth of that,"" Chaffetz agreed. Many news outlets characterized the chart as misleading, so we too wanted to get to the bottom of the truth. As it turns out, Richards’ lawyer was correct about the source of the chart -- it comes from an Americans United for Life web post from June 2015. The chart, we found, gives a misleading impression. The numbers listed on the chart are based on actual statistics, but they are small and were hard to read during the televised hearings. The chart’s most prominent feature — the much larger crossed arrows — suggests a conclusion that’s flat wrong. We reached out to Chaffetz’s office but did not hear back. A spokesperson for Americans United for Life told PolitiFact that the graphic is accurate and honest. Experts, however, begged to differ. ""That graphic is a damn lie,"" said Alberto Cairo, who researches visual communication at the University of Miami. ""Regardless of whatever people think of this issue, this distortion is ethically wrong."" Dueling axes Chaffetz’s chart falls into a category known as a dual-axis chart. On the left side, cancer screenings and prevention services are plotted in the millions. On the right side, abortions are plotted in the hundreds of thousands. But the way the chart was assembled is problematic. For starters, dual-axis charts are particularly susceptible to showing spurious correlations. With two axes, trend lines can be exaggerated and manipulated, as most people ignore the axis labels that put the numbers in context. ""It forces your brain to see a relationship that isn’t there,"" Cairo said. ""As economist Gary Smith once said, ‘If you double the axes, you can double the mischief.’ "" Second, it’s even more inappropriate to use a dual-axis chart when comparing equivalent measures (in this case, the number of services performed by Planned Parenthood) using different scales, said Enrico Bertini, a professor at New York University who studies data visualization and who called the chart ""scandalous.""   Typically, dual-axis charts are used to compare lines that represent different things — ""for instance, abortion rates and cost,"" said Bertini. ""But in this case the unit is the same.""   ""You cannot put two measures, one in the millions and one in the hundreds, without making it explicit,"" Cairo said. ""We map data into visual properties — height, length, color — but we need to keep the proportions. We cannot force the data to adopt a shape we like."" Finally, perhaps the most egregious decision was to not label the axes. Experts told us that, given this decision, they cannot rule out purposeful deception. ""By claiming to combine these two lines into one graph and then omitting the y-axis, we are being misled into to making a false comparison of two non-equivalent contexts,"" said Noah Iliinsky, a visualization and information designer based in Seattle. ""The graph is absolutely misleading, and intentionally so."" Iliinsky also said he saw ""propagandized design choices"" in the choice of the arrowheads, which suggest a ""strong continuation of these trends, which we don’t know to be true."" Corrected charts With guidance from the experts, we compiled the number of abortions and cancer screenings/prevention services from Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (we could not find a report from 2008). Here’s what the chart should look like:  As you can see from the chart, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. It is true, however, that the organization now provides fewer cancer screenings and preventive services, though medical experts said that’s more likely due to changing health guidelines than the organization prioritizing abortions. Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood and for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer. Medical groups used to recommend an annual Pap, but now suggests the test every three or five years for most women. Planned Parenthood also provides an array of other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment — services that have gone up by 50 percent since 2006 — as well as pregnancy tests. Here’s how all of the services have changed from 2006 to 2013: < A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood told PolitiFact that the number of services provided in each category tend to fluctuate from year to year for myriad reasons, ranging from changes in laws and medical practices to the opening or closure of Planned Parenthood clinics. Megan Christin, a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, speculated that the decline in contraception could be due to a growth in the use of IUDs, which last for five to eight years. Overall, if we compare abortions and non-abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood — and if we use standard scales on the axes, we see largely consistent trend lines for both:  Our ruling At the hearing, Chaffetz presented a chart that showed the number of abortions at Planned Parenthood rising higher than the number of preventive services and cancer screenings between 2006 and 2013. But that’s inaccurate, disputed by the chart’s own, hard to read numerical labels. In fact, there were three times as many cancer screenings and prevention services as abortions in 2013. Experts in data presentation said this was an egregious example of using a chart to mislead. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Oddsmakers barking about Georgia Bulldogs over the Crimson Tide
","ESPN and other news outlets are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide likely will have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. Alabama hasn’t walked on the field as the underdog in 72 consecutive games --  not since the SEC Championship against Florida in 2009, ESPN reported. Even then, as five-point underdogs, the Crimson Tide rolled over the Gators, 32-13. The team went on to win the national championship and has been favored by the oddsmakers to win every game since then --- until now. It is the longest such streak in modern college history, according to ESPN college football insider Phil Steele. That’s quite a claim -- one that caused PolitiFact Georgia to decide to temporarily step out of its comfort zone, truth-squading politicians and newsmakers, and check. So when Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide roll into Sanford Stadium in Athens on Saturday, will they really be the underdog pick for the first time in 72 games? Or is that just more hype about the Bama-Bulldog rivalry? These two teams first met back in 1895 and have battled it out 66 times over the years, with Alabama coming out on top 37 times. Saturday’s game marks the first time the Crimson Tide has visited Athens since 2008, when Georgia trailed 31-0 at halftime before losing 41-30. Underdog status isn’t a subject to be broached with university officials in Alabama, Georgia, or any state for that matter. That’s because it’s based on whether a team is or isn’t a betting favorite with Vegas oddsmakers, and betting in any form is against NCAA regulations. On Thursday, UGA was a 2.5-point  at William Hill’s Nevada sportsbook. David Purdum, who covers the gambling industry as a staff writer for ESPN Chalk, told PolitiFact how he did his calculations. Using one of several online college football preview magazines, Purdum looked at Alabama’s record against the spread since 2010 (36-34-1). The Tide’s streak as predicted game winner started with the national championship game against Texas in 2009, so adding that to the 71 games since 2010 is how Purdum, who also freelances as a high school sports reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, came up with the count of a record 72 games in a row. He also cross-checked the info with ESPN’s Stats & Information Department, he said. For this Saturday’s sellout game Between the Hedges in Athens, OddsShark.com had No. 8 ranked Georgia (4-0, 2-0 SEC) favored by a 2.5-point spread. And underdog status could still turn by kickoff on Saturday, depending on how the final betting goes. A win Saturday against No. 13 rated Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) would be a huge boost for the Bulldogs. A loss could mean another second-tier bowl season for University of Coach Mark Richt’s program. But atAt a press conference Tuesday, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt wasn’t talking like Alabama is the game’s underdog. ""They're as good or better than they've ever been, in my opinion,"" he said of Alabama. The Crimson Tide rarely finds itself in a must-win situation this early in the season. But a second straight conference loss would be devastating for the team's playoff chances, while a win would put Alabama right back on track with home dates in three of the team's next four games. Our ruling ESPN and others are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide will likely have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. That’s based on the fact that for 72 games in a row Alabama was favored in betting to win. And that wasn’t the case this week as bets started being placed for the game Saturday at Sanford Stadium. But since betting goes on down to the wire, there’s at least a possibility that the underdog status could change up to game time. That’s why they call it gambling. And given the unknown, we have to hedge a bit ourselves at this stage of the game. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D41D00>],/factchecks/2015/oct/01/espn/oddsmakers-barking-about-georgia-bulldogs-over-cri/

Ben Carson says a lot of released illegal immigrants are from Iraq, Somalia and Russia
","Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says the federal government has failed to secure the border and is releasing ""hardened criminals"" who are trying to invade the United States -- including from Iraq. Criticism about the federal government releasing criminal illegal immigrants has been a familiar talking point during the GOP presidential primary following the murder this summer of a woman in San Francisco by a convicted felon who had previously been deported. In a Sept. 25, 2015, speech at the Family Research Council’s Values Voter Summit, Carson said that after a trip to the Mexican border, he found that ""anybody could get through there."" Then he made a claim about how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement releases illegal immigrants: ""And then, you know, when they capture people, ICE tells them to release them. And a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They’re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia. And many of them are hardened criminals. And it seems like our federal government is actually fighting against the sheriffs and the people who are down there."" Two days later, Martha Raddatz of ABC News asked Carson if he had evidence that many were hardened criminals from those countries. Carson, a GOP presidential candidate from West Palm Beach, Fla., replied: ""Well, I talked to a number of the sheriffs on the borders and they've told me what kind of people are coming over. So I'm not sure that I would trust, quite frankly, any figures coming from the government, given the fact that they are the ones who are problematic."" We decided to check whether ""a lot"" of illegal immigrants who are released are from Iraq, Somalia and Russia. We couldn’t find comprehensive data on the citizenship of those who are released, but within the universe of those who are apprehended, only a tiny speck are from the countries cited by Carson. Pinal County, Arizona Carson campaign spokesman Doug Watts told us to call Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu in Arizona. Carson met with Babeu when he visited the Arizona-Mexico border in August. Babeu blasted the federal government for releasing three criminal illegal immigrants this summer who were from Iraq, Russia and Sudan (not Somalia, as Carson said). That included Dennis Valerievitch Tsoukanov of Russia, who set a police informant on fire; Musa Salah Abdelaziz Abdalla of Sudan, who had been convicted of assault; and Nasser Hanna Hermez of Iraq, who had been convicted of negligent homicide in the death of his infant daughter. In all three cases, after they had finished any term of incarceration, they were turned over to ICE, which then later released the men. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea told PolitiFact that ""ICE under current law can no longer legally hold the three individuals."" Hermez is a legal permanent resident whose conviction does not make him eligible for deportation. The other two were foreign nationals who were released based on the Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas vs. Davis. That ruling prevents ICE from indefinitely holding individuals if it’s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them. These two men were ordered to report regularly to an ICE officer. Tim Gaffney, director of administration for the Pinal County Sheriff's Office, told PolitiFact that law enforcement had seen an increase in a group referred to as ""special interest aliens"" who are from 35 countries with terrorist ties, including Iraq and Somalia. Gaffney sent PolitiFact an excerpt from a report produced by the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center and other agencies which stated that during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2014, Border Patrol apprehended 402 ""special interest aliens"" with more than half of them from Bangladesh. The three countries cited by Carson, however, were not included in the excerpt. (Gaffney said he couldn’t provide the whole report because it is ""law-enforcement sensitive."") We also found news articles that cited examples of illegal immigrants with ties to terrorist groups who had been caught along the border. But none of the articles we saw backed up Carson’s argument that any significant number of illegal immigrants were from Iraq, Somalia and Russia. The most we could find were articles like one from February, in which the Houston Chronicle posted a report from the Texas Department of Public Safety that stated that it had come in contact with special interest aliens including from Somalia with terrorist ties. There were additional news articles about two different Somali men with terrorist ties accused of smuggling Somalis into the United States. But none of these reports suggest that there are ""a lot"" of people from those nations. Illegal immigrants apprehended or removed We also looked at broader data from federal officials to gauge the frequency of aliens from the countries Carson cited. The most comprehensive data comes from the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. That data shows that for 2013 there were 662,483 aliens apprehended, including 169 from Iraq, 320 from Russia and 214 from Somalia. So, combined, the illegal immigrants from these countries add up to less than 1 percent of the total. The largest groups of illegal immigrants were from Mexico (424,978), Guatemala (73,208) and Honduras (64,157). We obtained more current data from the U.S. Border Patrol which showed the number of apprehensions by citizenship for 1.2 million deportable aliens between fiscal year 2013 and August 2015. Let’s look at the countries cited by Carson:   Total deportable aliens Honduras Mexico Iraq Russia Somalia Fiscal year 2013 420,789 46,865 267,734 5 32 7 Fiscal year 2014 486,651 91,475 229,178 7 30 6 Fiscal year 2015 through August 306,288 30,067 172,932 7 17 1 Totals 1,213,728 168,407 669,844 17 79 14 Percent of total 13.9 % 55% .001% .006% .001% Source: U.S. Border Patrol Still, Carson referred to the citizenship of illegal immigrants who were released by ICE, so we went in search of that data. Illegal immigrants released According to ICE data, the agency released 36,007 criminals in 2013 and 30,558 in 2014. The most common reason for the releases was due to a court order. However, data on country of origin for illegal immigrants who were released was not immediately available from ICE. We did find some efforts to fill in the blanks. Jeremy Redmon of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution documented cases in which the person’s country of origin refused to take them, which led to their release. The Journal-Constitution created a map to show 9,000 incidents of such illegal immigrants in cases between January 2012 and June 2014. He obtained the data through the federal Freedom of Information Act. The countries that had the highest numbers of those released because their country wouldn’t take them were Cuba (2,348), Vietnam (779), Laos (465), Honduras (450), El Salvador (419), Mexico (346) and Guatemala (336). By contrast, 47 detainees were released from Russia, 153 from Somalia and 136 from Iraq. Of course, this is only one subset of illegal immigrants who were released; however, it is one more piece of evidence that shows certain Latin American countries have higher numbers of illegal immigrants caught here than most other nations. Jessica M. Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said she has examined unpublished Border Patrol data on the citizenship of those apprehended and ""noted that there are some individuals from Middle Eastern countries apprehended each year at the land border, although not a large number."" Our ruling Carson says that when ICE releases illegal immigrants ""a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They’re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia."" Carson pointed to information from just one sheriff in Arizona, and even here he garbled the information -- the sheriff criticized the federal government for releasing three criminal illegal immigrants from Iraq, Russia and Sudan, not Somalia. When we looked at the broad sweep of data, we saw nothing to indicate that the three countries Carson cited account for a significant share of illegal immigrants. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CC540>],/factchecks/2015/oct/01/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-lot-released-illegal-immigrants-ar/

Uncle Sam is on track to make $66 billion profit off 6 years of student loans, Elizabeth Warren says
","Campaigning for U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- who has been talked up as a potential vice-presidential candidate -- hammered on an issue that she, Hillary Clinton and other national Democrats have seized on: Student loans. During her Sept. 26, 2015 speech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, given with a group of students arrayed behind her, Warren cited an oft-repeated statistic about the $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. Then she suggested that the federal government is an exploitative lender. ""Right now, the United States government charges an interest rate on student loans that covers the administrative costs, covers the bad-debt losses, covers the cost of funds and then -- on top of all that -- makes a profit for the government,"" Warren said. ""How much profit? Well, let me just give you a little slice of the loans, where we've got particularly good data. The loans that were put out between 2007 and 2012 -- that cohort of loans -- is on target right now to produce $66 billion in profits for the United States government."" Warren went on to say that the government has already spent the ""profits."" As we’ll see, there’s an odd anomaly at work here. In making the $66 billion profit claim, Warren relies on one gold-standard source -- the federal Government Accountability Office. But another gold-standard source -- the Congressional Budget Office -- says the accounting method used to produce that figure is flawed. Indeed, when the CBO has employed both the official method (which was mandated by Congress) and its own preferred accounting method, any projection of ""profit"" for the government from student loans turns into a loss. That’s because CBO’s preferred method of projecting takes into account more of the risks assumed by the government, such as defaults during hard economic times. How student loans work To help students attend college, as a 2012 PolitiFact item reported, the federal government in 1965 took three important steps: Guaranteeing student loans against default; promising a certain interest rate to the banks (even if the rates students paid were lower); and paying additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans. The result: Millions of Americans earned college degrees. But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies and produced lucrative revenue streams for banks. Some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives. In 2010, a law essentially eliminated the middle man -- the banks. The federal subsidies to the banks were replaced with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury. The Huffington Post has reported that the government is forecast to generate billions in profits from making student loans. And Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has said the government has turned student lending into a ""profit center."" But it’s not so clear cut. Warren's evidence To back Warren's claim, her Senate office referred us to a January 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress that examines matters relating to the receipt and payment of public funds. It estimated that the $454 billion in student loans the government disbursed from 2007 to 2012 will generate about $66 billion in ""subsidy income"" -- or what Warren calls profit. So, Warren cites a figure from a respected source. But as we said, the figure uses an accounting method that the Congressional Budget Office has called into question. Other views The Washington Post Fact Checker detailed some of this in examining a similar claim, when Warren said the federal government made $51 billion from student loans just in 2013. Her statement earned two Pinocchios -- the Post’s rating for a statement that contains significant omissions or exaggerations. As The Fact Checker noted, that projection was made using the mandated accounting method, which potentially underestimates the cost of the loans to the American taxpayer. The Congressional Budget Office’s preferred accounting method -- known as fair value -- essentially assesses the risk as private firms would if they made the same types of loans. We found that the CBO has pointed out the shortcomings of mandated method. In fact, it has argued for using fair value, saying it better takes into account the risks of lending to students. (Some organizations, such as the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have argued that fair value makes federal credit programs such as student loans appear more expensive than their actual cost to the government.) There is quite a difference, depending on which accounting method is used. In a May 2014 report, the Congressional Budget Office did student loan projections for 2015 through 2024. During that 10-year period, using the official accounting method that Warren relied on in making her claim, the loans are expected to generate a ""profit"" of $135 billion. But using the ""fair value"" accounting method CBO prefers, the projection is an $88 billion loss to the government. That’s a swing of $223 billion. Our rating Warren said student loans issued by the federal government between 2007 and 2012 are on target ""to produce $66 billion in profits"" for the government. Warren accurately cites an estimate from a Government Accountability Office report -- but that estimate was made with an accounting method that the Congressional Budget Office says is misleading. As the CBO has pointed out in another report, using that accounting method, student loans are projected to generate $135 billion in ""profit"" from 2015 to 2024 -- but using the CBO’s preferred accounting method, they are projected to produce an $88 billion loss. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

Is Bernie Sanders the only presidential candidate without a super PAC?
","It’s no secret that Bernie Sanders isn’t a fan of billionaires and, according to Sanders himself, he’s practically the only 2016 presidential candidate to refuse their money as well. The democratic socialist senator from Vermont has long criticized campaign finance law and offered legislation to flush big money out of the political arena. His campaign prides itself on its small donations. Speaking at the University of Chicago on Sept. 28, Sanders vowed to nominate Supreme Court justices who will overturn Citizens United, the landmark 2010 decision that opened the floodgates for unlimited donations to political fundraising organizations known as super PACs. That same day, Sanders took to Twitter to demonstrate his consistency.   ""Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC which collects money from billionaires and corporations,"" he tweeted. We wanted to look at which 2016 candidates have a super PAC. Is Sanders really the only candidate out of the 15 Republicans and six Democrats without one? A who’s who of outside spending We compiled data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group, and a Washington Post analysis. We found that Sanders’ claim largely checks out, albeit with some caveats. Sanders and Donald Trump are the only major candidates without an affiliated super PAC, the type that are typically campaign surrogates. But he and Trump both have unaffiliated super PACs backing them. We’ll get to the distinction in just a bit. Here’s a breakdown of various super PACs connected to the 2016 candidates. The data comes from the July 2015 quarterly filing to the Federal Election Commission. New quarterly reports are due in October 2015: Candidate Affiliated super PACs Unaffiliated super PACs Total raised (as of July 15, 2015) Jeb Bush, R-Fla. • Right to Rise • Millennials Rising • Vamos for Jeb $103,224,384 Ben Carson, R • One Vote PAC • National Draft Ben Carson for President • For a Better Tomorrow $6,844,986 Chris Christie, R-N.J. • America Leads • Ready for Christie $11,003,305 Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y. • Priorities USA Action • Faith Voters PAC • Balance of Power • BillForFirstLady2016 $15,674,490 Ted Cruz, R-TX • Keep the Promise • Keep the Promise I  • Keep the Promise II
• Keep the Promise III • Crusaders PAC • Jruz PAC • Take DC Back • Stand for Principle $38,425,747 Carly Fiorina, R • Carly for America • Unlocking Potential $3,492,728 Jim Gilmore, R-Va. • Growth PAC $193,094 Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. • Security Is Strength • West Main Street Values $2,897,457 Mike Huckabee, R-Ark. • Pursuing America's Greatness $3,604,987 Bobby Jindal, R-La. • Believe Again $3,685,919 John Kasich, R-Ohio • New Day for America 2016 $0 Martin O’Malley, D-Md. • Generation Forward $289,443 George Pataki, R-N.Y • We the People, Not Washington PAC $859,244 Rand Paul, R-Ky.. • Concerned American Voters • America's Liberty • Purple PAC • Forever Free PAC • Human Action • Rand PAC 2016 • OnlyRand.com $5,057,783 Marco Rubio, R-Fla. • Conservative Solutions PAC • Students for Rubio • Americans for Marco Rubio $5,057,783 Rick Santorum, R-Pa. • Working Again $0 Donald Trump, R • Make America Great Again • Hispanic Citizens for Donald Trump $0 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. • Collective Actions PAC • BillionairesForBernie $8,795 Surrogates versus supporters The difference between unaffiliated and affiliated super PACs ""gets to the core issue of coordination and non-coordination in the post-Citizens United era,"" said Robert McGuire, a research analyst with the Center for Responsive Politics. Affiliated super PACs are often created or staffed by the candidate's political allies and act as extensions of the official campaigns. Though these independent groups are not allowed to donate directly to or coordinate with campaigns, they’ve have found ways to toe the line. A few examples: Jeb Bush’s longtime strategist and friend Mike Murphy heads his Right to Rise super PAC, which has advertised on his behalf.  Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager Guy Cecil is at the helm of the pro-Clinton Priorities Action USA, while her current campaign manager has met with potential PAC donors. Martin O’Malley’s Generation Forward super PAC, established by his former press secretary, has run attack ads against Sanders.   Unaffiliated super PACs are different. The two pro-Sanders super PACs -- Collective Actions PAC and Billionaires for Bernie -- have no ties to Sanders or his campaign. In fact, Sanders team has asked the unaffiliated super PACs to cut it out. Sanders’ lawyers ""have told them to stop,"" said Michael Briggs, communications director for the Sanders campaign, referring to a cease and desist letter sent to one that formed recently. (That group didn’t file with the FEC until mid September, but received a $50,000 donation from Daniel Craig, the actor who portrays James Bond.) But because anyone can register a super PAC (this fact-check would be remiss to not mention Stephen Colbert’s Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow), candidates can do little to stop one from forming and declaring its support. The distinction between an affiliated super PAC and an unaffiliated one is significant, said Anthony Corrado, a professor who studies campaign finance at Colby College. ""Sanders has been clear in disavowing any such efforts and noting that he does not want the support of such groups,"" he said. ""So I do not believe the mere existence of a registered committee renders his point invalid."" Ahead of the PACs We should note that Sanders isn’t the only presidential candidate without an affiliated super PAC. The same could be said of Democratic rivals former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb (who’s polling at 0.8 percent), former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee (who’s polling at 0 percent) and Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig (who doesn’t appear in the polls at all and who, before declaring his candidacy, famously started a super PAC dedicated to ending all super PACs). But among the more prominent candidates, Sanders is indeed the odd man out. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has more affiliated super PACs than anyone else (four), while Bush’s Right to Rise has raised the most money by far: more than $103 million. In Sanders’ own party, the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action has raised $15.6 million. Donald Trump, who repeatedly touts his financial independence from donors, seems to be friendly with a super PAC created in his honor. While Trump’s not coordinating with the group on the same level as Bush or Clinton, the connections are certainly stronger than Sanders’ with his backers and ""worth noting,"" said McGuire. The billionaire attended a New York fundraiser hosted by the Make America Great Again PAC in July and said he’s grateful for their support, reports Politico. The group also received a $100,000 donation from the in-laws of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, according to Politico. Our ruling Sanders tweeted, ""Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a Super PAC which collects money from billionaires and corporations."" Out of the 21 presidential candidates, Sanders is one of five who doesn’t have an affiliated super PAC. Sanders’ qualifier -- ""virtually"" -- makes his claim more accurate. If we narrow the count to major candidates, only Sanders and Trump can claim that, but both have two unaffiliated super PACs backing their candidacy. Trump has appeared at a fundraiser for one super PAC that’s also received donations from his in-laws. Sanders, meanwhile, has disassociated himself with these groups, through statements and legal action. We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AA8440>],/factchecks/2015/sep/30/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-only-presidential-candidates-withou/

","There’s a reason they don’t call it Factbook. The latest example of a misleading factoid gone viral casts restrictive gun policy as a backfiring failure, with two countries as case studies.  On one side of the post is Honduras, with a population of 8.2 million people and a government that ""bans citizens from owning guns."" Honduras has ""the highest homicide rate in the entire world,"" the post claims. On the other side is similarly populated Switzerland, which ""requires citizens to own guns"" and has the ""lowest homicide rate in the entire world."" A reader wanted to know if the post’s counterintuitive message is right. The source of the claim was not immediately clear, though we found some examples of websites and figures repeating the message. Here’s why it’s flawed. Population  We’ll pause on the numbers and start with an overriding issue with the post’s premise. It holds up population as the sole constant that justifies comparing these countries’ gun policy and violence. Even though Honduras and Switzerland are No. 94 and No. 96 in the CIA’s list of countries by population, this metric alone is not enough reason to compare the effect of different gun control laws in either country. There’s really no point in comparing the challenges of Honduras, a lower middle-income country in Central America beleaguered by corruption and violence from the drug trade and gangs, to Switzerland, an affluent country nestled in western Europe. ""Of course, what you want to do is compare countries where everything else is the same, except for guns and gun laws, to see if guns and gun laws have any effect,"" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health.  ""Switzerland and Honduras are not even close to being the same in many aspects of their society that will influence the levels of violence and homicide."" The post ignores a litany of cultural, political and socioeconomic factors that play into gun violence, or a lack thereof. The gross domestic product per capita, to name one, is $2,435 in Honduras and $84,733 in Switzerland, according to the World Bank. ""The determinants of homicide rates are multiple and not very well understood, and guns laws may indeed be one among many, many determinants,"" said Christopher Mikton, World Health Organization technical officer for violence prevention. ""But to point them out as the sole cause is wrong."" But even if you choose to ignore the macrofactors, the post messes up the particulars, too. Rates Honduras indisputably has the highest homicide rate in the world, with estimates ranging from a rate of 90.4 intentional homicides per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the United Nations, to 103.9 per 100,000 population, according to the World Health Organization. This was significantly higher than the rates of neighboring El Salvador (41.2), which has reduced its homicide rate following a truce among gangs, the UN said in its 2013 Global Study on Homicide. The vast majority, more than 80 percent, of those homicides are linked to a firearm. Lethal shootings most often occur in urban centers and areas along the Atlantic coast and border regions, which suggests the violence is linked to drug trafficking patterns and gangs, according to a report on Honduras by the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research project. Switzerland’s homicide rate is among the lowest in the world, but the meme goes too far in saying it’s the very lowest. By the UN and WHO measures, the most recent Swiss intentional homicide rate is 0.6 deaths per population. Several countries — including Japan and Singapore, which have very strict gun laws, as well as Iceland and Luxembourg — posted lower rates than Switzerland in either one or both of the UN and WHO data sets. Laws The post is wrong about the gun laws in each country. Honduras doesn’t ""ban"" citizens from owning guns. The Small Arms Survey says the most popular gun in Honduras is the 9mm handgun, ""which can be legally purchased and owned"" — undermining the meme’s claim that Hondurans are banned from owning guns. Because this weapon is banned in nearby Mexico, the UN has said the difference in laws fosters the exchange of illegal weapons between the countries. An analysis of gun laws in six Latin American countries by Insight Crime, a foundation that studies crime and policy in Central America, characterizes Honduras’ regulations as ""light"" compared to the ""restrictive"" laws of Brazil and Mexico and ""moderate"" laws of Venezuela and Chile. Uruguay also has ""light"" gun control laws but an incredibly smaller homicide rate than Honduras of about 5.9 percent per 100,000 people. (It also has less organized crime.) The disparity in homicide rates and gun control laws showed ""gun legislation, on its own, means little in terms of gun violence,"" the Insight Crime analysis found. The gun culture in Switzerland is altogether different. The country boasts the third-highest firearm ownership per capita rate, trailing the top-ranked United States and Yemen. Honduras is No. 88. A 2012 Time story about Switzerland’s gun culture notes how citizens hold their right to own guns as a patriotic duty, and Swiss children often join sharpshooting groups to hone their skills. But, again, Switzerland does not require ""citizens to own guns."" The government issues a gun to men for their mandatory military service, but the gun is taken home under ""carefully controlled conditions without ammunition,"" said Mikton, the WHO officer who is also Swiss. ""As soon as they have finished their military service — typically around 30 years of age — they have to return the gun,"" he said. Swiss gun laws are more strict than the post implies, though less tough than some other European Union countries. Swiss law requires mandatory background checks on civilian handgun purchases and licenses for the concealed carry of weapons, and it bans automatic weapons. Our ruling The viral post aims to jolt readers with a counterintuitive implication: Gun laws can lead to deadly unintended consequences. But the post is flawed on many levels. The comparison based on similar population size alone is shallow, and non-scientific. Moreover, Switzerland does not have the world’s lowest homicide level, and the post is flatly wrong about the laws in each country. This claim rates Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D27B40>],/factchecks/2015/sep/30/viral-image/viral-flawed-post-compares-honduras-switzerland-gu/

Donald Trump says the unemployment rate may be 42 percent
","During the televised press conference in which he announced his tax plan, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump returned to a claim he has made before -- that the official unemployment rate -- currently 5.1 percent -- woefully undercounts the percentage of people who are unemployed. During the Sept. 28, 2015, media event, Trump described an unemployment rate in the range of 5 percent as ""such a phony number."" ""The number isn't reflective,"" he said. ""I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent."" He continued, ""5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent."" We previously rated False a claim by Trump that ""our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent."" So if 18 to 20 percent is false, how does 42 percent rate? We took a closer look. We’ll start by offering a refresher about how the official unemployment rate is calculated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population. Not factored into this calculation are people who are not currently looking for work. This is the portion of the population that alternative measures -- such as those cited by Trump -- attempt to factor in. Broadly speaking, supporters of these alternative measures say that not working, regardless of the reason, is tantamount to being unemployed, and should be reflected that way in the official measurements. The 42% calculation We asked the Trump campaign for a source of the 42 percent figure, but they didn’t respond. The Fact Checker, however, traced it back to a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a ""plausible measure of the potential workforce."" If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you run the numbers, ""the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent,"" Stockman wrote. Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws. In the column, Stockman himself acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so. ""Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers,"" he wrote. ""We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else."" Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial. Stockman’s calculation ""treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all."" In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced. Taking another whack at the numbers All of this spotlights a long-running debate among economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than the one traditionally used. It’s within the economic mainstream to believe that the traditional method that produces 5.1 percent is too limiting, even if the far more permissive calculation that produces 42 percent is vastly overstated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics itself offers a more expansive alternative measurement of labor ""underutilization"" called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially ""unemployed"" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently the U-6 rate is 10.3 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see if we could come up with a percentage that approaches Trump’s 42 percent. We started with the 94 million Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. Here’s a summary. Category People Neither working nor officially unemployed, age 16 and up, civilians and noninstitutionalized only 94.0 million Subtract: Ages 16 to 19 9.7 million Subtract: Ages 65 and over 37.8 million Subtract: Students, age 20 to 24 8.7 million Subtract: Students, age 25 to 29 2.9 million Subtract: Students, age 30 to 34 1.4 million Subtract: Stay-at-home moms 10.3 million Subtract: Stay-at-home dads 2.0 million Subtract: Those receiving disability checks 9.0 million Subtract: Those in job training, ages 24 to 29 745,000 (estimate) Remainder: 11.5 million In other words, there are perhaps 11.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working (though they could be full-time students between 34 and 65, undergoing job training over age 29, or be affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early). If you turn this into a new type of ""unemployment"" rate, it comes out to 16.4 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 percent, but it’s only a small fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed. As Burtless told us previously, most of those suffering from being ""out of work"" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. ""The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits,"" he said. This isn't the first time Trump has used the 42 percent number. In August, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave a similar statement from Trump Four Pinocchios, the column’s harshest rating for truthfulness. Trump then repeated it in his tax-plan press conference. Our ruling Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump’s 42 percent. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DEED00>],/factchecks/2015/sep/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-unemployment-rate-may-be-42-perc/

Vast majority of Milwaukee police and firefighters make no contributions to their pensions?
","Unlike every other City of Milwaukee employee, the vast majority of Milwaukee police officers and firefighters make no contributions to their pensions, Mayor Tom Barrett says. Strictly speaking, he’s right. But it’s not quite that simple. Barrett’s claim Presenting his 2016 budget to the Common Council on Sept. 22, 2015, Barrett said he would eliminate three unpaid furlough days that had been imposed on police officers as a cost-saving measure. He said that’s a cost to the city of $1.5 million. In return, the mayor wants the police officers union to agree, during collective bargaining with the city, to more pension contributions from police officers. (Firefighters have not had furlough days, but the city is seeking in contract negotiations more pension contributions from them, as well.) ""Today we have a situation where each and every general city employee pays toward his or her pension,"" Barrett told the aldermen, ""but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not."" The numbers To check Barrett’s 88 percent claim, we asked for figures from the city pension office on what percentage of city employees make contributions -- as a portion of their pay -- toward their pensions. There are four groups of employees. Here’s the breakdown: Employee group Percentage of employees who contribute to pensions General employees 100% Police officers 11.6% Firefighters 12.3% Elected officials 100% So, Barrett is correct: 88.4 percent of police officers  -- along with and 87.7 percent of firefighters -- do not make direct contributions to their pensions.   Here’s how that came to be. Pension vs wages, Act 10 As we’ve noted, generally speaking, pension funds are built by contributions made from employees and from employers. But it has long been the case in Wisconsin that many public employers, such as Milwaukee, have covered both the employee and employer contributions. Jerry Allen, executive director of the city pension system, told us that around 1970, unions for the various City of Milwaukee employee groups negotiated contracts in which employees made concessions on wage increases in exchange for the city picking up their pension contributions. John Barmore, vice president of the Milwaukee Professional Fire Fighters union, told us the city sought the so-called ""pickup"" because both inflation and pay raises were relatively high in the early 1970s. By accepting lower raises, employees have, in effect, continued contributing to their pensions even though no direct employee payments are made, he said. Mike Crivello, president of the Milwaukee Police Association union, made the same point. In 2010, the City of Milwaukee began requiring general city employees hired in 2010 or later to make pension contributions. Then in 2011, Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 became law. It requires state and local government employees in Wisconsin -- except for police, firefighters and other public safety workers -- to make pension contributions, as well as to pay higher health insurance premiums. For the City of Milwaukee, that meant general city employees hired before 2010 also had to start making pension contributions. The city also used Act 10 to require that police officers and firefighters hired on or after Oct. 3, 2011 contribute 7 percent of their wages toward their pensions. But it remains to be seen whether unions representing police and firefighters will agree in their contract bargaining to Barrett’s call to have officers and firefighters hired before Oct. 3, 2011 make pension contributions. Barrett has not indicated that he would reinstate furlough days for police officers if they don’t agree to the pension contributions. But he has suggested that the pension issue could affect another priority of the police union: adding more officers. ""So I’m fully prepared to have a meaningful conversation about police staffing levels,"" said in his budget address. ""What I’m not going to do is cut public health nurses. I am not going to slow down the reconstruction of neighborhood libraries, gut our increased commitments to infrastructure or interrupt our efforts to build strong neighborhoods and put people to work. The best option is the fair option: everyone should be contributing toward his or her pension."" Our rating Barrett said every general City of Milwaukee employee ""pays toward his or her pension, but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not."" The Act 10 collective bargaining law, adopted in 2011, requires most public employees in Wisconsin, including all general City of Milwaukee employees, to make contributions toward their pensions. Because the law exempts police and firefighters, only Milwaukee police officers and firefighters hired since late 2011 make pension contributions -- the vast majority, 88 percent, do not. However, it’s worth noting that the police and firefighter unions in effect are paying toward their pension in that they made wage concessions in exchange for not making direct contributions to their pensions. We rate Barrett's statement Mostly True.   More on City of Milwaukee Ald. Nik Kovac says police, fire workers routinely get 4% raises (False) Milwaukee Police Association says it has offered several million dollars in savings in contract negotiations with the City of Milwaukee (Mostly False)",[<zip object at 0x0000028096973FC0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/30/tom-barrett/vast-majority-milwaukee-police-and-firefighters-ma/

NBC's Chuck Todd: Bernie Sanders was 'there' on same-sex marriage 20 years ago
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign serve as an almost constant reminder that Hillary Clinton has not always taken the lead on issues near and dear to the more liberal members of the Democratic Party. She only recently declared that she opposed the Keystone XL pipeline that would link oil from the tar sand fields of Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. On same-sex marriage, Clinton’s views evolved. As PolitiFact has described, in 1999, Clinton both supported the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and woman, and legal recognition of civil unions. By 2007, she opposed DOMA, but fell short of backing same-sex marriage. Then in 2013, she came out in favor of same-sex marriage pure and simple. Chuck Todd, the host of NBC’s Meet the Press, focused on same-sex marriage during an interview with Clinton on Sept. 27, 2015. ""Bernie Sanders has been where you are on these issues,"" Todd said. ""Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago. Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, ‘Well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.’"" Clinton said Sanders could speak for himself and used the question to attack Republicans. Here, we wanted to look at whether Sanders supported same-sex marriage two decades ago. What we found was long-standing support for gay rights in general, a voting record consistent with same-sex marriage, but not much in the way of public statements on behalf of same-sex marriage itself. An early gay rights backer Todd said Sanders was ""there"" on same-sex marriage 20 years ago, but we found evidence pointing back even further. In the early 1970s, Sanders ran for governor of Vermont under the banner of the Liberty Union party, a coalition of leftist groups. The party platform called for making taxes tougher on corporations and lighter on families, an end to the Vietnam War and a number of measures to get government out of people’s private lives. ""The Liberty Union believe that there are entirely too many laws that regulate human behavior,"" Sanders wrote in an open letter. ""Let us abolish all laws which attempt to impose a particular brand of morality or ‘right’ on people. Let’s abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc.)."" There’s an image of that letter, thanks to Alternet.  While you could read Sanders’ sweeping reference to all laws dealing with homosexuality as including same-sex marriage, it doesn’t specifically say that. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., Sanders supported a gay pride parade in 1983, saying ""we must all be committed to the mutual respect of each other’s lifestyle."" Sanders also put through a 1984 housing anti-discrimination ordinance that protected people based on ""his or her sexual preference."" In 1995 on the House floor, Sanders came to his feet to chastise a Republican congressman who attacked supporters of a tougher Clean Water Act as ""the same people that would put homos in the military."" According to a Boston Globe article at the time, ""You used the words 'homos in the military,' "" Sanders shouted at Cunningham. ""You have insulted thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country."" So Sanders has a long track record on the side of gay rights in general. When it comes to same-sex marriage and Todd's reference to ""20 years ago,"" Todd is pointing to Sanders' votes related to the Defense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 In May 1996, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced a bill most notable for its section on definitions. The bill, best known as DOMA, empowered states to disregard same-sex marriages that might be legal in other states. It also defined marriage as ""only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."" Sanders had a couple of key opportunities to vote as DOMA moved through the House. As the bill was headed for a final vote, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., offered an amendment that would allow each state to set its own definition of marriage. Sanders joined about 100 lawmakers in supporting Frank’s amendment, far short of the total needed. On DOMA itself, Sanders was part of a smaller group of opponents, just 67. The bill passed and President Bill Clinton signed it in September. We wondered if Sanders made any public statements about DOMA in 1996. A search of the Congressional Record and the Nexis news database turned up nothing. His campaign staff couldn’t provide any examples from that time. We contacted Susan Murray, a Burlington lawyer and a co-founder of the Vermont Freedom to Marry Task Force. Murray said members of her group met with Sanders in 1996. ""He opposed DOMA and explicitly told Freedom to Marry so,"" Murray told us. ""The meeting was not focused on whether Bernie affirmatively supported marriage equality."" Same-sex marriage was not on the legislative table in the mid 1990s. When Todd said Bernie was on board before it was popular, the survey numbers back him up. In 1996, Gallup found that 68 percent of the public opposed marriage between couples of the same sex. Vermont passed a civil union law in 2000. Sanders supported it. The year before, Gallup found that 62 percent of the public opposed marriages between people of the same sex. In 2006, Sanders opposed a Republican-sponsored constitutional amendment that defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In an Associated Press interview, Sanders said the measure was designed to divide the public, and he praised Vermont’s civil union law. Vermont ""led the way,"" but noted that it was ""a very divisive debate."" The AP reported that when asked if Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, Sanders said, ""Not right now, not after what we went through."" Our ruling Todd said that Sanders was ""there"" 20 years ago on the issue of same-sex marriage. What we found specific to same-sex marriage is that Sanders opposed defining marriage exclusively as between a man and a woman. He expressed that opinion through his votes, and in conversations with activists in his state. Todd’s claim is accurate. We rate it True. Editor's note, March 21, 2016: This fact-check has been updated to include Sanders' 2006 positions and comments to the Associated Press. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A81C0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/29/chuck-todd/nbcs-chuck-todd-bernie-sanders-there-same-sex-marr/

John Kasich says when he left the U.S. House, 'we had a $5 trillion surplus'
","Against the backdrop of acrimony in the House Republican Caucus -- leading to the resignation of Speaker John Boehner last week -- Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is harking back to his own tenure in the House, when, in his view, things moved more smoothly. ""Look, I was there in the '90s when we actually got things done,"" Kasich said in an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation. ""Think about it. We changed the welfare system, which had been in place for about 40 years. We balanced the budget, of which I was chief architect. And we cut taxes. The economy was growing and we were doing great. And when I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus."" A reader asked us about the $5 trillion number, and we didn’t recall the surplus ever having been that high. So we looked back at the data. Kasich, now the second-term governor of Ohio, last served in the House in 2000, a year when Bill Clinton was ending his tenure in the White House and the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. That year, the federal government registered a $236 billion surplus. In raw dollars, that’s the biggest one-year surplus in American history, but it’s not anywhere near the $5-trillion number that Kasich mentioned. So what’s going on? The Kasich campaign said it came from a 10-year figure for the size of the future surplus as determined by the Clinton administration in 2000. The administration projected a cumulative $5 trillion surplus over 10 years, 2001 through 2010. (We should note the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, projected a lower surplus over the same time period of $4.6 trillion.) Of course, this never actually panned out, for a variety of reasons, including the technology bust, the post-9/11 attack recession and the Bush tax cuts, which decreased tax revenues collected. The bigger problem with Kasich’s claim is the shorthand terminology used to describe that number. Even though Kasich said, ""When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus,"" the government never actually had a $5 trillion surplus in hand -- it had a projected $5 trillion surplus (and it was over 10 years, not one). That projection was also subject to numerous assumptions about future growth in spending and revenues -- assumptions that, as it turned out, didn’t hold. Kasich’s campaign acknowledged that his phrasing was somewhat elliptical. ""It’s a bit of budget jargon to shorthand it to a ‘$5 trillion surplus’ and leave off the ‘projected,’ but it reflects the way these types of projections are used in policy and budget planning,"" said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich. Kasich ""typically notes that the $5 trillion was a projected surplus, but failed to do so in this instance,"" added Rob Nichols, another Kasich spokesman. Our ruling Kasich said, ""When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus."" His rationale for the $5 trillion figure is reasonably sound, but he was inaccurate in how he referred to it. It was a 10-year cumulative projection for future surpluses, rather than a one-year actual surplus, and the savings turned out to be ephemeral due to unforeseen events. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B1FDC0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/29/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-when-he-left-us-house-we-had-5-tr/

Is there Planned Parenthood funding in the bill that stops a government shutdown?
","Congress needs to pass a spending bill by Sept. 30, 2015, or there’ll be a government shutdown. Some members of Congress want to leverage this deadline to defund Planned Parenthood. But the bill Congress will likely pass -- a short-term spending bill that funds the government through Dec. 11 -- doesn’t include funding for Planned Parenthood to begin with, said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., on Fox News Sunday Sept. 27. So Congress shouldn’t shut down the government over funding the women’s health organization. ""Well, first of all, look, on Planned Parenthood -- there's no money in the short-term (spending bill) for Planned Parenthood,"" Cole said. ""Ninety percent of their money comes from Medicaid, not from anything we're going to do. And the remainder is awarded on what are called grants. They're all done in about April. There's none left to do this year, literally none. So, the idea that we're fighting over money for Planned Parenthood is -- it's a canard. It's just not true."" Is it true that this spending bill -- which could shut down the government if it’s not passed -- doesn’t include any money for Planned Parenthood? We decided to find out. Federal budget and Planned Parenthood funding To understand what Cole’s talking about, we need to consider a key distinction in the federal budget. For the most part, federal spending is either mandatory or discretionary. The mandatory category includes what are commonly referred to as entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Annual spending for these programs is based on the number of people eligible for the program. Mandatory spending effectively runs on autopilot unless Congress changes this formula. Discretionary spending goes toward pretty much everything else. Congress determines the amount of discretionary spending -- program by program -- through the annual appropriations process. When we talk about getting a budget or else the government will shut down, we’re talking about discretionary spending, because that’s what funds most agencies and government salaries. Keep that distinction in mind as we break down where Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from. Planned Parenthood receives about $450 million each year in federal funds. Government funding (including state funding, too) accounts for about 41 percent of Planned Parenthood’s yearly revenue, according to the group’s annual report. Of the $450 million in annual federal funds, about $390 million comes from Medicaid. Less than $1 million comes from other entitlement programs: Medicare and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Medicaid provides subsidized health care for poor Americans, and Planned Parenthood provides a significant number of poor women with reproductive health care. So nearly 90 percent of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from entitlement programs, a.k.a. mandatory spending. Meaning it’s not part of the appropriations process. The remaining 10 percent does come from discretionary spending, meaning it’s normally up for debate in the appropriations process. The $60 million comes from grants under the National Family Planning Program -- known commonly as Title X because it operates under Title X of the Public Health Service Act. However, this remainder is also not at issue at the moment. Right now, Congress is trying to pass a short-term bill that would fund the government through Dec. 11, while it comes up with a more comprehensive budget bill. Next year’s Title X grants will not be awarded until late spring, and all of this year’s grants have already been given out. So Title X grants are not included in this short-term funding bill. But just because this bill doesn’t include appropriations for Planned Parenthood doesn’t mean that members of Congress can’t use it as a vehicle for defunding the organization in future legislation. Bill language Those who want to defund Planned Parenthood by leveraging funding for the rest of the government have advocated for including language in the short-term spending bill that zeros out all funding -- even if the funding isn’t accounted for in that particular bill. The language likely would look something like the proposed Defund Planned Parenthood Act: ""Passage of the bill that would bar, for one year, federal funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates unless they certify that, during that period, they will not perform abortions or provide funds to other entities that perform abortions. The prohibition would apply to all federal funds, including Medicaid."" If that language were to become law, the effect would be immediate, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. However, Congress normally doesn’t change mandatory spending through the appropriations process because ""it doesn’t make political sense,"" he said. Reforming entitlement programs is an uphill battle, and attaching it to an appropriations bill doesn’t change that. ""It basically dooms the bill and guarantees a shutdown because those programs are so politically contentious,"" he said. Additionally, the Appropriations Committee would be stepping on other committees’ toes, Huder added. Legislating on appropriations bills is technically against the rules, though the House can waive that rule.    In any case, it appears that a ""clean"" short-term spending bill (which doesn’t zero out Planned Parenthood funding) will pass Sept. 29 or 30, pushing this fight off to December. Our ruling Cole said, ""There’s no money"" for Planned Parenthood in the bill that would keep the government open. Congress could include language in the bill that would kill Planned Parenthood funding accounted for in other legislation. This would be an unusual move by Congress and would launch a major political fight. But Cole is correct that the short-term funding bill that Congress is slated to pass does not itself fund Planned Parenthood -- largely because this bill addresses discretionary spending, while the vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from mandatory spending through the Medicaid program. We rate Cole’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B72C0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/29/tom-cole/there-planned-parenthood-funding-bill-stops-govern/

Jay Nixon says 90% of I-70 toll-road funding would come from non-Missourians
","The search for money to fund infrastructure improvements has Gov. Jay Nixon open to the idea of turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road. On Aug. 20, Nixon spoke to nearly 1,000 people at the State Fair’s 63rd annual Governor’s Ham Breakfast. After the event, Nixon took questions from reporters and shared his thoughts on turning I-70 into a toll road. Nixon said, ""almost nine out of every 10 pennies"" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. ""Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent there would be from folks outside Missouri, with the federal dollars, and then (with) the folks traveling through here,"" Nixon said. ""So you can get a road built, 90 percent (of) a brand new road, by non-Missourians, (a road) that we use a lot. ... I think that's still is something that should be looked at very carefully."" The numbers Nixon cited jumped out at us, so we decided to see if he had his facts right. The journey for answers began by reaching out to Scott Holste, the governor’s press secretary. Holste said Nixon’s claim was ""part of an extemporaneous answer to a reporter’s question at the State Fair."" The numbers cited by Nixon for the construction revenue of I-70 would be based on tolls collected from vehicles, as well as construction funds received from the federal government, Holste said. He also provided a Missouri Department of Transportation report, which lays out tolling options for I-70. The project cost could range between $2 billion and $4 billion.  The report analyzed a 200-mile stretch of I-70 from Independence, Mo. to Wentzville, Mo. (Basically, all of I-70 in Missouri outside the St. Louis and Kansas City metro areas.) No data from the report, however, aligned exactly with Nixon’s claim, but there were some interesting details about truck traffic, which Holste pointed out. ""Some 70 percent of the truck traffic on I-70 originates and terminates from outside the 200-mile study limits of Independence to Wentzville – many of those originate or are destined from locations outside Missouri,"" the report stated. Put another way, trucks passing through this stretch continue on to somewhere else. Holste said this information suggests those trucks come from out-of-state. In addition, trucks would face a toll rate two to three times higher than the 10-15 cents per mile rate for passenger vehicles, according to the report. Add those two facts together, Holste said, and it suggests out-of-state trucks would carry a greater share of the cost  a per-vehicle basis. Not 90 percent, but something. In addition to truck traffic bringing in extra dollars, Holste said the federal government will help pave the way. Under The Highway Trust Fund, the federal government  is responsible for reimbursing states a certain project types. This means up to 80 percent of construction costs will be paid by funds from the federal level, Holste said. So, in theory, 80 percent of the revenue used to fund an I-70 toll road would come from the federal government. But that by itself is misleading. The transportation trust fund is dependent on fuel taxes paid in each state, which are deposited in the trust fund to pay for transportation projects. In other words, Missourians would be responsible for a portion of the funding for the trust through the gas taxes they’ve paid. We wanted to be thorough in our analysis of Nixon’s claim so we contacted Bob Brendel, the special assignments coordinator for MoDOT and a contributing writer of the original report Nixon’s office cited. When asked about Nixon’s claim, he said the best data for what we are looking for is in the MoDOT report. The data supporting out of state truck traffic comes from a study conducted between 2006 and 2009, Brendel said.  The report Holste provided was prepared in 2014 to provide data to support the idea of turning I-70 into a toll road. The data paint an interesting picture for out-of-state truck traffic, but don’t touch on how much toll revenue might be paid by out-of-state or ""non-Missourian"" drivers if I-70 was a toll road. ""To determine the percentage of traffic from out of state would require a detailed origin-and-destination study that has not been conducted,"" Brendel said. Brendel also pointed out another important feature about the Highway Trust Fund. The portion of money from the federal government would only reimburse Missouri for 80 percent of project work. So Missouri would only see federal money after construction is complete. Our ruling Nixon claimed that ""nine out of every 10 pennies"" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. His office later clarified that the remark was ""part of an extemporaneous answer"" to a question from a reporter. In reality, it’s a guess. The report Nixon’s office cited includes many interesting traffic figures, but none of them support his specific claim. And while the federal highway trust fund would cover much of the work, some of that money comes from gas taxes paid by Missourians. Nixon has a point that a toll road would bring in a good chunk of revenue from out-of-state drivers and  the federal government. But 90 percent? That’s an unsubstantiated guess. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC0280>],/factchecks/2015/sep/29/jay-nixon/jay-nixon-says-90-i-70-toll-road-funding-would-com/

Bernie Sanders says federal government, not McDonald's or Walmart, is biggest low-wage employer
","Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has been outspoken about his desire to raise the federal minimum wage. Last week, ahead of Pope Francis’ visit to the nation’s capital, the senator from Vermont joined low-wage federal contract workers during a strike to advocate for a higher wages. During his speech to protesters, Sanders compared the government to the two companies with the largest U.S. workforces: Walmart and McDonald’s. ""There is no justice in America when the largest low-wage employer is not McDonald’s; it is not Burger King; it is not Walmart; it is the United States government,"" Sanders said. He later tweeted a shorter version of the statement, mentioning only Walmart and McDonald’s. We wondered whether Sanders was right that the U.S. government is the biggest employer of low-wage workers in the country. While Sanders can find some support in the data, he ignores some important qualifiers. By the numbers When we reached out to Sanders’ camp, policy director Warren Gunnels said the claim is based on this 2013 report from Demos, a liberal economic think tank. The report defines ""low-wage"" workers as those earning below $12 per hour. More critically, the report counts workers who are employed by federal contractors, not those directly employed by the government. Here is a summary of the report’s estimates, which we double-checked for accuracy. The report estimated the number of low-wage workers at McDonald’s by using the percentage of low-wage workers in the food-service industry more generally, while it used a University of California-Berkeley report to estimate the number of low-wage employees for Walmart. McDonald’s total U.S. employees (includes franchise employees): 859,978 McDonald’s U.S. low-wage employees: 580,485 Walmart total U.S. employees: 1,400,000 Walmart low-wage employees: 901,600 Total workers on federal contracts: 6,791,437 Low-wage workers on federal contracts: 1,992,000 So the number of federal contract workers, at nearly 2 million, exceeds the number of Walmart and McDonald’s workers combined, at 1.48 million. Jonathan Rothwell, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the difference is due to how large the government is in comparison with McDonald’s and Walmart. Indeed, if you look at the numbers as percentages, low-wage workers make up less than one-third of the total federal contract workforce. By comparison, the percentages for McDonald’s and Walmart are much higher -- 67.5 percent and 64.4 percent, respectively. ""It is quite likely that the federal government is the largest vendor of just about every kind of worker -- high, medium, and low-wage workers included,"" Rothwell said. The government does not directly pay these workers Another problem with Sanders’ claim is his use of the word ""employer."" Employees on federal contracts are not directly employed by the U.S. government. Workers under these types of contracts work in a wide array of industries, ranging from construction to food service to health care. ""The U.S. government does not employ contract workers in the legal sense of the word,"" Rothwell said. ""(Contract workers) work for a firm, which contracts with the federal government."" Multiple federal laws govern the pay of federal contract workers. The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts require federal contract workers involved in the construction and repair of public buildings and other public works to be paid ""the locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits."" More recently, President Obama signed an executive order in February 2014 that raised the minimum wage to $10.10 for all workers on federal construction and service contracts. Obama also signed an executive order in September to make federal contractors give workers up to seven days of sick leave per year. Still, advocates of higher wages for federal contract workers argue these laws aren’t enough. The National Employment Law Project calls federal contract workers ""the hidden federal workforce."" According to a 2013 report by the NELP, ""low-bid federal contracting and exemptions to the Service Contract Act and Public Contracts Act mean that hundreds of thousands of workers paid by the federal government via contractors or similar arrangements work for sub-standard wages in poor conditions."" David Neumark, an economics professor and director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California-Irvine, agreed that the connection between federal contract workers’ wages and federal government policy is tenuous. ""Presumably, the low-wage workers hired by contractors are low-skill workers,"" he said. ""It may suck that low-skill people earn low wages, but that is a problem of the economy more generally. … The claim that we are ‘subsidizing’ low wages is a red herring. We are probably paying market wages. They just happen to be low."" Government employees tend to be paid well The federal government directly employs about 2.7 million people, according to Drew DeSilver, a senior writer at Pew Research Center. We couldn’t find any exact statistics on how many of these workers make less than $12 per hour, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, federal government workers with no college degree ""earned about 21 percent more, on average, than similar workers in the private sector."" ""When we look at those directly employed by the federal government, low-skilled workers tend to be paid more than they would get paid in the private sector,"" said Adam Ozimek, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. ""The government actually tends to pay less for higher skilled workers."" According to occupational employment statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90 percent of workers across all levels of government make more than $12 per hour in half of the 50 states. Our ruling Sanders said that ""the largest low-wage employer is not McDonalds or Walmart but the US government."" Measured by the raw numbers, more federal contract workers make less than $12 an hour than workers at Walmart and McDonalds combined. But he is incorrect to suggest these workers are directly employed by the U.S. government, as they actually work for private companies. In addition, a much smaller percentage of federal contract workers make less than $12 an hour when compared to McDonald’s and Walmart. In terms of actual government employees, the U.S. government has historically paid low-skill federal civilian workers more than similar occupations in the private sector.

No, graduated tax rates did not drive wealthy from New York
","After months of debate, the Democrat-controlled Illinois General Assembly recently approved a measure placing a question on the 2020 ballot asking voters to lift the state’s constitutional ban on taxing different income levels at different rates. We’ve reviewed a number of exaggerated claims from both sides about the effects of a graduated rate structure, which is backed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and opposed by Republican lawmakers and prominent state business groups. With the question headed for the ballot box next year, supporters and detractors alike have plenty of time to continue making their case for or against switching out the state’s flat-rate income tax, which is currently set at 4.95%. Several days before the measure passed the legislature, a group of Republican House lawmakers held a press conference to voice their concerns. One freshman who spoke out against the plan pointed to New York as a cautionary tale, citing remarks from that state’s Democratic governor. ""Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo of New York said, ‘tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the rich. God forbid the rich leave,’"" said Rep. Mike Murphy of Springfield. ""When they implemented a program similar to this, they had a 2 to 3% shortfall in their (revenue) forecast because of the outward migration of their top earners."" We confirmed with Murphy that he was referencing comments Cuomo made in early February when he announced New York tax collections came in $2.3 billion below projections for December and January. When we spoke with Murphy by phone, he told us he got his information from an editorial published in February by Investor’s Business Daily. That piece focused on Cuomo’s warning that asking New York’s wealthiest earners to pay more was spurring them to decamp for lower-tax states. What Murphy neglected to mention during the press conference was that Cuomo wasn’t criticizing his state’s graduated income tax rate structure. Rather, Cuomo’s remarks were aimed at what he thought were the effects of economic uncertainties such as stock market volatility combined with new limits placed by a 2017 Republican-led federal tax overhaul on the deductibility of state and local income taxes. ""‘Implemented' might have been a poor word to use,"" Murphy told us after we pointed out that New York state income tax rates haven’t changed substantially in a decade. ""‘Continuing to’ would have been a better word, maybe."" That argument holds up no better, however, because Cuomo himself provided no proof of the supposed exodus he described. Single filers in New York pay a rate of at least 6.85% on income over $215,400, according to the Tax Foundation. Illinois lawmakers are currently considering a bill that would begin applying higher rates to income greater than $250,000 if voters approve the constitutional change. Under that plan, which Murphy opposes, an Illinoisan making more than $750,000 annually would be charged a 7.99% rate on her or his entire income. Meanwhile, New York applies its highest rate of 8.82% to earnings above $1.07 million. Since New York raised state taxes on top-bracket earnings in 2009 to help close a budget deficit, the number of federal tax filers in that state with income greater than $200,000 has grown annually, data from the Internal Revenue Service show. And there were roughly 210,600 more filers reporting top incomes in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, than there were in 2006, before the Great Recession, when rates paid by high earners were lower. Indeed, Cuomo’s own warning relied on evidence his administration acknowledged was only sketchy. ""Anecdotal evidence suggests that high income taxpayers are considering changing their residence and that financial industry firms are looking at real estate outside of New York,"" read a slide included in his February presentation. And New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted collections could improve with state tax payments in April, a prediction that proved accurate. New York revenues dropped by $3.7 billion for the year ending March 31, records show, but by April as annual tax returns were filed there were clear signs of a rebound. Revenues from the personal income tax in New York were up 57 percent this April from the comparable month in 2018, according to a report from DiNapoli’s office. We ran Murphy’s claim by state finance expert David Merriman, who questioned the broader connection Murphy sought to make between high tax rates on top earners and out-migration. ""As far as we know, there’s very little mobility in response to these tax rates on very high income groups,"" said Merriman, who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois and recently co-authored a report outlining the academic evidence on the subject. A recent Better Government Association analysis also found the number of high-income tax filers in Illinois grew during a period several years ago when Illinois’ flat income tax rate jumped a record 67%. That occurred despite warnings from critics that the tax hike would lead to a big exodus from Illinois of wealthy taxpayers. Citing remarks made in February by the governor of New York, Murphy claimed that when that state ""implemented a program"" to tax the wealthy at higher rates it saw a revenue shortfall ""because of the outward migration of their top earners."" Cuomo did raise the specter of out-migration among the state’s better-off taxpayers when personal income tax revenues came in below projections early this year. But he blamed the drop on fallout from the Republican federal tax overhaul of 2017 and other factors, not graduated income tax rates in New York which haven’t been raised in a decade. What’s more, IRS data show the number of people filing with income greater than $200,000 in New York has increased every year since 2009 when New York raised rates on top earnings to levels similar to those currently under consideration in Illinois.

Sorry Tim Kaine, there are no tobacco frescoes on the state capitol's ceilings
","U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mitch McConnell have introduced a bill that would raise the age for buying tobacco products from 18 to 21. The senators say they’re bothered by a surge in tobacco use by young people, brought on by e-cigarettes. The senators represent two of the largest tobacco-growing states: McConnell, the Republican majority leader, is from Kentucky; Kaine is a Virginia Democrat. Kaine acknowledged tobacco’s huge historic role in Virginia while introducing the bill in a May 20 floor speech. ""Tobacco has had such a place in our history that in the ceiling of both legislative chambers in the Virginia capitol, designed by Thomas Jefferson, the ceiling is circled by gold-embossed tobacco leaves,"" he said. In Virginia, it’s lore that the ceilings in legislative chambers are adorned with tobacco frescoes. But is it true? We fact checked the claim, spread by Kaine and many others, and it went up in smoke. Two experts told us there are no depictions of tobacco on the ceiling - or anywhere - in the chambers. ""I can’t think of anything that would be plausible in the House and Senate chambers,"" said Mark Greenough, the capitol’s historian since 2002. Although theres a forest's worth of leaves in the chambers, ""they’re not tobacco,"" said Susan Schaar, clerk of the state Senate since 1990. Let’s take a tour: Spanning the widths of the ceilings are embossed rows of sheafed leaves and berries. To the untrained eye, they may pass as tobacco. But Schaar, who grew up on a tobacco farm, knows better. ""Tobacco doesn’t have berries,"" she said. A large, oval skylight, centers the ceiling of each chamber, tightly framed in a rectangular panel. In the deep corners of the panel that the curved skylight doesn’t reach are the superimposed letters VA, painted blue and gold surrounded by embossed leaves. But again, they have berries. What are thesefronds with berries? ""The laurel produces small round fruit or berries and that would resemble what we see here,"" Greenough said. At least half of the leaves in the chambers don’t have berries. They're painted on canvases in recesses where the walls and ceilings meet. They're frescoed on the borders of ceiling panels. All are painted gold. Closer to the ground, berry-less leaves emboss the plasterwork surrounding doors and windows, and on pillar-like structures that jut from walls. Schaar and Greenough say these are acanthus - a leaf that has adorned classic Greek and Roman architecture since ancient times. Thomas Jefferson relied on that style when he designed the state capitol in the 1780s. Jefferson, however, did not design the house and senate chambers that wing the original capitol building. They were built in the very early 1900s. Greenough said the architect took pains to design the chambers in the exact Greek-Roman style of the Ionic order that Jefferson used. The chambers opened in 1906, but there wasn’t time to decorate them before the General Assembly session began. So everything, including the frescos, was painted bright white. That’s how the cghambers looked until 1908, when Virginia’s first lady - Elizabeth Swanson - was put in charge of the decoration. Early this century, the chambers were meticulously restored to Swanson’s design. Kaine, in his speech, twice described the ceiling leaves as gold-embossed. But this needs elaboration. Greenough said there’s no gold-gild on the ceiling. What was used originally and during the restoration was much cheaper Dutch metal paint. The bottom line: ""It’s not gold-gild paint, and it’s not tobacco,"" Greenough said. But those determined to find tobacco in the capitol may be able to declare a small victory. You have to leave the chambers and go to the rotunda, designed by Jefferson. Looking up to the corners of the third-floor ceiling, you can see long leaves painted rusty brown. ""There's nary a berry to be found,"" Greenough said, pointing to the leaves. ""So, you know, at least it creates an opening for  those who really want to find tobacco leaves in the Rotunda. I'm not going to swear to it."" We sent an email with our findings to Kaine’s press secretary - Katie Stuntz. ""We learn something new every day!"" she wrote back. ""Thank you to the capitol historian and senate clerk for setting the record straight."" Our ruling Kaine said the ceilings of the Virginia Senate and House chambers are ""circled by gold-embossed tobacco leaves.""   Experts say there’s not a fleck tobacco on the ornate ceilings and walls of the chambers. What you see is likely laurel - remember, tobacco doesn’t have berries - and acanthus, leaves used since ancient times to adorn Greek-Roman architecture like the capitol. And there’s no gild in the gold, just Dutch metal paint. Kaine was repeating a myth which, by definition, must be false. So that's what we'll rate his statement: False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D4CB80>],/factchecks/2019/may/30/tim-kaine/sorry-tim-kaine-theres-no-tobacco-frescoed-state-c/

No source for supposed Pelosi statement about undocumented immigrants
","The debate over immigration reform has long roiled Congress as Republicans and Democrats spar over how to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. But a May 20 Facebook post seems designed to undermine House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s authority in this particular fray. ""Just because someone is here illegally doesn’t mean they broke any of our laws,"" Pelosi is quoted as saying in the post. Underneath Pelosi’s photo, two Star Trek characters hold their faces in their hands in an image that seems to project weariness or frustration. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The question of whether undocumented immigrants commit a crime by virtue of being in the country is less clear-cut than it seems: At PolitiFact, we have examined the matter before and found, actually, most of the time it is not a crime to be undocumented in the United States. But the purpose of this fact-check is to determine whether or not Pelosi actually said what this post attributes to her. A spokesman for Pelosi did not immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact asking if the quote is authentic. We searched the Nexis database of English-language news for the quote and ""Nancy Pelosi"" and found only one result: a March 20 column in the Tri-County Times from Fenton, Mich., that espouses some popular conservative views and attributes the statement in the Facebook post to Pelosi. But the columnist doesn’t provide any context for the statement, such as when or where Pelosi said it. Searching for the quote online we encountered similar attributions — lacking context and often suggesting Pelosi is stupid. But we couldn’t find any credible citations for the quote. On an immigration page on her congressional website, there is no mention of crime or scofflaws. On an immigration reform page on the House speaker’s website, it says: ""We will continue to work toward a comprehensive solution for our country’s broken immigration system, and we will never stop fighting to ensure that America remains a land of opportunity for those who work hard, abide by our laws and dare to dream."" Next we looked for any similar remarks Pelosi might have made. In 2006, she said on the PBS NewsHour that not all of the millions of illegal immigrants came to the country illegally. ""Some did,"" she said. ""Some came and their visas expired or they’re on a backlog at the immigration service, when it was called the immigration service. And so a number of reasons why people’s documents are not in order, but many did come in illegally. And that is that we do have to strengthen security at the border; there is no question about that. Everyone agrees to that."" More recently, Pelosi chastised a reporter for saying ""illegal alien,"" RealClearPolitics reported in June 2018. ""Using terminology like ‘illegal aliens illegally entering the country’ is just not viewed as constructive,"" Pelosi said. ""The fact is that we have — we must protect our borders; that is our responsibility. We also must protect our values; that’s our responsibility as well."" She went on to say, ""what we’re talking about here, though, are asylum seekers, and that has nothing to do with illegal entry into the country.""   Snopes, which also failed to find evidence that Pelosi made the statement in the Facebook post when it fact-checked the claim in January, notes other politicians have shared a similar sentiment to the quote. In 2016, Democratic senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris tweeted: ""An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal."" In 2008, former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, then a U.S. attorney, said that sneaking into the country may be a civil wrong but that it isn’t criminal. ""Being in this country without proper documentation is not a crime,"" Christie said, according to a 2008 story in the Star-Ledger. ""The whole phrase ‘illegal immigrant’ connotes that the person, by just being here, is committing a crime."" The paper also quotes him as saying: ""Don’t let people make you believe that that’s a crime that the U.S. Attorney’s Office should be doing something about. It’s not."" What we couldn’t find was a quote from Pelosi. If one emerges, we’ll reconsider this fact-check. For now, we rate the Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097650380>],/factchecks/2019/may/29/viral-image/no-source-supposed-pelosi-statement-about-undocume/

What counts as a high crime or misdemeanor for impeachment? Justin Amash got it right
","Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan broke with his fellow Republicans in a series of tweets that suggested President Donald Trump might deserve impeachment by the House. One of Amash’s tweets caught our eye, because it addressed the constitutional definition of impeachable offenses. In his tweet, Amash noted that the definition of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" in the Constitution is relatively fluid, but that it has generally been seen as a breach of the public trust: ""In fact, ‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’ is not defined in the Constitution and does not require corresponding statutory charges. The context implies conduct that violates the public trust—and that view is echoed by the Framers of the Constitution and early American scholars."" In fact, “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” is not defined in the Constitution and does not require corresponding statutory charges. The context implies conduct that violates the public trust—and that view is echoed by the Framers of the Constitution and early American scholars. With growing calls for Trump’s impeachment, we wondered what the framers were actually thinking. So we reached out to scholars of impeachment to better understand the origins of the concept and how that aligns with the small number of times it’s been applied. Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Southern Methodist University Center for Presidential History and a contributor to the 2018 book Impeachment: An American History, said Amash’s understanding of the framers’ thinking, was ""spot on."" ""A high crime is an affront to the state, to the people, the body politic,"" Engel said. ""A president, or any leader really, need not break any statute in order to break the public’s trust."" The Constitution, written in 1787, says that ""the President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" But the idea of high crimes and misdemeanors goes back roughly 400 years before the drafting of the Constitution. Impeachment was typically used against ministers appointed by a monarch. As the U.S. Constitution was being drafted, some of the framers questioned whether an impeachment mechanism was necessary, under the belief that the vote of the people was sufficient. But three framers — George Mason, James Madison, and Edmund Randolph — strongly argued in favor of an impeachment mechanism. ""America’s founders established impeachment not as a catastrophic contingency, but as a legal and peaceful means for removing a rogue leader without resort to revolution or assassination,"" said Allan J. Lichtman, an American University political scientist and author of The Case for Impeachment. Still, it took much debate before the framers settled on the definition of an impeachable offense. After rejecting an initial standard of ""malpractice or neglect of duty,"" the framers considered ""treason and bribery."" But Mason and others argued that this was too narrow. Mason pointed to an impeachment taking place almost simultaneously in Great Britain — of Warren Hastings, the governor-general of India. The Hastings case involved abuse-of-power allegations that fell short of treason or bribery. Another option, ""maladministration,"" was rejected for setting too low a bar for ousting a president. Eventually, Mason suggested wording that included ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" which echoed longstanding British language. This is the wording that the framers ultimately approved. ""They recognized that just being a lousy president was no reason to subvert or preempt the standard electoral process,"" Engel said. ""A president that is an active danger, however — one who can no longer to trusted to use his or her best judgement and abilities for the sake of the people — that is one to be feared, and thus impeached."" The phrase ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is flexible but also has historical meaning. Perhaps the most famous remark about it was by soon-to-be President Gerald Ford, who said: ""An impeachable offence is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history."" In a literal sense, Ford isn’t wrong, since no court can review the House’s decision to impeach. Only the Senate has a say, when it decides unilaterally to remove or keep the president in office. (A two-thirds votes is required for removal.) However, scholars said Ford’s definition is incomplete. High crimes and misdemeanors ""is a clear legal concept that can be quite thoroughly construed according to the usual ways of constitutional construction: text, history, structure, doctrine, prudence, and ethos,"" said Philip C. Bobbitt, a University of Texas law professor and editor of Impeachment: A Handbook, New Edition. Bobbitt pointed to Federalist Paper 65, written by Alexander Hamilton, which refers to impeachment as stemming from ""offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust."" This passage, Bobbitt said, clarifies that the framers were contemplating political crimes, and not ordinary ones. Formally, ""the House can do whatever it bloody pleases,"" said Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri law professor and author of the forthcoming book High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump. ""But practically speaking, precedent has real effect. It sets the boundaries where game is played."" The number of presidential impeachments is small. Two efforts cleared the House, and one likely would have if President Richard Nixon hadn’t resigned first. Of these three examples, scholars said, the Nixon impeachment probably tracks most closely with what the framers envisioned: crimes committed against the public trust. During the Nixon impeachment process, the House Judiciary Committee staff argued that ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" historically meant offenses like ""misapplication of funds, abuse of official power, neglect of duty, encroachment on Parliament’s prerogatives, corruption, and betrayal of trust."" They added that in Britain, impeachable offenses ""had no roots in the ordinary criminal law."" Indeed, the three articles of impeachment approved by the committee involved offenses in line with this definition: obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and defiance of subpoenas. ""Then and to this day, those are considered impeachable grounds,"" said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and author of Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know. An illustration of President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial in the Senate, published in Harper's Weekly. The first presidential impeachment in U.S. history – of President Andrew Johnson — failed narrowly in the Senate. Johnson became president when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and his vision for a post-Civil War South clashed with that of Congress, which sought to aggressively enforce civil rights for freed slaves in the former Confederacy. Amid fierce legislative clashes with Johnson, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, which prohibited the president from removing certain cabinet officers without congressional approval. As part of the law, Congress included a trigger that effectively made violation of the law an impeachable offense. Johnson violated the law in 1867 when he fired his secretary of war. The House soon began impeachment proceedings. In the end, Johnson came within one vote of being ousted by the Senate. Meanwhile, the third impeachment involved President Bill Clinton in 1998, on one count of perjury and another of obstruction of justice, both concerning sexual liaisons. This effort failed in the Senate as well. Amash said that ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not defined in the Constitution but that the framers envisioned the phrase applying to violations of the public trust rather than just statutory crimes. We found that the writings of the Constitution’s framers, the discussions in the drafting of the Constitution, and the opinions of legal experts today all support Amash’s description.

Would Vermont's toxic exposure testing bill make it an outlier?
","A multi-year debate over Vermonters’ right to medical monitoring, supported by environmental advocates and loathed by industry, bubbled to the surface during a recent House debate. Under tort law, people who sue traditionally need to show proof of an injury to be awarded damages. Starting in the 1980s, some courts in the U.S. began awarding plaintiffs exposed to hazardous substances payment for diagnostic tests and other procedures for early detection of diseases they face an increased risk of developing due to exposure. Those cases are referred to as ""medical monitoring"" claims.  Bennington’s two senators, Democrats Dick Sears and Brian Campion, had sponsored a bill, S.37, in response to the contamination of private wells around Bennington with PFOA from the ChemFab plant in town.  Under S.37, Vermonters without a disease would have a ""cause of action"" to sue a company that exposed them to toxic substances through wrongful conduct for medical monitoring costs. Before awarding medical monitoring, a court would have to find that the exposure increases the risk of developing a disease. A medical expert would also have to deem that diagnostic testing beyond normal medical checkups to be reasonably necessary. Only businesses of 10 or more employees — or of 500 or more employees at multiple facilities — in the mining, manufacturing, transportation and utility sectors could be sued for medical monitoring costs under S.37.  The state discovered the Bennington area contamination in 2016. The Department of Health offered Bennington area residents testing for PFOA levels in their blood.  PFOA is one of the most toxic chemicals of the man-made PFAS chemicals. PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, do not break down in the environment and are used in a wide array of manufactured products, from rain jackets to cookware to firefighting foam. Scientists now know that exposure to certain PFAS chemicals can lead to cancer, thyroid disease, immune system damages, developmental problems in children and low birth weight.Proponents of the medical monitoring bill argue that companies that release toxic pollutants -- not the state or exposed individuals -- should have to pay for that medical testing.  A similar proposal was vetoed last year by Gov. Phil Scott, who said it created an ""unprecedented"" level of liability for Vermont businesses. During a House floor debate on the bill last week, Rep. Scott Beck, R-St. Johnsbury, introduced an amendment to S.37 favored by industry representatives that sets more stringent criteria for people in an exposed area to receive medical monitoring.  Multiple lawmakers rose to speak in favor of the amendment. Rep. Heidi Scheuermann, R-Stowe, said representatives from the manufacturing industry ""came to Montpelier this year"" with the intent of supporting medical monitoring legislation.  ""They understand the importance (of medical monitoring),"" she said on the House floor last Thursday, referring to industry. ""It’s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn’t."" Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Sen. Bobby Starr, D-Essex-Orleans, echoed similar concerns during Senate floor debate on the bill this week.  The bill passed both the House and the Senate, but is unlikely to get the governor's signature. So we were wondering, if S.37 becomes law, would Vermont be an outlier compared to the rest of the country? In an interview Wednesday, Scheuermann said that her statement came from concerns expressed by industry representatives and lobbyists. In particular, they felt the so-called ""test"" for medical monitoring in S.37 was too lenient and would impact their ability to obtain insurance, she said.  ""GlobalFoundries testified, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce testified, (Associated Industries of Vermont) testified, all pointing out the specifics of how it is out of line with other states and what that impact could be to manufacturers in our state and their ability to obtain liability insurance,"" she said.  Scheuermann also directed VTDigger to a state-by-state comparison of medical monitoring from Jill Rickard, director of policy at the state Department of Financial Regulation.  In Rickard’s comparison, five of the six states and territories referenced — Guam, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida — require plaintiffs demonstrate either significant exposure to a toxic substance or exposure greater than background levels. Courts in Guam, Florida and Pennsylvania all say that the plaintiff must have a ""significantly"" increased risk of contracting a ""serious"" latent disease. Beck’s amendment would have required exposure to a toxic substance be ""significant."" It also would have changed ""greater risk of contracting a latent disease"" to a ""significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease."" The argument between industry representative and environmental advocates on the latest version centers on whether or not to include those adjectives in the medical monitoring test in S.37.  There is little disagreement that if S.37 is signed by Gov. Phil Scott, Vermont would be the first state in the country to put the right to sue for medical monitoring into state law, and not leave the decision only to a court. So far, courts in 16 states have recognized medical monitoring claims, while 13 states have denied those claims, arguing a medical condition must arise first, according to a white paper by Ken Rumelt, a professor at Vermont Law School.  This week, 38 industry associations around the state sent a letter to senators, urging them to vote against the bill.  ""The major flaw with this legislation is that it is not consistent with what courts in other states have held regarding medical monitoring claims,"" the groups wrote in the letter. ""This will increase operational risks and costs for a wide range of Vermont employers, and make Vermont an outlier even compared to other states that have recognized this as a remedy for plaintiffs."" State and federal courts in nine jurisdictions include the requirement that the plaintiff show they are at a ""significantly increased risk"" of developing a ""serious"" disease, according to a handout from an industry lobbyist. And courts in seven jurisdictions require the plaintiff to show that exposure was either ""significant"" or ""above background levels.""  But proponents of the bill argue that the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not that different than in other jurisdictions. ""Despite what you have heard, the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not materially different than the test that exists in other states,"" wrote Jon Groveman, policy and water program director for Vermont Natural Resources Council, and Ken Rumelt, senior attorney at Vermont Law School, in testimony at the end of April.  They go on to write that, in some ways, the bill would set ""more stringent"" conditions for medical monitoring claims than other states. For example, no other states have limited medical monitoring claims to large facilities or specific industries like in S.37. Groveman and Rumelt also reference a case pending in federal court brought by Bennington residents exposed to PFOA seeking medical monitoring costs, among other damages. Judge Geoffrey Crawford issued a preliminary ruling in the ongoing Bennington case that lays out a less strict test than in S.37, they say.  In a white paper he prepared for Vermont Natural Resources Council and VPIRG, Rumelt describes the ""high bar"" plaintiffs must prove to qualify for medical monitoring from West Virginia’s Bower case. Under that eight-part test, plaintiffs must show they’ve been ""significantly exposed"" to a proven hazardous substance, putting them at an increased risk for developing a ""serious latent disease.""  ""I think it’s, to a large degree, equivalent to the Bower’s test,"" Rumelt said of S.37.   In the Bower case, ""significant exposure"" is defined as the plaintiff being exposed to a hazardous substance.  Rumelt and other proponents of the bill say that the requirement in S.37 that a physician has to testify that a plaintiff’s exposure would make additional testing beyond what is generally prescribed ""reasonably necessary"" speaks to the significance of exposure and seriousness of disease.  In an email, Groveman listed tests for medical monitoring in some of the states where courts have allowed it. California does require a plaintiff to show the ""significance and extent of exposure"" and the ""seriousness of diseases for which the plaintiff is at an increased risk,"" but  does not require the plaintiff to show that he or she is at a seriously increased risk.  In Utah, the plaintiff must show that exposure puts them at risk of developing a ""serious disease, illness or injury"" but not that there was significant exposure or a significantly increased risk. In Missouri, there is not a list of elements, but the court allowed a claim when a plaintiff has a ""significantly increased risk of contracting a particular disease relative to what would be the case in the absence of exposure.""  And in New York, courts are all over the map in whether or not they recognize medical monitoring claims. In a class action case ruling involving the National Hockey League Players’ Concussion Injury Litigation, the U.S. District Court of Minnesota reviewed medical monitoring common law throughout the country. The plaintiffs had sought to group together 28 jurisdictions that they claim allow medical monitoring. ""Plaintiffs’ grouping theory cannot be used to sidestep the widespread divergence among the states in the requirements for medical monitoring,"" Judge Susan Richard Nelson writes.  In her conclusion, Nelson cites ""widespread differences in the applicable state laws governing medical monitoring"" as a reason not to grant class certification to the plaintiffs.  Rep. Heidi Scheuermann said: ""They understand the importance (of medical monitoring). It’s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn’t."" It's true that Vermont would be the first state in the country to actually put a right to medical monitoring in state statute. Vermont would not be alone in allowing for medical monitoring ahead of a disease. Sixteen states have allowed for medical monitoring claims, while 13 state have rejected those claims. Some courts lay out more stringent criteria for medical monitoring tests, based on significance of exposure, extent of increased risk and seriousness of latent disease.  However, not all courts include those qualifiers in their tests for medical monitoring. S.37 also sets limits on what types of businesses could be sued for medical monitoring in a way that other courts have not done. And a judge in a Vermont federal court has issued a preliminary ruling that could set an arguably less strict threshold for medical monitoring claims than S.37.  We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D4440>],/factchecks/2019/may/24/heidi-scheuermann/would-vermonts-toxic-exposure-testing-bill-make-it/

No, Mark Twain never said to fear the media, but he wasn’t a fan of the press
","A scathing quote that recommends fearing ""the media"" attributed to Mark Twain is gaining steam online. The full quote reads: ""Do not fear the enemy, for your enemy can only take your life. It is far better that you fear the media, for they will steal your HONOR. That awful power, the public opinion of a nation, is created in America by a horde of ignorant, self-complacent simpletons who failed at ditching and shoemaking and fetched up in journalism on their way to the poorhouse."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Twain was himself a member of the press, but he did have a tumultuous relationship with journalists. He uttered a portion of this statement and was pretty unrelenting in his criticism of journalists – but he never used the phrase ""fear the media."" During the time period Twain was alive (the mid-nineteenth century to the very early-twentieth century) the term ""the media"" was not used in the way it is today as there was only one form of mass communication – print. We found no evidence that Twain said or wrote the first half of the quote: ""Do not fear the enemy, for your enemy can only take your life. It is far better that you fear the media, for they will steal your honor."" In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Mark Twain Journal editor Alan Gribben, said he also doubts that Twain ever employed the word ""media"" in this context. We reached out to Barbara Schmidt, a Mark Twain researcher and writer who runs TwainQuotes.com. Schmidt pointed us to a speech Twain gave in March 1873 called ""License of the Press,"" in which Twain said the second portion of the quote. The address, which Twain delivered in Hartford, Conn., encapsulated his unwavering assessment of the power of the press and the unfairness he felt to be inherent in the fact that laws existed to protect freedom of speech, but they did not protect people from the press: ""That awful power, the public opinion of a nation, is created in America by a horde of ignorant, self-complacent simpletons who failed at ditching and shoemaking and fetched up in journalism on their way to the poorhouse.  I am personally acquainted with hundreds of journalists, and the opinion of the majority of them would not be worth tuppence in private, but when they speak in print it is the newspaper that is talking (the pygmy scribe is not visible) and then their utterances shake the community like the thunders of prophecy."" A social media post attributes Mark Twain as saying it is ""far better"" to ""fear the media"" and ""that awful power, the public of a nation, is created in America by a horde of ignorant, self-complacent simpletons.."" Twain certainly had some things to say about the power of the press and the liberties he felt some members of the press took during his lifetime. But, the first half of the quote – that is better to ""fear the media"" over the ""enemy"" because the media will ""take your honor"" – appears to be fabricated. The second portion of the quote accurately displays words he said during an address in 1873.

How much has local government debt increased in Texas?
","Property taxes have been front and center at the Texas Legislature this year, with lawmakers debating proposals to constrain property tax rates while still leaving wiggle room for local governments to raise the money they need to operate. State Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, took to Twitter to voice her concern over rising property taxes and to vouch for two of her bills. ""Local Government debt in Texas has increased nearly 40% in the past 5 years,"" Cambell wrote in a tweet. ""This trend is raising Texans’ property taxes. I filed SB 462 & SB 1090 to make it harder for cities to borrow unsustainable debt that leads to higher property taxes."" We were curious about the first part of her claim — has local government debt really increased by nearly 40% in the past five years? Debt issued vs. debt outstanding Campbell’s spokeswoman Alice Claiborne said the number came from the 2018 Local Government Annual Report produced by the Texas Bond Review Board, a state board comprising Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Comptroller Glenn Hegar and House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, R-Lake Jackson, that oversees debt and debt financing across the state. These annual reports, produced by the board’s staff, look at trends in local government debt and include data from cities and counties and from school, health, water and community college districts, as well as from other special districts. Claiborne pointed us to a specific line in the report, which says that, over the past five fiscal years, ""local government debt issuance"" has increased 38.6%, rising to $32.65 billion in fiscal 2018. Case closed, right? Not so fast. Several debt and budget experts said Campbell’s tweet refers only to debt, which could leave the impression that she is talking about the growth in total debt held by local governments, or debt outstanding, which has actually increased at a much lower rate. The same report shows that over the past five fiscal years, outstanding debt held by local governments has grown 17.7% to about $230 billion at the end of the 2018 fiscal year. Debt issuance, the value Campbell’s staff pointed to, is the total principal amount of debt sold. Debt outstanding is the principal owed over the remaining life of all debt issues, according to a glossary from the comptroller’s office. ""I think the difference is subtle,"" said Bill Fulton, director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice University, in an email. ""Clearly, local debt issuance grew by almost 40%. But local debt outstanding grew by only 17% because of refinancing, payoffs, etc."" Fulton said the accuracy of Campbell’s statement depends on how the viewer interprets her remark, but added that he read her tweet as referring to outstanding debt. ""But that’s just the way I look at it,"" he said. Jon Oliver, Campbell’s chief of staff, defended her remark and rejected the idea that her claim is inaccurate due to different interpretations of the word debt. ""I would add that however it might be inferred, what she wrote was not inaccurate,"" Oliver said in an email. ""I understand different folks may interpret things differently. That’s also the nature of a tweet."" Oliver also noted that both pieces of legislation referenced in Campbell’s tweet — Senate Bills 462 and 1090 — are about bond elections, or new debt. Both bills would change the election process involving local bond proposals. One would require bond propositions on ballots to include more details, and the other would require a two-thirds majority of voters to approve bond propositions affecting property taxes. While both bills are about debt issuance, the analysis accompanying both proposals references how new bonds contribute to outstanding debt and in turn affect property tax rates. In fact, the analysis for Senate Bill 462 includes a statement that mirrors the language Campbell used in her tweet — but it explicitly refers to outstanding debt. ""Outstanding local bond debt in Texas has dramatically increased in recent years, contributing to the rapid rise of property taxes,"" the analysis reads. The analysis for Senate Bill 1090 discusses the need for property tax rates to generate ""sufficient revenue to provide payment of debt service on outstanding and projected General Obligations debt."" Given the status of both bills and what little time remains in this year’s legislative session, both proposals are unlikely to be adopted. Narrow scope offers better analysis Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said she would not have guessed that Campbell’s remark was about new debt as opposed to debt outstanding, even after looking at the legislation referenced in the tweet. Given the focus on how debt impacts property taxes, DeLuna Castro said Campbell should have narrowed her focus to look at tax-supported debt as opposed to outstanding debt in total, which includes revenue-supported debt. ""That’s the part of debt that matters as far as property taxes are concerned,"" she said in an email. ""Revenue-backed debt is paid off in other ways – user fees, customer charges (like for a utility), sales taxes, etc."" Outstanding tax-supported debt held by local governments has increased 21.2% in the past five years, to $150.22 billion; new tax-supported debt issued by local governments has increased by 32.3% in the past five years. Rob Latsha, director of the Texas Bond Review Board, and Braxton Parsons, a policy analyst at the board, said they would look at outstanding debt in the scenario Campbell described. And even then they would restrict their analysis to general obligation debt, which is backed by the credit and taxing power of a local entity. If Campbell insisted on looking just at debt issuance, Latsha and Parsons said she should have looked just at new money and excluded issuance used to refund existing debt. During fiscal 2018, the board’s report showed that more than 36% of local debt issuance was used to refund debt. Both Latsha and Parsons also warned that it is tricky to draw conclusions about how increases in debt might impact property taxes by using numbers found in their annual reports, since all local governments are lumped together and the report does not account for things like local property values and tax rates. Our ruling Campbell said local government ""debt in Texas has increased nearly 40% in the past 5 years."" Campbell's staff said she was referring to an increase in the amount of debt issued by local governments, which has increased about 38% in the past five years. But experts said her tweet was imprecise and left the impression that she was referring to outstanding debt, which has increased about 17% in the past five years. Plus, experts said looking at an increase in overall debt issued by local governments is not the best way to analyze how debt impacts tax rates.

Viral video of Nancy Pelosi slowed down her speech
","A video circulating on Facebook gives the impression that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke in a very slurred manner at a public event. That video isn’t an accurate representation of Pelosi’s speech — the audio is slowed down to a point that some social media users questioned whether she was drunk or medically impaired. ""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on President Trump walking out infrastructure meeting: ‘It was very, very, very strange,’"" said text accompanying the approximately three-minute clip. The video was posted on the Facebook page for an account called Politics WatchDog. The Washington Post published a story May 23 headlined, ""Faked Pelosi videos, slowed to make her appear drunk, spread across social media."" The story included Politics WatchDog’s video and mentioned other videos posted on YouTube that slowed her speech or suggested Pelosi spoke drunkenly. Politics WatchDog’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Pelosi on May 22 attended the Center for American Progress Ideas Conference and spoke about a failed meeting among President Donald Trump, Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. While they were supposed to talk about infrastructure, Trump walked out of the meeting, Pelosi said, questioning Trump’s intentions to work on policy. ""It was very, very, very strange,"" Pelosi said of the brief encounter with Trump. The real audio from C-SPAN is noticeably different than what Politics WatchDog posted. We sent experts links to the Facebook post and to C-SPAN’s coverage of the event. ""The one on Facebook shows more slurred and lisping than the one on C-SPAN,"" said Siwei Lyu, an associate professor of computer science at the University at Albany, State University of New York, whose research includes digital media forensics. Lyu analyzed the audio tracks and said there was ""a clear frequency difference,"" with the audio on the Facebook video showing signs of stretching. ""I can hear artifacts in the audio that would be consistent with the video being slowed and the audio being stretched,"" said Cole Whitecotton, an IT professional at the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado Denver. The Facebook video also contains duplicate frames, said Matthew C. Stamm, an assistant professor at Drexel University. ""The number and placement of duplicate frames in this video are unlikely to happen in an original video, and are a strong indicator that this video has been modified,"" said Stamm, who focuses on developing techniques to detect falsified images and videos. It’s more difficult to prove whether the video was purposefully manipulated or just sounds different due to poor streaming or other video capture and encoding issues, experts said. Politics WatchDog’s video has at least 2.4 million views and has been shared at least 47,000 times. We reached out to Politics WatchDog for comment but did not hear back by deadline. ""Just for the record we never claimed that Speaker Pelosi was drunk. We can’t control what the people in the comments think. It’s a free country. For your information we are not a conservative news outlet. Washington Post is fake news!"" Politics WatchDog wrote in a May 23 Facebook post. Trump on May 23 tweeted a separate video also taking a jab at Pelosi. ""PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE,"" Trump tweeted, along with a video from Fox Business which showed a compilation of instances in which Pelosi repeated, rephrased or stumbled over some words. Commentators in the video questioned ""what’s going on"" with Pelosi. Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, on Twitter called the second video, the one in Trump’s tweet, ""doctored"" and linked to the Washington Post’s report of inaccurate videos about Pelosi growing on social media. That second video is certainly edited to paint Pelosi in the worst light. But side by side footage of the video Trump shared with another version captured by journalists shows that Pelosi’s voice wasn’t manipulated. And, importantly, the video Trump shared on Twitter is not the same one that was posted by Politics WatchDog.

Donald Trump's international comparison of 'merit-based' immigration, fact-checked
","As he proposed more changes to legal immigration, President Donald Trump said the United States lags other countries that admit a higher rate of migrants based on education or training. Most of the 1 million green cards awarded each year are based on a family connection to someone in the United States. Now, Trump wants to flip this so that most permits are based on skills and ""merit."" ""Only 12% of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit,"" Trump said May 16. ""In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and others, that number is closer to 60, and even 70 and 75% in some cases."" We decided to fact-check his international comparison. The numbers mostly check out for the United States, and they are at least close for the other three countries. But context is needed, and it’s unclear what countries meet the high of 75% he mentioned. The White House press office did not answer our questions. A key thing to remember is that population sizes for these four countries are very different. Estimated 2017 population: United States: 326 million Canada: 37 million Australia: 25 million New Zealand: 5 million The number of people granted permanent residence includes new arrivals and those already in a country who adjust their status. Countries also use different terminology, migration categories and criteria. The term ""merit,"" for example, isn’t widely used outside of U.S. discussions and could suggest that migrants who get green cards through other avenues — such as refugees or family members of U.S. citizens — don’t merit the status. Migrants who get a green card through family links or other streams might have professional degrees and other skills, even if that’s not the basis for their admission. Family-based immigration, as a share of their respective population, is similar in Australia, Canada and the United States, studies say. But the United States does have a significantly lower rate of employment-based immigration. About 1.1 million people became permanent residents in fiscal year 2017. About 138,000 people, or 12%, did so under an employment-based category. (Other categories include refugees and relatives of U.S. citizens.) The employment-based category included multinational executives, skilled workers and professors. A small share of those green cards went to ""needed unskilled workers."" And more than half of the recipients were spouses and children of the primary applicants. In 2017, Canada admitted close to 286,500 permanent residents; about 159,300, or 56%, were under the ""economic class"" category. This category includes caregivers, entrepreneurs and other skilled workers. The number reflects applicants and immediate family members. Family members represent about half of the economic category in recent years, according to a nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute analysis. Australia’s Migration Program granted around 180,200 permanent residences in fiscal year 2016-17. About 124,000, or 68%, were under the ""skill stream"" designation. Less than half were the primary applicants. (Overall, Australia granted about 207,200 permanent residences— that includes individuals granted residence under other programs, including humanitarian. The ""skill stream"" category is about 60% of that 207,200.) The skill stream category included points-tested skilled migrants, entrepreneurs, and workers sponsored by employers. New Zealand approved residence for close to 48,000 people in the 2016-17 fiscal year. About 29,000, or 60%, were under the ""skilled/business"" stream. New Zealand’s skilled/business category covers entrepreneurs, people with exceptional talents, technicians and trade workers. The majority of approvals were for the skilled migrant subcategory, and about half were the primary applicants. So none of the other countries Trump mentioned quite reach job-based admissions of 70 or 75%, as he said. His main point, though, is that the United States’ rate is much smaller. But that doesn’t mean that Canada and Australia are ""more stingy"" on family immigration, said Daniel Griswold, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who has studied those immigration systems. Rather, it’s a reflection that they are ""far more open to employment-based immigration."" The Migration Policy Institute also looked into family-migration policies in the United States, Canada, and Australia (not New Zealand.) If dependent family members who get green cards under the economic categories are reclassified as family migrants, then family admissions become the largest category in Canada, MPI said. ""While analyses of family migration tend to focus narrowly on migrants recorded as entering through family-sponsored channels, this is only part of the picture,"" MPI said. ""Taking the dependents of migrants who enter a country through other visa categories into consideration reveals more fully the centrality of family migration in many countries."" Trump said, ""Only 12% of legal immigrants are selected based on skill or based on merit. In countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and others, that number is closer to 60, and even 70 and 75% in some cases."" In the United States, about 12% of immigrants get employment-based lawful permanent residence. In Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, residence for similar immigration categories range from 56% to 68%. For all countries, those percentages include professionals’ family members. If the accompanying family members are reclassified as family migrants, then Canada’s family migration is greater than the economic share, a study said. Relative to its population size, the United States takes in roughly the same rate of family migrants as do Canada and Australia. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D531C0>],/factchecks/2019/may/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-international-comparison-merit-based/

Viral photo of two armed men guarding a high school was taken for a yearbook, not a school shooting
","Two men with rifles appear to guard a building entrance in a dated image that is being shared on Facebook as an example of the good that can come from arming school personnel and students. Text above the image says, ""1973, a student and teacher guarding a Delaware high school after someone called in a shooting threat during a morning class. Juniors, seniors, and teachers went to their cars and trucks to grab their guns, and guard the doors between classes. No shooter ever arrived."" The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post gets this much right: The photograph was indeed taken outside of a Delaware high school in 1973. But the rest of the description falls short.   Best we could tell, the claim dates back to a 2016 reddit thread. The thread begins with the photograph and this description: ""A Student and Teacher Guarding The High School In My Hometown In 1973. There Was A Shooting Threat Called In The Morning. Students and Teachers Alike Pulled Their Shotguns From Their Trunks To Guard The Doors Between Classes."" Caleb South, who runs the blog Christians Against School Violence, tracked down the high school in 2018 after the photo became popular on social media following the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The photograph depicts two students (neither was a teacher) sitting outside Caesar Rodney High School in Camden, Del., in 1973. But the young men, said to be seniors Kendall Cool and Carl Willoughby, were not guarding the school because a shooting threat was made that morning. An inquiry by South inspired  some Caesar Rodney alumni to explain the background of the photograph in a Facebook group post: ""... spring ‘73’ we had a series of bomb scares at the time and Kendall and Carl brought their hunting rifles to the door for a photo op. I believe it was exam week and seemed like everyone knew when the bomb scares were coming in, totally upset the exam schedule…"" ""One other funny thing about it was that it was the week of the Dover football game. We got bomb scares called in 2/3/4 times a day and by Wednesday or Thursday they decided to post 2 letterman at each door. Someone had a couple of shotguns out in the truck and (thought) it'd make for a funny (photo) op. This was it. Btw, guns were empty."" It is accurate that the school experienced a spate of false bomb threats that academic year, but according to local news reports, it appears to have occurred in the fall semester. According to a November 9, 1972 article in the Wilmington News Journal, the school received a series of bomb threats over multiple days, each resulting in the evacuation of the school’s 1,600 students. The article said the Board of Education was offering a ""$100 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the persons or person who have called in more than 10 bomb threats to the high school."" About a week later, the newspaper reported that police arrested three juveniles, all students from the school, and charged them with making false bomb threats. As well, many of Caesar Rodney’s yearbook photos were uploaded online, and the photograph of the two young men can be found in the 1973 collection. A viral image post online claims it depicts a student and teacher guarding a high school in 1973 after a shooting threat was made that day, and that because they and others were armed, ""no shooter ever arrived."" The image features two students (not a teacher) with guns outside of a Delaware high school in 1973, but there was no shooting threat. A series of bomb threats were reportedly made against the school that academic year, and alumni of the school say the picture of the young men was taken for a yearbook photo op.

No, North Carolina did not ban Sharia law or make practicing it a criminal offense
","A viral Facebook post that has been shared over 68,000 times makes the claim that the state of North Carolina banned Sharia law.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

House Bill 522, which the state’s General Assembly approved with a 75-37 vote, did not make it illegal for state residents to personally practice any foreign law, including Sharia, but prohibits state courts from applying such laws in cases of divorce, child custody, child support, alimony or other family law proceedings. Opponents say laws like these, which have been ratified in multiple states and are being proposed in others, target Islam and are, according to the Anti-Defamation League, ""redundant and wholly unnecessary."" But in regard to the claim that Sharia was ""banned"": Nowhere in the bill’s language is it explicitly singled out, nor does the bill declare that practicing the religious law is a ""criminal"" offense. A popular post on social media says that North Carolina has banned Sharia law and regards it as ""criminal.""

On Colbert, Kamala Harris flubs wage gap statistic
","U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris has made equal pay a centerpiece of her Democratic campaign for president. In late May, she unveiled a plan to require employers to disclose pay data, under penalty of being fined if they fall short of paying their workers equally, regardless of gender. A few days after launching the proposal, Harris appeared on CBS’s ""Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" During the interview, Harris discussed her efforts to promote equal pay. Here’s an exchange from the May 22 show, starting about two-thirds of the way through the clip: Harris: ""The law says that men and women should be paid equally for equal work, but what we know is that in America today, women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work. African American women, 61 cents on the dollar, Latinas 53 cents on the dollar. And these are actually not debatable points."" Colbert: ""So this is not hours worked, on average. This is hour for hour."" Harris: ""Yeah, and for the same work. Or it could be the annual salary, but it’s for the same work."" Harris’ figures for African American women and Latinas are correct, as long as you compare those groups to white, non-Hispanic men working full-time and year-round, a distinction that Harris didn’t specify. However, there’s a bigger problem with what Harris said — that women are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid ""for the same work."" In a nutshell, Harris incorrectly explained the meaning of the gender wage gap. The 80 percent figure is not an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work. Instead, it refers to average pay for all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women.  When we reached out to the Harris campaign, they quickly acknowledged that Harris had misspoken, even after being prodded on the point by Colbert. Spokesman Ian Sams pointed out that Harris’ plan does not use the ""for the same work"" formulation. The most recent official data on this point, published by the U.S. Census Bureau for 2017, showed that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did. That’s up by a couple percentage points in recent years, though it did not significantly change between 2016 and 2017. As we’ve written previously, the 80 percent figure does not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and the years of experience they’ve had. So while the 80 percent figure may be used to signify some facets of women’s challenges in the workplace — such as disproportionate representation in fields that offer more flexible work schedules, even if that means earning less — the statistic cannot be used to pinpoint pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work. Other studies have shown a significantly closer match for men and women holding the same jobs. For instance, a 2013 study by the American Association of University Women that evened out those factors found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. That’s still a disparity, but it’s about one-third as big as the figure Harris cited in her tweet. ""Adjusting for workers’ hours of work narrows the gender gap below the gap mentioned by Sen. Harris,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""Adjusting for workers’ age, educational attainment, and years of work experience also reduces the gap slightly. Making additional adjustments for workers’ industry, occupation, and size of employer reduces the gap even more."" While career choices may be shaped to a certain extent by gender, ""we do not know how much discriminatory ‘herding’ there is,"" he said. It’s worth noting that the wage gap varies industry-by-industry. For instance, women working as cooks earn about 91 percent of what male cooks make, but women in retail sales earn just 74 percent of what their male equivalents earn, according to calculations by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. In an article for the job site Indeed.com in May 2019, economist Martha Gimbel cited research suggesting that ""occupation and industry differences between men and women explain about half of the gender pay gap because men are more likely to work in occupations with higher pay."" Harris said, ""In America today, women on average are paid 80 cents on the dollar of what men are paid for the same work."" The 80 percent figure compares pay for all working women to pay for all working men, so it’s wrong for Harris to characterize it as a comparison between women and men doing the same work. Research has shown a pay gap for women and men doing the same work, but it’s narrower than 80 cents on the dollar. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A3740>],/factchecks/2019/may/23/kamala-harris/colbert-kamala-harris-flubs-wage-gap-statistic/

In election security hearing, Marcia Fudge misleads about South Carolina, Ohio voting machines
","Amid fears of hacking, election officials told U.S. lawmakers they need more federal money to replace voting machines that are old or lack a paper trail. Election officials face pressure to shore up their equipment before the 2020 elections, following reports that Russia attempted to hack election systems in 2016. U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who chairs a subcommittee on voting rights, said the United States lacks regulations for voting machines. Fudge suggested that one state bought faulty machines from the one she represents.  ""I’m from Ohio by the way — a state that thought that our machines were so awful we got rid of them, but South Carolina bought them,"" she said at a May 8 hearing of the Committee on House Administration. ""This is true. South Carolina bought all the machines we got rid of because they were not effective.""  A week later, the South Carolina Election Commission wrote a letter to the committee accusing Fudge of making ""inaccurate and misleading statements."" ""At no point has South Carolina purchased machines for its current voting system once used in, but later decertified or otherwise discarded by, the State of Ohio,"" wrote Harrison Brant, the commission’s general counsel. The machines that South Carolina uses were new when the state bought them in 2004, Brant wrote. Time for PolitiFact to weigh in. Here’s the short story behind our ruling: South Carolina did not buy castoff machines from Ohio. Both states bought electronic voting machines that experts found to be vulnerable to hacks. ""Hanging chads"" in punch card machines in Florida in 2000, followed by a recount, led Congress to provide more than $3 billion for states to purchase new voting equipment. In 2004, South Carolina spent $34 million to buy 12,000 iVotronic machines from Election Systems & Software. The machines allowed voters to cast ballots electronically, and they were used statewide starting in 2006. Over the years, counties purchased some additional machines, including some refurbished machines from Florida and Tennessee. But not Ohio. In 2007, the Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner released a 300-plus page review of Ohio's electronic voting technology that also called into question the security of South Carolina’s machines. The researchers evaluated equipment by a few companies that were used in Ohio: Election Systems & Software, Hart InterCivic, and Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold). The study examined multiple vendors because Ohio counties can select their own equipment. The researchers found that all three systems lacked protections to guarantee a trustworthy election and were vulnerable to attacks. ""The security failings of the ES&S system are severe and pervasive,"" they wrote. ""There are exploitable weaknesses in virtually every election device and software module, and we found practical attacks that can be mounted by almost any participant in an election."" The vendors disputed the findings, which set off a debate in Ohio and South Carolina about whether to get rid of electronic voting machines that lacked a complete paper trail. The South Carolina Election Commission said the equipment was secure, and the election officials test it before elections to make sure. That study wasn’t the first red flag about electronic voting equipment in Ohio. In 2006, an elections panel issued a 400-page report that detailed what went wrong leading up to a botched May primary in Cuyahoga County, where it took about a week to count the results. Cuyahoga County, one of Ohio’s largest counties, includes Cleveland which is in Fudge’s district. The report criticized decisions by the county’s top election officials and multiple breakdowns amid a changeover to Diebold electronic machines. Diebold later spun off its election machines to Premier Election Solutions. After vote tabulation problems in November 2007, Cuyahoga ditched the machines. The Ohio study isn’t the only one to raise concerns about electronic voting machines that lack a paper trail. In 2006, a team of computer experts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology reported that they could find no way to verify the accuracy of votes cast on paperless touch-screens. But by then, many states had moved forward with purchasing such equipment. Criticism of such equipment has persisted, including in a recent study by Duncan Buell, a University of South Carolina computer scientist. Fudge appears to have lumped together the electronic voting machines in Ohio and South Carolina. When we asked Fudge’s spokeswoman for her evidence, she said Ohio got rid of Premier Election Solutions. We couldn’t find evidence that Brunner decertified that vendor, but she did sue them and the state won a settlement. But South Carolina didn’t buy equipment from Premier Voting Solutions; it purchased machines from Election Systems & Software. (The company bought Premier Election Solutions in 2009, though it then sold the intellectual property a year later.) ""My statement was meant to convey that South Carolina bought the same type of machines, with the same defects as those in Ohio, and experienced similar problems,"" Fudge told PolitiFact in a statement. The state remains confident in the equipment, commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told us. However, due to the age of the machines, South Carolina plans to buy a new system that will have a paper record of each voter’s ballot. Fudge said that Ohio ""thought that our (voting) machines were so awful we got rid of them but South Carolina bought them. This is true. South Carolina bought all the machines we got rid of, because they were not effective."" Her statement was confusing, and her explanation didn’t clear it up. The state did not buy machines from Ohio. A study commissioned by Ohio found multiple types of equipment were vulnerable from both of those companies. South Carolina continued to use the Election Systems and Software equipment despite the findings. That doesn’t make Fudge’s version of the story more accurate.

Who has more lakes: Minnesota or Wisconsin?
","Wisconsin and Minnesota have no shortage of regional squabbles. Packers vs. Vikings. Badgers vs. Gophers. Soda vs. pop (it’s soda). Better cold tolerance? Nicer people? More lakes? New state Tourism Secretary Sara Meaney stuck her toe into the lake dispute May 9, 2019 during an appearance on ""Wisconsin’s Afternoon News"" on WTMJ radio. ""Wisconsin, many people may not be aware, actually has 15,000 freshwater lakes,"" she said. ""More than Minnesota?"" asked host John Mercure. ""More than Minnesota,"" said Meaney. ""Absolutely. We win. We win."" Minnesota is the ""Land of 10,000 Lakes,"" as the state’s license plates declare. But Wisconsin isn’t exactly a desert. As residents of both states head for the nearest body of water in droves this Memorial Day weekend, we thought we would, well, dive into this one. Who has more lakes? Not an easy question Our quest begins with the simplest version of this question. Hey Wisconsin, how many lakes do you have? 15,074, says the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Hey Minnesota, how many lakes do YOU have? 11,842, says the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Congratulations, Wisconsin, you win? Nope. It's not nearly that simple. What makes a lake? Let's start by figuring out what a lake is. Does a lake have to have a name? Be a certain size? What if it’s actually a flowage? (And what the heck is a flowage?) What about intermittent lakes, that come and go by season (as opposed to year-round lakes)? Minnesota defines a lake as a body of water greater than 10 acres. That’s how it got the 11,482 number in its Public Waters Inventory. Wisconsin defines a lake as, well, anything it feels like calling a lake. Thousands are less than 10 acres. Of the 15,074 ""documented lakes"" in the state, 60% don’t even have a name. If we use Wisconsin’s lake database and apply the same 10-acre standard as Minnesota, Wisconsin has only 5,898 lakes. But the two state databases have different criteria for inclusion so this alone doesn’t settle our debate. Peter Boulay, a climatologist with the Minnesota DNR, said different agencies use different definitions of lake for their own purposes, but there is no nationally accepted definition. He deferred to Paul S. Welch, a University of Michigan professor who in 1935 literally wrote the book on limnology — the study of lakes and other bodies of fresh water. Welch wrote that generally accepted definitions of lake describe ""a body of standing water completely isolated from the sea and having an area of open, relatively deep water sufficiently large to produce somewhere on its periphery a barren, wave-swept shore."" But he pointed out unique lake shapes and makeup create problems for this definition and chose instead to define lakes by exclusion. Welch said ponds are ""very small, very shallow bodies of standing water in which quiet water and extensive occupancy by higher aquatic plants are common."" Anything larger, he said, is a lake. Meanwhile, the U.S. Geological Survey doesn’t officially define lakes. Its National Hydrography Dataset merges lakes and ponds into a single category. And the agency notes at least 54 generic terms have characteristics similar to a lake. Examples include a basin, a pond, a reservoir and a flowage (water accumulated upstream from a dam). Meaney’s office wasn’t much help on the definition issue. When we reached out seeking backup for the claim, spokesman Craig Trost shared this via email: ""Three facts are undeniable: 1. Minnesota boasts more than 10,000 lakes. 2. Wisconsin boasts more than 15,000 lakes. 3. 15,000 is larger than 10,000."" Of course, that just puts us back where we began. Still, our pursuit is not hopeless. We just need to use the same measuring stick for each side. We turned to Stephen Aichele, a geographer with the U.S. Geological Survey. He used the National Hydrography Dataset — which combines all inland water bodies into a lake/pond category — to compare Wisconsin and Minnesota bodies of water using various thresholds. And, in Aichele’s words, ""each variant of the question comes up the same way."" Based on the federal data: — Minnesota has 124,662 lake/pond features, while Wisconsin has 82,099. — Minnesota has 8,784 lake/pond features with a name, while Wisconsin has 5,481. — Minnesota has 14,444 lake/pond features of 10 acres or more, while Wisconsin has 6,176. For context, 10 acres is about seven-and-a-half football fields (including end zones). That’s also the cutoff Minnesota uses to define lakes. Using a 25-acre cut off, Minnesota also has more than twice as many lakes — 8,466 to 3,350. Fear not, Wisconsin readers. Our research did uncover a couple lake metrics where Minnesota is lacking.     Deepest lake: The deepest natural lake in either state is Green Lake in central Wisconsin, with a maximum depth of 236 feet. That’s 27 feet deeper than Minnesota’s deepest entry, Ten Mile Lake. (Wisconsin’s Wazee Lake in Jackson County is a whopping 350 feet at its deepest, but it’s a manmade lake made from an abandoned iron mine.) Surface area: Wisconsin also dominates in the percentage of surface area covered by lakes, with 17% compared to 8% for Minnesota. Of course, that tally is dramatically skewed by the inclusion of Lake Michigan on the Wisconsin side of the ledger, which vastly outstrips the small corner of Lake Superior claimed by Minnesota. Removing the Great Lakes from the equation, Minnesota has 5.4% of its surface area covered by lakes compared to 2.7% for Wisconsin. Minnesota also has the largest lake, with Red Lake (288,000 acres) easily topping Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago (137,708). Meaney claimed Wisconsin boasts more than 15,000 lakes — ""more than Minnesota."" But those numbers use vastly different definitions of ""lake,"" with thousands counting toward the tally in Wisconsin that wouldn’t meet the definition in Minnesota. If both states used Minnesota’s 10-acre minimum standard — or really any other reasonable metric — Minnesota has about twice as many lakes. We rate Meaney’s statement False. But we’ll still give the tourism department’s spokesman the last word here: ""At the end of the day,"" Trost said, ""we are happy to let Minnesota count their lakes and their Super Bowl championships, and we’ll count our own.""
