Ted Cruz says Facebook shut down Chick-Fil-A appreciation page. Facebook also restored it.
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, fresh from questioning Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing, asserted that Facebook inappropriately killed an appreciation day for Chick-Fil-A, the chicken restaurant that serves customers in more than 150 Texas places. We hadn’t heard that before. Was Facebook down with that? Cruz’s April 11, 2018, commentary on the Fox News website centered on what the Texas Republican described as Facebook’s suppression of conservative news stories and the like, making Facebook, Cruz wrote, far from a neutral public forum--a critique that Zuckerberg hadn't embraced. Cruz put Facebook’s suppression of chicken appreciation this way: ""Facebook’s actions have ranged from seemingly petty things – like shutting down a ‘Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day’ to blocking posts from journalists, specific religious groups and most recently, grassroots Trump supporters Diamond and Silk,"" Cruz asserted. Cruz cites 2012 account Asked the basis of Cruz’s Chick-Fil-A claim, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier provided a web link to a July 2012 Huffington Post news story that said that for some time over perhaps two days, a Facebook ""events"" page urging people to patronize Chick-Fil-A had been taken offline. According to the story, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee created the page -- urging Aug. 1, 2012, visits to the chain -- because he was upset that Chick-Fil-A was the target of criticism in the wake of Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy’s saying that ""his company supports ‘the biblical definition of the family unit.’"" We saw that the HuffPo story mentioning Huckabee’s Facebook events page touting the intended appreciation day debuted at 10:09 a.m. July 24, 2012. Nearly eight hours later, a 5:55 p.m. update of the story quoted Huckabee saying the page had been yanked down that morning. ""The Facebook event is no longer available,"" HuffPo reported, ""and Gov. Huckabee has written the following on his Facebook page: ‘A number of you are asking questions about the Chick Fil-A event. The event disappeared from my page this morning and we have asked Facebook to look into this. I will update you as soon as I know more. The event is still on and the info should be back up soon.’"" The next day, at an unspecified time, the HuffPo story was updated to say: ""The Facebook event is back and more than 125,000 people have signed up to participate."" Huckabee said on the restored Facebook events page, which was live when we started to fact-check Cruz’s claim: ""I ask you to join me in speaking out on Wednesday, August 1 ‘Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day.’ No one is being asked to make signs, speeches, or openly demonstrate. The goal is simple: Let's affirm a business that operates on Christian principles and whose executives are willing to take a stand for the Godly values we espouse by simply showing up and eating at Chick Fil-A on Wednesday, August 1. Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we’re considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant. This effort is not being launched by the Chick Fil-A company and no one from the company or family is involved in proposing or promoting it. ""There's no need for anyone to be angry or engage in a verbal battle. Simply affirm appreciation for a company run by Christian principles by showing up on Wednesday, August 1 or by participating online – tweeting your support or sending a message on Facebook."" After Cruz made his claim, we reached out to Huckabee and didn’t hear back. But Huckabee specified in a July 25, 2012, Facebook post pointed out to us by Frazier that the Facebook page he’d created to talk up Chick-Fil-A had been taken down for 12 hours. It seems, Huckabee wrote then, ""we caught a 12 hour bug… We still aren’t sure why it happened, we have been told by Facebook ‘it was a mistake,’ clearly we think it was a mistake too but aren’t so convinced it was an accident. ""Could it be,"" Huckabee went on, that ""we were were attacked because of our beliefs? Could it be that Facebook has a glitch in their system with a VERY NARROW target? Who knows if we will ever know for sure, but one thing we do know for sure is that we are back up and running…"" Huckabee’s post closed: ""So we got knocked down, but hey! WE ARE BACK UP!"" The page’s temporary vanishment evidently didn’t stop the appreciation day. According to the Facebook events page launched by Huckabee, some 653,000 people participated that day. Facebook responds We also asked Facebook and Chick-Fil-A about the accuracy of Cruz’s claim. By email, Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack responded that the events page devoted to celebrating Chick-Fil-A was ""mistakenly removed by our automated systems after we received a report that content on the page violated our policies."" Pollack went on: ""The event did not violate our policies and we worked to restore it as soon as we were aware. The event page was restored within ten hours and is still live today."" Asked which policies were at issue, Pollack replied that she didn’t have more detail because the event page ""didn’t violate any of our policies."" See Facebook’s ""community standards"" policies here. We also heard back from Jackie Jags, a Chick-Fil-A spokeswoman. Jags advised by email that the one-time appreciation day ""was not initiated by the company."" We told Frazier, of Cruz’s campaign, that we’d learned that Facebook restored Huckabee’s pro-Chick-Fil-A page within 12 hours and that it looked like the declared appreciation day occurred after all. By email, Frazier reiterated that the page was initially yanked off-line by Facebook. Cruz’s claims about Facebook, she wrote, ""are based in fact."" Our ruling Cruz wrote that Facebook shut down a ""Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day."" This claim delivers only half the bird--we mean, story. In 2012, Facebook says, it responded to an objection by removing an events page encouraging turnout at Chick-Fil-A restaurants. But the appreciation day page didn’t violate Facebook’s community standards, the company says, and it was put back online within 12 hours; the celebration occurred after all. On balance, we rate Cruz’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Donald Trump gets ahead of the facts on North Korea denuclearization
","President Donald Trump fired off a frustrated tweet about North Korea after a Sunday political news show. ""Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven’t given up anything and they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, and no more testing! Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven’t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing! NBC Meet the Press host Todd drew Trump’s ire for saying that a more positive tone for negotiations was in the air, but not more than that. ""We don’t have a release of any of those Americans that they’ve held captive,"" Todd said April 22. ""We don’t have a pledge of denuclearization as the ultimate goal."" Kim Jong Un announced North Korea will stop nuclear testing, but @ChuckTodd asks some tough questions about other unresolved diplomatic concerns. pic.twitter.com/6Jk0Y2NoR1 Trump’s tweet insisted that North Korea indeed had agreed to denuclearization, so we looked at the record. In terms of what North Korea itself has said, Trump has gotten ahead of events. North Korea announced April 20 that it would shut down its northern nuclear test site. A translation of a broadcast from North Korea’s state news agency said North Korean President Kim Jong Un unveiled the decision at a Workers’ Party Central Committee meeting. ""The northern nuclear test ground of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test,"" the newscaster said. Kim also reiterated the promise to conduct no weapon or missile tests while talks were under way. He added that tests were no longer needed because the country had met its goal of developing its weapons capability. So far, North Korea has yet to officially commit to scrapping its nuclear program. It has left it to other countries to put that possibility on the table. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told dozens of South Korean media executives April 20 that North Korea was ""expressing its commitment to complete denuclearization."" Moon said North Korea is not demanding the withdrawal of American troops from bases in South Korea. That would be a significant shift, but as the Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo reported along with Moon’s comments, ""there is still a considerable gap between Washington’s demand of the North’s denuclearization in a minimum period of time and Pyongyang’s calls for progressive and synchronous measures for denuclearization."" Denuclearization has been in the air since Kim made a rare trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The official Chinese news service Xinhua reported March 28 that Kim said, ""It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula."" Trump also tweeted about his Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo’s meeting with Kim. ""Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week, Trump tweeted April 18. ""Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!"" So, no direct statements from North Korea on denuclearization, but the word has been in play and not refuted by North Korea. The White House pointed to an opinion piece in the Washington Times as support for Trump’s latest statement. The April 19 headline said, ""North Korea agrees to ‘complete denuclearization,’ says South."" That op-ed cited an NBC News report that had the headline, ""North Korea willing to accept 'complete denuclearization' without conditions, Moon says."" The NBC News post repeated a Reuters report from April 19 that said, ""South Korea's Moon says North seeking 'complete denuclearization'."" In the nuances of diplomacy, the transition from ""seeking"" to ""agrees to"" is a big deal. ""North Korea has agreed to talk about it (denuclearization), not to do it,"" said Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, a group that funds work on U.S.-Asian policy. Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sounded unimpressed with what North Korea has promised so far, even with the closure of its test site. ""I think this announcement on Friday is better than continued testing, but it's not much better than that,"" Cotton said on CBS’s Face the Nation April 22.  ""It's an easily reversible decision, and they made no announcement about their medium- or short- range ballistic missiles that threaten hundreds of thousands of Americans in Korea and Japan just like it threatens our allies there."" South Korean skeptics of the North’s intentions have noted that denuclearization has been central in previous high-level negotiations without producing tangible results. Jannuzi said North Korea often speaks of denuclearization as the dying wish of Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung. ""They always said he wanted that the peninsula be denuclearized,"" Jannuzi said. ""All we have from the North right now is basically what’s always been there."" Trump said that North Korea had agreed to denuclearization. While North Korea has promised to halt testing and close a weapons test site, it has not officially said that it is committed to denuclearization. Other leaders have made that statement on their behalf, and even in that case, the only promise is that they are willing to talk about reaching that point. That is not the same as agreeing to do it.

No, British Intelligence didn't seize $400 million from Clinton Foundation
","The Clinton Foundation, established by former President Bill Clinton, has long been a favorite subject for sites looking to spread questionable news on the Internet. Here’s the latest example making the rounds. It was flagged as possibly providing false information, as part of Facebook’s effort to combat fake news. A website called NRTONLINE posted an article on April 14, 2018, headlined, ""BREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash."" Here are the opening paragraphs: The Clinton Foundation is once again trying to distance itself from a scandal surrounding something they’re involved in. This time, the warehouse they use in the UK to store food and toiletries to make ready for shipping to Africa and Indonesia was raided by MI6. The warehouse, which is leased by the Foundation and one other tenant, is owned by a man known for shady arms deals and exploiting cheap Asian labor for counterfeit goods. The Brits took down his office and storage space, finding 400 Million in US Dollars. Maleek Bin Shalakta has been on the UK terrorist watch list for some time. The problem: None of this ever happened. The article was lifted wholesale from the website Reagan Was Right, which -- before the site was taken down earlier this year -- described itself as a ""whimsical playland of conservative satire."" Another disclaimer read: ""Everything on this website is fiction."" You can’t find the Reagan Was Right article on its original web page any more, but a version of the article dated Nov. 10, 2017, is available on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Reagan Was Right was affiliated with Christopher Blair, a Maine man we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are a carefully curated social experiment designed to ""feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama."" Among the dubious elements of both the original Reagan Was Right article and the NRTONLINE facsimile is a reference to the nonexistent country of Latkavia, as well as a stray reference to a correspondent for ""LLOD."" The article doesn’t explain the acronym, but fake news cognoscenti will recognize it as one of Blair’s other fake (and now shuttered) sites, the Last Line of Defense. Meanwhile, the photograph that accompanies the post was published in June 2017 by the Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom to illustrate an entirely different article -- one about police evicting a group of trailer-home residents who had seized a warehouse for 24 hours. As for the publisher of the most recent version, NRTONLINE, a quick click into the site’s ""About Us"" page shows not an explanation of the site’s background but rather an un-filled-in web page template. So, unlike the Reagan Was Right version, NRTONLINE offered no indication that this article was ""satire."" The Clinton Foundation confirmed to PolitiFact that the article is ""totally false."" ""We don’t rent a warehouse in the U.K., the quote from ‘Chelsea Clinton’s assistant’ is made up, and nothing in this story seems to be based in reality,"" spokesman Brian Cookstra told PolitiFact. Fake Clinton Foundation raids are a staple of dubious web posts. For instance, in May 2017, some of our fellow fact-checkers debunked an Internet claim that a Clinton Foundation cargo ship had been caught smuggling people from Syria, drugs and illegal fruit. The source of that claim? The Last Line of Defense. Social media posts linked to an article headlined, ""British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash."" But that never happened -- the tall tale originated with a self-described satirical post.

Sherrod Brown credits Obamacare for helping pay for opioid treatment
","The Affordable Care Act is helping people in Ohio get the treatment they need for opioid addiction, said U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. ""Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act,"" he said in an April 9 speech to the City Club of Cleveland. This is a common talking point by Brown, who will face the winner of the May 8 Republican primary that features U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci and businessman Mike Gibbons, among other candidates. Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid as part of the 2010 federal health care law, and is one of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic. Experts have said that the program for the poor has helped treat those with opioid addiction. Brown was citing a valid study about the Affordable Care Act, but he didn’t precisely explain what the researchers found. We learned it is difficult to pinpoint how many have gotten this type of treatment as a result of the law. Brown cited research by Harvard Medical School. The research, conducted by health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied, was released in January 2017 when Republicans were vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though that didn’t happen. ""Repealing the ACA — and its behavioral health provisions — would have stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses,"" the researchers concluded. Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. In Ohio, the researchers found that 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. (Brown said ""right now,"" but this data is two years old.) About 151,200 obtained coverage through the Medicaid expansion and 69,225 obtained plans through the marketplace. While Brown specifically said that 200,000 were getting opioid treatment, the research was more broad, because it addresses addiction and mental health disorders in general. Sometimes Brown has more precisely explained that 200,000 figure, including in a press statement when the study was released. But at other times, he has said that 200,000 Ohioans were getting opioid treatment through the Affordable Care Act. One of the researchers confirmed for PolitiFact that the 220,000 figure referred to significant behavioral health or substance use disorder needs.   ""The data we had analyzed do not indicate how many in this group used substance use treatment services,"" said Glied of NYU. It’s clear that more broadly, Medicaid expansion has helped Ohioans seek drug treatment. Glied said that about half of all medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse treatment in Ohio is paid by Medicaid. Brown’s office spokeswoman, Jennifer Donahue, pointed to news reports showing that 500,000 low-income Ohio adults received mental health and addiction services under the state’s Medicaid expansion, including many for drug addiction. Donahue also cited news reports showing Republican Gov. John Kasich credited the Medicaid expansion for helping treat opioid addicts. Other health care experts, including the Kaiser Family Foundation, have expressed similar views that the Affordable Care Act will play a key role in tackling the opioid epidemic. Spokespersons for state departments of health, addiction services and Medicaid told us they didn’t have any data showing how many Ohioans had received opioid treatment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. However, between the time Ohio expanded Medicaid in 2014 through August 2017, more than 633,000 Ohioans with behavioral health needs had accessed services, including addiction treatment and mental health, through expanded Medicaid coverage. But we don’t know how many in this group received opioid treatment. The state data suggests that those receiving services may be even higher than the Harvard study, which was based on 2016 data, if we include additional years. Brown said, ""Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act."" Harvard and New York University researchers concluded that about 220,000 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through Medicaid expansion or purchasing insurance on the exchange, in 2016. But Brown oversimplified the study. The statistic is more broad than those who have received treatment for opioid addiction. Other state data suggest the number could be higher than 220,000, if we include multiple years. Brown’s general point that the Affordable Care Act has benefited people who need opioid treatment is supported by experts. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/apr/20/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-credits-obamacare-helping-pay-opioid/

Donald Trump falsely says James Comey memos disprove collusion, obstruction
","President Donald Trump claimed that memos written by former FBI Director James Comey ""show clearly"" that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election, and that Trump has not obstructed justice amid ensuing investigations. Comey, who Trump removed as FBI director in 2017, made detailed notes following seven encounters with Trump. Comey had testified before Congress about portions of the memos, but they became public in their entirety for the first time on April 19, which prompted Trump to claim the memos cleared his name. ""James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,"" Trump tweeted.  James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? Comey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trump’s tweet badly mischaracterizes their contents. Nowhere in Comey’s memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice. Let’s recap how the memos came to be. In July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump. On May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia. Later that month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was authorized to lead the investigation into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as other matters that ""may arise directly from the investigation."" (Rosenstein was acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the investigation.) Here’s the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasn’t in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not. To date, Mueller’s investigation has swept up four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Mueller’s team as part of a plea deal. Mueller’s probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question. The idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker. For starters, Comey’s memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump. The memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a ""patronage relationship"" with him. Comey’s memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, ""I need loyalty, I expect loyalty."" The memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go."" Finally, two days after Comey’s ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that he’d been thinking about the FBI’s Russia investigation when he fired Comey. ""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt. As in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Even when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still don’t support his claim that the writings exonerate him. Comey’s memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to ""lift the cloud"" being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him. But Comey’s final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. More recently, Comey addressed the investigation in his memoir A Higher Loyalty, where he holds open the possibility of criminal wrongdoing: ""One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Mueller’s team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. It’s certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble."" Trump said the Comey memos ""show clearly"" that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice. Nowhere in Comey’s memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals. In his book, Comey writes that the memos and the circumstances of his firing may be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing. We rate this Pants on Fire.

Florida Republicans attack Sen. Bill Nelson's legislative record
","Florida Republicans unveiled a website that portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., as a do-nothing career politician. ""Out of 860 bills he’s introduced in Congress, only 10 have passed,"" said the website No More Nelson, sponsored by the Republican Party of Florida. The Republican attack coincided with Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s announcement that he would take on Nelson in November. It’s a common strategy to attack incumbents for not having many of their bills signed into law. Our review found that Nelson has not sponsored many bills that became law. But the simple pass-fail ratio omits other ways in which members of Congress can influence legislation, and there are significant problems with the GOP’s choice of words and numbers. It is not surprising that these figures, easily extracted from Congress.gov, found their way into a soundbite. But they are a trap. It is difficult to extract quantitative takeaways from the qualitative work of legislating. Nelson’s Congress.gov profile includes links to about 860 measures that Nelson sponsored. Narrowed to those that became law, there are 10 results. But the Republicans’ comparison is flawed. While they referred to the 860 count as ""bills,"" less than half were bills. The remainder were amendments or resolutions, including a designation of National Tourism Week (which passed) and a more meaty action to help Medicare users pay for prescription drugs (which never reached a vote). Narrowing the data to only sponsored bills shows about 360 results. The larger GOP tally also includes dozens of duplicates for when Nelson introduced the same or similar bill more than once. For example, Nelson introduced the Truth in Caller ID Act three times in 2006, 2007 and 2009 before it became law in 2010. The Republicans should have been more precise in the second half of the claim, too: The party said only 10 bills from Nelson ""have passed."" Those were actually the 10 measures that made it into law. There’s a broader category of legislation that ""passed"" one chamber even if it didn’t become law. By that count, Nelson had 77 measures that passed the Senate and seven that passed the House. The broader view includes minor measures such as naming a courthouse, recognizing the Negro Baseball League and commending the Marlins for winning the World Series. When a bill passes one chamber, it is largely out of the member's control whether that bill passes the second chamber. Most major bills are worked out between committee chairs and members in leadership. The problems with the 10/860 ratio don’t end there. The Republicans stuffed the pot to include 860 Nelson’s bills, resolutions and hundreds of amendments. But their tally does not address the outcome of Nelson’s hundreds of amendments at all, focusing only on the 10 enacted bills or resolutions.   Nelson’s Congress.gov profile shows that dozens of amendments were approved in the Senate by unanimous consent or voice vote — a sign that they weren’t controversial — and a handful were approved in roll call votes. But the 10/860 comparison doesn’t capture that success. Bottom line: If the Republicans wanted to make an apples-and-apples case, then they should have only looked at bills sponsored. ""The Republican claim appears to be a jumbled mess,"" said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political scientist. ""Legislative provisions that are counted for the 860 tally also should be counted among the provisions approved by the Senate or both houses of Congress. They are not, and so (it) understates the success of the senator’s efforts."" The Republicans have been more careful about describing bills ""passed"" versus ""enacted into law"" in other places. On Twitter, for instance, the Republicans said Nelson’s ""batting average = .012 bills signed into law."" We can see their math (10/860). But congressional experts said aside from being misleading, it’s also meaningless. ""Members introduce bills for many reasons — to lay out markers, to set the stage for something that has to incubate for a long time, to make a statement,"" said Norman Ornstein, an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Conflating bills, amendments and resolutions is not fair. And getting something through one house is a big step — especially if the other party controls the other house. I wonder what the same standard would show for Marco Rubio or the other Republicans in the Senate."" We did, too. Following the same formula as the GOP, we looked at Rubio’s 476 pieces of sponsored measures and found three bills that became law. Remember, using the Republicans’ methodology, we should count Rubio’s hundreds of amendments in that 476-measure total but exclude the outcome of the amendments. Rubio’s ""batting average"" would be .006 for sponsored legislation signed into law. Pointing this out isn’t to pick on Rubio, but to show that the attack is a lousy way to evaluate any lawmaker’s record. The numbers also don’t show the many other ways to evaluate the effectiveness of a member. Members can lobby colleagues to include  language in other bills, hold hearings, negotiate agreements or provide constituent service (for example, help with getting Social Security benefits). A member may enact a single bill, but it could be an incredibly important law. Or a member might enact a lot of bills that are minor, such as renaming post offices. ""Measuring the number of laws per member, or the ratio of laws to bills, is a terrible way to assess his/her success as a member of Congress,"" said University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger. Nelson’s office pointed to several examples in which he played a role in legislation even if he didn’t sponsor a bill that passed. Nelson worked with former Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., to enact legislation to ban oil drilling off much of Florida’s Gulf Coast through 2022. Nelson was the cosponsor of a bill by Martinez, but a few months later it evolved into a separate bill that included a buffer off Florida’s coasts until 2022 — without Nelson’s name. Nelson’s office also showed PolitiFact about a dozen examples of bills Nelson sponsored in the Senate but a similar version, often in the House, was signed into law. For example, Nelson sponsored a bill to extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for one year. The House version to extend the act for 10 years became law in 2013. Smith said that the Republicans failed to acknowledge the reality of being a legislator in the minority. ""It is difficult for a minority party member to get credit for legislative activity when the majority party wants to deny him a high success rate,"" he said. ""I find the Republican claim to be virtually meaningless."" Nelson enjoyed majority Democratic control in the House from 1979-91. He has been in the U.S. Senate since 2001, including stretches when Democrats were in the minority and majority. The Republican Party of Florida said out of 860 bills Nelson has introduced in Congress ""only 10 have passed."" The Republicans have boiled down Nelson’s legislative record into a sound bite that has several holes. Those 860 measures are not all bills, but also amendments and resolutions.

Democrat touts party endorsement. Party: we want you to resign
","Since state Rep. Duane Hall won his first election in 2012, his name has been accompanied by the letter ""D"" for Democrat. But this year, it appears that he’s misusing the party label. Hall, a Raleigh attorney, is serving his third term representing state House District 11 and is seeking a fourth. But to earn it, he’ll first have to beat challenger Allison Dahle in the May 8 Democratic primary. Now, perhaps to reinforce his status as the strongest Democrat in the race, Hall is circulating mailers that suggest he’s endorsed by the Democratic Party. One mailer boasts that Hall is ""making education priority one."" And at the bottom, the words ""endorsed by"" accompany a blue ""D"" with a circle around it. The logo is almost identical to the one used by the Democratic National Committee. Hall indeed received the support of Democrats in previous elections. The Wake County Democratic Party included Hall’s name on voter guides at the polls in the 2014 and 2016 general election, said Virginia Reed, the group’s executive director. ""He has been listed on our Democratic candidate slate cards in the past which could be considered an implied endorsement,"" Reed said. And the North Carolina Democratic Party promoted Hall in a similar manner, party spokesman Robert Howard said. No primary endorsements However, PolitiFact North Carolina found that neither the Wake County Democratic Party, the NC Democratic Party nor the DNC have endorsed Hall in his primary race against Dahle. On Wednesday, each party organization told PolitiFact that they don’t endorse any candidates in primary races. ""We have not endorsed any 2018 candidates and will not until after May 8th,"" Reed said on behalf of the county party. ""The state party supports Democratic candidates in the general election but does not typically endorse legislative candidates in the traditional sense, leaving that to local and county parties,"" Howard said. In fact, the state party has been the opposite of supportive of Hall this year. On Feb. 28, party chairman Wayne Goodwin called on Hall to resign from the legislature because he faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Calls to resign ""Sexual harassment is never acceptable – no matter the party or politics. These are serious allegations and Representative Hall should step down,"" Goodwin said in a statement. ""The North Carolina Democratic Party has no tolerance for sexual harassment and we continue to encourage women to speak out against inappropriate behavior of any kind."" Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, also called Hall to resign. Hall, for his part, denied that he has harassed anyone. Nonetheless, on Thursday, the DNC joined the state party in calling for Hall to resign. ""The DNC does not endorse candidates running in contested primaries and we have not endorsed Duane Hall in North Carolina. We were not informed, nor did we approve the use of our logo in his mailer,"" Francisco Pelayo, DNC director of Hispanic media and regional press secretary, wrote in an email. ""We take sexual harassment very seriously and we are very concerned by the allegations against Hall. We stand with Governor Cooper’s and NCDP’s calls for him to step down,"" Pelayo wrote. He added that he’s not aware of any time that the DNC has previously endorsed Hall. It’s unclear why Hall is using the ""D"" logo. He didn’t respond to an email or voicemails left by a reporter. What is clear is that the national, state and county parties haven’t endorsed him this year. Our ruling Hall’s mailer suggests that he’s endorsed by the Democratic Party. The local and state parties have promoted him in the past. But the Wake County Democratic Party, NC Democratic Party and Democratic National Committee all denied making any primary endorsements at all. Not only are the parties not endorsing him, the NCDP and DNC have called on him to step down.

Did Congress vote to give itself a pay raise this year? No
","  A Republican candidate for Montana’s U.S. Senate seat painted his opponent, Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, as a greedy Washington insider by claiming Tester voted to give himself a pay raise this year. Matt Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said Tester’s compensation bump was part of the $1.3 trillion ""omnibus"" spending bill signed into law March 23. ""If you send me to Washington, D.C.,"" Rosendale said, ""no more will we have a senator who takes and votes against tax cuts for you, while he just took an income raise in the omnibus bill."" Tester did indeed vote for this year’s Consolidated Appropriations Act, a spending package that funds everything from the military, to assistance for the nation’s opioid problem to border security. But Rosendale’s claim that Congress received a pay raise is flat wrong. Montana state Auditor Matt Rosendale announces his bid for the U.S. Senate on July 31, 2017. (AP/Bobby Caina Calvan) The Constitution requires Congress to determine its own salary. The Framers deemed in Article I, Section 6 that, ""the Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law."" In 1789, senators and representatives earned $6 a day for attending congressional sessions. But a law signed that year bumped senators’ pay up to $7 a day — the first congressional pay raise in American history. Fast forward about 200 years and you’ll find the last instance that Congress enacted specific legislation to change its pay. Since around 1989, pay has been determined by laws that use formulas to automatically adjust members’ wages. Here’s a snapshot of how members’ salaries changed over several years under a law that codified a pay adjustment formula:  As the chart above shows, most senators and representatives earned an annual salary of $174,000 in 2009. That year is significant for another reason: it’s when Congress stopped giving itself raises. Yes, you read that correctly. Members’ salary levels were frozen in 2009. Lawmakers achieved this through a series of laws blocking their scheduled yearly adjustments. For Rosendale to be correct that Tester voted himself a raise, the 2018 omnibus would have to have resume Congress’ yearly pay bump. So, did it? Nope. The omnibus bill continues the pay freeze for the remainder of the year. As Section 7 of the bill states:  As this Congressional Research Service chart notes, members’ salaries in 2018 is $174,000 — the same as it’s been since 2009. (There are exceptions for Speaker of the House, who makes $223,500, and the President pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, who make $193,400.)  An aide to Rosendale said the candidate had been referring to the roughly $49 million increase in the Senate’s operating budget, as well as $12 million in salary increases for officers and other employees, which resulted from the omnibus spending bill. But Rosendale said Tester took an ""income raise."" It’s hard to imagine he was referring to anyone other than Tester. Rosendale said Tester ""took an income raise in the omnibus bill."" Congress’ pay has been frozen at $174,000 per member since 2009. Under the omnibus spending bill, it remains frozen through 2018. Rosendale has no basis for his claim.

Hoax claims Hillary Clinton is responsible for war in Syria
","Hillary Clinton’s emails are back in the news — the fake news, that is. A false story claims that a Clinton email shows she ordered the war in Syria in order to benefit Israel.

Did Scott Walker take $1 billion from Wisconsin schools, as governor candidate Tony Evers claims?
","Since shortly after Republican Scott Walker became governor in 2011, Democrats have claimed that he cut $1 billion or more in state funding for public schools. Now, with Walker seeking a third term, the billion-dollar attacks are back. One was made by Tony Evers, who, as state schools superintendent, would seem to be in a good position to know. Evers is one of a slew of Democrats hoping to win the August 2018 primary election in order to challenge Walker in November. Evers was asked in a March 23, 2018, Wausau radio interview about a recent increase in funding Walker had approved for kindergarten through 12th grade schools. Evers replied by saying: In K through 12, I think it’s a one-year flash. Governor Walker has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools and it hasn’t been replaced. This year, a little bit of an anomaly …. Some of the other Democratic candidates for governor, including Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Helen Roys, have made similar attacks. There’s no question that, despite recent funding increases, Walker earlier made significant cuts to school funding. But has Walker ""taken"" over $1 billion from public schools? Not in the way most people would think of a funding cut. Evers’ evidence To back Evers’ statement, his campaign provided calculations of ""total educational cost"" figures. They indicate school funding is down a total of more than $1 billion since 2010-’11 -- the final state fiscal year under Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. But those figures count federal, state and local sources of school funding. So, let’s go to a more direct measure -- state money allocated in the state budget for K-12 schools. State funding of schools When we posed Evers’ claim to the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the bureau provided us these GPR (general purpose revenue) figures. They include funding streams known as per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids. The chart below contains a lot of numbers. But we’ll focus on only four figures, each marked with an asterisk, and we’ll walk you through them. State fiscal year GPR school aids Change to prior year Change to 2010-’11 Cumulative change to 2010-’11 2010-’11 $5.27 billion* 2011-’12 $4.85 billion -$426.5 million* -$426.5 million -$426.5 million 2012-’13 $4.91 billion +$68.9 million -$357.6 million -$784.1 million 2013-’14 $5.03 billion +$119.8 million -$237.8 million -$1.021 billion 2014-’15 $5.19 billion +$160.5 million -$77.3 million -$1.1 billion 2015-’16 $5.2 billion +$3 million -$74.3 million -$1.17 billion* 2016-’17 $5.4 billion +$197.3 million +$123 million -$1.05 billion 2017-’18 $5.58 billion +$176.9 million +$299.9 million -$750.6 million 2018-’19 $5.84 billion +$267.1 million +$567 million -$183.6 million* The starting point is $5.27 billion -- the amount of state funding for schools in 2010-’11, Doyle’s last year as governor. Think of that as the base. The next year, 2011-’12, Walker used his first state budget to cut school funding by $426.5 million, the second figure with an asterisk -- that’s the actual reduction. How to get to ‘over $1 billion’ Since making that cut, Walker has increased the amount of state aid to schools every year. But it took awhile before state aid got back to the level it was under Doyle’s final year. More specifically, in Walker’s first five years, schools received a total of $1.17 billion less in state aid than if the funding had remained at the base level. But if you carry that comparison forward to today, the amount ""taken"" is only $183.6 million. Other factors A final point. While it’s clear that Walker’s first budget cut the $426.5 million, he also gave school districts the ""tools,"" with Act 10, to recoup their losses. The law, which dramatically reduced collective bargaining power for teachers and most public employees in Wisconsin, enabled school districts to save money by, for example, requiring employees to pay for a greater share of their health insurance. On the other hand, Walker also reduced how much money revenue school districts could raise in property taxes. And that reduction, like the state funding for schools overall, hasn’t been fully restored -- though school districts can ask voters in referendums to exceed the limits. Our rating Evers says that despite a recent increase in school funding, Walker ""has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools."" In Walker’s first year as governor, he cut school aid by $426.5 million from the previous year, Doyle’s final year as governor. Because it took five years to get school funding back to that base level, it can be argued that Walker ""took"" a total of $1.17 billion from schools over that period. But since then, Walker has increased school funding to the point that the deficit, in comparison to the base year, is $183.6 million. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/20/tony-evers/did-scott-walker-take-1-billion-wisconsin-schools-/

Do a majority of Americans live in states with legal marijuana?
","For the first time this week, Californians can celebrate ""4/20,"" the unofficial pot holiday, by purchasing legal recreational cannabis at dispensaries across the state. Marijuana buffs trace the April 20th date to a story about five high school students in Marin County, Calif., who ""created a ritual for getting high. They would meet at 4:20,"" in the afternoon, according to a short history behind the holiday. The time and date are now a core part of popular marijuana culture. Voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016, which allowed retail sales to start in January. It added California to what is currently a list of nine states, plus Washington D.C., where recreational marijuana is legal. But just how many people in the United States can legally use marijuana, in some form, on ""4/20"" or any other day?   California Treasurer John Chiang made a recent claim saying:  ""A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis."" Right before that, he noted that more states have approved medical marijuana than recreational pot. Still, we wondered: Was Chiang right that a majority of Americans live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis? Or was he blowing smoke? We set out on a fact check. RELATED:  Pot 101: Facts you should know about California’s legal marijuana How much privacy do you have when you buy marijuana in California? TRUE: During campaign, Trump pledged to leave marijuana legalization up to states Our research  Chiang, a Democrat who is running for governor, made his claim in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 29, 2018. He urged Sessions to establish federal banking rules for the cannabis industry. The letter was signed by state treasures from Oregon, Illinois and Pennsylvania, as well as several cannabis industry representatives. Marijuana remains illegal, in all forms, under federal law. In January, Sessions rescinded an Obama administration memo that recommended a hands-off approach to marijuana prosecution in states that have legalized pot. The move was seen as possibly paving the way for a federal crackdown on marijuana users and suppliers, though it’s uncertain whether that will happen.  Different types of marijuana sit on display at Harborside marijuana dispensary, Monday, Jan. 1, 2018, in Oakland, Calif. Starting New Year's Day, recreational marijuana can be sold legally in California. (AP Photo/Mathew Sumner) To support the statement that ""a majority"" of Americans live in states that have legalized cannabis, a spokesman for Chiang pointed us to a November 2017 report by the treasurer’s office. It includes a map based on information from the National Conference of State Legislatures showing 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, ranging from adult recreational use to medical use to ""limited medical"" use in several states allowing ""cannabis extracts.""   Based on that map, the vast majority of Americans do live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis. But it’s also the broadest collection of states we found and stretches the case on whether a state has really legalized any form of marijuana. We decided to limit our count to states where voters or a state legislature has approved a comprehensive law authorizing medical or recreational marijuana. We found 29 states, plus Washington D.C., that meet that criteria, based on news reports. Nine have legalized recreational marijuana while the rest have legalized medical marijuana.    Even with this smaller group of states, however, Chiang’s statement holds up. There are more than 207 million people in these states, based on our review of census data. That’s easily a majority of America’s 325 million people. Our ruling  California Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed: ""A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis."" His office pointed to a report that shows 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, though that list includes some states with only ""limited medical marijuana"" legalization and no comprehensive law authorizing the use. In reality, 29 states, plus Washington D.C., have passed laws authorizing recreational marijuana, medical marijuana or both. But even with this smaller group, Chiang’s statement is correct.

Is Donald Trump correct about the size of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan?
","When President Donald Trump held a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-A-Lago resort, a Japanese journalist asked the leaders about trade between the two countries. Trump started his answer by saying, ""The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year. That's massive by any standpoint."" When we took a closer look, we found that the lower end of Trump’s scale has some credibility, but not the upper end. First, let’s look at the data for trade in goods alone. (This is not the most complete look at trade — more on that later.) But the figure for goods alone is the one that trade skeptics are more apt to cite, because it is more likely to paint the United States as getting the short end of the stick in bilateral trade. U.S. Census Bureau data shows that the U.S. deficit with Japan in goods has been consistent in recent years, from $67 billion to $69 billion. In 2017, it was $68.8 billion. That figure is in line with the lower end of Trump’s range, but it’s well below the upper end of his range. In fact, the higher figure Trump offered is about 50 percent larger than the actual size of the deficit. There’s a more comprehensive figure that combines the deficit in goods and services. It makes Trump’s point more inaccurate. The United States tends to have a more favorable balance of trade in services, which includes sectors such as financial and insurance services, legal services, business consulting, and entertainment. Any goods-and-services deficit is usually smaller than the deficit in goods alone. According to Census Bureau data, the U.S. deficit with Japan in goods and services in 2017 was $56.1 billion. So Trump offered an upper estimate that’s almost twice as large as the actual goods-and-services deficit. Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, confirmed our conclusion that Trump’s upper-end estimate was off-base. ""President Trump tends to get creative when speaking about bilateral trade deficits,"" she said. Trump called the trade deficit ""massive."" Let’s put it into context. The size of Japan’s goods-and-services deficit is far below that of China’s, and it’s also smaller than those of Mexico and Germany. But the deficit with Japan still ranks high on the list of deficits among top trading partners. The deficit with Japan is modest as a percentage of all trade between the two nations. The 2017 goods-and-services deficit with Japan amounted to 19.6 percent of total trade between the two countries. That was larger than the percentage for Mexico (11.1 percent), but it was smaller than for either Germany (28.5 percent) or China (47.4 percent). When we contacted the White House, they came up with identical data as we did — about $69 billion as a deficit in goods, but not as high as $100 billion. Trump said, ""The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year."" The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is roughly $69 billion if you only look at the trade in goods. A more comprehensive figure that includes the balance of trade in services is even smaller, $56.1 billion. Either way, the $100 billion that Trump threw out is unsupported by the data. We rate the statement Half True. CORRECTION: This version has corrected the size of the goods and services deficit with Japan. It is $56.1 billion, not $57.1 billion.",/factchecks/2018/apr/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-about-size-us-trade-deficit-j/

Florida Democrats slam Gov. Rick Scott for defrauding US taxpayers
","Democrats had some fun with Photoshop after Florida Gov. Rick Scott released an ad promoting term limits in Congress. The TV ad shows Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, in front of a white board with an outline of the United States behind him. Halfway through the ad, Scott puts a red X next to Washington to illustrate his point that it's ""the only place that doesn’t want term limits.""   The Florida Democratic Party recycled the image of Scott on Twitter to insert a joke about his tenure as CEO the Columbia/HCA hospital chain. Federal agents went public with an investigation into the company for Medicare fraud in 1997. Scott resigned from his post shortly after, and the company wound up paying a record $1.7 billion in fines after pleading guilty to 14 corporate felonies. Hey @ScottforFlorida - we fixed it for you. #SelfServingScott pic.twitter.com/QWxAUMywGK ""Hey @ScottforFlorida - we fixed it for you. #SelfServingScott,"" the Florida Democratic Party tweeted. ""X marks the spot at every HCA location where I probably defrauded taxpayers,"" the edited image says.  Florida Democrats told us the eight X marks weren’t intended to refer to specific cases at hospitals. ""Probably"" is barely squeezed in, roughly half the size of the rest of the words. Democratic Party spokeswoman Caroline Rowland said that should indicate the tweet was a joke. But is it true? Scott certainly hasn't been immune from claims surrounding his time as CEO of Columbia/HCA. In 2014, Florida Democrats claimed Scott ""oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history,"" which PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. We wanted to see how this new claim stacked up. Scott started Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he added hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia chain purchased Tennessee-based HCA and its 100 hospitals and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents seized records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanded their investigation across the country. They focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, almost four months after the inquiry became public. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. We’ve covered specific charges against the company in several fact-checks since Scott’s first race, such as the company billing Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians; attaching false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; and illegally claiming non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education. We don’t know a lot about  the exact hospitals where fraud was found. But the scope of the settlement suggests the Democrats’ map of eight spots isn’t that much of a stretch. By the time Scott resigned, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott's campaign said in 2010. That includes HCA networks in  Houston, Miami, Oklahoma City, Wichita, Kansas City, Utah (either Payson or Salt Lake), Nashville and Falls Church, Va. In each of those cities, there is at least one hospital in the HCA network. The 2000 release does mention a few different places where subsidiary of HCA entered in to a plea agreement for fraudulent activities: the Southern District of Florida (Miami); the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta); the Middle district of Florida (Tampa); the Western District of Texas (El Paso); and a Tennessee facility. Columbia Homecare Group and Columbia Management Companies Inc. entered into a criminal plea agreement and plead guilty to several charges involving ""a wide range of criminal conduct which occurred at HCA's hospitals nationwide."" In Miami, Columbia Homecare Group Inc., a subsidiary, plead guilty to violating the anti-kickback statute. We could not find any other direct evidence that shows tax payers were specifically defrauded in all eight of the cities pointed out by the Florida Democratic Party, but the release indicates that the fraud was a national issue. Then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in the 2000 release that the investigation was the ""the largest multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by the U.S."" ""Health care fraud impacts every American citizen. When a company defrauds our nation's health care programs, it takes money out of the pockets of the American taxpayers,"" Reno said in 2000. ""It is wrong."" The DOJ also noted in the release that prosecutors from more than 25 states across the country assisted in the case. Adam Levine, an adjunct professor at Stetson University College of Law, said it’s ""mostly correct"" to assume that there was fraud in areas where HCA is located given the amount of money involved. ""We don’t know where the offenders were and which were worse than others,"" he said. ""So all are equally culpable."" One final point: Scott was in charge, so he bears some responsibility and has said so. But it's worth pointing out that we don't know how much he knew, and when he knew it. ""While I would agree that a CEO or corporate officer cannot know everything, the depth and breadth of the fraud indicates systemic, company-wide policies and procedures that had to be flawed,"" Levine said.   The Florida Democratic Party distributed a cheeky map of the country and Scott, saying ""X marks the spot at every HCA location where I probably defrauded taxpayers."" The post involves the health care fraud settlement against Scott, who used to be CEO of Columbia/HCA. We don’t know if fraud occured at those eight exact places on their map, but experts said the scope of the settlement with Columbia/HCA suggests the Democrats' claim isn’t too much of a stretch. The Department of Justice and the attorney general said the case affected facilities nationwide and taxpayers across the country.  We rate this Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/apr/19/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-slam-rick-scott-defrauding-peopl/

Joe Garcia says Carlos Curbelo supports raising flood insurance rates
","As thousands of Floridians faced the threat of a massive flood insurance hike in 2014, a deluge of protests from homeowners led Congress to delay some of the heftiest increases. Now U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, says in a Sept. 5 Web ad that his Republican opponent Carlos Curbelo ""supported raising flood insurance rates."" That’s a serious charge in Garcia’s district, which includes many homeowners in flood-prone Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. A few days later, the Garcia campaign unveiled a TV ad that makes a similar charge that Curbelo would let rates ""skyrocket."" We dove right in to search for the facts: Has Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates? Federal and state flood insurance laws in 2014 Congress and the Florida Legislature have taken action on flood insurance during the past few years. But Curbelo, a Miami-Dade school board member, hasn’t participated in those votes. Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida in an interview that he does not want to get rid of the National Flood Insurance Program but does agree with a new Florida law that made it easier for private companies to step in. The Garcia campaign argues that Curbelo’s comments during two GOP primary debates show he supports raising flood insurance rates. Curbelo’s statements relate to federal and state bills about flood insurance -- we’ll recap both pieces of legislation. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012 overhauled the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures more than five million properties nationwide, including about two million in Florida. The bill sought to avoid insolvency for the program -- as of July 2013, it owed about $24 billion. For some policyholders, the bill translated to skyrocketing rates. Residents, well, flooded Congress with complaints, and lawmakers reversed much of their earlier reforms. In March 2014, Obama signed the  Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which lowered the rate increases on some policies and prevented some future increases. The Florida Legislature sought its own solution in 2014. Some private companies were already offering flood insurance, but SB 542 made it easier for them to offer more flexible and potentially cheaper plans. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bill in June, but no new companies have started selling policies, and the vast majority remain through the federal program. Experts predict slow growth in the private sector as it will take time for companies to figure out where they can profitably write policies. ""It will take a decade well past this November for the private market to emerge slowly,"" said Jay Neal, president of the Florida Association for Insurance Reform. The two main companies offering private flood insurance in Florida are currently offering cheaper rates than the federal program, said Richard Koon, Florida’s deputy insurance commissioner. But the situation remains in flux -- the national program is expected to revise rates, and some companies might want to see if Congress will make future changes. Curbelo’s debate statements about flood insurance Flood insurance laws emerged as topics in GOP primary debates in Congressional District 26. Here was part of Curbelo’s statement in the June debate: ""Our rates here in this district are going up because of things that are happening in other parts of the country. So like with everything else I am for a market-driven solution. We should allow the private sector to step in. Florida already started doing that because Congress failed to address this issue with its supposed fix that Mr. Garcia is going around town talking about. They failed so the state of Florida stepped in and has encouraged private companies to fill this need. So we should continue allowing that process to grow. And again -- when the market fails and only when the market fails -- the federal government should step in to help.""   During a debate moderated by CBS4’s Jim DeFede, Curbelo (and all the participating candidates) said they would have voted in favor of the Biggert-Waters fix passed by Congress that capped certain annual increases at 18 percent. Curbelo: ""I would have voted yes recognizing that it is a bandaid and that it does not solve the long term-problem."" DeFede: ""I thought though you had given some comments you didn’t think it was Congress’ place to interfere win the market which is essentially what this is doing by capping the increases.""  Curbelo: ""My position is Congress should not interfere with the market unless the market fails. If the market fails, that’s when government intervention is acceptable."" A couple minutes later, Curbelo added some criticisms of the federal program: ""Florida is a major donor state. We make investments in infrastructure, we prepare for storms in this state and we don’t get a whole lot of credit for it. Florida shouldn’t be treated unfairly under NFIP and that should have been one of the reforms that Congress passed.""  (A study concluded that several states, including Florida, pay more into the program than they receive in claims.) Curbelo clearly talked about allowing private companies to provide flood insurance. So how does Garcia reach the conclusion that that would raise rates? Garcia points to news articles that explain that historically the federal program kept rates artificially low for homeowners, while private insurance was prohibitively expensive. But some of the articles also showed that it remains to be seen what will happen in the future as private companies enter the market. The Palm Beach Post wrote in March 2014 that supporters of the state bill ""portray it as the start of a new era of more flexible, affordable private options."" Evan Hecht, CEO of a Gainesville business representing Lloyd's of London syndicates, told the Wall Street Journal  that ""the proposed (federal) legislation appears to allow potentially millions of people to continue to pay below-market rates, which the private sector wouldn't want to compete with."" But the article also paraphrased Paresh Patel, the chief executive of HCI Group in Tampa as saying ""that by carefully selecting homes to cover and pairing the protection with a homeowners' policy, HCI could charge less than the new rates and still make a profit."" Our ruling Garcia’s ad says that ""Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates."" It’s a stretch to imagine a candidate campaigning in Miami and the coastal Keys who would tell voters that he wants to raise their flood insurance bill -- and in reality, Curbelo hasn’t done that. For starters, Curbelo hasn’t taken a vote on federal or state flood insurance. The Garcia campaign says that if Curbelo supports private companies providing flood insurance, that means he supports higher rates. That’s a huge distortion. Curbelo says he supports private companies and in hopes that competition will lower rates. Pushing competitively priced private insurance is not pushing for higher premiums. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/16/joe-garcia/joe-garcia-says-carlos-curbelo-supports-raising-fl/

Klobuchar: Children who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to commit domestic violence
","The release of a video showing NFL running back Ray Rice striking his now-wife in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino elevator revived conversations about domestic violence on the Sunday shows.   On the Sept. 14, 2014, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., shared an anecdote from her time as a prosecutor to illustrate the ills of domestic violence. ""We had a poster outside the door so everyone would see it when they came in. It was a picture of a woman beaten up with a Band-Aid over her nose, holding a little baby boy,"" Klobuchar said. ""And the words read, ‘Beat your wife, and it’s your son that goes to jail.’ "" ""Kids … that have seen it happen,"" Klobuchar said, are ""twice as likely to commit it themselves."" Klobuchar concluded that because the NFL puts ""out their players as role models,"" they have ""to set a different culture."" We were interested in checking Klobuchar’s claim that kids who witness domestic violence are ""twice as likely to commit it themselves."" 90's kids We want to be clear upfront that witnessing domestic violence means witnessing it in a child’s household -- not watching the TMZ.com Rice video. That said, the ""twice as likely"" talking point is fairly popular among advocates against domestic abuse, and suffice to say has been around for a while. The domestic violence literature we’ve seen often cited that claim with a 1990 book called ""Physical Violence in American Families: Risk Factors and Adaptations to Violence in 8,145 Families."" This book compiled the results of the landmark National Family Violence Surveys of 1975 and 1985, which constituted 60-minute face-to-face interviews and 30-minute phone interviews, respectively, with thousands of American families. Based on those interviews, the book’s authors illustrated how a variety of factors influenced the incidence of domestic violence. Most of the book is about gender differences and roles in domestic violence, but the section on the effects on children crunches the surveys’ numbers on whether abusers said they witnessed abuse as children. That produced the ""twice as likely"" estimate. The experts we talked to told us there hasn’t been any study as definitive or comprehensive since, although other studies have taken stabs at the issue of intergenerational transmission of domestic violence. ""We’ve known for such a long time that the biggest risk factor for being abusive against wives and children is witnessing domestic violence at home or being abused,"" said Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing who studies domestic violence. So ""people haven’t repeated the research for a while,"" Campbell said, and ""a lot of stuff is old and mostly cross-sectional."" What the existing literature says Campbell pointed us to a 2010 study about intimate partner violence -- a subset of domestic violence -- which found that children who witnessed any intimate partner violence were 2.6 times as likely to perpetrate it themselves. Children who witnessed any violence were 1.6 times as likely, according to the study, to become abusers as adults. Klobuchar’s claim, then, has grounds in literature both old and new. There are literally dozens of studies on this issue, though, and different studies tell different stories. A 2000 meta-analysis of 39 different studies on this issue found a ""small-to-medium"" correlation between witnessing and perpetrating. The studies in that survey, while a couple decades old, ranged from showing a causal relationship between witnessing and perpetrating to showing no relationship at all. That corroborates Klobuchar’s larger point that parents’ domestic violence has negative outcomes for their children, but that’s not the same as these kids being ""twice as likely to commit it themselves."" Difficulties with measurements Putting numbers on domestic violence is particularly hard, and perhaps even inappropriate, said Ruth Glenn, executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""I wouldn’t say twice as likely,"" said Glenn. ""So I would say that it is an additional risk factor. I get nervous when we start to assign data, because there’s not enough data to support it. Domestic violence happens in families, and each of those families are individual units."" In other words, there’s enough out there to suggest that children who witness domestic violence are more likely to perpetrate it, but saying something as precise as ""twice as likely"" is difficult. Domestic violence is ""hard to measure for various and sundry reasons,"" said Glenn, from the lack of ""good data"" on who’s charged and convicted of domestic violence to confidentiality issues with its victims. And even when researchers can get affirmative data, there are methodological concerns. The studies about children who witness domestic violence often surveyed clinical populations -- meaning those with family issues, so a non-representative sample -- and ask respondents to self-report and to retroactively report. Extricating domestic violence from other family issues -- like mental health and substance abuse -- is also difficult, according to the studies Campbell referred us to. Our ruling Klobuchar, arguing that the NFL has a responsibility to hold its ""role models"" accountable to a ""different culture,"" said that kids who witness domestic violence in their households are ""twice as likely to commit it themselves."" There are legitimate, peer-reviewed studies that bear Klobuchar’s claim out. But overall, even though there’s a consensus that witnessing domestic violence puts kids at a greater risk for perpetrating it themselves, the precise figures differ. Measuring domestic violence is very difficult for a variety of reasons, and there hasn’t been a recent, comprehensive study. So saying these kids are ""twice as likely to commit"" domestic violence is a little too precise. We rate Klobuchar’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/16/amy-klobuchar/klobuchar-children-who-witness-domestic-violence-a/

Rand Paul says income inequality is worse in cities with Democratic mayors
","During a recent interview with NPR, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the belief -- widely held among Democrats -- that Republican policies are encouraging greater income inequality. ""I think inequality can be a problem, and interestingly seems to be getting a little bit worse under this administration,"" Paul said. ""Income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors."" (Here’s the full transcript.) A reader asked us to check whether Paul’s claim about cities under Democratic and Republican mayors is correct. So we did. We located a study by the Brookings Institution released earlier this year that ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 cities by income inequality -- and there does appear to be something to what Paul said. Of the study’s 10 most unequal cities, nine have Democratic mayors. They are Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Oakland, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. Of the 10 most unequal cities, only Miami has a Republican mayor. By contrast, seven of the 10 most equal cities have Republican mayors -- Oklahoma City; Omaha, Neb.; Fort Worth, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Mesa, Ariz.; Arlington, Texas; and Virginia Beach, Va. The other three either have a nonpartisan mayor (Raleigh, N.C., and Las Vegas) or a Democrat (Wichita, Kan.). So on the numbers, Paul has a point. The question is, does this discovery mean anything? Experts we spoke to urged taking the claim with a grain of salt -- if not a whole shaker. Here are a few reasons why. Mayors aren’t all-powerful players in the local economy. Where claims of this sort are made, PolitiFact tries to establish whether credit or blame is deserved. In this case, then, is it reasonable to attribute patterns of inequality exclusively, or even primarily, to a mayor? No -- many factors play into a city’s economic success. The mayor of Detroit doesn’t have much power over the international market for automobiles, and no mayor of New York can take all the credit for the economic juggernaut of Wall Street. While mayoral policies may have an effect on the margins, such factors as the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a much greater impact on economic inequality in cities. In addition, it’s worth remembering that ""cities attract people on the basis of many factors, of which the party of their political leaders is probably a minor one,"" said William Frey, a senior fellow in Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. Inequality patterns in cities may be at least as much about population size and geographic patterns as they are about partisan leadership. Focusing on the partisan differences obscures a more fundamental difference between the most and least unequal cities. The more unequal cities tend to be very big, and the less unequal cities tend to be more modestly sized. The median population of the 10 most unequal cities on the Brookings list is about 630,000, compared to about 430,000 for the most equal cities. (If you used the mean, rather than the median, the average population of the 10 most unequal cities would be even higher -- almost 1.9 million residents per city.) So it’s not exactly apples-to-apples if you compare the attributes of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on the one hand with those of Colorado Springs, Virginia Beach and Arlington on the other. All other things being equal, larger cities tend to have a wider distribution of incomes on both extremes, since they have more residents. That, almost by definition, means larger ratios between the top and the bottom. In the meantime, big cities tend to attract more wealthy people -- i.e., people who can choose to live anywhere they want -- because megacities are likelier to have world-class amenities. ""The real wealth ‘peaks’ tend to be in the big cities, so they have high tops as well as lower bottoms, while the income profiles of smaller localities are typically more ‘compressed,’ "" said Jamie Peck, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia who has studied urban and political patterns in the United States. How old a city is can matter, too, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist and vice president of analytics at the real estate website Trulia. In older cities many middle-income residents have relocated to the suburbs, leaving behind higher levels of inequality. By contrast, newer cities -- such as Mesa (which is near Phoenix) or Arlington (which is near Dallas) -- often contain many suburban areas or are, in effect, suburbs themselves, Kolko said. Such cities tend to have more modest income ranges. Why does all this matter? It undercuts the notion that partisan leadership has much to do with why certain cities become relatively unequal and certain become relatively equal. Causation may actually run the opposite way. It’s always important to remember that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. In this context, it’s not necessarily that Republican leadership creates greater equality, as Paul’s comment presumes. Rather, it could be that greater equality prompts people to vote Republican. Or it could be unrelated. ""I think it runs more in the direction that inequality provides conditions for Democratic success, rather than Democrats causing inequality,"" said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who specializes in electoral patterns and geography. And any explanation other than political leadership causing greater equality weakens Paul’s point. The pattern holds only if you look at cities, not metropolitan areas. If you look at Kolko’s research -- which studied inequality in broader metropolitan areas, rather than in cities per se -- Paul’s pattern falls apart. Of the 10 metropolitan areas with the most equality, only one has a Republican mayor -- Colorado Springs. The other nine either have a Democratic mayor, a nonpartisan one, or no mayor at all because they’re an unincorporated area. This list includes Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla.; Allentown, Pa.; Salt Lake City; Bethesda-Rockville-Frederick, Md., Tacoma, Wash.; Las Vegas; Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; Raleigh; and Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. What Paul’s office says Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, cautioned that the senator was not simply casting aspersions on Democratic mayors’ handling of their cities’ economies. ""What he was saying is that Democrats are not solving the problem,"" Darling said. ""It may be an unsolvable problem. Democrats love to talk about the issue and have been allowed to position themselves as the warriors for those harmed by income inequality, yet they are not a party of action"" on this issue. That’s a reasonable point, but we think a typical listener hearing Paul’s comment would have assumed that he was arguing that Republican policies have promoted greater equality in cities than Democratic policies have. And as we’ve found, that’s far from clearcut. Our ruling Paul said that ""income inequality is worse in towns run by Democrat mayors than in towns run by Republican mayors."" He has a point that one credible study shows a fairly strong correlation between low inequality and a Republican mayor. But experts say it’s a stretch to draw conclusions from this. The claim inflates the actual powers of mayors to shape inequality in their cities and it ignores the role of population size and suburbanization in driving inequality. It also glosses over the fact that metropolitan areas, as opposed to cities, show no such relationship. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-income-inequality-worse-cities-demo/

Wendy Davis claims Greg Abbott didn't act on allegations of sexual abuse at state-run school
","In a TV ad suggesting Greg Abbott failed to act when allegations of misconduct came to his office, Wendy Davis reminds Texans of the sexual abuse scandal that touched off a 2007 legislative overhaul of the Texas Youth Commission. In the ad, a narrator says in a dark tone: ""Young boys at a state-run school are sexually abused. When a local investigation lags, a Texas Ranger notifies Attorney General Greg Abbott, asking him to investigate. Abbott does nothing,"" the narrator says, adding that 11 months then went by with more incidents of abuse and neglect. ""But Abbott didn’t pursue the case,"" the narrator says. By way of backup, the Davis campaign offered news stories describing attempts by a Texas Ranger to get authorities outside of West Texas, including the attorney general, to look into the alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Pyote. We reviewed those news reports and others, which together chronicled initial inaction by a state lawyer before Abbott’s office presented the related allegations to a grand jury. Abbott does nothing? Public knowledge of alleged sexual wrongdoing by officials at the remote school traces to February 2007 news reports by the Texas Observer and Dallas Morning News. But a Texas Ranger, Brian Burzynski, had been on the case for years and had already reached out to the state for help. Burzynski emailed an assistant state attorney general, Will Tatum, on Feb. 21, 2006, graphically detailing sexual abuse of male youths at the school, according to information released by Abbott’s office in March 2007. The Ranger’s email said the local prosecutor had the case but ""hasn't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will. ... I would like you to view this report and tell me what you think."" Burzynski had begun his investigation in February 2005. According to Abbott’s office, Tatum declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the attorney general’s office needed a local prosecutor to ask for assistance before it could get involved. As Burzynski’s emailed request became public, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said Tatum still should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the email, but he didn't follow agency procedures, according to news reports at the time. Knowing ""the seriousness of the allegations contained in that email, action would have been taken by the attorney general's office, and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible,"" Strickland said. But Strickland also said that two days after Burzynski sent the email, Tatum correctly told the Ranger that the Ward County district attorney, Randall Reynolds, would have to ask Abbott's office for help on the case. An April 2007 Austin American-Statesman news story said Tatum sent Burzynski the name and address of his supervisor, Adrien McFarland, for the Ranger to give to Reynolds. Abbott acted in 2007 Strickland said the attorney general's office began an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help; that request came in Jan. 17, 2007. In April 2007, a Ward County grand jury returned 13 indictments against two former school administrators for improper sexual conduct with six students, ages 16-19, the attorney general’s office announced at the time. Abbott and other state prosecutors appeared before the grand jury to present the charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookins and John Paul Hernandez, Abbott’s office said. Abbott said at the time: ""With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve."" According to the state announcement, on April 4, 2007, District Judge Bob Parks had granted the attorney general’s office sole authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse at the Ward County facility. Parks appointed the attorney general as ""District Attorney Pro Tem"" after the local district attorney recused himself from the case, the announcement said. Footnote: In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookins to 10 years in prison on his conviction for sexual relations with a teenage inmate. In 2011, a jury acquitted Hernandez on 14 counts of molesting boys in 2004 and 2005. Texas law on the attorney general and criminal prosecutions Generally, the April 2007 Statesman news story pointed out, the Texas attorney general is an executive who primarily defends the state in civil disputes, ""though in local criminal cases involving fraud in insurance, Medicaid or elections, the attorney general can usually find a way to involve himself, one way or another. His staff, using a provision in the penal code dealing with computer crimes, can even initiate investigations into the solicitation of sex from minors on the Internet."" Charges like the ones from West Texas, the story said, ""are off-limits until a local prosecutor requests assistance in writing."" Eric Nichols, deputy attorney general for criminal justice, told the newspaper the state agency followed the letter of the law. At the time, the Texas Government Code said: ""A prosecuting attorney may request the assistance of the attorney general in the prosecution of all manner of criminal cases or in performing any duty imposed by law on the prosecuting attorney. In requesting such assistance, a prosecuting attorney may appoint any assistant attorney general as an assistant prosecuting attorney."" The 2007 Legislature amended the law to say the attorney general may offer assistance in any criminal prosecution. Another adopted revision: The attorney general may offer assistance ""in the prosecution of criminal offenses concerning the Texas Youth Commission."" The Statesman story said two lawmakers, Democratic Reps. Jim McReynolds of Lufkin and Jim Dunnam of Waco, questioned Nichols about whether Abbott’s office should initially have done more: Even if he couldn't initiate prosecution, couldn't he have picked up the phone and called Reynolds, or even the governor, the state's chief executive officer? Nichols said in an interview at the time that Abbott’s aides assumed the local prosecutor was doing his job. ""Do you automatically draw the conclusion that nothing is going to happen?"" Nichols asked. On the other hand, the Statesman story said, it might not have mattered whether someone in the attorney general's office called Reynolds to offer help. Burzynski told lawmakers in 2007 that Reynolds continually assured him he would prosecute the case. The story said Reynolds had said little in his defense except to blame politics or a ""breakdown in communications."" A timeline accompanying the story said Abbott learned of the West Texas investigation at a meeting of senior agency staff Jan. 22, 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a state-run school. In 2006, Abbott’s office reacted to a Ranger’s report detailing such allegations by saying a local prosecutor needed to seek state assistance--and a state lawyer reportedly did nothing more. But this charge ignores a pivotal development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested help, state attorneys overseen by Abbott steered a grand-jury presentation leading to indictments. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Congressional candidate Rhue Reis says 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans are homeless
","During a recent broadcast of ""State of the State,"" a Rhode Island public access TV show, the subject of homeless veterans came up, in a round about sort of way. The show, which aired Sept. 7, 2014, featured a debate between U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat, and Rhue Reis, the Republican who would like to replace him. The two were talking about what to do about the children coming across the U.S.-Mexico border. Reis said they should be sent back to their respective countries because the United States has too many problems of its own. ""It needs to stop for their safety and because we cannot handle the influx. We have a much more difficult time taking care of our own,"" he said. ""When you have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day, we can't take care of them and yet we want to bring in another influx of tens or hundreds of thousands of people, illegal immigrants? We can't even take care of our own.""   We wondered  whether Reis was correct about the number of homeless veterans. When we asked him for his source, Reis referred us to a web page from the National Coalition for the Homeless, which featured a  fact sheet written in 2009. It pegs the count at 130,000 to 200,000 per night -- substantially less than Reis’s 200,000 to 400,000 number. .As we searched for more information, we found several different and equally dated estimates from other advocacy groups for veterans and the homeless, some lower, some higher For example, in 2007, the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the Homelessness  Research Institute used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to estimate the numbers at 192,000 in 2004, 194,254 in 2005 and 195,827 in 2006. But that same group now says the nightly number of veterans who are homeless is just under 50,000. That’s far lower than Reis’ number. Why the dramatic drop? It turns out that the newest numbers come from the U.s. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Since January 2009, they've conducted an annual ""Point-in-Time Count"" of the homeless who spend the night in shelters or are on the street. It's done by groups that regularly work with the homeless and who have become very good at tracking them down. ""The bottom line is, until 2009 we didn't have accurate counts for veteran homelessness,"" said Emanuel Cavallaro, spokesman for the National Alliance. Before direct counting was done, and the people doing the counting became adept at identifying whether a homeless person was a veteran, the estimate was done by the VA. ""That [VA] data was very problematic and wasn't very reliable."" So while the VA was estimating 131,000 homeless veterans per night in 2009, the   point-in-time  census of the homeless put the number at 75,609. It rose to 76,329 the following year in the midst of the Great Recession and has been declining ever since, according to the point-in-time counts. The count for January 2014: 49,933. The number has been declining, said HUD spokesman Patrick Rodenbush, because there has been a concerted effort in recent years by the Obama administration and Congress to get housing for homeless veterans. ""In an era of budget cuts, this is one area where Congress has been fully funding the president's requests,"" he said. ""This gets bipartisan support."" Our ruling Rhue Reis said, ""You have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day."" Reis inaccurately cited a 2009 study, which said the number at that time wasn’t more than 200,000. The latest, best data suggests that the current number is closer to 50,000. Homelessness among veterans is a serious problem, but the numbers are much lower than Reiss claimed. We rate his statement False.

Matthews: Cheney's post-Saddam tactic created ISIS
","Even as President Barack Obama rallies support to attack the forces of the Islamic State, the military group also known as ISIS and ISIL, he is taking barbs from both the hawks and the doves. The former, like Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, back military engagement but skewer the president for having failed to act earlier. The doves doubt that a military response will do more than breed new enemies of the United States. This pincer movement galls Obama’s fans who feel he is unfairly blamed for a disaster he inherited. In the closing seconds of MSNBC’s coverage special immediately after the president’s address on ISIS on Sept. 10, Hardball host Chris Matthews leveled this dig at a major backer of the original invasion of Iraq, former Vice President Dick Cheney. ""Do not listen to Dick Cheney,"" Matthews said. ""He's the one that created al-Qaida by taking over the holy land in Saudi Arabia. He’s the one that de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS."" We set aside the reference to Saudi Arabia and decided to take a closer look at the link between Cheney, ISIS and Iraq.  Through the MSNBC press office, we asked Matthews if he could expand on how Cheney created ISIS. We did not hear back. But we can fill in the blanks. Saddam Hussein wielded power through the Ba’ath party. For all practical purposes, leadership in the military and civilian sectors was synonymous with Ba’ath membership. Early in the occupation of Iraq, the George W. Bush administration decided to purge the Ba’athists. And we know that at least some of the success of ISIS on the battlefield is due to former generals and colonels under Hussein who have shaped the groups tactics and intelligence activities. Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said there is no doubt about this. ""ISIS is indeed cooperating with former Ba'athists, especially military officers, who have been seminal in directing the group's military strategy,"" Khatib told PunditFact. So that’s a rough top line. But Matthew’s statement requires that we explore two points: Was Cheney responsible for de-Ba’athification? And how might that have led to the creation of ISIS? We heard from several researchers of ISIS and its origins. From them, and our review of the historic record, we find that this Ba’athist connection between Cheney and ISIS is real but it is indirect, and more factors than the expulsion of Ba’athist members from the Iraqi military fueled ISIS. Cheney and de-Ba’athification Thanks to a report from the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, we know that more than a year before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration began discussing plans to govern the country once coalition forces overthrew Hussein. A basic puzzle was this: to leave the Ba’athist leadership in place would give them the power to undermine anything the Americans might want. But to get rid of them wholesale risked chaos. In the words of former Secretary of State Colin Powell, ""when you hit (Iraq), it’s like a crystal glass. It’s going to shatter."" Initially, Bush signed off on a plan of ""light"" de-Ba’athification. While that term was never well defined, the general notion was that the most senior leaders would be removed, and mid-level managers would stay. In mid May 2003, about two months after the invasion began, a very different policy took effect. Under Ambassador Paul Bremmer, the man in charge of Iraq reconstruction, at least 20,000 government workers were fired. Then Bremmer disbanded the entire Iraqi military. According to the inspector general’s report ""key U.S. generals on the ground in Iraq strongly opposed Bremer’s order. (They) anticipated using the Iraqi army to help stabilize the country and start the reconstruction process."" Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of coalition forces in Iraq in 2003 said, ""essentially, (the move) eliminated the entire government and civic capacity of the nation."" When challenged at the time, Bremmer insisted that his orders came from the White House and the Defense Department. We found some ambiguity on who issued those orders. De-Ba’athification has come to be seen in many quarters as such a pivotal error, no one has leaped forward to take credit. In addition to the inspector general’s report, there are two other assessments written by analysts with high-level access to insiders. One, from U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, reported that Bremmer was handed his instructions by an undersecretary of defense, Douglas Feith. ""President Bush had previously given Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld managerial control of the occupation, so it is possible that Feith spoke for Rumsfeld who spoke for Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney,"" the institute report said. A report from the Rand Corporation, the grand-daddy of the private defense policy think tanks, said the National Security Council, ""with President Bush in the chair,"" learned of the de-Ba’athfication order the day before it was implemented. ""No one raised objections,"" the report said. However, the inspector general’s report finds that the move caught both the CIA and the State Department off guard. A body of information ties Cheney to this decision. Cheney played a key role on the National Security Council and in all decisions surrounding the war. His chief of staff Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby recruited Bremmer for his post in Iraq. Press reports at the time and analyses afterward put Cheney in a group of hard-liners within the White House and the Defense Department who sought to remake Iraq from the ground up. While Cheney might not have drafted the de-Ba’athification order himself, we can safely say he supported it. De-Ba’athification and ISIS Several key steps lie between the former Ba’ath leaders and the circumstances that ultimately produced ISIS. Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King’s College London, said there is a tenuous link. ""De-Baathification and the dissolution of the Army disenfranchised Iraqi Sunnis, creat(ed) the kind of resentment that fueled the Iraqi insurgency in the mid 2000s,"" Neumann said. ""This helped al-Qaida in Iraq, ISIS's predecessor, and it's the same kind of resentment and mistrust towards Shiites that allowed ISIS to gain the support of Sunni tribes in its recent advances."" Austin Long, security policy professor at Columbia University, argues that it is, ""certainly correct that without the 2003 invasion, the ISIS would almost surely not exist."" On the other hand, Long said many ex-Ba’athists turned against al-Qaida in Iraq between 2005 and 2007. Long, as did the other analysts we contacted, pointed a heavy finger of blame at former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. ""It is really in the past four years, with the Maliki government really disenfranchising and even targeting many Sunnis, that the Islamic State has begun to find allies in the Sunni community again,"" Long said. ""Matthews’ statement is not wrong in the sense that without an invasion and de-Ba'athification there would be no ISIS, but it elides the fact that Cheney was not in office for the critical period when ISIS began to regain support."" William Braniff, executive director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said ISIS draws its strength from powerful ideological beliefs and ethnic tensions. ""The Ba’athists are useful, but not the drivers of this murderous movement,"" Braniff said. Beyond Maliki and de-Ba’athification, many factors led to the creation of ISIS, including the tactics of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which played ISIS forces against other rebel groups, and some early funding linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. The online news site Vox has an intriguing overview for those wishing to read more. Our ruling Matthews said Cheney de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS. We find that Cheney played a key role in de-Ba’athification and in creating the circumstances that led to the formation of ISIS. Former Ba’athists provide important military ISIS leadership, as they did in the first few years after the invasion when they joined forces with the group that preceded ISIS, al-Qaida in Iraq. However, many of those same Ba’athists later turned against al-Qaida in Iraq. They shifted back into the orbit of what became ISIS due to the repressive policies under Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. The causal link is too distant to say Cheney created ISIS. His decisions contributed to the group’s formation, but not more than that. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/15/chris-matthews/matthews-cheneys-post-saddam-tactic-created-isis/

Dan Patrick voted against final version of state budget partly restoring education funding in 2013
","A legislative supporter of more than $5 billion in reductions to public education in 2011 says those cuts had to happen but that he later played a lead role in restoring most of the funding. State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, the 2014 Republican lieutenant governor nominee, said in an Aug. 28, 2014, campaign press release: ""As chair of the Senate Education Committee, I led the charge to restore most of the education cuts from last session."" The 2013 Legislature boosted school spending by $3.4 billion. But Patrick was among four senators who voted against the final version of the budget later signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry. The restoration of aid occurred two years after majority Republicans, faced with a multibillion-dollar projected revenue shortfall, tweaked finance formulas and took other steps resulting in schools getting more than $5 billion less in 2012-13 than if the formulas and other commitments had gone unchanged. We knew Patrick chaired the Senate’s education panel. We didn’t recall him leading the charge to restore most of the cut funding. As it turned out, there's no convincing evidence he did. Patrick’s backup information By email, Patrick’s campaign spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, noted that in the 2013 session, Patrick led the budget-drafting Senate Finance Committee’s workgroup on public education, which included four other senators, according to a Senate web page. Also, Garcia said, Patrick voted twice in favor of increased funding. Minutes of the finance committee’s  March 13, 2013, meeting indicate all 15 panel members voted for a revised version of Senate Bill 1, the body’s 2014-15 budget act providing for $1.5 billion in additional state education aid, according to news accounts. A week later, Garcia said, Patrick voted on the Senate floor for the same partial restoration; the Senate Journal entry for that day shows Patrick and 28 other senators voting to advance the Senate version of the budget to the House. Two senators (but not Patrick) voted ""no."" Garcia also guided us to video of Patrick summarizing the Senate version of the budget. Patrick, addressing colleagues on the Senate floor, made no mention of rolling back the 2011 reductions. He did say he and the other workgroup members decided ""as a team"" to put most of $1.5 billion in additional state revenue allotted to the group into school funding formulas with funds also going to extended-day pre-Kindergarten and other programs. No school district would end up with less money than it was already getting from the state, Patrick said, while many would get more. No signs of Patrick leading charge Without success, we looked for independent confirmation of Patrick leading the charge for reversing most of the 2011 cuts. Just before the legislative session, Patrick joined with Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in issuing a press release declaring their ""education reform"" agenda. Patrick’s Dec. 19, 2012, press release called for changes in the state’s accountability system and more charter schools and pathways to graduation. The release did not mention general education spending. A Statesman news story posted online that day said Patrick was seeking to create tax credits enabling children to attend private schools. On the first day of the 2013 session, Patrick told the Houston Chronicle that while lawmakers cut the budget in 2011, the new session was ""an opportunity to do big and bold things for the future of Texas -- school choice and major education reform being at the top of the list."" In February 2013, after a Travis County state district judge agreed with school districts that the state’s education funding system was underfunded and unconstitutional, Patrick told the San Antonio Express-News he didn’t know where the Democratic judge, John Dietz, ""pulled his numbers from -- out of the sky, I think -- that we might need to spend $2,000 more per student, which equates to $10 billion. That might freeze us on doing anything significant because there are only so many dollars."" Patrick said any expenditure would be made ""strategically,"" the newspaper said. As the session proceeded, according to news stories and advocates for education groups, House members including Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Democrats including Rep. Sylvester Turner of Houston, propelled the final budget (which Patrick voted against) to increase education spending by $3.4 billion -- more than double the original Senate hike. In a May 30, 2013, public interview with the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith, Patrick said he voted against the budget in the end because certain education initiatives -- including funds to pay for students to take the SAT -- weren’t in it. Some education groups including the Texas Association of School Boards and the Equity Center, which represents property-poor school districts, declined to comment on whether Patrick led the charge to restore dollars. Josh Sanderson, a lobbyist for the Association of Texas Professional Educators, told us education groups didn’t find Patrick receptive to reversing the 2011 cuts. ""He never responded positively,"" Sanderson said by phone. Sanderson and Lonnie Hollingsworth, who advocates for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, said pressure to escalate education spending mostly came from House members, among them Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton. By phone, Hollandsworth singled out Pitts and Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, R-Killeen, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, and Democratic Reps. Turner and Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio. ""It’s really not any one individual who led the charge for the partial restoration of funding,"" Hollingsworth said. Clay Robison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, said by email Patrick’s vote against the final budget ""is what counts. If the final budget doesn’t pass, it doesn’t matter how much a legislator put into the budget for education or any other program."" Patrick, Robison said, ""didn’t convince me or TSTA that he cared any more about adequate education funding than he did in 2011."" Bonnie Lesley of Waco, a retired teacher and co-founder of Texas Kids Can’t Wait, which describes itself as a bipartisan group, credited House members for the ultimate aid boost. By phone, Lesley called Patrick’s claim a matter of laughable chutzpah. The group previously issued a ""report card"" rating legislators based on votes on education measures; Patrick was among legislators rated ""unacceptable."" Garcia, informed of what we were finding, stressed Patrick’s chairmanship of the education panel. ""The chairmanship says it all,"" he said. Our ruling Patrick said that in the 2013 session, ""I led the charge to restore most of the education cuts from last session."" In the session, Patrick voted twice for a version of the budget elevating education spending by $1.5 billion, or less than a third of the earlier reduction. He later voted against the final budget driving up such spending by $3.4 billion, a decision he didn’t clarify to us. On balance, it’s not clear to us how someone can lead in putting money back by voting against putting money back. This claim grades out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

NRCC says Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., voted with Barack Obama 85% of the time
","One of the biggest obstacles to a strong Democratic showing in the 2014 midterm elections is that approval ratings for President Barack Obama are mired in the 40 percent range -- and even lower in many red states. Because of this, it’s no surprise that the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- is creating ads that emphasize the degree to which vulnerable Democratic incumbents have voted with Obama. We recently found two NRCC ads using virtually identical language on this point. Here, we’ll fact-check an ad attacking Democratic Rep. John Barrow of Georgia. In a separate item, we’ll fact-check an ad that targets Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia. Barrow represents a district that voted for Republican Mitt Romney by a 12-point margin in the 2012 presidential race, making him one of the few House Democratic incumbents representing a district won by Romney. In fact, only three Democratic House members represent more heavily Republican districts than Barrow. (Rahall represents one of those three districts; the other two are two retiring lawmakers, Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina.) This makes Barrow, first elected in 2004, a key target for House Republicans. He faces a strong GOP challenger in construction company owner Rick Allen, and independent handicappers rate it as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year. The NRCC’s ad features Richard Fender, a business owner from Augusta, Ga. In it, Fender says, ""Whatever Obama wants, he's voted with him,"" a comment that’s accompanied by text on the screen that says, ""John Barrow voted with Obama 85 percent of the time."" In much smaller type, the ad footnotes this claim to ""Congressional Quarterly 2009 vote analysis."" Since data from 2009 would now be five years old, we had a hunch that the NRCC might have ignored a couple of years with lower percentages. It turns out we were right. In 2010, according to the same CQ study, Barrow voted with Obama 83 percent of the time. But that dropped to 59 percent in 2011, and fell even further to 28 percent in 2012 and 35 percent in 2013. (Data for 2014 has not yet been posted.) Clearly, the 85 percent figure for voting with Obama was a more attractive one for the NRCC to highlight. But it amounts to cherry-picking. Democrats could easily run an ad saying Barrow voted with Obama 28 percent of the time and be just as correct (if not more so, since the data backing up the Democratic assertion is more recent). NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill attributed the drop in Barrow’s percentage of voting with Obama to increasing discomfort with the president’s agenda. ""When Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the House under President Obama and John Barrow was in the majority, he voted with his party at every turn,"" Prill said. Another likely factor worth noting: Between the 2010 Census and the 2012 election, Georgia’s Republican-dominated state Legislature drew a new map for the state’s congressional delegation. The new arrangement removed Savannah and other moderate-to-liberal areas from Barrow’s district, turning what had been a slightly Democratic-leaning district into a modestly Republican one. So at least part of Barrow’s increasing independence from Obama can be chalked to a change in the policy preferences of the voters he represents. Our ruling The NRCC’s ad said, ""John Barrow voted with Obama 85 percent of the time."" Barrow did indeed vote with Obama 85 percent of the time -- but that was in 2009, a fact that is footnoted in the ad, albeit in small type. Between 2010 and 2013, Barrow’s voting record was much less closely aligned with Obama, bottoming out at 28 percent and 35 percent in the most recent years for which data is available. House Democratic leaders might consider scores like that to be short of ""team behavior."" The statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/sep/15/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-rep-john-barrow-d-ga-voted-barack-obama-/

NRCC says Nick Rahall voted with Barack Obama 94% of the time

(The most Republican district held by a Democrat is the Utah seat occupied by retiring Rep. Jim Matheson.) Rahall faces state Sen.

Stokes right on broad gender pay claim, missteps on specifics
","With the national implications of Georgia’s U.S. Senate battle and the close battle for governor, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor recently tried to draw some attention to that overshadowed race by highlighting so-called women’s issues. Connie Stokes, one of a handful of female candidates (all Democrats, save for the Libertarian choice for U.S. Senate) for statewide office, mentioned issues such as business, domestic violence and women’s health in a recent fundraising email. Then she referenced an issue that has tripped up candidates all year: the pay gap between men and women. ""After serving in the state Senate for 10 years, it saddens me that women still do not get paid as much as men,"" Stokes wrote. ""There appears to be some discrepancy about the difference in the amount of money women are paid compared to men,"" she continued.  ""You know It does not matter what the difference is, women are paid less than men for the same work, period. "" Democrats from President Obama on down have emphasized the ""gender wage gap"" all year, in an apparent bid to woo the female voters that tend to favor the party to polls. Stokes would need that turnout and then some to win her uphill battle against Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle for the job that mostly presides over a tantrum-prone state Senate. PolitiFact Georgia, and our PolitiFact national arm, have fact-checked various incarnations of the gender-wage claim before. For example, we gave Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn a Mostly True rating in April for her statement, ""On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make."" Her qualifier ""on average"" and broad statement kept the claim on target. By contrast, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter – the grandfather of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jason Carter – earned a Mostly False rating for his statement that, ""in the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men."" In those cases, they were referring to a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau study that examined total wages of male and female workers. Men’s total wages were about 23 percent higher than women’s, the study found. But the gap was due in part to men working more hours, the study concluded. It did not look at pay rates for the same work or the same number of hours. Stokes avoided the specifics of numbers in her statement. And other data backs up her claim of an overall  wage gap between men and women. Her claim, however, gets more problematic as she gets more specific. Looking at weekly wages, a 2011 Bureau of Labor Statistics report found women earned 81 percent of men’s wages for all occupations (Table 18). The gap is smaller than the Census figures, which rely on annual wages and can therefore include pensions, bonuses and other factors that widen the difference. Those different conclusions show the inherent problem with bold statements on a wage gap, especially when referencing specific numbers.   Numbers also don’t tell the whole story about the second part of Stokes’ claim, that women are paid less ""for the same work."" Again, the data overwhelmingly back up the broad claim – but not in every field. The 2011 BLS report shows women actually earn 12 cents more than men in the food preparation/serving industries, 10 cents more as ""billing and posting clerks and machine operators"" and 5 cents more than men working as store clerks. Yet beyond those three jobs, and looking at broad industry categories, women still earn less than men overall (Table 19). Stokes said that was the point to her statement. ""We know the numbers don’t agree because of the variables, but we all know that women are paid less than men,"" Stokes said. ""That’s the bottom line."" If the point is women earn less than men, it would be. But the comparisons are not as simple as they seem at first blush. Experts agree on a gender-based wage gap. Yet differences in life choices such as occupational choices and hours worked can make simple comparisons tricky. The gap can narrow, for instance, when accounting for education level and specific jobs. Stokes was on target to cite a gender pay gap. But vastly oversimplifies the ""same work"" claim -- it does matter what job is being performed. Stokes claim is accurate on one level. But a lot of context is needed to really understand what is going on. We rate her claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/15/connie-stokes/stokes-broadly-right-gender-pay-claim/

Did NFL commissioner Roger Goodell interview Janay Rice with her husband, Ray Rice, present?
","The Sunday news shows broke from their usual coverage of Washington’s inner-workings to examine another institution fraught with controversy: the National Football League. The heat is on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for his discipline of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who was shown in a video leaked last week punching out his now-wife Janay Rice in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino elevator in February. The video’s release prompted more voices to question Rice’s initial two-game suspension as too lenient, including Goodell, who announced Rice’s indefinite suspension amid fallout from the video. To some sports pundits and victim advocates, that’s not nearly enough to prove Goodell is for real about punishing players accused of domestic violence. Washington Post sports columnist Mike Wise said Goodell should lose his job on CNN’s State of the Union. ""The thing that bothered me most is Roger Goodell at one point tried to play essentially a marriage counselor with the victim and the perpetrator, Janay and Ray Rice,"" Wise said. ""He put the victim and the perpetrator together. Every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency, that’s a no-no."" Wise continued: ""She is sitting, telling her story in front of the person who essentially abused her. And it’s the tone deafness of those types of things that show me that this commissioner does not take domestic violence seriously enough."" PunditFact wondered if Wise is right: Did Goodell talk to victim Janay Rice with Ray Rice present? And does that violate the policy of domestic violence advocacy organizations and law enforcement agencies? The meeting lead-up and fallout  An NFL spokesman declined to comment, citing the investigation by former FBI director Robert Mueller of the NFL's actions. The meeting in question occurred June 16 at the NFL’s headquarters in New York, three months after a New Jersey grand jury indicted Rice on charges of third-degree aggravated assault from the elevator incident. Ray Rice, who married Janay Rice on March 28, was accepted into a pretrial intervention program to avoid time behind bars in May. The purpose of the mid-June meeting was to discuss disciplinary action by the NFL. Sports Illustrated’s Peter King broke the first details about the meeting, citing anonymous inside sources that the NFL has not contradicted. The meeting included not just Goodell and Ray and Janay Rice, but also Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome, Ravens President Dick Cass, and two NFL executives, King reported. In the meeting, Janay Rice asked Goodell to be lenient to Ray Rice, the source told King, saying major discipline could ruin the running back’s career. On July 24, the NFL announced it would suspend Rice for just two games, setting off early waves of criticism. King’s story is important because it informed the subsequent chorus of columns and punditry that slammed Goodell for not talking to the couple separately. The popular sports blog Deadspin quoted two domestic violence victim advocates -- Rene Renick, vice president of programs and emerging issues with the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and attorney adviser Viktoria Kristiansson of prosecutor resource group AEquitas -- who said Goodell’s combined meeting with the couple was inappropriate. ""Even having the two of them in the room and thinking that she can speak freely in that kind of a situation is crazy,"" Renick told Deadspin. ""There is no way she can speak freely. And if there was any chance that she was afraid or coerced, she couldn't have said that. She would have been probably in a whole lot of danger."" A columnist for the Ravens’ hometown paper, the Baltimore Sun’s Dan Rodricks, interviewed a local social worker and counseling professor who echoed that point. And Wise, too, wrote a July 29 column that went into more detail about Goodell’s meeting with the couple than Wise discussed on CNN. In an interview with PunditFact, Wise said the meeting was ""ethically irresponsible"" and shows Goodell’s background lacks professional mental health training. ""I have no qualms whatsoever about maintaining that law enforcement agencies and domestic violence advocates on the whole support not interviewing a perpetrator and the abused together, especially when deciding matters of discipline for the perpetrator,"" Wise said. Law enforcement policies Ruth M. Glenn, interim executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, confirmed to PunditFact what other domestic violence advocates told other news organizations: Goodell should not have talked to Janay Rice in front of her husband. ""When that incident is being reviewed, investigated, whatever it is, there should never be an opportunity where that inquiry occurs when they’re both present,"" Glenn said. ""Absolutely, it doesn’t make it any different if it had happened a day before."" Glenn said the domestic violence prevention community has pushed for years for law enforcement agencies to adopt policies that call for interviewing victims and suspects separately (example of model policies and checklists here.) We found plenty of examples of law enforcement agencies that expressly say to separate the victim, suspect and witnesses involved in the dispute, including Santa Clara County (Calif.), Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina and New Jersey. (We didn’t have time to check each district or state by our deadline, and the U.S. Department of Justice did not offer a comment, but we are comfortable saying this policy is widespread.) Stanford University law professor Robert Weisberg noted that detectives always question witnesses separately. Still, while separation may be required in the immediate aftermath of an incident, it isn’t always maintained throughout the legal process, said said Charles H. Rose III, Stetson University College of Law professor. Sometimes couples in domestic violence cases are interviewed together so officials can judge how they act with one another. ""By the time Goodell was involved it was no longer necessary to have them be interviewed apart,"" Rose said. ""In effect, the wagons had already been circled."" Also left unsaid by Wise: Goodell was not initiating a law enforcement investigation. That already had occurred. ""You cannot apply a law enforcement paradigm to an employment issue,"" Rose said. ""Different standards, different law, and different results."" Goodell’s goal for talking with Ray and Janay Rice may not have been analogous with a law enforcement investigation, cautioned James Acker, a University at Albany-SUNY School of Criminal Justice professor. ""If it was, then for the same reasons, such a joint discussion would not likely be appropriate,"" Acker said. ""On the other hand, for all I know, the context was quite different. Perhaps Goodell already had received a factual account elsewhere; perhaps he wanted to attempt to gauge the Rices' relationship and try to form an impression of them together."" Our ruling Wise has a problem with Goodell meeting with Ray and Janay Rice together as Goodell sought information about the February elevator incident and aftermath that would inform Rice’s discipline by the league. First, there’s little debate that the meeting occurred, as it has been widely reported and not challenged by the NFL. Second, Wise also claimed that ""in every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency"" a meeting like that would be ""a no-no."" That’s for the most part correct as well, though experts we spoke to questioned whether it’s the right parallel to draw. Questioning victims separately from suspects in domestic violence cases does appear to be a widespread practice both encouraged by domestic violence advocates and many police and state policies after an incident occurs. But Goodell was not conducting a criminal investigation -- that already had occurred, and he had access to that information. Also, there are occasions when couples involved in domestic violence cases are interviewed together later, allowing police and prosecutors to judge how they act with one another so they can assess credibility and potential prosecution, one expert told us. Setting aside whether the comparison is apt, Wise’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/14/mike-wise/did-nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-interview-janay/

Former CIA director: Obama said Syrian opposition was made up of doctors and pharmacists
","President Barack Obama drew harsh criticism for comparing the terrorist group Islamic State to a ""JV team"" — and then again for claiming that’s not what he said (PolitiFact rated that statement False). On Sunday, another one of his characterizations of the situation in the Middle East came under fire as the political talk shows debated his plan for dealing with instability there. Former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden was asked about Obama’s decision to arm local rebel groups in Syria to help fight the Islamic State there. He wondered why Obama was suddenly interested in arming opposition forces there. ""The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on,"" Hayden said. ""We've turned on the dime in terms of our expectation for them, so if we're going to get them to this force that he said it was fantasy to rely on to the force that's going to be, as (White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough) said, the anvil in a combined arms operation, they're going to need an awful lot of help."" In this case, we're checking whether Obama described the Syrian rebels as ""pharmacists and doctors."" We're not checking whether the rebels actually are pharmacists or doctors, as we'll explain in a bit. We tried to reach Hayden but were unsuccessful. McDonough, though, was asked about Obama’s comment during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. ""I think that the question that the president was responding to at the time was looking back a couple of years,"" McDonough said. ""We have had a relationship with these fighters now for a couple of years. They're getting better and more capable."" If that’s the case, then maybe Hayden was embellishing Obama’s comments. Keep in mind, the debate over arming the Syrian opposition forces in their fight against Syrian President Bashar al Assad has been ongoing for years. PolitiFact noted in a fact-check last week that several key members of Obama’s national security team favored the move in August 2012. Let’s take a look at exactly what Obama said. We found four instances of Obama describing the Syrian opposition forces in recent months. May 29 Obama discussed his foreign policy during an interview with NPR. He was asked if conditions were more ""robust"" for aiding the rebels than in the past. ""I wouldn't say the conditions are better,"" Obama said. ""In many ways, the conditions are worse. ""When you talk about the moderate opposition, many of these people were farmers or dentists or maybe some radio reporters who didn't have a lot of experience fighting,"" he added. ""But creating a capacity for them to hold ground, to be able to rebuff vicious attacks, for them to be able to also organize themselves in ways that are cohesive — all that takes, unfortunately, more time than I think many people would like."" For what it’s worth, the Washington Post fact-checked Obama’s claim about the makeup of Syrian rebels as farmer, dentists and radio reporters and found it to be dubious. June 19 In mid June, a few days before Obama asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip some of the Syrian opposition, he discussed the makeup of those forces on a couple occasions. In a June 19 press conference, a reporter asked Obama if ""the expansion of the Syria war into Iraq changed your mind about the type of weapons and training we’re now willing to give the opposition there?"" Obama responded: ""The question has always been, is there the capacity of moderate opposition on the ground to absorb and counteract extremists that might have been pouring in, as well as an Assad regime supported by Iran and Russia that outmanned them and was ruthless. ""And so we have consistently provided that opposition with support,"" Obama said. ""Oftentimes, the challenge is if you have former farmers or teachers or pharmacists who now are taking up opposition against a battle-hardened regime, with support from external actors that have a lot at stake, how quickly can you get them trained; how effective are you able to mobilize them. And that continues to be a challenge."" The next morning, he made a similar comment to CBS' This Morning. ""When you get farmers, dentists and folks who have never fought before going up against a ruthless opposition in Assad, the notion that they were in a position suddenly to overturn not only Assad but also ruthless, highly trained jihadists if we just sent a few arms is a fantasy."" Aug. 8 In a sitdown with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Obama again was asked about why he chose not to arm the Syrian rebels. ""This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards,"" Obama said. Counter to what McDonough said Sept. 14, Obama very much seems to be talking about the Syrian opposition in the present and the challenges in providing them with assistance and arms. This continued up until August. The one caveat that Hayden does not mention is the conversation was largely in the context of the opposition’s capacity to go up against Assad and the Syrian regime, not their ability to fight a rogue terrorist organization like the Islamic State. Still, it is a noticeable about-face that as recently as August, Obama told Friedman he believed ""there’s not as much capacity as you would hope"" for providing these individuals training. Our ruling In discussing Obama’s decision to arm opposition forces in Syria, Hayden said, ""The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on."" We found several examples of Obama, as recently as June and August, characterizing the Syrian rebels as pharmacists and doctors, as well as dentists, radio reporters and teachers. Usually he was describing their capacity to fight Assad, but that doesn’t make Hayden’s point any less accurate. We rate Hayden’s statement True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/14/michael-hayden/former-cia-director-obama-said-syrian-opposition-w/
"['Elections', 'Virginia', 'Robert Sarvis']","
Sarvis says over 40 percent of Virginia's General Assembly seats go uncontested each election
","Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Robert Sarvis says the two-party system leads to a lot of one-candidate elections. In a speech at the Buena Vista Labor Day Festival, Sarvis said voters need more choices, particularly in General Assembly elections. ""Over 40 of our 100 (House of) Delegates seats go uncontested every year, and over 40 percent of our state senate seats go uncontested every year,"" Sarvis said. With all General Assembly seats up for election next year, we put Sarvis’ statement to the Truth-O-Meter. Nicholas Cote, spokesman for the Sarvis campaign, said the claim was based on election data compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project. The records examine general elections going back to 1999 and show the number of uncontested statehouse elections. All seats in the 100-member House are up for grabs every two years. Cote accurately noted that in the last eight elections, an average of 49.75 seats House seats were uncontested. That would be in line with Sarvis’ proclamation that more than 40 House of Delegates seats are one-candidate elections. All seats in the 40-member Senate are up every four years. And Cote correctly noted that an average of 17.25 Senate seats were uncontested in the last four elections. That’s an average of 43 percent per election, Cote said, consistent with Sarvis’ claim. But Sarvis didn’t phrase his statement as an average. He said ""every year"" more than 40 percent of the seats in each chamber weren’t contested. So we have to look at each election year individually. Here are the number of uncontested seats in biennial House elections since 1999, according to returns from the state Board of Elections: 2013 -- 45 2011 -- 63 2009 -- 31 2007 -- 59 2005 -- 51 2003 -- 61 2001 -- 40 1999 -- 48 Sarvis’ claim that ""over"" 40 seats went uncontested each cycle doesn’t hold up for 2009 and -- because it’s our job to be sticklers -- in 2001. Here are the number of uncontested seats in quadrennial Senate elections since 1999: 2011 -- 14 2007 -- 17 2003 -- 19 1999 -- 19 Remember, the Senate has 40 members. Sarvis’ claim that more than 40 percent of the seats went uncontested each cycle sputters in the latest election, in 2011, when 35 percent the races had no competition. Virginia’s not the only place where a significant percentage of state legislature races go uncontested each election year. An October 2012 study from the College of William and Mary found that 39.7 percent of the 6,000 statehouse races across the country that year lacked competition between major party candidates. The study examined the 44 states that had legislative races that year. Virginia wasn’t included because it holds General Assembly races in odd-numbered years. The study said legislative redistricting -- in which lawmakers draw election maps and usually fashion safe districts for themselves -- discouraged competition for statehouse seats. That would carry over to Virginia, where lawmakers control redistricting, according to John J. McGlennon, a professor of government at the College of William and Mary who co-authored the report. McGlennon said another factor deterring competition is that Virginia’s statehouse races occur in years when there are no presidential or congressional races. That means down-ballot candidates for the state legislature can’t ride a coattail effect into office, he said. Our ruling Sarvis said ""every year"" more than 40 percent of House and Senate seats have only one candidate. Election figures generally back Sarvis. The only blip is that during a few years -- 2011 for the Senate, as well as 2009 and 2001 for the House -- the number of uncontested races didn’t quite hit the threshold Sarvis cited. His point is basically correct but could use some additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/sep/14/robert-sarvis/sarvis-says-over-40-percent-virginias-general-asse/
"['Income', 'Small Business', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Harris']","
New Wisconsin tax breaks will let factory owners pay less income tax than Taco Bell workers?
","To spark his underdog campaign for Congress, Democrat Mark Harris is steering attention to his GOP opponent, state Sen. Glenn Grothman. And doing so with an attack that compares how much factory owners and Taco Bell workers pay in state income taxes. The winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 election will succeed retiring Fond du Lac Republican Tom Petri, who was first elected to the east-central Wisconsin seat in 1979. In doing an interview with Harris on Sept. 2, 2014, John ""Sly"" Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host in the Madison area, argued that Gov. Scott Walker’s administration has provided ""corporate welfare"" and that the Legislature ""has been sort of a rubber stamp."" Harris, who is the Winnebago County executive, referred to Walker’s 2011-’13 state budget in giving this response: ""Well, even in the first Walker budget, Mr. Grothman pushed through tax credits for manufacturing and agriculture,"" Harris said. ""And he did it in the last day of the Joint Finance Committee, when there really wasn't time for anyone to scrutinize what was happening. And they basically passed credits that all but eliminate income tax on manufacturers and on agricultural operations."" He continued: ""And, you know, it's not fair to have someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income pay less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage. But that's exactly what Glenn Grothman passed, and it's phasing in gradually."" That’s an eye-opener. Did Grothman push through credits that, over time, would enable a factory owner earning millions to pay less state income tax than a worker earning minimum wage? The credits In June 2011, Grothman helped lead an effort to add manufacturing and agriculture tax credits to Walker’s state budget. The credits apply to the production income of the businesses, not to income such as royalties and investments. The measure gave businesses that are assessed as manufacturing or agricultural for property tax purposes a dollar-for-dollar credit on income from manufacturing or agricultural production on their 2013 tax bill. The credit, which began in 2013, rises annually until reaching 7.5 percent in 2016. Businesses organized as, for example, limited liability companies -- where an owner pays the firm's tax as personal income tax -- can reduce their state income tax rate from as much as 7.75 percent to 0.25 percent or less. In other words, come 2016, the 7.5 percent credit could eliminate a large share of a factory owner’s tax liability. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the credits will mean $359.7 million less in tax revenues for the state over its first five years, and $128.7 million a year once it is fully phased in starting in 2016. The value   Harris, who formerly practiced as a certified public accountant and a lawyer, provided figures on the state’s income tax rates and on the 2016 tax credits. The figures support his claim in that the credits would wipe away all of a factory owner’s state income tax liability -- on factory production income only -- for the first $2.4 million in production income. We consulted two accounting professors: the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater’s William Raabe, whose specialties include state taxation; and Stacie LaPlante, chair in accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Business School. They agreed that a full-time minimum-wage worker ($7.25 per hour for 2,000 hours per year) claiming the standard deduction ($9,930) and exemption ($700) would owe about $170 in state income tax. They also agreed that the factory owner wouldn’t owe more than that on production income until after earning roughly $2.6 million in production income -- a figure even higher than the one Harris cited. But the professors added some caveats under which the owner could pay more state income tax than the Taco Bell worker. ""Qualified production income"" is a specific type of business income. Not all of the net income from a factory would necessarily qualify for the tax credits, which would mean the owner would be paying additional taxes. Once the factory owner's production income exceeds roughly $2.6 million, he would pay more income tax than the Taco Bell worker.  But it's worth noting that the owner's rate on that level of income would be only 0.15 percent (7.65 percent rate minus 7.5 percent credit), well below the 4 percent rate paid by the Taco Bell worker. Harris said Grothman pushed through tax credits so that when they are phased in, ""someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income"" will pay ""less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage."" Once the credits pushed by Grothman are fully phased in, in 2016, some factory owners who earn up to roughly $2.5 million from production income from the factory will owe less in state income tax on that production income than a full-time worker earning minimum wage. But factory owners earning above that amount from production income would pay more than the minimum-wage worker, and more on any other income that doesn’t come from production. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, our definition of Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel web page.  This item was changed on Sept. 15, 2014 to clarify that the tax rate on production income above roughly $2.6 million is effectively 0.15 percent.",/factchecks/2014/sep/14/mark-harris-wisc/new-wisconsin-tax-breaks-will-let-factory-owners-p/

Taxpayers paid for a secret no-bid contract that benefited Gina Raimondo’s firm, Angel Taveras says
","A TV commercial that ran before the Sept. 9 primary showed two well-dressed men carrying briefcases, approaching each other. They meet in the shadows of a stairwell to shake hands. The implication: they don't want anyone to see what they're doing. The word ""SECRET"" appears in large green letters, followed by the words ""No-bid Contract."" A narrator talks about General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, then one of four Democrats running in a primary for governor, a race she ultimately won. ""Her venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers,"" the narrator says The commercial was for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, one of Raimondo’s opponents. It didn't say what the contract was about, but it sure sounded shady. Even though the primary is over, we decided to examine the commercial’s claim because the issues it raises may well come up again as Raimondo runs against Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, who won the Republican gubernatorial primary. The commercial cites a March 1, 2014 story in The Providence Journal that explored the terms of a 2006 investment that Providence made in a venture capital investment firm, Point Judith Capital. Raimondo co-founded the company. In March 2006, four years before Raimondo would enter politics, a board chaired by then-Mayor David Cicilline voted to invest $1 million in retirement money with Point Judith. The investment would last 10 years; the city initially invested $100,000. Under the terms of the deal, if the investment made money by 2016, Point Judith would get 20 percent of the profit and it would refund the management fees Providence would be paying to Point Judith -- as much as $200,000 during the duration of the deal. By Dec. 31, 2013, the city had invested $907,211 and Point Judith had deducted $159,690 in fees, but the value of the investment had grown to $1.466 million. What makes this a ""secret"" deal? Venture capital firms, which provide early financing for innovative companies in hopes of getting big payoffs down the road, are tight-lipped about how they invest their money and demand secrecy from those who invest in them. The Journal spent months trying to get details about the city's Point Judith investment, which included debate between Point Judith and the city over what to release. In April, more than a month after The Journal reported on the general terms of the deal and eight years after it was approved, Providence released a copy of its agreement with Point Judith to the newspaper, with several portions -- including dollar amounts, investment periods, interest rates and other key elements -- redacted. So key elements Providence's contract with Point Judith remain secret. But when it comes to other aspects of the deal, the image of two shadowy businessmen cutting an illicit deal in a stairwell is ridiculously wrong. The vote to invest money with Point Judith was approved unanimously on March 23, 2006, during a regular meeting of the city's Board of Investment Commissioners. The public session was in a third floor conference room in City Hall. A transcript of the meeting, during which Raimondo made a presentation and members weighed the pros and cons of the deal, is available online. The investment was recommended by the fund's investment counselor. One reason the city went with Point Judith: at the time, the company was the only venture capital firm based in Rhode Island. ""We did not say the contract was entered into secretly,"" said Dawn Bergantino, spokeswoman for Taveras’ gubernatorial campaign. ""We are saying the contract itself is secret. We were talking specifically about the non-disclosure aspect of the contract. When the agreement was signed, the position of Point Judith was that the information is not for public disclosure. The Mayor has fought Point Judith to subsequently make the contract public."" ""If the specifics of the contract are hidden from public view, and if on being asked to release the contract the requests are refused – the contract is secret,"" she said. And was this a no-bid contract? The short answer: yes. But that's not unusual on the state or local level. Investments are often done without bidding because they are based on the recommendation of a fund's investment adviser. ""For the most part, most do not go out for bid"" unless an investment board doesn't have a financial consultant, said Howard Pohl of The Bogdahn Group. He is a well-known consultant to many public pension plans. Spokespeople for Taveras insisted that most investments were done through requests for proposals. We asked to see copies of past RFPs. Providence's consultant, Wainwright Investment Counsel, said it didn't have any available. We also asked three of the four people who voted on the Point Judith investment about whether bidding was standard practice. Cicilline, now a U.S. Congressman, said through spokesman Andrew Gernt that individual investments did not go out for bid. Myrth York, who was a member of the investment commission at the time and is supporting Raimondo's bid for governor, said the same thing. ""Someone would come in and say they had something, and we would either be interested in it or not, and part of it would depend on how it fit in with the overall portfolio. It's wasn't like you opened three bids and picked one,"" she said. Stephen T. Napolitano, also a former commission member, said: ""We relied on our consultant to make recommendations and provide us with people in the field to come in and do interviews. Based on that, we made a decision to hire them. . . . In terms of putting it out to bid, I don't think it was ever done back then. I don't think that's the normal procedure."" Our ruling Angel Taveras said Gina Raimondo's ""venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers,"" citing a newspaper story that deals with the terms of Point Judith's deal with Providence. Some elements of the deal remain secret. But the ad’s clear implication that the contract was approved in secret is wrong. It wasn’t. It was voted on in an open session. To call it a no-bid contract is technically correct, but that phrase suggests something improper. The reality is that many such investment decisions never go out for bid because the investments have been vetted by a financial consultant. Because the statement in Taveras' commercial contained some element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Alison Lundergan Grimes ad says Mitch McConnell voted for corporate tax breaks for outsourcing
","Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate from Kentucky, says that as Mitch McConnell’s wealth has grown, he has hindered Kentucky’s prosperity. Recently, we looked at an ad in which Grimes said McConnell, the incumbent Senate minority leader, made millions while in public office. We rated that claim Mostly False. But that was only one of several claims in the ad that attacked McConnell for being out-of-touch with average Kentuckians and biased toward the wealthy. Another claim caught our attention: McConnell voted ""three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas."" We’ve noticed that this claim -- that a candidate voted for tax breaks that send jobs overseas -- is a trending talking point among Democratic candidates, and we’ve found that often the claim is simplistic and misleading. So we decided to see whether or not Grimes’ claim about McConnell stacks up. The votes The ad makes it sound as if McConnell voted three times to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing specifically. This is not the case. For evidence for its claims, the Grimes campaign pointed us to information on their website. All three ""no"" votes were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions. These deductions did not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind of tax break for moving employees out of the country. McConnell’s first ""no"" vote was in 2010 on the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. The second and third ""no"" votes were on the Bring Jobs Home Act, which was proposed in 2012 and again in 2014. These votes, split almost exclusively along party lines, were on procedural measures that ultimately prevented the bills from receiving a final passage vote. Both laws would have given a tax benefit to companies that insource jobs and denied an already-existing tax break to companies that outsource them. The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn’t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Tax experts we spoke with said the law was almost entirely symbolic. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule, compared to corporate tax revenue overall. So minuscule, in fact, that getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company’s decision to engage in foreign activity. ""It adds up to a trivial amount of money,"" said James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan. ""Given how many big multinational firms we have, it’s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior."" Eliminating standard deductions for costs associated with outsourcing would result in an average $14.2 million a year in revenue, according to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. That’s not much in the grand scheme of things. For some perspective, the Internal Revenue Service took in $273.5 billion in corporate income taxes in 2013 alone, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group, based on Office of Management and Budget data. Revenue from eliminating that deduction would amount to 0.005 percent of total revenue. Among Republicans’ reasons for opposing the Bring Jobs Home Act, the policy would have lost revenue and added to the deficit, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation. The government would have spent more money on the tax credit for insourcing than it would have raised by eliminating deductions related to outsourcing. Overall, the policy would have resulted in an estimated $214 million loss over 10 years. Our ruling Grimes said McConnell voted ""three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas."" The ad makes it seem like McConnell voted to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing. Actually, he voted ""no"" on legislation that would have eliminated the standard business expense deductions -- which exist for all businesses -- for costs associated with outsourcing. (Current law includes no provision that specifically addresses insourcing or outsourcing.) These bills had little chance of passing, and they were largely symbolic.

Did Oregon state Rep. Shemia Fagan sponsor the 'new Buy American law'?
","State Rep. Shemia Fagan, a first-term Democrat, is running for re-election for House District 51. House Republicans, who support Fagan’s challenger, Jodi Bailey, sent us a statement from Fagan’s Voters’ Pamphlet entry. They argue that the statement mischaracterizes Fagan’s involvement in a bill introduced into the regular session of the 2013 Legislature. The claim: The statement pertains to House Bill 3473, which would have amended part of the state’s public contracting code to require public agencies to buy American-made iron or steel if the purchase amount exceeded $50,000. Fagan says in her entry: ""I sponsored Oregon’s new Buy American law and fought to give local companies the first shot at state contracts, so your hard earned tax dollars create more jobs here at home."" ""HB 3473 of the 2013 session did NOT become law,"" wrote Kara Walker, a House Republicans’ spokeswoman. ""Rep. Fagan’s assertion that she sponsored a new law is false and misleading."" PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: We contacted Fagan’s campaign. Fagan, a business attorney by profession, defended her choice of words in an email. ""Yes, the terms ‘bill’ and ‘law’ are frequently used interchangeably in common speak,"" she wrote, ""particularly by everyday Oregonians, who are the audience for my Voter’s Pamphlet statement."" A quick Google search, she added, turned up two instances supporting her assertion. One linked to a report by a southern Oregon television station headlined ""Now it’s Oregon Senate’s turn to vote on gun laws."" The second took us to a press release issued last spring by the Oregon Republican Party. The release, Fagan said, ""...used the terms ‘bill’ and ‘law’ interchangeably."" We checked the state’s legislative website and found Fagan among the 10 sponsors -- six Democrats and four Republicans -- of HB 3473. The bill had a first reading in the House on March 28, 2013. One public hearing was held on April 10, 2013. The bill was still stuck in the House Business and Labor Committee when the session ended on July 8, 2013. So could she rightfully call it a law? We called Legislative Counsel Dexter Johnson, whose office reviews legislators’ proposals for new laws and drafts them into bill form for presentation to the full assembly. He walked us through the bill-drafting process then summed up: ""This is technically a bill. It didn’t become law."" We called Vera Katz, a longtime Oregon Democratic legislator who served as speaker of the House and later as Portland mayor. We didn’t identify Fagan by name, but asked if ""bill"" and ""law"" are routinely used interchangeably in Salem. ""That’s not accurate,"" she said. ""It’s a bill. It’s not a law. That person should have been more careful."" We turned to the links Fagan provided. The KPIC (Roseburg) headline referred to ""gun laws,"" but every reference in the story was to ""bills."" The GOP press release, issued April 4, 2013, stated why the party opposed four proposed Democratic gun bills. ""Such laws,"" the release stated, ""assume the guilt of all firearms owners…"" That language, however, seems conditional, gathering any anti-gun legislation under one umbrella and saying, in essence, ""laws such as these aren’t needed."" Finally, we tackled the aspect of Fagan’s claim where she argues that the words ‘bill’ and ‘law’ ""are frequently used interchangeably in common speak, particularly by everyday Oregonians…"" PolitiFact Oregon hit the streets and put the question to the first two dozen people we encountered: Where the Legislature is concerned, are the words ""bill"" and ""law"" interchangeable? Not counting the three people who waved us off, all answered immediately that the terms are separate and distinct. The ruling: Fagan, in her first re-election bid for House District 51, wrote in her Voters’ Pamphlet that she ""sponsored Oregon’s new Buy American law."" HB 3473, the proposal to amend Oregon’s public contract code, died in committee after one public hearing. It didn’t pass either chamber and was never signed into law by Gov. John Kitzhaber. The office that drafts legislative proposals said the words can’t be used interchangeably, while a longtime Oregon politician said Fagan should ""have been more careful"" in her statement. The links Fagan provided to defend her statement fell short of being persuasive, and a quick and unscientific survey of ""everyday people"" failed to back her claim. If re-elected, Fagan said she plans to reintroduce the bill in the 2015 session. There’s still the chance, then, that her bill will become a law.
