Obama says children from low-income families hear 30 million fewer words than peers by age 3
","Words, words, words. President Barack Obama is certainly fond of them. His recent speech on economic issues, in which he backed a minimum wage increase, included more than 6,500. But what about a point Obama made in the speech about how the income gap affects young children? ""By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she’s already behind,"" he said. Just for comparison’s sake, 30 million words would be equivalent to 4,615 Obama speeches. But did he get his fact right? We’d never heard of this finding before, so we took a closer look. When we asked the White House for a source, a spokesman pointed us to research from the mid 1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley. They published their findings in a book, Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children. Over several years, the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses, based on education and income levels, and found that better-off families engaged their children more frequently with language. They found a 30 million ""word gap"" by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes. That’s one piece of evidence, they argued, to explain the ""achievement gap,"" a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower-income students start kindergarten on worse footing. The word gap, along with other issues, leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls, said Dana Suskind, a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago. She’s also the director of Thirty Million Words Initiative, one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research. ""This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life,"" Suskind said. Obama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development, said Samuel Odom, a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. When asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question, Suskind told us it’s ""pretty well-accepted"" as the norm in the field. In addition, she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately. Suskind offered just one caveat: While Obama described the norm, there’s variation from family to family. Some low-income families speak to and interact with their kids more, and some more affluent families don’t. ""No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed,"" she said. ""You can’t generalize economic groups."" Our ruling Obama said that less-affluent children are behind by the time they start school because they have heard about 30 million fewer words than peers from higher-income families. Experts say studies clearly support Obama’s point. We rate Obama’s statement True. Editor's note: This item was edited after initial publication to clarify that researchers studied the word gap of children up to age 3, not age 5.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097223380>],/factchecks/2013/dec/05/barack-obama/obama-says-children-low-income-families-hear-30-mi/

Facebook meme says Vladimir Putin accused Barack Obama of being an idiot
","After a bumpy rollout of his health care law, President Barack Obama has taken his share of criticism lately. But did that include some trash-talking by Russian President Vladimir Putin? This week, a reader forwarded us a Facebook meme with Putin’s picture and the quotation, ""Any fourth grade history student knows socialism has failed in every country, at every time in history. President Obama and his Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy."" Did Putin really call his colleague Obama an idiot? You may wonder why you hadn’t heard about the large-scale diplomatic crisis. We did, too. So we took a look. As it turns out, the alleged quote is not new. It appeared repeatedly on social media during the past few years, surfacing on Facebook and far-flung corners of the Internet. As long ago as 2009, it surfaced on Godlike Productions, a site that regularly discusses UFOs and conspiracy theories. While some commenters questioned the quote’s veracity, many lauded it: ""Even Putin knows history and he is an intellectual man-with EXPERIENCE. Regardless of his early years in KGB-he seems fairly aware and likely giving sound advice,"" wrote one user. Another site called ""Obama sux"" even used the quote as its motto, putting Putin’s name in Cyrillic letters – Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин – to add an authentic touch. But we just needed a little Web sleuthing to confirm that the original source of the quote was a blog post in February 2009, on a site called Scooter’s Report. It was part of a short article titled, ""Putin: Obama ‘Idiot’ For Adopting Socialism."" The article quoted Putin as saying that Russian history clearly proves Obama’s approach is a recipe for failure. It ended with this rebuttal by an Obama spokesman: ""We're going to do socialism better."" So what is Scooter’s Report? It’s a blog that mixes satirical articles with offensive, manipulated images of Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. It only appears to have been updated once since 2011. A different site, World News Bureau, is operated by the same blogger, publishing such posts as ""Chris Matthews not allowed to masturabte during Obama interview"" and ""Unexplained Phenomena Reported At Monticello."" The people distributing Putin’s alleged quote didn’t bother to look at a disclaimer on Scooter’s Report that says: ""Like I have to tell you. This is fictitious satire and any resemblance to persons, places, or events is coincidental."" Our ruling A recent Facebook meme said Vladimir Putin accused Obama of being an ""idiot"" for trying to implement socialism in the United States. The alleged quote has circulated online for almost six years, but we can say with confidence that the quote comes from a satire website, a truth that could have been easily discovered through a few clicks on the Internet. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C480FC0>],/factchecks/2013/dec/05/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-says-vladimir-putin-accused-barack-o/

Ezekiel Emanuel says California 'kids' are signing up for health insurance in proportion to their share of the population
","Health policy experts are eyeing one group of Americans very carefully as people sign up for health coverage on insurance exchanges: young adults. Participation by this age group is seen as crucial to the success of the insurance marketplaces. Young adults are generally in better health and are needed to balance out risk among other, older enrollees, and they’re disproportionately uninsured. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, host David Gregory asked if ""the lag effect"" of the struggling federal marketplace will deter young adults from signing up for insurance. Washington Post Wonkblog editor Ezra Klein said the Obama administration was planning to deploy a vast marketing campaign to encourage young people to sign up through their preferred TV shows, social networks and parents, but the effort was not fully rolled out as problems with Healthcare.gov persisted. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and former health care adviser in the Obama administration, pointed to a microcosm of success in California, where the state-based exchange is ""working well enough."" ""And there, the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population,"" Emanuel said. ""And so it does appear that we are going to have enough when you look at that data point. And if we can get the word out, I think Ezra is right, we'll get enough young people."" California’s enrollment figures were described as ""a rare bright spot"" by the New York Times amid dismal reports about the federal marketplace. We wanted to dig in a little more and find out if Emanuel is right that young adults are signing up as a proportion to the population in California. Several experts we reached were initially thrown by Emanuel’s use of ""kids."" Emanuel clarified he was referring to news about young adult sign-ups from Covered California, the state’s health insurance exchange, in a brief interview. (He added that he has an almost 30-year-old ""kid."") Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, distributed a Nov. 21 press release that pointed out 18- to 34-year-olds applied ""in direct proportion to California’s population"" in October. That age group comprised about 22.5 percent, or about 6,900, of the people who selected plans during October and were not eligible for Medicaid. In 2010, the same group comprised about 21 percent of the state’s population. The last two columns from the following Covered California chart illustrate the point. The gap widens if you tinker with different data. Young adults comprise 25 percent of the state’s population using 2012 data from the American Community Survey, and about 27 percent if you take out the 65-and-over population, which is eligible for Medicare, according to the California Health Interview Survey 2011-12 data. So, we’re all finished here, right? Well, hold on. For one thing, experts said it’s way too early to draw sweeping conclusions from the state’s first month of data. November data, unavailable until mid December, could tell a very different tale. The real meaningful test will be how many young adults sign up long-term. ""People talk about these numbers because we have them, but you can't extrapolate from these,"" said Glenn Melnick, a University of Southern California health policy professor. Then there’s another matter of Covered California, and Emanuel, spinning the data in a way that emits positivity but, experts say, is not exactly relevant. Instead of comparing the percentage of young adult enrollees to their share of the population, some said it would be better to compare those signups to young adults’ share of the uninsured population, which is about 40 percent, several experts said. ""They need it proportionate to the target population, which is the uninsured,"" Melnick said. Another issue with comparing to a share of the population: The marketplaces established by the health care law are not really intended for the nation’s youngest and oldest residents. Children who receive coverage because of the law are getting it mainly through expanded Medicaid offerings, and adults over 65 are eligible for Medicare. That means comparisons could be misleading. ""So that’s not to say that they are completely off the table, but they are by design expected to be less represented in the enrollment in Covered California than their presence in the population,"" said Marian Mulkey, director of the California Healthcare Foundation’s Health Reform and Public Programs Initiative. Using 2011 Current Population Survey data, the foundation determined that 41 percent of the state’s uninsured population under age 65 is between the ages of 18 and 34. Since one of the goals of the law is to get more people in this group insured, you’d want to see young adult signups go higher than just their share of the overall population, she said. ""I would submit that that’s not quite a high enough bar for what they should be aiming for,"" she said of measuring the signups against the overall population. ""I would hasten to say that this is very early data, it doesn’t mean that they won’t get there."" Gail Wilensky, the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that measuring sign-ups of young adults against the percentage of uninsured young adult Californians would be the more relevant statistic. ""This might not look quite so good as the percent of the population since this group is disproportionately uninsured,"" Wilensky said. Still, Dylan Roby, a UCLA School of Public Health assistant professor of health services, disagreed with the idea of the uninsured population being a better benchmark. In California, he said, the risk pool for plans sold on the individual market, both within the exchange and outside of it, is the same. Plus, he said people who sign up for insurance early are likely to be those who already have it but were not previously eligible for subsidies on the exchange. ""So, given that we don’t have numbers on how many 18-34 year olds are signing up for coverage outside of the exchange with the same consumer protections, deductible limits, out-of-pocket maximums, etc., I am not sure you can make any statement about the magnitude of sign-ups and response to the new plans,"" he said. Roby said his target would be for 35-40 percent of people signed up on the individual market (through Covered California or on their own) to be between the ages of 18 and 34 at the end of open enrollment. More than 2 million uninsured Californians are 18-34 years old. Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, struck a similar chord, saying neither view of the percentage of young adult enrollments -- whether compared to their share of the state population or of the uninsured population -- is necessarily germane. ""Neither one really tells you what we should expect to see if young adults were participating in proportion to their share of the overall target population for the exchange,"" she said. ""That’s what feels relevant to me."" Many uninsured young adults actually look like they’re eligible for Medicaid, she said. So just looking at the percentage of those who are signing up for exchange coverage against the overall uninsured population doesn’t tell the full story. She added that enrollment estimates broken down by age group are hard to come by, and ""I haven’t myself tried to calculate that particular target."" A Nov. 20 Reuters story that analyzed early data from state-run exchanges in Connecticut, Kentucky, Washington and Maryland said ""so far more than 20 percent of the 23,500 combined enrollees in private insurance plans are 18 to 34 years old, ranging from about 19 percent in Kentucky and Connecticut to about 27 percent in Maryland."" Other state-run exchanges, such as New York and Hawaii (and D.C.), have not released enrollment data by demographic. The early turnout among young adults is encouraging, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of the Young Invincibles, an advocacy group focused on enrolling young adults into coverage, in an interview. ""We anticipate that we’ll see a broader surge in young people as they get more educated."" Several of those states reported an uptick in enrollments in the early weeks of November, including California. Our ruling Emanuel tried to point to a good sign for the health care law in California, saying ""the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population."" The statement is pretty accurate for young adults for the month of October. But it is a curious statistic. Health policy experts said the stat is misleading because the entire California population is not supposed to access the marketplace. They offered more apt comparisons that relate more closely to the uninsured population and alter the figures. The more important takeaway is that it’s very early to draw significant conclusions about California’s performance and what it could mean for a functional Healthcare.gov after its first month.

James Capretta says Obamacare is 'massive income redistribution'
","Conservatives have many reasons to dislike Obamacare but one of the most fundamental is, as with any government program, it interferes with private-sector decisions by collecting money from some people and spending it in ways that might not benefit them directly. This point came up on Fox News Sunday when host Chris Wallace asked if Obamacare involved massive income redistribution. One of his guests, James Capretta with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a group with ties to conservative organizations, agreed wholeheartedly. ""If you think about it, it's $250 billion a year in Medicaid expansion, in the subsidy structure, that's basically being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts, and a lot of tax increases,"" Capretta said. ""It is a massive, massive income redistribution."" In this fact-check, we look at whether the new health care law is a ""massive, massive income redistribution"" that has taken $250 billion a year out of taxes and from people on Medicare and moved it into Medicaid expansion health care subsidies. Capretta told PunditFact that he drew his numbers from the entity that lays down the benchmark for all of these discussions, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress. In a May 2013 report, that office projected that in 2023, the Affordable Care Act would spend $250 billion specifically to offer Medicaid to a larger number of poor people and subsidies to make private insurance more affordable to people making up to 400 percent of federal poverty (about $92,000 a year for a family of four). Capretta argued that since the law reduces deficits, that $250 billion, and more, must come from somewhere and he correctly points to reductions in Medicare spending and a variety of tax increases. The Obamacare balance sheet The most detailed figures from the Congressional Budget Office are for 2022, not 2023, but the pattern remains the same. A quick reminder: The Medicare spending reductions we’re talking about are not cuts in the sense that Medicare will spend less than it does today. The reductions are in the future growth of Medicare spending, not a cut in existing programs. That said, on the government balance sheets, in 2022 the health care law ""saves"" $133 billion from Medicare, Medicare Advantage (an alternative insurance program within Medicare), and a program that pays hospitals that serve more than their fair share of poor, uninsured patients. Another $161 billion in new revenue is collected from five different sources. That list includes penalties paid by individuals and employers for not buying or offering insurance, taxes on higher income earners (above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples), a tax on the most generous insurance plans (the Cadillac tax), a tax on medical device and drug manufacturers, and a grab bag of other taxes. That’s a total of $294 billion. What does the government do with the money? As Capretta said, it spends most of it on an expansion of Medicaid and on subsidies for people purchasing health insurance through state and federal marketplaces. Around $45 billion goes toward deficit reduction. Does that make Capretta right? John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic research center in Washington, said yes and no. ""There’s definitely redistribution going on,"" Holahan said. ""All the Medicaid and subsidies clearly go to lower income people. Where he’s wrong is in calling it massive. It’s very small."" Holahan said relative to the size of the economy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates at $21.7 trillion in 2022, the total redistribution amounts to about 1 percent, but even that, Holahan said, is ""a wild exaggeration."" The primary reason, he said, is that except for the new or increased taxes on wealthier Americans, it is difficult to know who are true losers in the new system. Insurance companies, for example, might pay more in taxes, but they also gain from the revenues they get from subsidized policies. And to one of Capretta’s main points, it’s equally unclear whether the Medicare savings come from people on Medicare. Tracking the redistribution When Capretta said that the Affordable Care Act changes are ""being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts"" he simplified a complex situation. The single largest source of dollars to cover the cost of expanded coverage comes from paying hospitals and doctors less for the same work. Jeffrey Clemens, a health economist at the University of California - San Diego, said this will hit the incomes of providers. The question is, what happens next? ""When it becomes less profitable for providers to treat Medicare beneficiaries, they become less interested in seeing Medicare beneficiaries,"" Clemens said.""Their time can be more profitably spent with the privately insured."" If a hospital pulled out of Medicare, that would hurt its Medicare patients. But Ann Marie Marciarille, a specialist in health policy at the University of Missouri School of Law, said providers have a track record of staying with the program, largely out of self interest. ""The federal government may not pay Medicare rates that top some commercial insurance but these rates top all Medicaid reimbursement rates,"" Marciarille said. ""Even more importantly, the federal government pays its bills eventually."" Tom Getzen, executive director of the International Health Economics Association and a professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business and Management, said curtailing Medicare payments is nothing new. Getzen says providers can adapt through innovation, and he notes that projects in the Medicaid program show that less money doesn’t always mean less quality. ""Recipients in many ‘tight’ managed care HMOs actually feel as if they are getting better service than before under fee-for-service which was more lucrative for most providers,"" Getzen said. There is one group of Medicare beneficiaries that is likely to be hurt. These are the people who purchase Medicare Advantage policies. This program has grown through subsidies that the Affordable Care Act phases out. Marciarille said this will cause dislocations that will hit mainly those she characterizes as ""near poor."" Scott Harrington, professor of Health Care Management at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, said of all the changes in Medicare, ""insurance companies and hospitals that sell Medicare Advantage policies will take the biggest hit."" Without the current subsidies, the market for these plans is projected to shrink, although recently enrollments spiked up. A look at the Obamacare taxes Capretta also mentioned tax hikes. The ones that most clearly redistribute money are the ones on wealthier Americans. In 2022, they can expect to pay $46 billion more. But then you have tax hikes that hit various players in the health care industry, plus the penalties on individuals and employers. While there is no shortage of speculation on how those taxes will play out, Getzen offered a more general summary of their impact. ""It tends to get spread around, but probably falls more heavily on the top 50 percent,"" Getzen said. ""In part because you cannot really get much from the bottom 25 percent."" Our ruling Capretta said Obamacare represents a massive redistribution of income, with the expansion of Medicaid and premium subsidies paid for by people on Medicare and through a host of other taxes. He is correct that money is being redistributed to fund the expansion of public and private health insurance. It it also true that higher income earners will pay an estimated $46 billion more in taxes. But that amount represents only about 15 percent of the total dollars generated by the Affordable Care Act. The rest of the burden will skew toward the upper half of the income ladder but those making less will also shoulder some of the burden. Massive is a subjective term but in this case, particularly relative to the total economy, the case is weak. Regarding the reduced payments to Medicare providers, there is a range of possible outcomes. Providers could get by with lower compensation, they could become more efficient, they could reduce access to services or they could reduce the quality of service. It is not a foregone conclusion that Medicare patients will suffer. The likely exception is for people who currently pay for Medicare Advantage, a program that loses its present subsidies. Capretta oversimplified a complex situation.

Jeb Bush says Obama is closing the embassy to the Vatican
","‘Tis the season to make claims about holy matters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is Catholic, tweeted on the day before Thanksgiving, ""Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare."" Did President Barack Obama close the embassy to the Vatican as a way of sticking it to them over Obamacare? That sounds like some un-divine intervention. But is it the truth? (It would be a venial sin to omit a hat-tip to the Washington Post Fact Checker, which ran a check on this earlier today. CNN also did a fact check earlier.) The Holy See The Vatican maintains diplomatic relations with more than 175 countries. In 1984, the United States and the Vatican established full diplomatic relations, and the Senate confirmed the first ambassador. (Prior to that the United States had diplomatic relations on and off.) No country has an embassy to the Holy See within the Vatican City proper -- all of them are located within the city of Rome, according to the State Department. The current United States embassy is in a converted residential property in Rome, about 1.9 miles from the Vatican. The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See has seven U.S. diplomatic personnel, plus support staff. Its budget is just over $3.5 million, not counting costs associated with the local guard force, state department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told PolitiFact. ""The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is, and will remain, among the largest foreign missions to the Holy See,"" she said. While discussions about embassy security have increased in the wake of the deadly attack on a United States facility in Benghazi, Libya, the idea of relocating the embassy to the Vatican had been considered as long ago as 2005, after the addition to a building at the U.S. embassy compound in Rome, according to an Inspector General report in 2008, when George W. Bush was president. Currently, the embassy to the Vatican isn’t at the same spot as our embassy to Italy. One of the report recommendations for the embassy to the Vatican was to ""relocate as soon as possible, with an eye towards cost savings, improved security, and maintaining as much as possible its separate identity to include a separate street address."" Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy signed a memo approving the move in March 2013, but news about it swelled suddenly in November as some conservative news outlets criticized the plan. The National Republican Senatorial Committee created a petition to tell ""President Obama to leave the American embassy at the Vatican."" (NRSC took down the petition about five days later. That drew some fire from liberals, but NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring said that’s a normal amount of time for the group to leave up such a petition.) An article in the National Catholic Reporter quoted several envoys who objected to the state department’s plan, including former U.S. Ambassador James Nicholson, a former secretary of Veterans Affairs in the Bush administration and a former chair of the Republican National Committee. He described the move as a ""massive downgrade"" in United States-Vatican ties. ""It's turning this embassy into a stepchild of the embassy to Italy,"" Nicholson said. ""The Holy See is a pivot point for international affairs and a major listening post for the United States,"" he said, ""and to shoehorn (the U.S. delegation) into an office annex inside another embassy is an insult to American Catholics and to the Vatican."" Other envoys who served under the first or second President Bush, along with one Clinton administration ambassador -- also objected, the National Catholic Reporter wrote. Current and former ambassadors under Obama supported the move. ""I see no diminishing in the importance of the relationship at all,"" said current U.S. Ambassador Ken Hackett. And Miguel H. Diaz, a former ambassador under Obama, defended the move, saying, ""This was done for security and financial reasons, not in any way to undermine and diminish the importance of the Holy See,"" CNN reported. The embassy shift Two days before Bush’s tweet, the State Department held a conference call with reporters to respond to the news reports. (The State Department didn’t name the official on the conference call.) The official stated that a few years ago, the government purchased land to expand an existing government compound in Rome and now plans to move the embassy there. The compound will have three separate buildings, each with their own entrances on different streets: the Embassy to the Holy See, the Embassy to the Republic of Italy and a U.S. Mission to the United Nations offices in Rome. The physical separation of the entrances is key because the Vatican requires embassies be separate from a country’s mission to Italy. The move was made due to cost and security, the State Department official told reporters. By consolidating operations at one compound, the state department expects to save about $1.4 million a year. The current embassy to the Vatican lacks ""the kind of physical security protection that we would like it to have,"" the official said. ""It doesn’t have the setback from the street that is available in its new compound, and … it does not have the level of other security protections, including Marine security guards that are available at the combined U.S. Government compound."" The State Department official emphasized that the move does not represent any downsizing of the United States diplomatic assets. ""There is no reduction in diplomatic staff, there’s no reduction in ambassadors, there’s no reduction in mission,"" he said. ""There is simply a reduction in overhead."" Shaun Casey, the special adviser for faith-based community initiatives at the State Department, described security as the No. 1 reason for the move. ""The United States is moving the location of the embassy to a building that is safer, bigger, and architecturally more appealing,"" Casey wrote. ""It also is slightly closer to Vatican City. Let me repeat that point: It's closer to Vatican City than the current location."" To be precise, the new site will be located 1.78 miles from Vatican City, about one-tenth of a mile closer than the current site. It is expected to open in 2015. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for the Vatican were unsuccessful, but a spokesman for the Vatican told CNN that ""the move was well within the Holy See's requirements for embassies and that relations with the United States are far from strained. ... Another Vatican official, not authorized to speak on the record about diplomatic relations, told CNN the Holy See understands security concerns are an issue for some countries and this move is ""an exception, not the ideal, but not the end of the world."" Meanwhile, we found no evidence to support Bush’s speculation that the relocation might have had something to do with the battle between Catholic bishops and the federal government about contraception requirements in Obamacare. (Despite the contraception fight, the bishops have long backed the broader concept of universal health care.) ""The Vatican itself said closing this location is not ideal,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told PolitiFact. ""Governor Bush does not believe this move reflects appropriate respect for the U.S. relationship with the Holy See."" So what to make of the conflicting accounts about whether the move is a slight to the Vatican? ""I think it’s not a big deal,"" Stephen F. Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America, told PolitiFact. Schneck, who has been to the embassy, called it an ""ugly, modernistic residential structure."" (Schneck told us he is close to the current ambassador and a couple of past ambassadors, including those that served under Obama and Bush.) ""While I wouldn’t actually call it unworkable, it's on a corner so it’s very accessible to street traffic,"" Schneck said. ""I certainly understand the security concerns."" Schneck emphasized that the roots of the move predate Obama, since it stems from an inspector general recommendation during Bush’s tenure. And he was dubious of the suggestion that the embassy move is retaliation for the Catholic bishops opposing the contraception mandate in Obamacare. ""I stand with my Catholic bishops in support of the lawsuits on the contraception mandate,"" Schneck said. However, the embassy-Obamacare connection is ""a ridiculous effort, one of those crazy conspiracy theories to connect dots that make no sense at all."" Our ruling Bush said, ""Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare."" For starters, the United States is not going to ""close"" its embassy -- it’s relocating it to a place that’s closer to the Vatican and that is more secure, less expensive and more architecturally distinctive. In addition, the move didn’t originate with Obama. It has been in the works since George W. Bush -- Jeb Bush’s brother -- was president. Finally, we found no evidence to support the idea that the relocation was related to battles over Obamacare. We rate Bush’s claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096605AC0>],/factchecks/2013/dec/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-obama-closing-embassy-vatican/

Barack Obama says minimum wage is lower now than under Harry Truman
","One of the major messages in President Barack Obama’s Dec. 4, 2013, speech on the economy was that Americans deserve a raise. ""It's well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office,"" Obama said in an address at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. We have previously checked an Obama claim that the minimum wage is ""lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office."" We rated that Mostly True. But we hadn’t heard the claim about Truman, so we decided to take a look. The minimum wage, as written into law, has been $7.25 an hour since 2009. Here’s a table that covers the years of Truman’s tenure in office. We calculated the inflation-adjusted wage using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator.   Year Nominal minimum wage Real minimum wage (2013 dollars) 1945 0.40 5.19 1946 0.40 4.79 1947 0.40 4.19 1948 0.40 3.88 1949 0.40 3.93 1950 0.75 7.27 1951 0.75 6.74 1952 0.75 6.61 2013 7.25 7.25   So in 1950 -- which was during Truman’s time in office -- the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was $7.27, which is higher than today’s minimum wage. Two cents more isn’t a lot, but it’s enough to give some credibility to the president’s claim. We should add, however, that 1950 was the exception. That was the year the minimum wage was raised -- indeed, it was nearly doubled. And with each subsequent year, inflation ate away at the wage’s purchasing power. Ultimately, during seven out of the eight calendar years when Truman was in office, the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was lower than it is today -- not higher. Does that matter? It’s a judgment call. ""The point wasn’t to isolate the eight years of Truman presidency, but the fact that we’re back at the same level as it was in 1950,"" said Bobby Whithorne, a White House spokesman. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, agreed. ""A lawyer defending the president’s wording would add that the president did not say the current minimum wage is lower than it was in every single year of President Truman’s tenure in office,"" Burtless said. ""Some of President Obama’s listeners would no doubt be stunned to (learn) that the purchasing power of the current minimum wage is below its purchasing power in any year of the Truman administration, even if the difference is only two cents per hour."" Our ruling Obama said the minimum wage ""in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office."" That’s correct for 1950, but incorrect for the other seven calendar years of Truman’s tenure. In fact, you could just as easily say that the minimum wage is higher today than it was under Truman, and that would be correct for seven out of the eight years he was in office. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F74A80>],/factchecks/2013/dec/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-higher-now-under-ha/

Facebook post says 44 percent of homeless people are employed
","As President Barack Obama used a Dec. 4, 2013, speech to turn the national conversation to economic inequality, we thought it might be a good time to check into a Facebook post a reader recently sent us. The post said: ""44% of homeless people are employed. Shouldn't work be an escape from poverty?"" We wondered if that was accurate. Sourcing the claim We began by looking into the source of the Facebook post. The meme being circulated was created by a website called Occupy*Posters, which provides eye-catching ""memes"" for supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement to share on social media. Occupy*Posters did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, but the group footnotes its sources, and it urges caution when people share them. ""While some of the posters here are expressive of only opinion,"" the group’s website says, ""great care is taken to ensure that the many posters here which present data mesh with solid facts. Still, due to human imperfections, you should independently verify information in the posters here before using them in any important way. Toward that end, it is the normal practice here to diligently, almost obsessively, cite all sources."" The footnote provided in the meme pointed to a fact sheet from the National Coalition Against Homelessness, an advocacy group. The document says, ""44% of homeless people ... have jobs and can't escape homelessness."" However, this document doesn’t provide the original source of the 44 percent figure, and the group did not respond to an inquiry. After some digging, however, we feel comfortable in saying that the statistic comes from a report by the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. The report -- ""Homelessness: Programs and the People They Serve: Findings of the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients"" -- found that ""almost half (44 percent) of homeless clients did some paid work during the 30 days before being interviewed."" So that would give the Facebook post a measure of truth. Still, we uncovered two important caveats. The data’s age First, the data is old. The report was published in 1999, and the data it used were collected in 1996. That makes the statistics nearly 18 years old, which is practically ancient by social-science standards. That said, despite this advanced age, there are no more recent statistics that address the question of how many homeless people are earning money from working, said Mary Cunningham, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute who specializes in homelessness and housing. ""It would be much better if we had up-to-date data, but that is not always possible,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist specializing in employment for the Brookings Institution. ""When using 17-year-old data, however, we have to ask ourselves whether other critical factors have changed in the intervening years.""   In this case, a key issue is whether there’s reason to think that the nature of homelessness and employment has changed in the intervening years. And experts say it may have. The Great Recession and the slow recovery have squeezed job prospects even for people who aren’t homeless and have extensive work histories. Nationally, the unemployment rate is about 2 percentage points higher now than it was when the data was collected in the mid 1990s. So it’s certainly plausible that homeless people today would be less likely to secure a job than they were back then, during an era of robust economic growth. ""You could argue that the employment picture for homeless people might be worse today due to the recession, though it’s hard to say with any amount of certainty,"" Cunningham said. The definition of ""employed"" The other issue we’ll note is what the Facebook post communicates by its use of the term ""employed."" When we first read it, we assumed ""employed"" meant that someone held a regular job. Certainly the meme’s message would be powerful if it said that almost half of homeless Americans aren’t getting paid enough from their regular jobs to be able to afford a home. However, the Urban Institute defined its figures somewhat differently. The report said that ""of those who report working in the last 30 days, 20 percent did so in a job lasting or expected to last at least three months."" The remainder worked temporary or day-labor jobs or peddled or sold personal belongings. The language of the report is a bit unclear; either the figure to pay attention to is 20 percent (rather than the meme’s 44 percent), or even as low as 9 percent (if it’s one-fifth of 44 percent). Either way, the number cited in the Facebook post is too high if you’re looking at homeless people who have a traditional, longer-term, steady job. ""I agree that taking an odd job is not the same as having a steady job,"" said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair, which suggests that the smaller number seems ""more relevant."" But not all experts agreed. Burtless noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics counts an ""employed person"" as someone who, during the time period studied, ""did any work at all as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession or on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in a family-operated enterprise."" Since this more expansive definition is as close as we can get to an official government definition, Burtless said, it seems like a reasonable standard to use, even if other plausible definitions exist. In addition, ""even ‘uneven’ employment is a sign of willingness to work,"" said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. ""So it depends on the point one is trying to make."" Our ruling The Facebook post said that 44 percent of homeless people are employed. On the one hand, the data is 18 years old, and the percentage who have a regular job is, at most, less than half that. Still, this is the most recent data available, and some experts say a broader more generous definition of ""employed"" is defensible. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AD9780>],/factchecks/2013/dec/04/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-44-percent-homeless-people-are-/

Could Clackamas County residents have received nearly $48 million for police, fire and schools?
","Local governments have long relied on urban renewal districts to redevelop blighted areas. The districts temporarily freeze the amount of property taxes collected for public services such as police, fire protection and schools, then redirect the money to improvement projects inside the district. The tax base is unfrozen when the district ends, allowing public service providers to begin collecting taxes on the new, higher property values. Urban renewal has become a hot-button issue. Critics, including some in Clackamas County, say it gives government unchecked power to spend money without sufficient oversight and that it amounts to a giveaway to developers. Clackamas County Commissioner Paul Savas, who is running for re-election, was targeted in a recent flier from the Tigard-based Freedom and Responsibility PAC. The flier, among other things, said Savas helped table a motion under which ""Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriff’s Dept. and Social Services."" The flier noted that the money would have come from the Clackamas Town Center Urban Renewal District, which formed in 1980 and ended in June with money left over. With local service providers seemingly straining for every cent these days, we decided to check whether Savas actually voted to deny them $48 million in unspent urban renewal money. According to the flier, here’s where most of that money would have gone if not for Savas’ vote: $20 million to the North Clackamas School District; $8 million to Clackamas Fire District #1; $8 million to the Sheriff’s Office; and $8 million to Clackamas County’s general fund. The remaining $4 million, according to county documents, would go to the other 13 overlapping taxing entities that operated within the urban renewal district. We called Savas, who was part of a 3-2 majority that voted to table a motion to return the $48 million in unspent urban renewal district money. It made sense, he said, to use the unspent money on needed but not yet approved projects in the district. Shortly after tabling the motion, the board, by the same 3-2 split, authorized two road projects inside the district totaling $9.2 million. A discussion is set for early next year on what to do with the remaining $38.8 million. Savas took issue with two of the flier’s key points: that the money could have been returned to ""residents"" and that $48 million was eligible for return. He cited an email from Clackamas County Assessor Bob Vroman noting that Oregon law prohibits returning unspent urban renewal money directly to citizens. Instead, it has to go back to the individual service providers. State officials confirmed that prohibition. So residents would not have gotten a kicker-style check. On the other hand, taxpayers are residents, and they would have seen a benefit had agencies they support received millions of dollars. On the other point, Savas said his vote actually saved Clackamas County residents nearly $20 million. Why? Because the $20 million claimed on the flier as destined for the North Clackamas School District actually would have gone to the State School Fund. Savas forwarded an email from Michael Wiltfong, the Oregon Department of Education’s school finance director, who estimated that the North Clackamas District would have gotten only $600,000 of that $20 million. Information compiled by the county put the figure closer to $330,000. As for the flier’s other claims: $8 million for ""Fire"": Information compiled by Dan Johnson, the county Development Agency’s manager, sets the figure at $6.95 million. $8 million for ""Sheriff"": Johnson’s number is $4 million, but there’s a big caveat. The money would go only to the Clackamas County Enhanced Law Enforcement District, which provides services only for unincorporated Clackamas County and the cities of Happy Valley and Johnson City. $8 million for ""Clackamas County"": This refers to the county’s general fund. Johnson’s number is $7.8 million -- the same if rounded up. We called Richard Burke, treasurer for the Freedom and Responsibility PAC, for a response. ""I recognize that only a portion of this money would go to local schools,"" said Burke, a self-professed Libertarian who lives in Beaverton. ""But I stand behind my point that there’s a pot of money that could have gone back to taxing districts if not for Paul’s vote."" In a followup email, Burke defended his $8 million figure for the sheriff, citing Sheriff Craig Roberts’ comments during budget hearings this year that his office was likely to get a good chunk of the $7.8 million headed to the general fund -- if commissioners had voted to return the money. But even if the money had gone to the fund, a sheriff’s office spokesman said, it would have been a ""commissioners’ decision on how to spend it."" The flier lists four figures. One -- the amount that would have gone to the general fund -- was accurate, and another -- the amount for fire services -- wasn’t far off. The figure given for the sheriff’s office was inaccurate and oversimplified, though, and the figure for schools was wrong in amount and recipient. On the other point, residents would have seen a benefit from the return of the money, but it wouldn’t have been given directly to them. We rate the claim Mostly False because it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts.",[<zip object at 0x000002809784DE40>],/factchecks/2013/dec/04/freedom-and-responsibility-pac/could-clackamas-county-residents-have-received-nea/

U.S. bishops have supported universal health care since 1919, Cardinal Dolan says
","The Catholic church and the White House have been clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. As we’ve noted before, the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required. ""Religious employers"" are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals don’t qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs. In an interview with David Gregory on NBC’s Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills. At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration it’s been battling. ""We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care,"" Dolan said. ""We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay?"" We wondered whether the bishops’ support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century. Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care. During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan, published the Bishops’ Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said. ""The state,"" the guide read, ""should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age."" That wasn’t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clinton’s ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993. ""The flap is over the (contraception) issue,"" said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. ""That’s where it comes to appear that they’re against universal health care."" Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years. Our ruling Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. He’s correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations. We rate Dolan’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809707BC80>],/factchecks/2013/dec/04/timothy-dolan/us-bishops-have-supported-universal-health-care-19/

Vos says nine-day deer hunt has $1.3 billion impact
","A physicist, an engineer and a statistician are out hunting. Suddenly, a deer appears 50 yards away. The physicist does some ballistic calculations, assuming a vacuum, lifts his rifle to a specific angle, and shoots. The bullet lands 5 yards short. The engineer adds a fudge factor for air resistance, lifts his rifle slightly higher, and shoots. The bullet lands 5 yards long. The statistician yells ""We got him!"" PolitiFact Wisconsin couldn’t help but recall that chestnut as we started fact-checking a claim by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). ""FYI,"" Vos posted on Facebook Nov. 22, 2013, the eve of Wisconsin’s biggest hunting season, ""the nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin."" Did Vos bag one when describing the impact of 615,000 hunters taking to the woods? At least one of our readers heard the claim as a reference to how much state government pulls in from the hunt. That’s a much smaller figure: Deer hunting licenses and permits generated $22.7 million in revenue for the DNR in 2010, the latest year available. Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer told us he meant the broader impact on the economy of hunting-related spending. That’s how we read it, too. The same number was referred to by Gov. Scott Walker and others in their own pre-hunt statements. Walker’s news release cited the state Department of Natural Resources, which pointed to a 2006 study, ""Hunting in America,"" by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. That 2006 study estimated direct spending by deer hunters at $899 million. That means money spent on gas for the pickup truck, food and beverages, firearms, ammo, lodging and other essentials, say, a new trailer, a gun case, land access fees, etc. The figure, gleaned from a large national survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, reflects that direct spending by hunters. But the study also estimates the ""ripple effect"" of their spending on the broader economy. That’s the $1.39 billion, cited by Vos and the others. The study uses a pretty broad definition of ripple effect. It quantifies such indirect spending ""as retailers buy more merchandise from wholesalers and manufacturers who then buy more input, plus the spending by the employees of all these companies,"" said Rob Southwick of Southwick Associates, which does the estimate. ""It is possible to divide and track retail sales as they move through the economy, with each successive round becoming smaller until it’s no longer possible to measure."" So it’s a much softer estimate than the direct spending. Such measures always are. It’s worth noting that $1.39 billion figure includes more than the just-concluded nine-day gun hunt mentioned by Vos. There’s a separate bow-hunt season as well. It’s not possible to tease out exactly how much spending is for bow vs. gun, and there is some overlap. But based strictly on licenses for all kinds of deer hunting, 74 percent are for the gun season (615,000 licenses). Applying that ratio, the direct spending for the nine-day gun season would be $665 million, and about $1.03 billion for indirect. That’s lower than Vos said. But because the figure is old, we thought it made sense to apply a simple inflation calculation to the gun deer-hunting numbers we extrapolated from the study’s overall deer hunting figures. The overall impact, including ""ripple effect"" spending, would be about $1.2 billion -- but given the overlap with spending between gun and bow hunting for deer -- probably somewhat higher. Newer numbers We found a study that updates the 2006 calculation. The 2011 report was by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in partnership with the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. The NSSF is is the trade association for the firearms industry. That 2011 study showed a surge in the number of deer hunters in Wisconsin, and a 146 percent jump in direct and indirect spending, up to $3.4 billion from the earlier $1.39 billion. Similarly, the direct spending by hunters rose from $899 million to $2.17 billion. The study is more recent, and shows a bigger impact, so you might expect the political types to latch onto it, right? Not in this case, due to concerns raised by a Wisconsin DNR official who urged elected officials to use the more conservative figures. The 2011 study showed a big increase in Wisconsin deer hunters when the number of hunters  actually went down, based on the number of licenses sold, said Keith Warnke, hunting and shooting sports coordinator at DNR. What’s more, Warnke said, it defies logic that spending by hunters more than doubled during the Great Recession. The 2006 direct spending breaks down to $1,400 per hunter -- a reasonable estimate in Warnke’s view. But the 2011 number works out to double that, about $2,800. As it turns out, even one of the authors of the 2011 study doesn’t stand by the big reported hike in the Wisconsin spending numbers. The Wisconsin sample size was too small in the national survey conducted for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said Southwick. ""The 2011 results should be used cautiously. While at the national level the sample is fine, it is screwy for many states like WI,"" Southwick wrote in an email. So that leaves us with the 2006 numbers. Our rating Vos repeated Walker’s assertion that ""The nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin."" The figure is from the most-recent estimate of deer hunting’s economic impact. Vos misfires a bit because the figure actually applies to all deer hunting, not just the gun season. But it’s hard to say by how much, and accounting for inflation brings his claim in line. The statement needs clarification because he’s talking about more than just direct spending by hunters. But Vos’s claim was stated broadly, so, like the statistician in the old joke, he is close enough to warrant a shout of ""We got him!"" We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AFC100>],/factchecks/2013/dec/04/robin-vos/vos-says-nine-day-deer-hunt-has-13-billion-impact/

Allen West blames 'Obama's EPA' for closing a smelter as evidence of 'back door gun control'
","Former Congressman Allen West has taken aim at a surprising gun control villain: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ...,"" wrote the Republican and retired Army lieutenant colonel on his website Dec. 1. ""So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration."" Here’s West’s explanation in a nutshell: The Doe Run lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri will close its doors this month due to air quality restrictions. ""What this all means,"" West wrote, ""is that after December 2013, any ammunition that will be available to US citizens will have to be imported, which will surely increase the price and possibly come under government control."" Is West correct to conclude that the EPA’s actions are ""back door gun control""? A reader asked us to check West’s claim, so we did. (A hat tip to the Blaze, which published its own fact-check between the time we spotted West’s claim and the time we published it.) Lead’s dangers Lead is a serious health hazard. According to the Mayo Clinic, ""even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal."" Lead contamination can be found in air, water and soil as well as homes from old paint. Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children. Adults who work with batteries, home renovations or in auto repair shops also may be exposed to lead. The health dangers prompted the U.S. to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980s. As Doe Run announced at the time, the company reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri in 2010 which included paying fines and ceasing smelting operations in Herculaneum. But the news is gaining fresh attention now because the actual closure date of Dec. 31 is looming. West’s blog cited an Oct. 29 post by Terresa Monroe-Hamilton on noisyroom.net which slammed the feds for ""back door gun control"" in driving the plant to closure. (The Blaze reported that West’s initial post failed to cite noisyroom but later updated with attribution.) Monroe-Hamilton sent us to a post she wrote Dec. 3 in response to the controversy, in which she said what she wrote was an ""opinion piece."" But the long history of lead-control efforts casts serious doubt on the idea that the closure was driven by anti-gun concerns. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters which are ""terribly toxic sites,"" said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution. The Doe Run smelter, he says, was shut down because it was a major polluter -- not as a way of curbing guns. ""It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets,"" Rosner told PolitiFact. ""The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant."" While West, who represented South Florida for one term, pointed the finger at ""Obama’s"" EPA, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 -- during the Reagan administration -- due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president to advance the anti-lead effort. In 2008, under President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. In 2010, the EPA reached a settlement with Doe Run. In November, Doe Run issued a news release about the closure: ""Although the United States is home to a number of secondary lead smelters, which recycle lead from various sources, the Herculaneum facility is the last primary lead smelter in the United States,"" according to the release. The release explains that the company isn’t shutting down entirely. While the company is closing its primary smelter, which extracts lead from ore, it will continue to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. According to the company, more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications.""In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product,"" the company release said. ""These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri."" The company added that lead is used in ammunition and other materials. Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey emailed PolitiFact to say that the company ""will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead."" We interviewed experts on lead or ammunition to ask about the impact of the plant closure. Most said there should not be major concerns. Michael Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, confirmed that lead used for ammunition made in the U.S. comes almost exclusively from recycled sources. ""While no one should ever be pleased about the closure of any industry, in this case there should not be a noticeable effect on consumers.  ... We should not see any effect on the civilian marketplace,"" Bazinet told PolitiFact. The foundation’s general counsel, Lawrence Keane, echoed that view in an interview with the Washington Times Others agree. While Doe Run is the last ""primary"" lead smelter in the U.S. there are plenty of ""secondary"" processing of lead in the U.S., Richard Lowden, a research engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory told PolitiFact in an email. ""Primary lead is of higher purity and is needed for specialty applications such as unique types of lead-acid batteries,"" Lowden said. ""Secondary lead is slightly less pure and is used in most applications -- over 80 percent of domestic consumption, including bullets. The U.S. imports very little lead, with the main foreign sources being Canada and Mexico. I do not  believe shooters have to worry about a source of lead for bullets."" Florida Bullet, a Clearwater-based company that supplies ammunition to most law enforcement agencies in Florida, isn’t worried about the smelter’s closure. The bullets the company sells, made by Federal and Speer, ""use reclaimed lead, so this is not going to bother us as far as production goes,"" said the company’s president, Tom Falone. ""We don’t foresee this being a problem for us."" When we asked Michele Hickford, West’s spokeswoman, why he blamed Obama if the EPA had zeroed in on the smelter long before Obama was president, she said, ""The plant closed under Obama. Regardless of what this lead plant is used for, the EPA net is tightening on the entire industry, and if you follow it to its logical conclusion, the industry will be shut down eventually. This is yet another example of the Obama administration circumventing the legislative process to achieve its goals."" Our ruling West wrote that ""back door gun control is in full effect in the United States"" due ""to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency."" But there is no evidence that it was a clandestine effort at back door gun control. Rather, the EPA’s settlement with Doe Run -- which concluded a case that began years before Obama was elected president -- had to do with emissions of a chemical that can cause serious injury and death to adults and children. And ammunition experts shot massive holes in the notion that the smelter’s closure would cut production, reduce supply or raise the cost of ammunition.

As usual, we started with the source of the claim. Axtman, to her credit, immediately toned down her piece after we raised concerns. It now reads that Republicans had ""placed a filibuster on virtually every piece of serious legislation and nominee."" (Emphasis ours.) ""I was not as clear as I should have been,"" Axtman said. ""I should probably have added a qualifying word in there. … To be fair, I thought I should change it. ""It’s super important to me to be upfront and clear."" We appreciate a quick response. Still, we generally push forward with a fact check on the original language even if it’s adjusted. To help explain what she’d based her assertion on, Axtman pointed us to a piece from Mother Jones, a liberal-leaning magazine, that explored the use of the filibuster. Authors Kevin Drum and Jaeah Lee used strong language to describe Republican obstruction, but nothing near as absolute as what Axtman had said. ""Republicans went into full-bore filibuster mode the day he [President Barack Obama] took office, and they've kept it up ever since,"" they wrote. ""For all practical purposes, anything more controversial than renaming a post office has required 60 votes during the entire Obama presidency."" That 60-vote bar is a reference to the number of votes it takes to achieve cloture or end a filibuster. You’ll notice here, though, the caveats of ""for practical purposes"" and ""anything more controversial than renaming a post office."" They gave themselves wiggle room. To get a broader, more informed perspective, we rang up James Thurber, the head of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, D.C. In terms of judicial and bureaucratic nominees, he said,  ""this culture of polarization has created an almost-constant threat of filibuster from the Republican Party."" But, he noted, ""that’s not as bold as saying they’ve filibustered every nomination."" In fact, Republicans cut a deal in July after Democrats threatened to change filibuster rules. ""Democrats agreed not to change the rules, but reserved the right to do so later if they feel the need. In return, President Obama gained confirmation of several nominees,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. Gina McCarthy, for one, was confirmed as head of the Environmental Protection Agency a day after the deal was made on a vote of 59-40. Clearly some nominations, though fewer than with previous administrations, were approved without having to pass the 60-vote bar. (PolitiFact National has looked more closely at this issue. By their calculations, on Nov. 21, 2013, there had been ""68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147."") There’s another point worth making, too. Legislation faced less threat of filibuster than appointments. ""In most cases, it’s a done deal before they consider the bill on the floor,"" Thurber said. There’s little question that Senate Republicans took using the filibuster as a tool of obstruction to a new extreme. But Axtman undercut herself by using superlatives. Twice in her piece, she hammered home that filibusters happened ""not just some of the time. ALL of the time."" While we appreciate her move to change the words after we brought them to her attention, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967E2480>],/factchecks/2013/dec/03/carla-axtman/have-senate-republicans-filibusted-every-nominee-e/

Corker said Congress dragged Obama ""kicking and screaming"" to put sanctions on Iran
","The tentative nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration has met with wariness in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties press for tougher sanctions. Just hours after President Barack Obama announced the deal with Iran on Nov. 24, 2013, Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed skepticism on Fox News Sunday. Among other things, Corker told host Chris Wallace that it was Congress, not Obama, that had pushed for the tough sanctions that forced Iran to the negotiating table. ""Congress is what brought us here,"" he said. ""The administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place."" Corker’s comments turned out to be a GOP talking point. Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., told CNN the administration ""opposed the Senate putting the key oil sanctions on Iran,"" while Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., also told CNN that ""the president opposed the first round of sanctions."" Is that the way it happened? Deal or no deal First, a quick explanation of the new deal. Iran has already surpassed enrichment levels necessary for nuclear power, leading the world to believe it is pursuing a weapon. The country has faced sanctions from the United States since 1979, with additional sanctions in recent decades by the United Nations and the European Union. A deal reached last month in Geneva between the U.S., Iran and five other world powers would open the door to easing those sanctions. It’s a complicated arrangement, but in exchange for easing some sanctions, Iran will agree to scale back or completely halt its nuclear weapons program. Under the deal, uranium that has been enriched beyond levels necessary for nuclear energy must be diluted or converted, and the country may continue to seek nuclear technologies for power. Iran must also open up its nuclear sites to frequent monitoring and inspections from the U.S. and United Nations. So far, Iran has already made enough progress that it would take just one or two months to reach weapons-grade enrichment levels if it wanted. The new deal would add weeks to that time frame. In exchange, Iran would receive between $6 billion and $7 billion in sanctions relief, more than half from oil revenue that’s currently frozen in foreign banks. The agreement is temporary and only lasts for six months. At that time, U.S. officials say the sanctions could be put back in place if Iran reneges on its side of the bargain. Corker’s comments What Corker said sounded a lot like a statement made by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in the 2012 vice presidential debate: ""This administration has no credibility on this issue (Iran). It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress."" At the time, we rated the statement Mostly False. And gave the same rating to similar comments made by Romney earlier in the presidential cycle. We asked Corker’s staff for evidence to back his claim, and they sent us a handful of articles from 2011 and 2012 that highlighted the tension between the White House and Congress on the best path to pressuring Iran to drop its nuclear weapons program. An article from Foreign Policy dated December 2011 noted that Obama had angered Democratic allies by coming out against a Senate compromise his administration had asked for. But a day later, the administration sang a different tune after the bill passed the Senate 100-0, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Despite its initial misgivings, the administration came to see the bill as useful in pressuring Iran, and came to support it ""so as not to damage U.S. relations with partner countries,"" the CRS report said. The last bit is a key point and is a big reason why we gave Ryan a Mostly False in 2012. There has been frequent tension between Congress and the White House on how to proceed with Iran. Both have eyed tough sanctions, and under Obama the U.S. has in place the ""most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. In fact, after three decades of sanctions, the U.S. has reached a point where there’s little left to ban going into and out of Iran. So it has instead sought to punish companies and countries that do business with Iran. But while Congress has pushed forward with a unilateral crackdown, Obama has asked for the flexibility to negotiate. In some instances, it would appear he used executive orders and signing statements to water down Congress’ attempts to pass tough sanctions. But when we looked at this question in 2012, a number of Iran experts told us that such episodes do not necessarily mean that Obama was showing weakness. Rather, it allowed him to negotiate with the European Union and countries like China to increase international pressure on Iran. Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, told PolitiFact last year that ""flexibility is the watchword. … It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran."" At the time, James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration and ambassador to Iraq and Turkey under Obama, said the back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch is common, and while some may call Obama’s maneuvers as ""watering down,"" others counter that they actually strengthened the U.S. position. For this article, we checked back with Jeffrey to see if he held the same opinion. He did. ""The Obama administration has supported tougher sanctions against Iran consistently,"" Jeffrey said. ""But on this or any other issue it will push for maximum flexibility with the Congress. Thanks to that pushing, it got authority to waive or suspend sanctions based on either countries' reducing oil imports, or a presidential national security waiver — not yet used, but probably necessary to uphold the ‘First Step’ (Geneva) agreement. Without — repeat — without these modifications, to the initial congressional effort, it would have been much more difficult to mobilize the international community."" Our ruling Corker said that on Iran sanctions, ""the administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place."" Experts agree that the term ""kicking and screaming"" is a large exaggeration. There was wrangling between the executive and legislative branches to secure negotiating flexibility for Obama — flexibility that made it possible to get the international community on board with tougher sanctions. Corker ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C10100>],/factchecks/2013/dec/03/bob-corker/corker-said-congress-dragged-obama-kicking-and-scr/

How strong have job gains been since the tax bill passed?
","  On the heels of a strong jobs report — one that featured 223,000 new jobs in May and an unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took to the Senate floor to tout the success of Republican economic policies. ""The bottom line is clear,"" McConnell said June 4. ""Under the policies of this unified Republican government, American workers, families, and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in recent memory."" McConnell went on to cite changes to the tax code and regulatory changes. ""After a decade of stagnation,"" he said, ""Republican policies have gotten Washington out of the way and freed American workers and job creators to do what they do best — build a dynamic economy that is literally the envy of the world. But as impressive as some of these statistics may be, I think it is important to keep in mind that these stories are, at the end of the day, human stories. More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December."" When McConnell’s office posted the speech to YouTube, it hit the jobs line hard, giving it the title, ""More Than One Million Jobs Created Since the Passage of Republican Tax Reform."" There's little question that the economy, and particularly the jobs picture, are strong. The 3.8 percent unemployment rate is the lowest since 2000. Asked about McConnell's floor speech, his office offered another quote from the Majority Leader: ""I spoke yesterday about the new job opportunities flooding into the U.S. economy. It’s all thanks to the ingenuity of American workers and job-creators, with an assist from Republican policies. … Republicans are proud of the historic tax reform and dramatic regulatory reform that helped make this happen."" But is there evidence that Republican policies have boosted job creation? While it’s always tricky to isolate whether specific policies have shaped economic trends, policies implemented by the Republicans in charge of the White House and Congress probably had some effect. That said, the number of new jobs gained since passage of the Republican-backed tax bill in December 2017 is pretty similar in scale to those racked up by both President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump going back to 2010. McConnell is correct on the number. From January to May 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a net increase of 1.037 million jobs. That works out to about 207,000 more net jobs a month. But rather than being a turnaround from weak to strong, that amount of job creation is roughly in line with the gains in each of the past nine years. Here’s a chart showing the month-to-month job gains since the start of 2008. And here’s a chart showing the job gains for every January-to-May period in recent years. Since 2010 — the year the Great Recession began to wane and the recovery began — every January-to-May period saw an average monthly job gain of between 160,000 and 236,000. The performance for 2018 was slightly higher than the average, but pretty typical. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, came to a similar conclusion. He looked at all 96 overlapping five-month periods from May 2010 to April 2018 to see how many of those five-month periods saw job creation grow at a faster rate than the first five months of this year. He found that employment increased faster than the most recent five-month period 47 percent of the time, and slower 53 percent of the time. In other words, the past five months were pretty ordinary. ""So, job growth since December 2017 does not look exceptional compared with job growth throughout the current economic expansion,"" Burtless said. Burtless said he didn’t doubt that the changes to the tax code could have had an effect on job creation. But he said it’s hard to measure how much. ""In the absence of the tax cut, job growth might have been weaker than what we actually saw,"" he said. ""My guess is that the tax cut probably boosted employment growth at least a bit. It’s just too soon to be sure, and we’ll probably never know with very much confidence."" Still, he added, ""it is not very convincing to claim recent job growth has been particularly remarkable."" McConnell said, ""The bottom line is clear: Under the policies of this unified Republican government, American workers, families, and business owners are achieving economic growth that is unmatched in recent memory. … More than 1 million new jobs have been created just since we passed tax reform last December."" Officially, it’s 1,037,000 new jobs — and it’s likely that the tax cut had some positive impact. However, it’s questionable to suggest that job growth in the past five months has been especially strong, or that recent rates of job-creation represent some kind of turnaround from a poor performance earlier. Job growth in the past five months is in line with the gains seen in previous five-month periods and in previous January-to-May periods going back nine years. We rate the statement Half True. Correction: The original version of this fact-check misstated the last year the national unemployment rate was 3.8 percent. It was 2000.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B95DC0>],/factchecks/2018/jun/05/mitch-mcconnell/how-strong-have-job-gains-been-tax-bill-passed/

Kevin Cramer distorts Heidi Heitkamp's record on banking regulations
","North Dakota’s candidates for U.S. Senate are sparring over a new banking law they both co-sponsored that rolls back parts of Dodd-Frank, a signature banking regulatory law signed by former President Barack Obama. North Dakota Democrats bragged on Twitter that during the bill’s signing Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, got a shoutout from President Donald Trump while Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Republican, lurked in the background. Cramer shot back that Heitkamp only discovered an interest in relieving regulations for banks after Cramer applied pressure. ""We’ve sent over 40 of these types of bills to the Senate she’s never been interested in, until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure,"" Cramer told conservative radio host Rob Port. ""All of a sudden she’s for a little bit of regulatory relief, and when I say little, I mean very little regulatory relief for the banking industry."" We were curious: Did Heitkamp’s interest in regulatory relief flower overnight? It’s something other Democrats have criticized her for, so we wondered if it was an election-year stance. A review of the evidence shows that Heitkamp has been working on banking issues since she was elected in 2012. She joined the Senate Banking Committee in 2013. Heitkamp cosponsored the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the law in question, on Nov. 16, 2017. Cramer announced his candidacy on Feb. 16, 2018. Heitkamp’s office said she has been working on the current law since 2013. She has also held over two dozen Senate Banking Committee hearings since 2015 on financial regulatory reform and over 30 discussions with top financial regulators. Heitkamp cosponsored a bill that was folded into law in 2015 to eliminate annual privacy notifications from banks, which cut red tape for community banks and credit unions. In 2014, Heitkamp also pressed for Obama to take into account community banks when naming a Federal Reserve governor. ""During the entirety of (her tenure), she has often expressed a desire for regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions,"" said Rob Blackwell, editor of American Banker. ""The idea that she’s a johnny-come-lately to regulatory reform just doesn’t hold water."" Blackwell pointed us to a 2013 profile of Heitkamp that appeared in American Banker: ""The North Dakota Democrat has emerged as a key player on the Banking Committee, helping to work on a bipartisan housing finance reform bill and championing legislation to provide relief to small banks,"" the profile reads. ""In doing so, she has impressed bankers in her home state and her fellow legislators with her commitment to financial issues and willingness to work across the political aisle."" Cramer’s campaign argued that Heitkamp did not support Cramer’s own House bills that aimed to curb more regulation. But the bills Cramer provided as evidence were more extreme and unlikely to garner Democratic support, Blackwell said. Cramer said Heitkamp has ""never been interested in"" regulatory relief for banks ""until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on."" Heitkamp has been an advocate of regulatory relief for small banks since she ran for the Senate in 2012. Cramer announced his Senate bid in February. Heitkamp’s lack of support for the regulatory relief that Cramer supports does not mean she is disinterested in regulatory relief.

Did Rep. Dan Donovan vote for tax cuts, as Trump said?
","President Donald Trump endorsed Rep. Dan Donovan for re-election, citing the Staten Island Republican’s support for tax cuts.

There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again.

""There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!"" Trump tweeted. Donovan faces a challenge from former Rep. Michael Grimm, who held the seat before Donovan won a 2015 special election. Grimm resigned from Congress after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion charges in 2014. Donovan trailed Grimm by 10 points in a poll conducted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in April. Trump’s tweet could help narrow that gap. But is Trump right about Donovan’s record on tax cuts? Recent tax cuts A spokesperson for Trump did not get back to us with information supporting his claim, so we can't say for sure what he was talking about in his endorsement. A search on Twitter shows Trump tweeted about tax cuts four other times in May. Each of those tweets referred to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the federal tax law passed last year designed to lower taxes for the middle class and give major breaks to corporations and wealthy earners.  Donovan was one of only 13 Republicans in the House that actually voted against the law. He and four other Republicans from New York state were against a part of the bill that limited the deductibility of state and local taxes. Residents were previously allowed to deduct an unlimited amount of those taxes. The new law caps that deduction at $10,000. ""Capping this deduction – which has been a part of the U.S. tax code since 1913 – will increase taxes and harm the already-unaffordable housing market in my district,"" Donovan said in a statement at the time. ""With the state and local tax deduction nearly eliminated, this tax bill doesn't equal relief for far too many New Yorkers."" Past tax cuts Congress has passed other tax cuts since Donovan took office. He voted in favor of an omnibus spending bill that included more than $600 billion in tax relief in 2015. The bill permanently extended several tax breaks enacted during the Great Recession that were set to expire in 2017. The enhanced child tax credit, for example, gave couples without a tax liability a larger tax refund based on the number of children they have. The 2017 tax law allows an even larger refund for those families with the credit. The 2015 law also extended a $2,500 tax credit for low- and middle-income filers attending their first four years of college. That credit was not changed in the 2017 law. Other provisions of the 2015 law expanded another tax credit for low- and middle-income workers with children, allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in school-related expenses, and extended other tax breaks Donovan also voted for a budget bill earlier this year that included more tax extenders for filers, and a bill in 2017 that gave extra tax relief to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Our ruling Trump said Donovan ""voted for Tax Cuts."" That's actually true. Donovan has voted for tax cuts in the past, though he was against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year. Trump's other tweets about tax cuts refer to that law, but we can't assume what Trump was talking about. That makes Trump’s statement accurate, but it required additional information.

NC Republican repeats false tax claim
","With midterm elections approaching, U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry is following in President Donald Trump’s footsteps on the campaign trail. McHenry, a Republican from Western North Carolina, distributed a newsletter on May 29 that targets the ""liberal news media"" and boasts about changes to the federal tax code that Congress passed last year. ""Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year, and Americans all over the country — including right here in Western North Carolina — are saving more of their hard-earned money each paycheck thanks to President Donald J. Trump,"" McHenry’s newsletter says. It asks for campaign donations, warning: ""Obstructionist liberals are working nonstop to discredit our Make America Great Again agenda and thwart any progress for our great nation."" Claims about last year’s tax cuts being the ""biggest"" in American history — a frequent talking point of Trump himself — have already been debunked by PolitiFact. It’s unclear why McHenry’s campaign made the claim. The campaign didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Measuring cuts The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax cuts and increases between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy). Depending on what projection of the recent tax cut you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. When measured by inflation-adjusted dollars, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) was the biggest cut since 1940 and last year’s tax cut ranks as the fourth-biggest. ' When measured by the cut’s percentage of GDP, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 is the largest tax cut and last year’s tax cut falls to seventh. ' Looking at GDP Economists generally prefer to measure the depth of tax cuts by their impact on GDP, said Michael Walden, economics professor at North Carolina State University. ""[A]s the economy (GDP) becomes larger, it takes a bigger tax cut in dollar terms to have the same impact,"" Walden wrote in an email. Comparing tax cuts this way, ""shows the Trump cuts ranked 5th among tax reduction legislation passed since 1964,"" he said, referencing a CNN analysis from earlier this year. So the depth of last year’s cuts have been overstated. As for who benefits, PolitiFact found that the cuts last the longest for the wealthiest Americans.

Did Republican sabotage cost 3.2 million their health coverage?
","Just in time for the midterms, an image is circulating on social media about a massive rise in the uninsured under Republican leadership. A tweet from Health Care Voters of Nevada featured a graphic with the title, ""The cost of sabotage."" ""3.2 million Americans lost coverage in the first year of the Republican war on health care,"" the image said. The web graphic is part of a project called Protect Our Care, a coaltion of groups that aims to preserve the Affordable Care Act. We looked into that 3.2 million number and found it falls at the high end of estimates. In addition, while Republican efforts to repeal and undermine the Affordable Care Act did the law no favors, their impact in 2017 is difficult to gauge. The number comes from the polling firm Gallup. In January, Gallup found that 12.2 percent of the population said they were uninsured during the last quarter of 2017. That was 1.3 percentage points higher than the same period in the year before. The survey group was people age 18 and older. ""That 1.3 point increase represents an estimated 3.2 million Americans who entered the ranks of the uninsured in 2017,"" Gallup wrote. So there’s hard data behind the figure. However, there are other estimates out there, and they raise questions about the 3.2 million figure. The strongest counterweight to the Gallup result comes from the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest government study showed a rise in the number of uninsured of 700,000. But the report said that was ""not significantly different from 2016."" That was for all ages. The picture for 18- to 64-year-olds was more complicated. The fraction of uninsured went from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. But taking into account the study’s margin of error (about .3 percent), the results were a statistical dead-heat. One other survey puts the Gallup figure on the high end. The New York-based Commonwealth Fund, a private health policy group, also measures insurance coverage. For its survey group of 19- to 64-year-olds, it reported that, ""an estimated 4 million people lost coverage."" However, that change took place over a longer period than the other studies, from early 2016 to March 2018, effectively a full two years. Republicans were in charge in Washington for only about half of that span. Looking at past Commonwealth Fund surveys, about half, or 2 million people, were added to the ranks of the uninsured on the Republicans’ watch. When it comes to precision, researchers give the nod to the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey. Praise comes from many quarters, including Sara Collins, the head of the Commonwealth Fund’s work on health care coverage. She said her group can give an early view of trends, but the greatest accuracy lies with the CDC. ""The large sample size of CDC’s National Health Interview Survey yields an estimate of change with smaller margins of error, and thus more definitive point estimates,"" Collins told us. The CDC reached over 78,000 people. By comparison, the Commonwealth Fund based its results on about 2,400 responses and Gallup’s was about 25,000. Collins added that within the limits of the Commonwealth Fund’s survey, they did not find statistically significant differences either between 2016 and 2017 or between 2017 and 2018. So in that respect, their results track with the government findings. Why do the results vary? For several reasons, the experts say. There are differences in the studies’ age groups and their response rates. Perhaps the biggest wild card is the timing of the surveys. Gallup calls people during each quarter, while the government collects data throughout the year. RAND analyst Christine Eibner put together this table with the uninsured rates for working age adults over the past two years from the three groups. (Commonwealth covers two years.)   Gallup CDC Commonwealth 2016 10.9% 12.4% 12.7% 2017 12.2% 12.8% 15.5% Eibner said the key to Gallup’s estimated 3.2 million more people without insurance in 2017 lies in its 2016 figure. That’s when it’s markedly lower than the other surveys that year. But Eibner said that could be an artifact of people rushing to get insurance at the end of the year after the election. Gallup’s lower rate in 2016 would translate into a bigger jump in the uninsured when it gathered data in 2017. Eliot Fishman, director of health policy at Families USA, a partner in the Protect Our Care coalition, said given that all three surveys show a rise in the uninsured, the overall trend is well supported by the data. The presumption in the claim is that Republicans are responsible. There’s no question that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans worked hard and nearly repealed Obamacare. Trump canceled about $10 billion in reimbursements to insurance companies, a move that drove up premiums. And the Republican tax law did away with the individual mandate penalty, which further roiled insurance markets. But insurance analyst Cynthia Cox at the Kaiser Family Foundation said the country has yet to see the full impact of all of that. ""It’s worth keeping in mind that the year in question -- 2017 -- was before most of the changes from the Trump administration and Congress went into effect,"" Cox said. Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota also urged caution. ""I don't believe it is possible to causally attribute the increase in uninsurance to the actions of the GOP in a specific or direct way, given the large number of factors and changes occurring simultaneously,"" Abraham said. She noted that rising premiums were in play before Republicans took power. That made health insurance in the individual market harder to afford for about the 8 million people who received no subsidy. On the other hand, Abraham said Republican actions made the markets less affordable. A graphic from the coalition Protect Our Care said that Republican sabotage had led to a rise of 3.2 million in the ranks of the uninsured. That specific figure is far from certain. A Gallup estimate backs up that figure, and a study by the Commonwealth Fund found an increase, but a somewhat smaller one. The government assessment deemed most reliable by health analysts found a small increase, but not one that was significantly different from the year before. On net, an increase is plausible, but the scale is hard to determine right now. As for Republican responsibility, they did make insurance less affordable in the individual market, but the full impact of their policies did not come in 2017. Given the complexity of health insurance, they bear some responsibility but not all of it. We rate this claim Half True.

Fact-checking Gavin Newsom’s attack: John Chiang ‘lost track of $31 billion’
","In a recent TV attack ad in the California governor’s race, Gavin Newsom’s campaign claimed ""the state auditor found (John) Chiang lost track of $31 billion,"" when he was state controller. But did the ad get its facts straight? Here’s the full text of the TV spot: Narrator: ""As California Controller, John Chiang’s job was to count the money. But the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars. That’s right. Billion with a ""B."" And Chiang made tens of billions in accounting errors. What was John Chiang paying attention to? His special interest campaign contributors. The Sacramento Bee found Chiang gave millions in tax breaks to big developers who gave big money to John Chiang’s campaign. John Chiang for Governor? Doesn’t add up.  This is a screen shot from the ad. View the full ad by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign here.  In this fact check, we focused on the ad’s eye-popping claim: the state auditor found Chiang, who is now state treasurer, ""lost track of $31 billion."" Background on candidates Newsom is a Democrat, the state’s lieutenant governor and a former mayor of San Francisco. He has consistently led in the polls in the race for governor — a late May survey showed him 13 percentage points ahead of second place Republican businessman John Cox. He was 26 points ahead of Chiang, who was next-to-last among the race’s prominent candidates. Recently, Newsom said he’d prefer to face a Republican in the November run-off, making his attacks on Democrats like Chiang appear to be part of his strategy. Chiang has served as treasurer since January 2015. Before that, he was the state’s controller, akin to the state’s chief financial officer, for eight years. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Our research  Asked for evidence that ""the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion,"" Newsom’s campaign pointed to a May 2014 news article by CBS13, a Sacramento TV station. It was headlined ""$31.65 Billion: California Accounting Errors Higher Than Combined GDP Of Jamaica, Iceland."" The CBS13 article refers to a scathing May 2014 report by the California State Auditor’s Office that found deficiencies in the state’s internal financial reporting practices. The mistakes ranged from understating liabilities, to miscalculating debt payments, to a data-entry error that added three extra zeros to a revenue figure, changing it from millions of dollars to billions. ""The number and magnitude of errors we found indicate the Controller’s Office lacks a sufficient review process to prevent and detect significant errors,"" Deputy State Auditor John Collins concluded in the report, which was submitted to Gov. Jerry Brown and top state lawmakers. Collins did not respond to requests for an interview. Stacking up $31 billion The state audit and a 2014 Sacramento Bee article, which summarized the audit, were both referenced in the ad. The Bee article used a less sensational headline: Audit: State Controller’s Office accounting riddled with errors, and had no mention of a $31 billion dollar figure. The audit itself does not literally say Chiang ""lost track of $31 billion."" The ad, however, overlays ""$31 Billion"" in large, bold numerals at the top of an image of the auditor’s report. The numbers even pop out at the viewer at one point. That $31 billion figure comes from the TV station’s article, which added up the dollar amounts of key mistakes cited in the audit. Here’s how CBS13 arrived at $31 billion: ""The audit revealed: -- $7.7 billion – Understated federal trust fund revenues and expenditures -- $653 million – Overstated general fund assets and revenues -- $8 billion – Overstated California State University’s bond debt -- $9.1 billion – Reporting error that understated a public building construction fund Also there was a deferred tax-revenue figure posted as $6.2 billion when it was actually $6.2 million. All told, that’s more than $31 billion in mistakes."" We checked and found all of those figures in the audit. More to the story There’s some truth to the ad’s claim, given the critical nature of the audit and the large dollar figure mistakes it found. But the use of the phrase ""lost track of $31 billion"" is somewhat questionable. It could leave the impression that Chiang’s actions led to the state actually losing that money, which it did not. The spot also omits the fact that Chiang’s office acknowledged the problems and was taking steps to correct them. ""The (state controller’s office) concurs with the California State Auditor’s (CSAs) notation and believes that the challenges of high staff turnover and in recruiting qualified staff significantly contributed to the issues identified,"" the 2014 audit said. ""Other contributing factors included budget cuts and denial of financial resources, as well as poor quality and late submission of the financial data by numerous agencies."" What did subsequent audits show?  In March 2015, the state auditor’s office released another report that ""concludes that the State continues to experience certain deficiencies in its accounting and administrative practices that affect its internal controls over financial reporting."" That report blamed agencies such as the Department of Education for inaccurate financial reporting, though it did not directly criticize the controller’s office.   Subsequent auditor reports show apparent improvement in Chiang’s final years as treasurer and those immediately after. In its March 2017 report, for example, the auditor’s report ""did not identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies"" in financial reporting for the fiscal year that ended in June 2016.   Response from Chiang’s campaign  Chiang’s campaign downplayed the significance of the 2014 audit report. They said a separate document, called a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, issued later that year was more reflective of the performance of the controller’s office. ""Nobody is more a financial expert in the state than John,"" Chiang’s campaign spokesman Fabien Levy said. ""Nobody is more obsessed with getting the numbers right."" Our ruling A TV attack ad by Gavin Newsom’s campaign for governor claims ""the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars,"" when he was state controller. A 2014 state audit supports part of the claim. It criticized the state controller’s office for understating billions of dollars in liabilities, miscalculating debt payments and making other errors. A TV news station added up some of the highest dollar figure mistakes and presented them as ""$31.65 billion in errors."" The state audit did not literally say the controller’s office made ""$31 billion"" in mistakes, nor did it imply that the money was permanently lost under Chiang, but instead that his office made numerous accounting mistakes. The ad also ignored that Chiang’s office, according to the audit, acknowledged the mistakes, worked to fix them and blamed the errors on staffing shortages. Newsom’s claim is partially accurate. But it takes information in the audit out of context and ignores key details. We rate it Half True.

"['Population', 'Illinois', 'Lori Lightfoot']","
No, Chicagoland isn’t the only metro area losing residents
","A Chicago mayoral hopeful vying to represent the city’s progressive wing recently leapt into the race with a talking point about population drain. Lori Lightfoot, an attorney who previously headed Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s police board, joined the growing crowd of potential candidates seeking to unseat him in May. In multiple media appearances following the announcement of her candidacy, Lightfoot argued high tax burdens under Emanuel are driving families of modest means out of the city. ""The fact that we are the only metropolitan area in the country that’s losing population ought to be a sense of urgency,"" Lightfoot said during a WGN radio interview. ""To me, it’s the proverbial canary in the mine shaft."" The city of Chicago’s population drain is well-documented. Chicago lost residents in 2017 for the third year in a row, the latest Census data show, and its population has been on a mostly uninterrupted decline since peaking at 3.6 million in 1950. Even so, at 2.7 million residents today, Chicago remains the nation’s third largest city. But the ""metropolitan area"" extends far beyond the city of Chicago, not just in colloquial terms but in those clearly recognized by the nation’s official head-counters at the U.S. Census Bureau. So the claim that the Chicago metropolitan area was the only one out of hundreds in the U.S. to lose population struck us as a demographic head-scratcher worth checking out. The Census assesses population change in metropolitan areas along officially designated lines that include counties with close ties to a core urban area. Almost a quarter of those 391 defined metropolitan areas experienced population loss between 2016 and 2017, according to Census data. The Census defines the Chicago metropolitan area quite expansively, taking in not just Chicago and Cook County but eight other counties in Illinois as well as four in Indiana and one in Wisconsin. The Chicago metro area is among the nation’s 10 largest, and Census estimates found that none of the other nine lost population in 2017. That said, some other still sizable metropolitan areas, including those surrounding Pittsburgh, Pa., and Rochester, N.Y., did shrink. ""Chicago technically is a place,"" explained Chicago demographer Rob Paral. ""It is different than a metro area."" That distinction might be chalked up to a slip of the tongue by Lightfoot had she not repeated the phrase ""metropolitan area"" in campaign talking points on at least three occasions. A Lightfoot spokeswoman said in an email that while the candidate is saying ""metropolitan area,"" she is only referring to the city of Chicago itself. In comparison to the nation’s other largest cities, the spokeswoman said, Chicago was the only one to experience a decline in 2016, the latest year for which city-specific data was available at the time Lightfoot made her claim. ""Lori is running to become the next mayor of Chicago and when she addresses population loss, she's referring to the fact that we are on a radically different trajectory than other major metropolitan cities like Los Angeles, New York, Boston or Philadelphia,"" the spokeswoman said. While the Lightfoot campaign is correct that Chicago was the only one of the nation’s biggest cities to see losses, it was far from the only city to slip. And the candidate’s original comments did not reference cities at all, let alone distinguish between major cities or otherwise. Paral, the independent demographics researcher, also took issue with the Lightfoot campaign’s characterization of Chicago’s population trajectory as ""radically"" different from other large cities. None of the major cities her spokeswoman cited, for instance, gained population by even a full percentage point last year, while Chicago fell by just 0.14 percent, and the gap between them the year prior was not much greater. That makes the difference in their rate of change relatively nominal. We also asked Paral about Lightfoot’s broader argument that taxes were responsible for driving low- and middle-income residents away. ""I think the jury is out on that,"" he said, adding that the correlation between tax rates and population change ""isn’t that strong."" Lightfoot does seem to find more solid ground in highlighting how an income gap may be playing a role in which Chicago-area residents decide to stay or go. A recent analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning found the number of people living in the Chicago region making less than $25,000 shrank between 2006 and 2016, while the number of residents making $75,000 or more grew. ""The loss of low-income residents in the region suggests that we’re not being so inclusive,"" said Aseal Tineh, the policy analyst who wrote the report. But the planning agency says it has not conducted research into links between population loss and taxes, which is the connection Lightfoot is trying to make. While arguing that high taxes are pushing lower-income earners out of Chicago, Lightfoot said: ""We are the only metropolitan area in the country that’s losing population."" Lightfoot has used the ""metropolitan area"" phrase repeatedly in the opening days of her campaign for mayor, though a spokeswoman now says when she uses the word ""metropolitan"" we should really insert the words ""major city.""’ It could be tempting to cut Lightfoot some rhetorical slack in her quest for the mayoralty. After all, the original Mayor Richard Daley got so routinely tongue-tied that his exasperated press secretary famously admonished reporters: ""Don’t write what he says, write what he means."" In Lightfoot’s case, however, it's not clear exactly what she means. She keeps repeating an incorrect statement that is wrong whether taken literally or figuratively. The Chicago metropolitan area is far from the only one in the country to lose population last year, according to the Census. And the city of Chicago by itself is far from the only city to lose population--though as the spokeswoman later pointed out, it is the only one among the nation’s very biggest cities. Experts also cast doubt on the existence of any evidence to back up the other beat of her claim, that lower-income Chicago residents were leaving because of high taxes. Lightfoot’s comments use a precise term imprecisely to make an unproven argument about population loss. We rate her claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771D6C0>],/factchecks/2018/jun/01/lori-lightfoot/no-chicagoland-isnt-only-metro-area-losing-residen/

Not even a bus ticket home for inmates released from prison in Wisconsin? That's an exaggeration
","Does Wisconsin leave just-released inmates stranded outside the prison gates? State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, an Alma Democrat who is running for governor, painted that picture in a May 1, 2018, interview with Earl Ingram, a liberal radio talk show host on WRRD-AM in Milwaukee. Saying she wants to provide better substance abuse and mental health services in prisons because so many inmates suffer from those problems, Vinehout declared: These folks need help. They need the ability to be able to deal with their addiction and the health care they need to heal from their mental health issues. And instead, the state doesn’t even give them a bus ticket to get home, let alone help them re-integrate into their community. We thought we should check the bus ticket claim. No evidence from Vinehout Ingram seemed startled. He followed up by asking: ""You mean to tell me, when a person gets out of prison, the state doesn’t even give them a bus ticket to get home?"" Vinehout responded vaguely, alluding to legislative hearings on prisons from years earlier. ""Well, we heard a lot of stories,"" she replied ""I have to give"" state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, ""credit for my education about what’s happening in our prison system."" When we asked Vinehout’s campaign spokesman for evidence to back Vinehout’s claim, we were told she was simply relating what others had told her, ""not talking on her authority."" But in the interview, Vinehout stated the claim as fact. And she didn’t backtrack on it when she was asked the follow-up question. Other prison-related fact checks: 39 percent of violent criminals return to prison? Mostly True. Probationers do new crimes but don't get probation revoked? Half True. State policy The state describes its policy on releasing inmates this way: Transition from incarceration to community is carefully planned collaboratively by both institution and community corrections staff, coordinated with inmates and community stakeholders and developed in full consideration of the concerns of victims. State Department of Corrections spokesman Tristan Cook told us that transition planning with a social worker and, if necessary, probation staff begins three months before an inmate’s release. That includes transportation from the prison. If an inmate doesn’t have transportation from family or friends, the department will provide a ride or a bus ticket, he said. It’s worth noting that inmates generally are returned to the county where the crime was committed -- which may or may not be where they lived or now have family. Dameon Payton told us the state gave him a bus ticket back to Milwaukee when he was released in March 2018. He said he knew other inmates who were transported by the state. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc But in practice … There are some exceptions, according to non-profit groups that help transition inmates. Andre Brown, an employment specialist at Project Return in Milwaukee, estimated that his agency gets calls twice a month from inmates who need rides. He said his agency provides them bus tickets. Linda Ketcham, executive director of Madison Area Urban Ministry, said her agency has never received calls like those. Inmates who will be supervised on extended supervision get a ride or a bus ticket from the Department of Corrections, she said. But released inmates who do not go on extended supervision are on their own to arrange transportation, she said. The Rev. Jerry Hancock, director of prison ministry for First Congregational Church of Christ in Madison, said in some cases the Department of Corrections drops inmates at the Capitol Square in Madison. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin ""doesn't even give"" released prison inmates ""a bus ticket to get home."" She did not provide any evidence and her claim certainly is not the state’s policy, or general practice. What we found is that the state typically provides a ride, or a bus ticket, to released inmates. But occasionally, there are inmates without transportation who get a bus ticket from a non-profit agency. Vinehout’s statement has only an element of truth and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Is protectionism a big part of the Great Depression, as Ben Sasse said?
","  Shortly after the Trump administration said it would slap tariffs on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., released a tersely worded statement on the looming ""trade war."" ""This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression,""
 Sasse's statement said. "" 'Make America Great Again' shouldn’t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.' "" Does Sasse have his history right when he says, ""We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression""? He does, as we’ve recounted previously. If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found. In a career-making scene, Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.) Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here): ""In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression."" Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got worse. Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 — sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. — raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street’s ""Black Tuesday"" on Oct. 29, 1929. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own. Several economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein-Sasse version of events is quite accurate. Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said there was ""no real reason"" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for ""domestic political reasons."" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists. ""Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression,"" Irwin said, but he added that it’s fair to say it made the depression ""longer and more painful."" After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports. ""Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,"" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that ""if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time."" Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office. As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan. This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression. ""Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,"" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century. For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade. Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said. ""It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,"" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. ""However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression."" Sasse said, ""We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression."" While the downturn that became the Great Depression had been under way for about half a year by the time the United States passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, economists agree that the resulting trade war worsened the impact on both the global and domestic economy. Sasse was cautious to say that the tariffs were ""a big part"" — rather than the only reason — for the Great Depression. So we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097716440>],/factchecks/2018/may/31/ben-sasse/protectionism-big-part-great-depression-ben-sasse-/

US losing one bank or credit union a day, but trend was in works before Dodd-Frank
","According to U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus, community banks have been collateral damage in Dodd-Frank’s push to rein in big banks. Rothfus said America has lost an average of one community bank or credit union every day since the end of the Great Recession, when Dodd-Frank became law. Rothfus, a Republican, made the claim in a press release explaining his May 22 vote in favor of a partial rollback of Dodd-Frank, the Obama-era law containing new financial sector controls and consumer protections inspired by the banking industry’s role in the financial collapse of 2007. We stumbled upon the claim when comparing Rothfus’ voting record to that of rookie Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, who is after Rothfus’ seat in the newly drawn 17th District, which includes Beaver and parts of Allegheny County. ""Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day,"" Rothfus said. The Great Recession ended in June 2009 — though the recovery continues in many places. Dodd-Frank was signed into law by President Barack Obama one year later and has remained on the books. So is Rothfus’ claim about a decimated community banking sector accurate? Here’s what we found. Rothfus made his claim after voting in favor of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, S. 2155, which supporters said will lessen the Dodd-Frank burden on community banking institutions — defined as those with less than $10 billion in assets — and which critics argue creates wiggle room and loopholes that larger banks will exploit. The rollback was signed into law by President Donald Trump on May 24. In explaining his ""yes"" vote two days earlier, Rothfus said, ""Today a House majority that included both Republicans and nearly three dozen Democrats voted to right-size regulations for our community and regional financial institutions. Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day."" As we stated above, the Great Recession ended in June 2009, the point at which real GDP and industrial production hit bottom and resumed growth. So we’ll start with the third fiscal quarter of 2009 in looking at the number of community banks reporting to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. According to FDIC data, there were 7,309 community banks in the third quarter of 2009, and that number decreased every quarter since, winding up at 5,168 in the first quarter of this year. (When asked to cite the source of his claim, Rothfus’ office pointed to FDIC data.) That’s a decrease of 2,141 reporting institutions over 35 fiscal quarters or roughly 244 fewer a year. The decline in community bank numbers certainly has continued under Dodd-Frank. But it was also underway long before the Great Recession and Dodd-Frank ever took hold. ""From 1985 to 2013, the number of the smallest institutions has declined dramatically (85 percent to be exact),"" PolitiFact reported in 2015. ""But mid-size and large community banks have remained relatively stable since 2010 (and have increased, albeit incrementally, since 1985)."" The report adds: ""Two-thirds of failed or voluntarily closed community banks are actually acquired by other community banks, according to the FDIC. The result: fewer, but larger community banks. Their goal: to achieve ‘economies of scale’ (cost advantages gained when spreading out expenses over more revenue), says the U.S. Government Accountability Office."" A 2015 paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found the number of ""failed"" community banks went down under Dodd-Frank — from roughly 125 in 2010 to less than 25 in 2014 — while the number of community banks involved in voluntary mergers grew in that same period — from roughly 175 to more than 225. PolitiFact found that the consolidation craze was ""a 30-year trend"" with various underlying causes — they include a softening of interstate banking rules in the ’80s. And while some experts say Dodd-Frank has exacerbated the trend, the law’s exact impact remains the subject of much debate. According to National Credit Union Administration data, there were 7,691 federally insured credit unions in the U.S. in June 2009. That number fell to 5,573 in the last quarter of 2017 — the most recent quarter for which data is available. That’s 2,118 fewer federally insured credit unions, or roughly 282 fewer a year. John Fairbanks with the Office of Public and Congressional Affairs at the National Credit Union Administration said the ""federally insured credit union"" figures above include all but roughly 125 credit unions — those are privately insured — in the United States. Fairbanks told PolitiFact Pennsylvania that it’s important to note what’s happening with these ""disappearing"" credit unions. ""That does not mean those institutions were simply ‘lost.’ Most credit union ‘losses’ are the result of mergers, usually a smaller credit union into a larger one, and usually for a business-related purpose, such as the smaller credit union being unable to provide a greater array of services to members,"" Fairbanks said. ""So credit union members do not ‘lose’ a credit union; it folds into another one. The numbers go down, but note that credit union membership and industry assets continue to grow."" So mergers are increasingly common with both U.S. credit unions and community banks. Fairbanks added, ""This, by the way, is a long-running trend in credit unions and financial services generally, going back decades. The consolidation process is nothing new."" As for the bill supported by Rothfus, the National Law Review says it could actually speed up the pace of community and regional bank mergers by raising the threshold for ""enhanced prudential standards"" applied to big banks from $50 billion to $250 billion. ""The increase in this threshold is especially important because it may spark renewed interest in [merger and acquisition] opportunities among regional banks that have carefully managed growth to avoid crossing $50 billion or that have otherwise been reluctant to pursue transactions in light of the significant regulatory scrutiny that has accompanied applications by large acquirors,"" the Law Review reports. Rothfus said, ""Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day."" His statement is supported by data for that timeframe from both the FDIC and National Credit Union Administration. Since the third quarter of 2009, America lost 2,141 community banks and 2,118 credit unions. That’s 4,259 financial institutions total.

"['Wealth', 'Taxes', 'New York', 'Christine Quinn']","
Does New York state have the second highest tax on the wealthy? No
","New York state ranks only behind California for taxing the rich, Christine Quinn said at the Democratic Party’s state convention on Long Island. ""Second-highest millionaires tax in the nation, highest on the East Coast, only behind California but we'll find a way to beat them, too,"" Quinn, vice chairperson of the New York State Democratic Committee, said to applause from the party’s delegates. When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011 he was staunchly opposed to the tax on the state’s highest earners. He, like Republicans, thought it would prod high-income residents to leave the state and lead to less income-tax revenue. Cuomo, however, has since fought to preserve the tax. He repeated Quinn’s claim in his speech at the convention. ""Our millionaires tax is the second-highest in the nation and the highest in the East,"" Cuomo said. New York state has a reputation as a high-tax state. But does the state have the second-highest millionaires tax rate in the nation? The millionaires tax In 2009, state lawmakers and then-Gov. David Paterson raised the state income tax rate from 6.85 percent to 8.97 percent for earners making $500,000 or more. The tax, intended to help close the state’s deficit, was supposed to expire after three years. Cuomo and state lawmakers agreed to extend the so-called ""millionaires tax"" before it ended, but lowered the rate to 8.82 percent for people making about $1 million or more. They eliminated the higher rate for filers making less. The top rate remains at 8.82 percent in 2018. Democrats in the Assembly have proposed setting even higher rates for people making more than $5 million annually. Republicans oppose that proposal. Other states Some residents of New York State — but not all — pay the second-highest income taxes in the country. Some cities in New York state, like New York City, collect their own local income tax on top of the state tax. Neither Quinn nor Cuomo made reference to the city in their speeches. The highest earners in New York City pay a local income tax of 3.876 percent. That applies to single filers making more than $50,000 a year and married filers making more than $90,000. That rate was already in place before Cuomo took office. The combined state and local income tax rate in New York City is 12.7 percent for people who make about $1 million or more. That’s less than California’s 13.3 percent state income tax rate, but more than the rates in the other states. We couldn’t find another city in the U.S. with a higher combined state and local income tax rate. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, confirmed that New York City residents pay the second-highest combined rate behind California. Quinn’s claim doesn’t hold up outside New York City. Seven states have higher income tax rates on wealthy earners, according to research from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a tax policy analysis group. Auxier confirmed that finding. California is highest, but two of New York state’s neighboring states also have higher tax rates on the wealthy. Vermont taxes people who make more than $416,650 at 8.95 percent and New Jersey taxes those making more than $500,000 at 8.97 percent. In the Midwest, Iowa and Minnesota tax their highest earners at 8.98 percent and 9.85 percent, respectively. Oregon’s highest rate is 9.90 percent and Hawaii reinstated an 11 percent state income tax for wealthy earners this year. New York state and California are the only two states with an isolated tax bracket for filers who earn about $1 million or more. The highest brackets in the other six states start lower, from $71,190 to $500,000. Washington D.C., while not a state, also has an income tax bracket for filers making $1 million or more, and they are taxed at 8.95 percent. No one from the State Democratic Committee offered an on-the-record explanation supporting Quinn's claim. Our ruling Christine Quinn said New York state has the ""second-highest millionaires tax in the nation."" That’s only true for New York City residents. Millionaires outside New York City have a lower rate than those in seven other states. Her claim contains an element of truth about New York City. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809771D1C0>],/factchecks/2018/may/31/christine-quinn/does-new-york-state-have-second-highest-tax-wealth/

Lupe Valdez says 1 in 6 Texans 'don't have health care' and Texas is the most uninsured state
","Lupe Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff nominated for governor by Texas Democrats, says health care will get much-needed attention once she’s in charge. Valdez was quoted in a May 23, 2018, New York Times news story saying: ""One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S."" It’s an exaggeration, we’d suggest, to say that all uninsured individuals don’t have any health care. As we concluded in a 2010 fact-check, many avenues exist to make care available--including paying out of pocket and going to hospital emergency rooms. Still, many people don't get the care they need. A slightly different 1-in-6 statement appears on Valdez’s campaign website: ""1 in 6 Texans lack health insurance,"" Valdez says on the ""Health Care"" portion of the site. She goes on: ""The truth is, we’re already paying for universal healthcare, we are just doing it in the most expensive and inefficient (way) possible."" Valdez, calling Republican Gov. Greg Abbott foolish for rejecting the option of expanding Medicaid in Texas as permitted by the Obamacare law, further says that as governor she’ll push to reverse his decision. We’ve found validity to other claims that Texas has the greatest share of residents who lack health insurance. After Valdez spoke, we decided to look again at how Texas ranks. Census Bureau estimates Valdez’s campaign didn’t respond to our email asking for her backup. But to our inquiry about the latest available data, Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, who previously advised us on the number of uninsured residents by state, pointed by email to a September 2017 Census Bureau report estimating that in 2016, Texas still had the nation’s greatest share of residents without health insurance, 16.6 percent--or 1 in 6 people. The Texas rate, the report says, was down from 17.1 percent the year before and 22.2 percent in 2013, according to information collected in the American Community Survey. In 2016, the report says, Alaska ranked second nationally with 14 percent of residents lacking coverage and Oklahoma was third with a 13.8 percent uninsured rate. Also answering our query by email, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Chris Lee shared its calculations indicating that in 2016, Texas led other states with 15 percent of residents lacking health insurance, per research connected to the bureau’s Current Population Survey. According to the foundation, states ranking second and third in residents lacking coverage were Alaska (14 percent) and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Utah (12 percent each). Lee guided us next to a Kaiser chart showing that Texas in 2016 also had the nation’s greatest share of uninsured residents younger than 65 (when residents qualify for Medicare). The Texas uninsured rate of 17 percent outpaced No. 2 Alaska’s rate, 15 percent, a foundation chart says. Gallup survey results We spotted a more recent nongovernmental estimate. In May 2018, Gallup said that surveys the polling company took in 2017 asked respondents: ""Do you have health insurance coverage?"" For the 10th straight  year, Gallup said, Texas had the nation’s highest rate of uninsured residents, 22.5 percent, which was still an improvement from the uninsured rate Gallup gauged for Texas in 2013, 27 percent. In 2017, Gallup gauged, Massachusetts residents had the nation’s lowest uninsured rate in 2017, 4 percent.                      SOURCE: Press release, Gallup, ""Uninsured Rate Rises in 17 States in 2017,"" May 9, 2018 Our ruling Valdez said: ""One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S."" One in six Texans in 2016 lacked health insurance, according to government surveys, and the state remained No. 1 for its share of residents without coverage.

Donald Trump falsely claims opioid numbers way down after $6 billion in new spending
","In his speech to rally support for Tennessee Republicans, President Donald Trump spoke briefly about progress in the fight against the opioid crisis. He remarked on the new money approved in the latest congressional spending bill. ""We got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of the scourge that’s taking over our country,"" Trump said May 29. ""And the numbers are way down."" ""We’re getting the word out — bad. Bad stuff. You go to the hospital, you have a broken arm, you come out, you’re a drug addict with this crap. It’s way down. We’re doing a good job with it. But we got $6 billion to help us with opioid."" We wondered what opioid numbers he was talking about, and whether they are really ""way down."" The White House cited an article about the decline in the number of opioid prescriptions. But the reduction in prescriptions might mean less than it seems, and opioid deaths remain high. Reporting on a study from a health data firm, an April 19 Washington Post article said the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies (measured in morphine equivalents) dropped 10 percent in 2017. The study by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science suggested that public outrage over over-prescribing had led to restraint by physicians. But a drop in opioid prescriptions isn’t a guaranteed sign of progress. A review of studies of prescription monitoring programs published in the Indiana Health Law Review found that about one-third of the time, these efforts take place in states where overdoses rose after the programs expanded. In West Virginia, for example, even with a ""significant drop in opioids dispensed"" between 2008 and 2015, the number of heroin poisonings doubled. ""Fewer prescriptions have not translated into lower overdoses,"" said the article's author Northeastern University opioid researcher Leo Beletsky. ""Quite the opposite."" As for Trump’s statement that the numbers are ""way down,"" the government’s most recent statistics through October 2017 show a rise in overdose deaths from the year before. For all opioids, including illegal and prescription drugs, deaths were up 15 percent. For the synthetic opioids alone, such as fentanyl, deaths were up 57 percent. Deaths from prescription painkillers such as oxycodone (the natural/semi-synthetic category) rose by a small fraction. The only possible bright spot in the numbers is that while the death toll continues to rise, it rose at a slower rate than the year before. The timing of the funding increase Trump mentioned also undercuts his claim. The appropriations bill that provided $6 billion to federal, state and local agencies to turn back the opioid crisis became law at the end of March. It is dubious to argue that this money flowed quickly enough to have a measurable impact on the opioid problem, especially since the total amount would come over two years. Trump said that in the opioid crisis, ""the numbers are way down."" One study shows a 10 percent decline in the the number of opioid prescriptions at retail pharmacies. However, the latest government figures show a 15 percent increase in opioid overdose deaths between 2016 and 2017. And research casts doubt on the tie between reduced prescribing and a drop in the number of overdoses. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2EA180>],/factchecks/2018/may/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-opioid-numbers-way-dow/

Greg Casar says Austin 'ranked repeatedly' high for economic segregation--even No. 1 nationally
","An official concerned about government not enforcing fair housing regulations says Austin has long been known to be a city divided. Greg Casar, who represents District 4 on the Austin City Council, told the Austin American-Statesman in May 2018: ""We do have a really serious problem in Austin. We’ve been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country."" Economic segregation can briefly be defined as residential division by income. And has Austin repeatedly been ranked high by that metric? Casar notes three studies To our request for elaboration, Shelby Alexander in Casar’s council office said by email that three recent studies classified Austin as economically segregated to a great degree. A February 2015 study, explored at the time in an American-Statesman news story, ranked the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area the country’s most economically segregated large metro area. That study, overseen by Richard Florida for the University of Toronto-based Martin Prosperity Institute, evaluated the nation’s 350-plus metro areas based on individual and combined measures of income, educational and occupational segregation plus an overall economic segregation index. The study ranked Austin first for economic segregation among metro areas with populations of 1 million or more. The San Antonio area ranked third, the Houston area was fourth and the Dallas area was seventh. Among all U.S. metros, the study found the Tallahassee and Trenton areas to have the greatest economic segregation, followed by the metro areas of Austin, Tucson, San Antonio, Houston, Ann Arbor, Bridgeport and Los Angeles:              SOURCE: Report, ""Segregated City, The Geography of Economic Segregation in America’s Metros,"" Martin Prosperity Institute, Rotman School of Management University of Toronto, February 2015 We followed up with Florida, who pointed us by email to his 2017 book, ""The New Urban Crisis,"" in which Florida says that since 2003, he’s explored his finding that the country’s ""creative cities"" including Austin double as ""epicenters of economic inequality."" ""Austin,"" the book says, ""is divided east to west… Its creative class is concentrated in a huge wedge to the west that runs from downtown through its high-end suburbs out to Round Rock and in another separate bloc in the far southeastern portion of the metro. Austin’s downtown has seen substantial revitalization, including the development of large amounts of new housing. The service-class and smaller working-class areas are massed entirely in the more disadvantaged areas of the east."" Also pointed out by Casar's aide: A 2017 study funded by the Urban Institute presenting economic segregation indexes for the 100 most populous U.S. ""commuting zones"" (similar to metro areas) as of the 1990 census. Generally, the institute study says, the ""share of Americans living in middle-income neighborhoods dropped from 65 percent in 1970 to 42 percent in 2009, and the share of families living in neighborhoods defined as either rich or poor has grown rapidly."" Since 2000, the report says, ""the number of people living in areas of concentrated poverty has nearly doubled, from 7.2 million to 13.8 million in 2013."" Also, the report says, ""the proportion of families living in high-income neighborhoods has risen."" The researchers analyzed economic segregation, the report says, by using the Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index (GNSI), described as measuring how many people of similar incomes ""clump"" together within a metro region, how many poor households tend to live in neighborhoods made up of mostly other poor households and how many rich households tend to live in neighborhoods made up of other richer households. From 1990 through 2010, the report says, Austin ranked among a dozen communities consistently placing in the top quarter of the nation’s economically segregated areas. But as of 2010, 10 of the 12 areas had greater  eco-segregation, the report says: New York; Charlotte, N.C.; Kansas City; Philadelphia; Louisville; San Francisco; Nashville; Dallas; St. Louis; and Washington, D.C. Among all 100 zones, Austin in 2010 ranked 18th in economic segregation--up from 25th in 2000 but down from 13th in 1990, according to a table in the study’s appendix. Dallas, the table says, was 15th, Houston was 28th, El Paso was 36th, San Antonio was 42nd, Fort Worth was 43rd, Brownsville was 86th. That year, the table says, New York ranked first by the metric ahead of No. 2 Bridgeport, Conn., and No. 3 Charlotte. Alexander also noted an April 2018 institute report ranking cities--not metro areas--by income and racial inclusion. By email, the institute’s Christina Stacy answered our inquiry by confirming that in 2013 by the institute’s analysis, Austin was outpaced for ""income segregation"" by only nine of 274 cities. INCOME SEGREGATION INDEX, 2013, AUSTIN (BLUE) AND NATIONAL AVG (YELLOW)  SOURCE: Report, ""Measuring Inclusion in America’s Cities,"" the Urban Institute, April 25, 2018 ""Although Austin ranks as highly segregated,"" Stacy wrote, ""it did improve on segregation between 2000 and 2013 while most other cities worsened. So, it has shown some improvement, but is still toward the bottom of the pack."" Another expert Another expert, Brown University sociologist John Logan, answered our inquiry with an email pointing out research placing the Austin area in 2010-14 16th among the nation’s most populous cities and 17th among all evaluated metro areas for economic segregation. Logan, presented with Casar’s claim, commented that the ""Austin metro is on the high end, but not so high as to merit the characterization as ‘one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country.’""    ""The general point is that all U.S. metro areas are highly segregated by income,"" Logan wrote, ""and that has consequences for the lives of residents."" We circled back to Casar, who agreed in replies emailed by his office that Austin’s level of economic segregation might be decreasing and that no study placed Austin by itself No. 1 by that metric. ""You could see how looking beyond the city proper makes sense,"" Casar replied. ""Consider, for example, that it’s commonplace for smaller municipalities within a larger metro area to show segregation, with some predominantly higher income and others predominantly lower income. It's also a problem that some central city neighborhoods see higher income people leave to suburbs nearby, thereby exacerbating segregation. It's also common for some lower income people to be pushed out of city limits, further away from services, also exacerbating segregation."" Our ruling Casar said Austin has ""been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country."" Austin and the Austin region have repeatedly been ranked among the nation’s most economically segregated areas. We didn’t find a ranking that placed the city or area No. 1 by this indicator though the University of Toronto study ranked the Austin area first among areas of 1 million residents or more. In that analysis, the Austin area landed third overall. We rate Casar’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Sherrod Brown misleads in lobbyist attack on Jim Renacci in Ohio Senate race
","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s first TV attack ad portrays his opponent U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci as a fan of lobbyists working in government. ""The U.S. Congress. There’s 68 teachers, 15 farmers, four pilots but only one lobbyist,"" says the narrator as a cash register cha-ching sound is heard in the background. ""That's right, Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress. And what's he done? He voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest."" Text on the screen shows this is a reference to the 112th Congress. That timeframe refers to January 2011 to January 2013. Democrats have long portrayed Renacci as a lobbyist. But what this ad omits is that while he was registered to lobby, there is no evidence he actually lobbied. And in fact, it wouldn’t make sense for a member of Congress to work as a lobbyist at the same time. The ad also gives viewers no context about the votes cited. Brown is one of several Democratic incumbents defending a seat in a state that Donald Trump won in 2016. Trump endorsed Renacci during the primary. Before being elected to Congress, Renacci primarily worked in the private sector. He owned and operated over 60 entities, according to his Congressional biography, including nursing facilities, a CPA firm, real estate and auto dealerships. (He later said it was his experience losing his dealership in the auto industry bailout when General Motors closed his dealership that prompted him to run for Congress.) He also served as president on the Wadsworth City Council and then served as mayor from 2004 to 2008. In 2008, Renacci and two other individuals registered as lobbyists for Smokehouse International Group LTD, named for Smokerise Drive, the street on which Renacci and other partners had offices. They intended to lobby in areas including defense, aviation, homeland security, and trade, according to their Senate lobbyist registration forms. Renacci filed documents with the House a handful of times between 2008 and 2011 stating that he gave no political contributions while a lobbyist. His campaign spokesman, James Slepian, said that it was a mistake to file the forms since he wasn’t lobbying and that it was handled by a lawyer. Slepian told us previously that two business associates wanted to form the firm and Renacci agreed to help because of his background as a CPA. The firm ""never got off the ground,"" Slepian said, ""but as a precautionary measure, one of the partners registered all three of them as lobbyists, just in case they ever took on any lobbying clients."" Brown’s campaign pointed to his lobbyist registration and a March article by the Associated Press. The AP quoted Renacci’s attorney, Laura Mills, as stating that Renacci never lobbied. She said that he asked her office to deactivate his lobbyist registration in 2009 before he entered Congress. But the AP found that Mills didn't file the companion form required to deactivate Renacci's registration until 2011, a few months after he took office. Members of Congress can’t lobby Congress or the executive branch on behalf of any private organization or individual ""as that would conflict with a Member‘s general obligation to the public,"" according to the House Ethics manual. In addition to it being banned, it defies logic that as a House member Renacci would want to lobby himself and his colleagues as a lobbyist. As a member, he already had the power to draft legislation and seek support from other members for his priorities. This part of the ad references two votes by Renacci. The first one is fairly circuitous. The campaign pointed to Renacci’s vote on a procedural maneuver related to HR 921 on Nov. 16, 2016. The resolution related to a bill to ban U.S. bank transactions in connection with export of commercial aircraft to Iran. The resolution passed, with all of the Republicans voting in favor and all of the Democrats voting against it. If the resolution had been defeated, then the minority party — the Democrats — would have had the opportunity to decide what legislation to consider next. On the Democrats’ plate: the No Lobbyists on Presidential Transition Teams Act, HR 6324. That bill, introduced by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., would have prohibited the use of funds to the president-elect ""for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists."" The bill was in response to a move by Trump to put lobbyists in his transition team. The ad doesn’t explain that Renacci never took a direct vote on lobbyist bill -- in fact, it never received any vote. Joshua Huder, a senior fellow in the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown, said that the Brown ad is relying on a hypothetical scenario about a tenuous connection. Members in the majority rarely vote ""no"" on a previous question because that would be handing off power to the minority. That’s something that leadership strongly discourages. The ad also cited Renacci’s vote in favor of a change to House Ethics Rules on Jan. 6, 2015. The vote passed along partisan lines: All of the Democrats voted against it, while all but four Republicans voted for it. The new rules proposed by Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., said that a person who is a subject to a preliminary or second-phase review by the Office of Congressional Ethics shall be informed of the right to counsel and that the person’s constitutional rights can’t be denied. Slepian said that Renacci ""believes in due process as enshrined in our Constitution and this measure was brought forth to ensure that due process rights are not eroded by bodies within our government.""   The rule change drew objections in 2015 from Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. At the time, he felt the rules would inhibit the ethics committee’s investigations. But now that more three years have passed, Holman told PolitiFact that the House rules didn’t ""seem to have made much of a difference."" Brown’s TV ad said, ""Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress"" and ""voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest."" Renacci misfiled paperwork about his lobbying activities, but there’s no convincing evidence he actually worked as a lobbyist while a member of Congress. The statement about a vote to help lobbyists hold government positions was not a direct vote. The ad is using circuitous logic on this point. Another vote involved a rule change that drew concerns from a government watchdog at the time, but the watchdog told PolitiFact that it ultimately didn’t make much difference. The statement omits critical evidence that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DAB6C0>],/factchecks/2018/may/31/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-misleads-lobbyist-attack-jim-renacci/

Is your Amazon Alexa spying on you?
","Once the stuff of science fiction, voice-activated virtual assistants like the Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod now reside in millions of American homes, tweaking thermostats, streaming music and scheduling appointments. While some see these devices as helping hands, others view them as Trojan horses in the age of digital surveillance. ""It is outrageous that the Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person’s home and transmitting it to the cloud,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., tweeted May 26. ""This is exactly why we need an internet bill of rights! Didn’t we fight a revolution to prevent exactly this kind of surveillance?""  It is outrageous that the Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person’s home and transmitting it to the cloud. This is exactly why we need an internet bill of rights! Didn’t we fight a revolution to prevent exactly this kind of surveillance? https://t.co/N6yn51QUxn Is Khanna correct about the scope of smart speakers’ electronic eavesdropping? We decided to take a closer look. Amazon’s voice-controlled Alexa products are considered ""always-on"" devices — but that doesn’t mean they record customers’ conversations. The devices constantly listen for a user to say a ""wake word,"" which triggers Alexa to begin recording voice data and respond to commands. Wake words include ""Alexa,"" ""O.K. Google,"" and ""Hey Siri."" The Amazon Echo — one of the online retail giant’s smart speaker product lines — uses seven microphones to listen for its wake word. According to Washington Post tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler, the Echo records a second-long snippet of ambient sound which it ""constantly discards and replaces,"" until a wake word starts the recording process. (Khanna said his claim was based on Fowler's piece.) At least, that’s how it works in theory. In practice, the wake word triggering mechanism has a track record that is far from perfect. In one highly publicized incident, a Portland family’s Alexa captured a private conversation after the voice-controlled device misheard what it thought was the wake word. It later sent the audio recording to someone in Seattle whose number was stored in the family’s contact list. (Khanna’s tweet referenced this story.) Amazon described the chain of events as ""an extremely rare occurrence,"" and issued the following statement: ""Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa.' Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer’s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right.' As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely."" The Washington Post’s Fowler, who has an Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod, said his devices go rogue on a regular basis. ""At least one of them starts recording, randomly, at least once per week,"" he wrote. ""It happens when they pick up a sound from the TV, or a stray bit of conversation that sounds enough like one of their wake words."" False positives aside, technology experts told us it’s against Amazon policy to constantly record customers’ private conversations, as Khanna claimed. ""There's no proof or confirmation from Amazon that Echo products record ‘every’ conversation in a person's home,"" said Tiffany Li, a privacy attorney at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project. ""Indeed, Amazon has publicly stated that the Alexa products only record after hearing users say wake words."" But Li noted that Amazon has been less-than-forthcoming about the circumstances surrounding its recording practices. ""It is possible that more data is being recorded than consumers know or that Amazon is willing to publicly admit,"" she said. ""Amazon is not very transparent on privacy practices related to Alexa/Echo products."" (An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on this story, but pointed us to their frequently asked questions page.) Notwithstanding Amazon’s lack of candor, Li said Khanna’s claim is ""probably not accurate."" Only voice data that’s recorded after a wake word is detected is sent to the cloud. So Khanna’s claim creates a false impression that private conversations are being secretly routed to Amazon’s computers. ""While the device is indeed always listening (there's no way for it to respond to the wake word otherwise), it is not always transmitting to the cloud,"" said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a Senior Staff Technologist for the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Still, Gillmor expressed reservations about the degree of control Amazon maintains over the devices after they’re installed in customers’ homes. ""The code in that device is under the control of Amazon, and it's basically up to Amazon (not to the owner of the device) to make sure that it's not transmitting to the cloud,"" he said. ""Clearly, Amazon isn't making those decisions correctly all the time."" Khanna said, ""Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person's home and transmitting it to the cloud."" Amazon’s Alexa technology is designed to capture voice data only after a specific voice command, called a wake word, triggers a recording mechanism. Despite some instances where private conversations were accidentally recorded and uploaded to the cloud, Khanna’s claim greatly overstates things. We found no evidence to suggest the device records every conversation and sends it the cloud. It does record conversations when it hears the wake word, and in some cases the device has misinterpreted speech when people didn't actually say the wake work.
