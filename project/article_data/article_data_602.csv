West says nearly half of Americans pay no taxes
","Allen West, a Republican candidate for Congress for the South Florida seat now held by Democratic Rep. Ron Klein, claims that close to half of Americans aren't paying ""any taxes."" On a page about the economy on his Web site, West claims, ""Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes."" That's a strong claim -- that nearly half of Americans aren't paying ""any taxes."" We wondered, could that be true?

First, a look at the context in which West made this claim. He made it in a section that focuses on income taxes -- though he said ""any taxes"":

""If we are serious about restoring the American economy then suspend payroll taxes until the situation improves. I would begin with a 3 month suspension and willingly extend that to 6 months if necessary. In order to inspire investment, innovation, ingenuity, and real growth we must end capital gains, dividend, and death taxes, just abolish immediately. We should begin to redefine our tax code, no more progressive tax system; we need to go to a flat tax system. Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes; a (flat tax) rate of around 15-17% would be adequate. A twist I recommend is to have a flat tax up to an income level of $2 Million, then institute a progressive system. My intent is to inspire Americans to earn and develop their wealth.:

The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes federal income tax issues, found the number was actually 36.3 percent based on tax year 2008 filed in 2009. The figure refers to federal income taxes.

""We found that out of the 142 million tax returns filed, roughly 51.6 million paid no income taxes or had negative income tax liability,'' said spokesperson Natasha Altamirano in an interview April 26, 2010. That equals 36.3 percent ""who paid no income taxes or got additional money through refundable tax credits"" and she added the 2008 numbers are actually the record high.

Altamirano said that it's important be precise in describing that group. ""One of the problems is when people say 'half of everyone, one-third of everyone does not pay taxes' -- that's not true,'' she said, because it omits other types of taxes such as property and sales taxes that those people still pay. ""This is just federal income tax. Unless they are saying 'federal income taxes' it's just not true.''

Another measure: According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, 46.9 percent of Americans paid no federal income taxes for 2009, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

We read him Allen West's quote about 40 to 45 percent of Americans not paying ""any taxes,"" and Williams said: ""That's not true at all.""

People who don't pay income taxes probably pay taxes in many other ways such as state and local sales tax and state and federal taxes on gasoline and alcohol. To avoid paying taxes entirely, ""you couldn't drink, you couldn't smoke, you couldn't drive a car, you couldn't live in a house,'' Williams said. ""It's hard to avoid them. We are very careful when we say 47 percent pay no federal income tax.""

West campaign spokeswoman Valentina Weis said West was referring to federal income tax.

""This paragraph refers to Allen's position on the federal income tax, and it has been well documented that the mentioned percentage (actually quoted higher in some instances, 47 percent) do not pay any federal income taxes,'' she wrote in an e-mail. We spoke to West, who also told us that his claim referred to federal income taxes. When asked why he didn't state ""federal income taxes"" rather than ""any tax"" he said:

""I presume people are smart enough to know what I'm talking about because I'm running for federal office,'' he said in an interview.

West's campaign provided links to an editorial in USA Today and articles from CNN, the AP and Business Insider which cite the 47 percent figure.

West's statement was made within a paragraph in which he discussed taxes, including several aspects of the income tax, but it appeared on a page about the economy that covered a range of financial issues including the ""death tax,"" sub-prime mortgages and foreign aid. If West meant to say 40 to 45 percent of Americans don't pay ""federal income taxes,"" he could have been more specific. As it is currently worded, the sentence is not specific and can lead people to believe he was referring to all types of taxes. So for the lack of important context, we rate this claim Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'George Will']","
Will says Arizona law merely echoes federal immigration statutes
","Arizona just passed an immigration law that's getting the attention of national policymakers.

Critics of the bill say it may be unconstitutional and that it will prompt racial profiling.

But conservative columnist George Will said on ABC's This Week that the new law only reiterates federal crimes.

""What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is a crime, a federal crime,"" he said. ""Now, the Arizona police -- and I've spent time with the Phoenix Police Department -- these are not bad people. These are professionals who are used to making the kind of difficult judgments. Suspicion of intoxicated driving, all kinds of judgments are constantly made by policemen. And I wouldn't despair altogether their ability to do this in a professional way.""

We're leaving questions of constitutionality to the lawyers. Instead, we wondered whether Will is correct that the new Arizona law makes a state crime out of something that's already a federal crime.

Other proponents of the bill have made the same argument, including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, who said that the ""legislation mirrors federal laws regarding immigration enforcement.""

""Despite erroneous and misleading statements suggesting otherwise, the new state misdemeanor crime of willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document is adopted, verbatim, from the same offense found in federal statute,"" she said on April 23, 2010, the day she signed the bill.

Opponents are adamant that the bill is unconstitutional. For instance, the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund wrote in a letter to Brewer that the new law will ""require or permit public officials to investigate and determine individual's immigration status. These provisions regulate immigration and are impermissible intrusions on Congress' exclusive constitutional powers."" They also argue that the Arizona law would allow local enforcement authorities to arrest those suspected of being in violation of the law without a warrant. But without a formal agreement with federal authorities, states are prohibited from enforcing civil violations of immigration law, they argue.

The legal scholars we spoke with told us to take a close look at two key sections of Title 8 of the U.S. Code. Section 1304e requires that ""every alien, eighteen years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him."" Those who fail to comply will be guilty of a misdemeanor and will be fined $100 and can be imprisoned up to 30 days.

Section 1306a says that, ""Any alien required to apply for registration and to be fingerprinted in the United States who willfully fails or refuses to make such application or to be fingerprinted, and any parent or legal guardian required to apply for the registration of any alien who willfully fails or refuses to file application for the registration of such alien shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not to exceed $1,000 or be imprisoned not more than six months, or both.""

Indeed, section 3 of the new Arizona law makes it a state crime if immigrants are in violation of either of those codes.

So, when it comes to that section of the law -- arguably the ""meat"" of the new law -- ""it's very clear that in this respect, George Will is right,"" said Paul Bender, a law professor at Arizona State University.

Gabriel Chin, a professor of law at the University of Arizona, had a similar take. In an e-mail, he wrote that Will's claim is generally correct.

""However, while the underlying offenses are federal crimes, they are among the least prosecuted in the U.S. Code,"" he wrote. ""For the relevant offense at issue here, failure of a non-citizen to register in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1306(a), there were five convictions across the U.S. in FY 2008. So to be precise, the statement would be 'What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is . . . a federal crime that the federal authorities have chosen not to enforce except in rare circumstances.'""

In fact, proponents of the Arizona law have argued that'sÂ why new state immigration rules are needed; federal authorities are not doing a consistent job of enforcing immigration laws that are already on the books.

So, in the two cases above, the bill does make what are already federal crimes state crimes.

There are other parts of the new law that also overlap with federal statute. For instance, section 5 of the Arizona law, which deals with the transportation of non-citizens, is nearly identical to section 1324 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code.

However,Â the Arizona lawÂ does break new ground. For example, Section 5 also would make it illegal to pick up day laborers on the street for hire, ""which has nothing to do with federal law. It's essentially a traffic law,"" Chin wrote. Those violating this section are guilty of aÂ misdemeanor. And it also makes it a crime for an illegalÂ immigrant to solicit work. Â 

Mary Giovagnoli, director of the Immigration Policy Center, pointed out another aspect of the bill that she finds particularly troubling: Section 2 of the Arizona law would allow citizens to sue local and state authorities if they do not believe the new law was being enforced effectively. State and local authorities could be fined between $1,000 and $5,000 a day for each day the policy remains in effect.

The bill also includes new language about how the law applies to employers and specifies the circumstances under which an officer can question and arrest someone he or she thinks is in violation of the law.

But Will wasÂ talking about crimes. He said that the the new Arizona immigration law makes what is already a federal crime into a state crime. And when it comes to some of the most talked about parts of the law, having to do with aliens who fail to carryÂ proper paperwork andÂ failing to register, Will is correct about the core of the law; federal statutes already makes those two provisions a crime. But the law alsoÂ includes a new prohibition barring picking up day laborers on the street for hire and soliciting for work. That's not in the federal code. As a result, we find Will's claim to be Mostly True.","[('This Week, April 25, 2010, episode\nThe New York Times, Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration, by Randal C.

CEO says GM has repaid government loans in full
","In an ad reminiscent of Lee Iacocca's ""Thanks, America"" commercials in 1983 after Chrysler had repaid government-backed loans, General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre has taken to the prime-time airwaves to boast that GM has paid back its government loans, in full, and ahead of schedule.""A lot of Americans didn't agree with giving GM a second chance,"" Whitacre says in the ad. ""Quite frankly, I can respect that. We want to make this a company all Americans can be proud of again. That's why I'm here to announce we have repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule. But there's still more to do. Our goal is to exceed every expectation you've set for us.""In addition to Whitacre, the loan repayment has been trumpeted by President Barack Obama and numerous members of his administration.It's true that GM has squared up on its government loans, but Whitacre isn't telling the full story.With GM in deep trouble and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the balance, the Obama administration -- through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -- stepped forward with tens of billions of dollars worth of assistance. As of March 31, 2010, the U.S. Treasury had committed approximately $52.4 billion to GM.Only a fraction of that, $6.7 billion, was in the form of loans. Most of the government's GM investment was converted to an ownership stake in the New GM, the company that emerged from bankruptcy: $2.1 billion in preferred stock; and 60.8 percent of the company's common equity.GM had already made several installments in paying back the $6.7 billion loan. But on April 21, 2010, GM announced that it had paid back the entirety of the remaining $4.7 billion in loans from the U.S. government (and another $1.1 million to the Canadian government). GM had until 2015 to pay back those loans. So the loan portion of the GM bailout was, in fact, settled, with interest, five years ahead of schedule.But the U.S. government is still on the hook for the bulk of its investment in GM. Again, the U.S. Treasury owns $2.1 billion in preferred stock and a 60.8 percent stake in the company. GM plans an initial public offering (IPO) as soon as this summer, and the government plans to sell off its interest in the company over time. The better the company does, the more the government looks to recoup. But the prospects for the government getting all its money back don't look promising.On March 18, 2010, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the government will end up losing $34 billion in TARP funds extended to the automotive industry. The CBO didn't break out how much of that is tied to GM, but it's fair to say most of it.While we found a GM official quoted as saying he thinks taxpayers will eventually get all their money back, few industry experts agree.In an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, Paul Ingrassia, theÂ newspaper's former Detroit bureau chief and author of Crash Course: The American Automobile Industry's Road from Glory to Disaster, wrote: ""It won't be easy for an IPO to raise $52 billion for the government shares. That's more than Ford Motor's current market capitalization, some $48 billion. And Ford, the only U.S. car company to avoid bankruptcy, already is profitable, which GM isn't. For GM to show sustained profits means doing business in a new way and breathing new life into long-moribund brands.""It likely will take years to find out exactly how the government fares in selling off its GM stock, but in an April 23, 2010, letter to congressional leaders, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said investments in GM ""will likely result in some loss, but we currently anticipate that it will be much lower than was forecast last year.""Aside from the outstanding stock issue, Whitacre's announcement has come under fire from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who notes that the loans were repaid not with GM earnings (in fact, SEC filings show GM expected to have negative net cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2009) but rather from GM tapping into a multi-billion-dollar TARP-funded escrow account.""Therefore, it is unclear how GM and the Administration could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its TARP loans in any meaningful way,"" Grassley wrote in an April 22, 2010, letter to Geithner. ""In reality, it looks like GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another. The taxpayers are still on the hook, and whether TARP funds are ultimately recovered depends entirely on the government's ability to sell GM stock in the future. Treasury has merely exchanged a legal right to repayment for an uncertain hope of sharing in the future growth of GM. A debt-for-equity-swap is not a repayment.""Grassley's claim about the origin of the money used to repay the loan was acknowledged by company and government officials.In an April 21, 2010, interview on the Fox Business Network, GM's vice chairman, Stephen Girsky, was asked if GM is just paying the government back with government money.""That is, in effect true,"" Girsky said. ""But a year ago, nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back. They gave us five years to pay it back, we're paying it back in nine months. ... This is one step along the way in the road to recovery here.''Elaborating on that point, he said: ""The business is stabilizing. Our performance is starting to improve. The cash flow is better. The financial condition is stabilizing. So we felt it prudent to start to get the taxpayer their money back.""In a Senate Finance Committee hearing on April 20, 2010, Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the TARP, was similarly asked if GM was ""taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other to do that."" ""The source of that was an equity capital facility ... that's basically escrow money,"" Barofsky said. ""Some of the money that was given to GM, it basically wasn't all given as a lump sum check, saying, here, all this money's available to you,"" Barofsky explained. ""Some of it was put in what's called an equity capital facility, which they can draw down. And they have to sort of report to the government what they're going to do with the money . . . . If there's any money left in that account after a certain period of time, it has to be used to repay the debt. ""And basically what GM is doing is it's pulling that forward, and it's taking the money out of this TARP capital facility and using it to pay off the debt, the $6.7 billion debt that was previously owed.""ABC News quoted a Treasury Department spokesman saying that ""the cash in the restricted account was the property of GM.""""This account was expected to be used for extraordinary expenses,"" the Treasury official said, ""and the fact that GM has decided that it does not need to reserve these funds for expenses is a positive sign for our overall investment.""In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.""To me, money is fungible,"" he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.""It's a genuine paying back,"" White said. ""It does reduce the federal government's involvement.""Still, he said, ""it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate"" with the U.S. government. Whitacre's claim may be ""technically accurate,"" White said, ""but if it was meant to give the impression that that clears GM from its financial involvement with the federal government, that's not correct.""Said David Zaring, professor at the Wharton School of Business: ""Itâs absolutely an exaggeration based on the fact that the government owns 60 percent of the company. But yes, thatâs a repayment of money by a company the taxpayer owns. In that sense, I wouldnât really crow too much about the repayment, if I were Ed Whitacre.""Several economists we spoke to said the repayment is undeniably a sign of progress for the struggling company. But nearly 90 percent of the government's investment in General Motors through TARP still hangs in the balance, and most industry experts doubt stock sales will recoup anywhere near what the government put up. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal on the day of the loan payoff announcement, Whitacre at least noted the issue of the remaining equity in GM still held by the U.S. government -- though even there he didn't quantify the government's financial stake. But we bet many more people saw the television ad we're fact-checking here. We think the TV ad would leave most reasonable viewers with the impression that GM has fully settled up with the government. Whitacre can accurately claim that GM has retired its $6.7 billion in loans from the U.S. government. But with the government still owning 60 percent of the company and the prospects slim for getting all its money back, we think that's highly misleading. And so we rate Whitacre's statement Half True.","[('YouTube.com, GM Post-Bailout Commerical ""Trust"" starring General Motors chairman & CEO Ed Whitacre, April 22, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbXpV0aqEM4&feature=player_embedded'), ('Wall Street Journal, Opinion: ""The GM Bailout: Paid Back in Full,"" by Ed Whitacre, April 21, 2010', 'No link'), ('Fox News, Opinion: ""Did General Motors Really Repay Its Taxpayer Bailout?"" by Sen.

Daniel Webster says he was Democrat's 'worst nightmare'
","Longtime state lawmaker Daniel Webster became the latest Republican to enter the race for Congress in Florida's 8th District on April 22, joining an already crowded field looking to oust incumbent Orlando Democrat Alan Grayson.In his announcement, Webster replayed a personal narrative that he believes can rally conservatives to his campaign:Found politics through his church. Fought for less government and low taxes. Built Florida's Republican dynasty. The first GOP speaker in 122 years. Webster, an air conditionioning contractor and a Georgia Tech graduate, shared a story from the 1996 election to help drive the point home. Republicans back then were potentially poised to take control of the Florida House, and Webster, then the minority leader, was in line to be speaker.""During the '96 election, Democrat Gov. Lawton Chiles said if I were to become -- me, he was speaking to me -- 'If he were to become speaker of the House it would be my worst nightmare,' '' Webster said. ""He was right.""So often candidates enter political races telling personal stories. In this case, we wanted to see if Webster's story about Chiles jibes with the historical record.On the historic 1996 election, Webster is on solid ground. Republicans that year took control of the Florida House for the first time since 1875 when ""carpetbagger"" Malachi Martin held the speaker's gavel. Republicans won a 61-59 majority in the House in 1996, making Webster speaker. Republicans also held a 23-17 edge in the state Senate, making Florida the first southern state since Reconstruction with a Republican-dominated Legislature.But what about Chiles?Though Chiles was never quoted in a newspaper saying exactly what Webster remembers, Chiles did use the phrase ""worst nightmare"" during the 1996 election, according to a search of newspaper accounts from the time.The first reference comes at the tail-end of a briefs column in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune on Oct. 19, 1996. An item about Jeb Bush campaigning for Republicans ended: ""Already facing a GOP-controlled Senate, Chiles has called the possibility of a Republican-led House his 'worst nightmare.' ""A similar line appeared the next day in the Lakeland Ledger: ""With a GOP-controlled Senate, Chiles has called the possibility of a Republican-led House his 'worst nightmare.' ""The Orlando Sentinel published a full quote from Chiles on Oct. 21. ""I'll go out and help those people who are going to help me after the November elections,"" Chiles said. ""My worst nightmare is for the Democrats to lose control of the House.""The quote, and the snippets from the Herald-Tribune and Ledger, aren't necessarily talking about Webster, rather Republicans in general.Oct. 25, in the St. Petersburg Times -- ""Chiles said losing control of the House would lead to his 'worst nightmare' - a Republican-dominated legislature.""The worst nightmare line continued to appear in news articles now and again, always in reference to the GOP-controlled House and not Webster specifically, until April 12, 1998, when a Herald-Tribune article about a feud between Chiles and Webster included this line:""But Webster, R-Orlando, is living up to the description Chiles once gave him: 'My worst nightmare.' ''Alan Judd, who authored the 1998 story and now works for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, said he couldn't recall if Chiles' statement was directed specifically at Webster or at the GOP House in general. But he thought Webster's statement at the campaign rally essentially reflected Chiles' thinking at the time.Back to Webster's statement. He said Chiles called Webster his ""worst nightmare."" Every published reference except one said the comment was about the GOP takeover of the Florida House in 1996 and not Webster specifically. In our minds, that's just a hair different, and warrants a rating of Mostly True.","[('My FOX Orlando, ""Familiar face enters race to unseat Grayson,"" April 22, 2010St. Petersburg Times, ""GOP plans new era Fla.

","Before Daniel Webster was for running for Congress, he was against it, his possible Democrat opponent says.Webster, the former Republican Florida House Speaker and Senate Majority Leader, announced he was running for the Florida 8th Congressional District at a rally on April 22, 2010.His announcement produced an immediate reaction from an adviser for incumbent U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando.""Daniel Webster said he's out. Now he says he's in,"" Tagen said in a statement on behalf of the campaign. ""If he flip-flopped on this, will he flip-flop on delivering for the people of our district?""We've already ruled on a claim from Webster's campaign announcement. In this item, we wanted to see if the Grayson retort that Webster already announced he wasn't running is accurate.Indeed, on Oct. 13, 2009, Webster said he was out. Here's his statement: ""After much prayer and thoughtful consideration, I have decided not to run for the United States House of Representatives, District 8. This has been a very difficult decision for me personally, especially because of the tremendous outpouring of support that has flooded me from all sides. However, in spite of this incredible encouragement, I still have a certain check in my spirit, prompting me to follow a principle that has always served me well: 'When in doubt, don't.'""I do firmly believe that in every public office there needs to be a resurgence of the basic principles on which this Republic was founded, and a return to our original standards of integrity and character. While I will not be pursuing a place in Congress, I am grateful for the privilege of serving the citizens of Central Florida for 28 years in our state Legislature, and look forward to future opportunities of service.""Webster told the Orlando Sentinel he originally opted against running because his family wasn't 100 percent behind the idea. Now they are.Grayson's right. Webster once said he wasn't running. Now, he is. We rate Grayson's statement True.","[('My FOX Orlando, ""Familiar face enters race to unseat Grayson,"" April 22, 2010Politico, ""Webster to shake up Grayson race,"" April 22, 2010Orlando Sentinel, ""Webster: I\'m not running against Grayson,"" Oct. 13, 2009Orlando Sentinel, ""Former Florida Sen.

Six largest banks getting bigger, Brown said
","Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is pushing a proposal to cap the sizes of large banks. He appeared on ABC News' This Week with Jake Tapper to talk about that, as well as Democratic efforts to pass financial reform.""Let me give you one statistic, if I could, Jake,"" Brown said. ""Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP, 17 percent of GDP. The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP. ... We've got to deal with risk to be sure, but we've got to deal with the size of these banks, because if one of these banks is in serious trouble, it will have such a ripple effect on the whole economy. So we simply can't let them get this big and have this kind of economic power over Main Street, over a small business in Canton, Ohio, or a worker -- a manufacturing plant in Dayton. I mean, we just can't let this happen.""Some very smart people disagree on Brown's point that big banks resist regulation by reason of their sheer mass. People like Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, urge measures that would limit the size of the biggest banks. Meanwhile, people like Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning New York Times columnist, say that breaking up the banks isn't necessary to avert the next meltdown if the proper regulations are put in place. We were interested in Brown's statistic though: That 15 years ago the top six banks' assets totaled 17 percent of GDP, while today that's 63 percent.Brown's staff said he got the numbers from 13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown, a book by Johnson and James Kwak, that describes the financial crisis and advocates steps for reform, including limits on the size of banks. Johnson also cited the number in an article in the New Republic, co-written with Peter Boone, that criticized President Barack Obama for not pushing rules that are tougher on big banks.The numbers are a fairly straightforward calculation. You take the bank's total assets, such as loans, cash and securities. (Remember that to banks, a loan is an asset, since they make money off loans.) Then you divide by GDP, which is gross domestic product, and is the total economic output for a country during a given year. Last year, the U.S. gross domestic product was $14.3 trillion.Johnson's book lists the six biggest banks of 2009 as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.The numbers in the book looked right to us, but we wanted to find an outside expert to confirm it. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia agreed to run the numbers to see if they got the same thing.Sure enough, they found the same thing. The figures were off by aÂ few percentage points because the researchers were able to use numbers from the fourth quarter of 2009 and compared them with the same quarter in 1994. Johnson's book cites numbers from the third quarter.Here's the information the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia sent us: Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 2009Bank of America Corp. - 2,224.5 JP Morgan Chase - 2,032.0 Citigroup - 1,856.6 Wells Fargo - 1,243.6 Goldman Sachs - 849.3 Morgan Stanley - 771.5 Total 8,977.5 Nominal GDP 14.453.8 Percentage 62.1% Assets (in billions), Dec. 31, 1994Citicorp - 250.5 BankAmerica Corp. - 215.5 Chemical Banking Corp. - 171.4 Nationsbank Corp. - 169.6 JP Morgan - 154.9 Chase Manhattan - 114.0 Total 1,075.9 Nominal GDP 7,248.2 Percentage 14.8% A couple of experts we asked about these numbers noted that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were for years categorized as investment banks, and would not have been counted in the 1994 numbers. That changed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, when the two firms became bank holding companies so they could borrow from the Federal Reserve. The underlying point, though -- that there has been significant consolidation in the banking industry -- remains true, they said.Brown said, ""Fifteen years ago, the assets of the six largest banks in this country totaled 17 percent of GDP ... The assets of the six largest banks in the United States today total 63 percent of GDP.""

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Legal Issues', 'Pundits', ""Bill O'Reilly""]","
O'Reilly says no one on Fox raised issue of jail time for not paying health coverage penalties
","Sen. Tom Coburn -- a staunchly conservative Oklahoma Republican -- surprised many on the right and the left in early April when he urged a town hall audience back home not to take everything said on Fox News as gospel. The spark for this unexpected exhortation was a question from an audience member about whether Americans could go to prison for failure to pay a penalty for not securing health insurance.

""The intention is not to put anyone in jail,"" Coburn told the audience. ""That makes for good TV news on Fox, but that isnât the intention.""

One of Fox's best-known hosts, Bill O'Reilly, took note of this apostasy and invited Coburn to join him as a guest on his April 13, 2010, show.

After some back-and-forth, Coburn told O'Reilly that he's ""very glad"" that Fox News is doing what it does. ""You offer a balance to the total slant on the left,"" Coburn said. ""But when we're not accurate, or when we overstate the case, and I will tell you I have heard that in certain Fox programs, the case is overstated.""

O'Reilly shot back, ""But tell me what -- because it doesn't happen here. And we researched to find out if anybody on Fox News had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance. Nobody's ever said it. So it seems to me that what you did was you used Fox News as a whipping boy when we didn't qualify there.""

We thought we'd check O'Reilly's claim that no one on Fox News ""had ever said you're going to jail if you don't buy health insurance.""

But first some background about what Coburn was referring to in the first place.

One of the key principles of the recently passed health care law is to corral uninsured Americans who can afford health care insurance into getting coverage. Except for a few exempted categories -- people for whom insurance premiums would be a financial hardship, Americans with religious objections, American Indians, undocumented immigrants and prison inmates -- Americans are all supposed to enroll in a health care plan. If they do not, the law imposes penalty fees that are administered through the tax code.

Critics of the bill have seized on this ""individual mandate"" as contrary to individual liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. In fact, the provision forms the basis of a lawsuit filed by a group of predominantly Republican attorneys general that challenges the newly enacted law. But what has bothered some critics even more than the penalties themselves is the fear that a failure to pay those penalties could land a violator in prison.

Neither the initial health care bill introduced in the House (H.R. 3200) nor the one that passed the House in November 2009 (H.R. 3962) had specific language ruling out prison for those who failed to pay penalties for not having health insurance. However, many experts considered the likelihood of prison time remote. On Sept. 29, 2009 -- at a time when H.R. 3200 was the only detailed health care bill under consideration in either chamber -- PolitiFact concluded that ""the notion that one could go to prison for not buying insurance is certainly attention-grabbing, but based on past patterns of prosecution, the likelihood of it happening is extremely small.""

Even that slight chance disappeared after the Senate got involved. The outline of a bill introduced on Sept. 16, 2009, by Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., didn't specify how penalties would be enforced but by the time the measure had made it into official language and been passed by his committee on Oct. 19, 2009, it included the following provision: ""In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this section, such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure.""

That provision made it into the bill passed by the Senate in December 2009, and also into the final version of the law that was passed by both chambers and signed by President Barack Obama.

Now let's analyze O'Reilly's specific statement.

It turns out that several Fox shows did mention the possibility of jail time. Here are some examples:

â¢ Paul Gigot, host of the Journal Editorial Reports, Oct. 3, 2009 

""Democrats want to require you to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. But they don't want you to call it a tax. Under the Baucus bill, the so-called individual mandate would require everyone to buy health insurance or pay as much as a $1,900 fee. If you don't pay up, the IRS could punish you withÂ a $25,000 fine or a year in jail.""

â¢ Sean Hannity, interviewing Greg Mueller, the president of CRC Public Relations, and Penny Lee, a Democratic strategist, on Nov. 10, 2009

Hannity: ""Jail? Is that...""

Mueller: ""We are losing freedom. The Berlin Wall anniversary is just the other day. And these are the kind of policies that used to be imposed on people behind that wall. One problem we're going to have, though, Sean, they're going to have, though, Sean, they're going to have to do something about prisons. They're going to put all these people in jail. It costs $50,000 a year to take care of a prisoner. So they're going to have to do prison reform.""

Hannity: ""That's going to be true.""

Mueller: ""Democrats don't like to do prisons.""

Hannity: ""Put people in jail if they don't get their government mandated health? We're going to tax business. We're going to tax individuals. There's going to be fines. There's going to be penalties. There's a millionaire's tax. We're paying for it through the wall. This is what you want? Your socialist utopia, Penny.""

Lee: ""You're not in socialist utopia. What they're trying to do is bring competitive choice and bring affordable quality health care.""

Hannity: ""People in jail?""

â¢ Andrew Napolitano, guest-hosting theÂ Glenn Beck Program, Nov. 10, 2009

""For the first time in American history, if this bill becomes law, the feds will force you to buy insurance you might not want or may not need or cannot afford. If you don't purchase what the government tells you to buy, if you don't do so when they tell you to do it, if you don't buy just what they say is right for you, the government may fine you, prosecute you, and even put you in jail.""

â¢ Glenn Beck, on his Fox show, Nov. 12, 2009 

""But if you don't play by their new rules on health care -- oh, here's a new little twist. Have you heard this? You're going to be looking at a fun little stint in jail.""

Later in the show, Beck said, ""And oh, yes, the potential jail time. If you don't have health insurance? Jail time. You heard Nancy Pelosi defend that portion of the bill just a few minutes ago. There has got to be some way to force everybody to have health care, right? It is jail.""

So we found at least four cases in which hosts or guests brought up the possibility of people being jailed for not having health insurance. Given the amount of programming hours that Fox aired during the health care debate, that's not an overwhelming number of mentions, and if O'Reilly had simply said that Fox didn't beat the drum too loudly on that specific provision, we'd be tempted to give him a pass. But he not only said definitively that ""nobody's ever said it"" on the network, but also said that his staff had researched the question. So we are left to conclude that either his staff muffed its research or that O'Reilly trying to pull a fast one.

One would think the story ends there, but it doesn't. On April 15, 2010, two days after his initial claim, O'Reilly managed to dig himself deeper.

Faced with evidence from the liberal group Media Matters that jail time had indeed been discussed on Fox, O'Reilly sought to clarify what he meant the first time around.

""Now as we all know, the prison option was taken off the table when the final Obama care bill was being debated,"" O'Reilly said. ""And that's what we were talking to Sen. Coburn about, the final bill debate. Not all that stuff. So, what I said is absolutely true. Nobody at Fox News reported inaccurately about the Obamacare prison situation. Nobody. Yet, Media Matters, as they always do, distorted the entire situation. Shamefully, NBC News and Time magazine lapped up the garbage and put it right out there.""

The way we see it, O'Reilly is rewriting history. We see no evidence in his initial statement that he was referring to Fox's references to jail time only during a specific time period. And he subtly tried to bolster his case by the clips he chose to accompany his April 15 comment. He used two clips to illustrate how Fox had dealt with the question of jail time in the past, both of which consisted of footage of journalists from other networks asking Obama and Pelosi a jail-related question at legitimate news events. Using those clips made it seem to viewers like Fox was getting blasted from the left simply for reporting on genuine news events, when in fact the criticism had to do instead with comments by Beck, Hannity and other hosts and guests who used the Fox platform to attack the health care bill.

O'Reilly said nobody had ""ever"" said on Fox that you risked jail if you don't buy health insurance, and to us, ""ever"" means ""ever."" So we don't buy O'Reilly's after-the-fact defense. We rate his claim Pants on Fire!","[('Fox News, The O\'Reilly Factor (video), April 15, 2010\n\nFox News, The O\'Reilly Factor (transcript), April 13, 2010 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)\n\nFox News, The O\'Reilly Factor (transcript), April 15, 2010 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)\n\nCapitol News Connection, ""A Top GOP Conservative Defends Pelosi, Slams Fox,"" April 6, 2010\n\nFox News, Journal Editorial Report, Oct. 3, 2009 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)\n\nFox News, Hannity, Nov. 10, 2009 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)\n\nFox News, The Glenn Beck Program (transcript), Nov. 10, 2009 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)\n\nFox News, The Glenn Beck Program (transcript), Nov. 12, 2009 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)\n\nPolitiFact, ""Conservative group says you\'ll be imprisoned for not having health insurance,"" Sept. 29, 2010\n\nMedia Matters for America, ""Quick fact: Beck fill-in Napolitano forwards false claim that the government could \'even put you in jail\' if you fail to purchase insurance under health care bill"" (blog post), Nov. 10, 2009\n\nMedia Matters for America, ""Quick fact: Beck\'s \'new little twist\' is the same old health care jail time falsehood"" (blog post), Nov. 12, 2009\n\nText of health care bill as signed by the president (H.R. 3590)\n\nText of health care bill as passed by the Senate Finance Committee (S. 1796)\n\nSummary of health care bill chairman\'s mark by Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (subscribers only)\n\nText of health care bill as passed by the House (H.R. 3962)\n\nText of health care bill as introduced in the House (H.R. 3200)', 'http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/m/30343165/talking-points-4-15.htm')]",/factchecks/2010/apr/27/bill-oreilly/oreilly-says-no-one-fox-raised-issue-jail-time-not/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says everyone has access to health care coverage, even without insurance
","
Gov. Rick Perry, presiding over the state with the nation's biggest share of uninsured residents, recently suggested that Americans have access to health care regardless of their insurance status. 
Perry, who has objected to the federal mandate passed into law requiring most Americans to obtain health coverage by 2014, told the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine April 15: ""There is a misnomer out there, I think, there's a misconception, that somehow or another... uninsured means that you have no health care. That's not correct. 
""Everyone in this country has access to health care."" 
Everyone? Even people without health insurance? 
When we asked for back-up for Perry's statement, his campaign didn't offer any data or additional analysis. 
Next, we looked at hospital emergency rooms, often the portal through which uninsured people seek treatment. 
Some background: In 1986, Congress responded to concerns that emergency rooms were refusing to treat indigent and uninsured people â a practice known as patient dumping â by approving the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The act requires all hospitals with emergency rooms that participate in the Medicare program to medically screen, treat and stabilize any patient (including illegal immigrants) who shows up with an emergency medical condition. The law doesn't require hospitals to offer preventive or follow-up care. 
However, not every condition that merits treatment is an emergency, and not every town has an emergency room. In Texas, 64 of the state's 254 counties don't have a hospital because it isn't economically viable, ""particularly in the Panhandle and West Texas,"" said Amanda Engler, spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association. Still, Engler said ""everyone should be able to access some level of care through the community."" 
A national health care expert, Henry Aaron at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, echoed Engler, saying that ""everyone has access to some health care. The issue is what care and how much of it... If you live in a place where few physicians practice and you don't have a car, you may not get much."" 
Remote hospitals that receive extra Medicare funding, designed to improve health care access in rural areas, offer lower quality of care on average than their metro counterparts, according to a 2009 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. The department also found that rural health care focuses on providing primary and emergency care locally, and referring patients to regional, often distant health care centers for specialized care. 
Next, we wondered if a person's insurance status affects their access to care. 
The Institute of Medicine, which researches the relationship between health insurance and access to health care, has found that health insurance makes it easier to get preventive services. In 2002, the institute reviewed 130 studies examining whether people without health insurance still get care they need. The upshot? Working-age Americans without insurance were more likely to receive too little medical care too late, be sicker and die sooner; they also were more likely to receive worse care than the insured when they're in the hospital, and less likely to receive recommended health screening services, like mammograms, Pap tests or checking your cholesterol. 
Other institute findings: the uninsured lack regular access to medications to manage conditions like hypertension or HIV infection; don't receive care recommended for chronic diseases, like timely eye exams to prevent blindness in people with diabetes; and receive fewer diagnostic and treatment services after a traumatic injury or heart attack. 
The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured reached similar conclusions. In 2009, the commission, part of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health care policy, analyzed a national health care survey tracking 17,800 people in 9,400 families, finding that more than 50 percent of uninsured adults have no regular source of health care and are more than twice as likely to delay or forgo care than the insured. 
Ed Haislmaier, a health care expert at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, said: ""If you have insurance coverage, as a general rule, you're more likely to access health care because presumably some portion of the insurance coverage pays for the cost."" 
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, some 83 percent of Americans currently have insurance coverage either through their employer, the private market or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Kaiser found the majority of the estimated 46 million uninsured are less likely than the insured to to pay for basic health care, and overall, they're less likely to receive preventive care. 
But Haislmaier said even insurance doesn't guarantee health care access â particularly to primary care physicians. For example, the Medicaid reimbursement rate for primary care physicians varies by state, so the less a state pays doctors for the costs of treating people covered under Medicaid, the less likely that doctor is to accept that person as a patient. 
""You can be living in the middle of New York City, but if you're on Medicaid, good luck getting a doctor to see you,"" Haislmaier said, citing Kaiser's Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index, a benchmark for how much each state is reimbursing its doctors to treat Medicaid patients by comparing it to the Medicare reimbursement rate. In 2008, New York reimbursed primary care doctors 36 percent of how much they would pay that doctor to treat a Medicare patient. The national average is 66 percent; Texas reimburses primary care docs 68 percent. 
What's more, Kaiser says, various safety nets like community clinics and public hospitals don't offer the broad range of health care, including mental health services that insurance provides. 
Case in point: In 2003, Texas legislators retooled the public mental health system â 39 state-funded community mental health centers that serve indigent, low-income and uninsured people â to focus on patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. People with other mental illnesses, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, rarely qualified for help unless they went into crisis, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). 
According to the agency, thousands more sometimes wait more than a year to get medication, therapy, substance abuse care and other services from community centers. Among them are 6,800 adults and children with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression â two-thirds of whom are currently receiving no services. 
Where does all that leave Perry's statement that everyone has access to health care? 
Somewhere on the continuum between hypothothesis and reality. While many avenues exist for making health care available, the reality is that many people cannot use them, and millions don't get the care they need. 
We rate Perry's statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.","[('\nThe Texas Tribune, Rick Perry: The TT Interview, April 19, 2010', 'https://www.texastribune.org/stories/2010/apr/19/rick-perry-tt-interview/'), ('\nKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, The uninsured and the different health insurance makes, September 2009', 'No link'), (""\nKaiser Family Foundation, Health reform: Implications for women's access to coverage and care, December 2009"", 'http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/1420-11-2.pdf'), ('\nKaiser Family Foundation, 50 state comparisons: Health insurance coverage of the total population, state (2007-2008), U.S. (2008), Oct. 6, 2009', 'No link'), ('\nKaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index, 2008', 'http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/7987.cfm'), ('\nAmerican Academy of Emergency Medicine, EMTLA, accessed April 20, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nInstitute of Medicine, Care without coverage: too little, too late, May 21, 2002', 'http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=125&cat=3'), ('\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, Health status and health care access of farm and rural populations, August 2009', 'No link'), ('\nAustin American-Statesman, Years after mental health overhaul, new picture of needs emerging, Dec. 6, 2009', 'http://statehealthfacts.org/comparetable.jsp?ind=196&cat=4'), ('\nSt. Petersburg Times, Legilsation would force elderly into managed care to trim Medicaid costs, April 20, 2010', 'No link'), (""\nInterview with Catherine Frazier, deputy communications director for Rick Perry's reelection campaign, April 20, 2010"", 'http://www.aaem.org/emtala/'), ('\nE-mail interview with Henry Aaron, economics scholar at the Brookings Institution, April 19, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with Ed Haislmaier, senior research fellow, The Heritage Foundation, April 23, 2010', 'http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Care-Without-Coverage-Too-Little-Too-Late.aspx'), ('\nInterview with Stacey Pogue, senior policy analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, April 20, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with Anne Dunkelberg, associate director at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, April 21, 2010', 'http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/EIB57/')]",/factchecks/2010/apr/27/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-everyone-has-access-health-car/

U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards says GOP challenger has never voted in a general election in the congressional district
","U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, seeking re-election, lashed out at his GOP foe shortly after Bill Flores captured his partyâs nomination in an April 13 primary runoff. In an ""Opening Statement"" campaign video posted online April 14, Edwards says the race will focus on his championing of veterans and his work for jobs and economic development. Edwards goes on to say Flores âhas been recruited by Washington, D.C., insiders to try to buy our district's congressional seat with millions of dollars he has made as a Houston oil executive even though he has never once voted in a general election in our district â not even once.â The charge that a wealthy candidate is trying to ""buy"" elective office is common in politics; for this article, we're looking at whether Edwards accurately depicts Floresâ voting history as a resident of the conservative-leaning 17th Congressional District. It covers more than 7,700 square miles in 12 counties, stretching from the suburbs of Fort Worth, south through Waco and east to Bryan/College Station. To back Edwardsâ claim that Flores has never voted in a general election in the district, Edwardsâ campaign pointed us to a Washington blog post and an article in the Dallas Morning News. Those reports and others published by the Waco Tribune-Herald and online Texas Tribune don't spell out all of Floresâ voting history. But they touch on Flores voting in the 2008 Democratic primary. At that time, Rob Curnock was running unopposed in the GOP primary to challenge Edwards. In this year's primary runoff in April, Flores defeated Curnock to win his party's nod for the House seat. The Tribune's March 29 article quotes Matt Mackowiak, Floresâ campaign manager, saying Flores voted in that Democratic primary in order to oppose then-Sen. Barack Obama for president, fearing Obama âwould take our country far to the left.â Mackowiak is also quoted saying he doesnât know which Democratic presidential candidate Flores voted for. Later that year, Mackowiak said, Flores phone-banked for GOP nominee John McCain on the day of the November election, got stuck in business meetings and was unable to leave in time to vote in the general election. To independently gauge Floresâ voting history, we contacted Brazos County. Flores, who lives in Bryan, has said his wife moved to the county in 2006, according to a voter guide posted online by the Dallas Morning News. Mackowiak said Flores lived in College Station while the couple's house was being built in nearby Bryan. Kathy Schuetze, the countyâs voter registration coordinator, told us records show Flores voting five times there: the 2010 GOP primary and runoffs, fall 2009 elections related to the Bryan Independent School District and proposed state constitutional amendments, plus the 2008 Democratic primary Trying another source, we contacted Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin, who maintains a statewide voter database. Smith said his database indicates that Flores registered to vote in Brazos County in December 2006. He said that while Flores missed the 2008 general election, Flores' wife, Gina Bass Flores, did vote then. So, there's no indication Flores has voted in a general election in the district. Then again, we wondered if the 2009 balloting on proposed constitutional amendments also was a general election because it occurred on a date that state law defines as the possible date of a special or general election -- the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November. Randall Dillard, spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State, which oversees elections, said many voters might have thought they were voting in a general election. However, Dillard noted, the Texas Election Code defines a general election as an election, other than a primary, that regularly recurs at fixed dates. In contrast, state legislators pick the dates of elections on proposed constitutional amendments. Flores' voting record drew questions earlier this year. Flores said at a February debate that he voted for Curnock in the 2008 general election -- then later said he'd been joking, according to an online post by the Lone Star Project, a pro-Democratic group. We sought to interview Flores. Mackowiak declined our request. He also confirmed that Flores has yet to vote in a general election in the district. We rate Edwardsâ statement as True.","[('Dallas Morning News, âRepublicans Curnock and Flores finally jab at each other days before runoff,â April 11, 2010, accessed April 21, 2010', 'http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-cd17_11tex.ART.State.Edition1.4c6128a.html'), ('Dallas Morning News, âVoter Guide, U.S. House, District 17,â accessed April 21, 2010 (Floresâ biographical background)', 'No link'), ('U.S Rep.

New ad links Rep. Bill Young to Jack Abramoff
","In a new web ad, state Sen. Charlie Justice comes armed with ominous music and some sloppy Photoshop work to link opponent Rep. Bill Young with jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff.But does Justice, who is seeking to unseat the 20-term Pinellas County Republican, have any facts?The ad describes ""Abramoff, Inc."" versus ""Young, Inc.,"" and spends two minutes drawing parallels between Young and the disgraced lobbyist now serving almost six years in prison on charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and conspiracy to corrupt public officials.The video uses Abramoff's famous fedora as a metaphor for the ties between the two men. A copy of the hat flips off Abramoff's head and lands on Young's. Words on the screen says that Abramoff ""used his money for, among other things, luxury cars."" The hat lands on Young as the screen says, ""Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car"" appears shortly thereafter. The ad says Abramoff was convicted of defrauding clients of ""tens of millions of dollars,"" while Young ""just this year"" put earmarks in the federal budget totaling $128 million.Separately, we've rated two of the ad's claims -- about Young's use of a luxury car, and whether he accepted $737,000 ""from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks."" In this item we wanted to zero in on the linkage between Young and Abramoff.Several other lawmakers, including former U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney of Florida, got tangled in the Abramoff scandal in one way or another. But there's never been a solid link to Young that we were aware of.We checked Nexis, a pay service that aggregates news articles from across the country, and found a few stories from 2006 did mention the two together -- all centering around $1,000 Young received in 2002 from an Abramoff client, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. But there is nothing to directly links Abramoff and Young. Indeed, Think Progress, a website run by the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund has a section on Abramoff's links to Congress. Many members were mentioned, including Alaska Rep. Don Young (no relation), but Florida's C.W. Bill Young isn't discussed at all.We also checked Abramoff's federal charging document. Young isn't mentioned. The document does refer to an anonymous ""Representative #1"" but that turned out to be former Ohio Congressman Bob Ney, who resigned from office and pleaded guilty to corruption charges as part of the Abramoff imbroglio.""Mr. Young never met him,"" Young spokesman Harry Glenn told PolitiFact Florida. ""He wouldn't be able to pick him out if the two passed on the sidewalk. To try to link them is ridiculous.""We find that Justice's claim about Abramoff is an attempt at sleight of hand. The ad doesn't say Abramoff bought Young the car, but with its ominous music and flying hat, it suggests a connection when there isn't one.The only connection is a tenuous one, that one of Abramoff's clients contributed $1,000 to Young in 2002. There's no evidence that Abramoff himself contributed to Young, nor that Young ever sought earmarks for Abramoff, nor that they even actually met. That's not enough to hang a hat -- or a fedora -- on.

Justice says Young spent campaign money on a luxury car
","An online video by the Charlie Justice for Congress campaign tries to link opponent Rep. Bill Young with jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. It is a case of guilt by association without proving any association. In a separate item, we've rated the suggestion of an Abramoff connection as Pants on Fire. But the video makes other claims about Young, a Pinellas County Republican, that have some truth to them, including one that Young used campaign money for ""a luxury car.""The video uses Abramoff's fedora as a metaphor for the alleged ties between the two men. A copy of the hat flips off Abramoff's head and lands on Young's. The screen says that Abramoff ""used his money for, among other things, luxury cars."" The hat lands on Young as the screen says, ""Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car.""Putting aside the sleight-of-hand implication of an Abramoff connection, it's worth exploring the simple question of whether Young did indeed use campaign money for a luxury car.The Justice campaign is referring to a 1990 revelation in the St. Petersburg Times that Young used campaign money to buy a Lincoln Continental for nearly $30,000. The  Times article noted that he also billed the campaign for the new car's taxes and title, ""a portable telephone and frequent fill-ups at the gas station."" The article said the purchase did not violate federal laws, which give members wide discretion for spending campaign money.That, however, was 20 years ago. Justice used the present tense in the words on the screen, implying that Young is still paying for his car with campaign contributions. We wondered if that part was true.Indeed, though the model of car has changed -- it's a Lincoln Navigator now -- Young spokesman Harry Glenn told us that the campaign makes monthly payments to lease the vehicle. He said the expenses have never been questioned by the Federal Election Commission and that Young felt it was better to use campaign money for the vehicle than taxpayer dollars as other members of Congress do.According to an expenditure report filed with the Federal Election Commission, in 2009 Young paid $799 per month to Ford Motor Credit for the ""campaign vehicle."" Is it fair to call a Lincoln Navigator a luxury car? We'll start with the price. The Web site says they start at $54,950, so it's definitely on the high end. The Navigator is an SUV, but Justice's use of ""car"" seems to suggest a vehicle rather than to specify a sedan. Lincoln describes the Navigator as ""the world's first luxury SUV."" The ""premium leather-trimmed"" seats are available in hues of Camel, Charcoal Black or Stone and have heating and cooling built into the front seats. Sounds like luxury to us.So Justice is right. Young used campaign money to buy the Lincoln Continental in 1990, which was traded in many years ago. But he is still using campaign money today to lease a Lincoln Navigator. Both can reasonably be called luxury cars, so we find Justice's claim True.","[(""YouTube, Young/Abramoff Video, accessed April 23, 2010.

New web ad attacks U.S. Rep. Bill Young on campaign contributions
","U.S. Rep. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores, has never been bashful about directing federal money back to his constituents in the Tampa Bay area. But now those hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks are being criticized by his opponent's campaign.Democratic state Sen. Charlie Justice of St. Petersburg levied a series of allegations against the 20-term congressman in a two-minute web video airing on Justice's website.Among them is a claim that Young, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who served as its chairman for six years, has received more than $700,000 in campaign contributions from people, businesses and groups who received his earmarks.""Just this year, Bill Young put earmarks on the federal budget totaling $128 million,"" the ad says. ""Young has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks."" (We should note that the ""this year"" reference is to FY 2010, not 2010 the calendar year. Republicans, including Young, have said they won't pursue earmarks in the FY 2011 budget).The ad, which began running April 14, 2010, has been criticized by the Young campaign, in part because it attempts to link Young to disgraced ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff, even though Young says the two never met.As a longtime member of Congress and a high-ranking member of the appropriations committee, it's not surprising that Young would receive campaign contributions from the people and companies he's supported, especially those located in his district. But the number in Justice's ad caught our attention since Young has been easily re-elected every year he's run. (He's only received less than 60 percent of the vote once, in 1992.)Justice's campaign said the $737,000 figure includes campaign contributions going back to 1997. That translates to about $61,000 a year.Justice campaign manager Mitch Kates provided PolitiFact Florida with a 37-page document that purports to show the link between the contributors to his campaign and how Young helped their companies secure federal earmarks. The document says that it tracks earmarks -- federal projects that lawmakers designate for particular companies or other entities -- from budget years 2008, 2009 and 2010, and contributions since 1997.The math The Justice campaign traced earmarks sought by Young to the company or group that would receive the money. The campaign then searched the Federal Election Commission database and OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan campaign finance website, to see who from that company or group donated to Young. Justice's campaign also used OpenSecrets to match lobbyists to the company getting the earmark. The overall dollar figure in Justice's ad includes lobbyist contributions as well, and goes back to 1998.We checked their methodology by running a search for a company called DRS Technologies, a Largo company that Justice says has received more than $12 million in earmarks since 2008. We found their approach sound.But in the process of doing that, we found that the Justice campaign's numbers didn't add up.We extracted all the contributions from the document and found more than $1 million in contributions -- not $737,000.Kates said the published figure was conservative. That seems strange because of the specificity of $737,000.But then, as we kept looking, we saw that there was more wrong with the numbers.The Justice campaign counted the same bundles of contributions five times or more, which vastly inflated the figures we found. The multiple countings occurred most often in dealing with lobbyists, who often represented multiple clients that dealt with Young. One Washington lobbying firm Van Scoyoc Associates, for instance, had identical contributions counted at least five times by Justice, because the company represented multiple clients. Also counted multiples times were contributions by the PMA Group, a defunct Washington lobbying firm that was under investigation for funneling bogus campaign contributions to then-U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.We created our own database that includes only unique contributions that Justice identified as coming from the beneficiaries of earmarks.The total?Closer to $600,000.Then Kates hastily provided PolitiFact Florida a second document showing another $1 million in contributions that he said was the result of additional research. But we found almost all of those contributions were duplicates as well. But, when you add both documents, the total is $795,000. So while the Justice approach was sloppy and full of double-counting mistakes, the number happened to be about right.Connections to earmarksNow we need to know if Young helped those companies get earmarks.We started by asking the Justice campaign how it tied Young to a specific earmark. Until 2008, earmarks in Congress were almost always requested anonymously. So Justice's campaign aides looked at earmark requests only from budget years 2008, 2009 and 2010, they said.They searched the Office of Management and Budget archives for Rep. Youngâs earmarks from fiscal year 2008 and the Congressional Record for earmark declarations from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 (Those declarations are actually on Young's Congressional website). ""Each procured earmark from FY 2008 or 2009 was verified in the billâs explanatory statement, and FY 2010 earmarks were verified in committee reports wherever possible,"" Kates wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida. ""We then cross-referenced the parties involved with his contributors in the Federal Election Commission database, searching specifically for each organizationâs board of trustees and any executive leadership committees. Any contributions from the parties' lobbyists, as identified through the Open Secrets database, were also included.""Young's earmark requests generally split into one of two categories -- either local projects in the Tampa Bay area, or defense projects for companies that have offices in Young's district. A few examples:In 2009, Young requested $4 million for researcher SRI International to continue a port security project in conjunction with the University of South Florida. SRI International announced plans to build a facility at the Port of St. Petersburg in 2006. Also in 2009, Young requested $6 million for Honeywell in 2009 to develop new ballistic missile technology (they have a location in Clearwater). For the 2010 budget year, Young requested $14 million for Pinellas County for beach erosion control, $250,000 for a business assistance project, $300,000 for a county substance abuse treatment program, and $250,000 for homeless medical care, among other requests.Young requested $4.8 million in 2009 and 2010 for St. Petersburg College for its National Terrorism Preparedness Institute, and $831,000 for terminal improvements at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport.Young spokesman Harry Glenn questioned a few of the earmarks Justice had tied to Young, specifically money for defense contractor Northrop Grumman. But he agreed Young had requested most of the money -- mainly for companies doing business in the Tampa Bay area.Glenn rattled off a list -- DRS Technologies of Largo, General Dynamics of St. Petersburg, Lockheed Martin of Oldsmar, Science Applications International Corp. of St. Petersburg, Information Manufacturing Corporation of Clearwater, L-3 Communications of Tampa, General Electric of Clearwater, Alliant Techsystems of Clearwater, Honeywell of Clearwater, Marine Desalination Systems of St. Petersburg.""These are all constituent companies doing work and employing people in Congressman Young's district,"" Glenn said.So Justice seems to be on relatively firm ground that the companies and other entities have received earmarks.But he makes a big leap of logic in tying individual contributors to those companies.Who's a recipientFirst, it is not technically accurate to say ""recipients of his earmarks"" gave Young that money. The recipients of his earmarks were mostly corporations, but they are prohibited under federal law from making campaign contributions. Justice bases his claim on the fact that many individuals who contributed to Young's campaign are employed by those companies. But Justice has not proven that those many individuals directly received money from the Young earmarks. Indeed, in our cursory examination of the names, we see examples of people who may not work directly in projects that got the earmarks.  Justice also makes a big leap in trying to tie the lobbyists to the companies and other entities that received the earmarks.For example, DRS Technologies, of Largo, spent $2.86 million with 13 different lobbying firms in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Under Justice's calculations, a contribution from any employee of any one of those 13 firms would be linked to Young. But that can be misleading because companies hire lobbyists for specific projects. Some firms might have contact with Young and his office. Many won't.Glenn said several don't lobby Young on those earmarks, including the lobbying firm PMA Group.""PMA does work in Congress for DRS, but they never have come to our office to discuss an issue,"" Glenn said. ""We never had any contact with them on this company.""Our rulingBack to Justice's claim. In a web ad, he claims that U.S. Rep. Bill Young ""has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks,"" and offers two documents totaling more than 80 pages to back up his claim. We checked the research and, quite frankly, find it a little squirrely. We know that Justice can only track earmarks back to 2008 because prior to that they were largely inserted anonymously, but he includes campaign contributions dating back to 1998. That's not a true apples to apples comparison. And the numbers don't add up. We don't know where Justice got the $737,000 from -- originally we tallied more than $1 million in contributions (though a lot of that was double counted). Then, Justice's campaign provided us with a second document with another $1 million in contributions (and again, a lot of that was double counted). Granted, the number still totals nearly $800,000 when you add both documents together and only count unique contributions.But Justice's claim is shaky because he is relying on two leaps of logic -- that any contributor who happens to be employed by a company is a ""recipient"" and that any lobbyist with a firm that did work for a recipient is tied to the earmark. Both create holes in his claim. We find it Half True.","[('YouTube, Young/Abramoff Video, accessed April 23, 2010Phone interviews with Harry Glenn, spokesman for Bill Young, April 23, 2010.Phone and e-mail interviews with Mitch Kates, spokesman for Charlie Justice campaign, April 22 and 23, 2010Charlie Justice campaign, background documents on Young campaign contributionsFederal Election Commission, Bill Young campaign finance reportsFederal Election Commission, citizens guideOpenSecrets, Bill Young campaign finance databaseNew York Times, ""Lobbyist Inquiry Appears To Be Widening,"" Feb. 11, 2009Office of Management and Budget, FY 2008 earmark requestsU.S. Rep.

Sherrod Brown says financial bill will end 'too-big-to-fail'
","The battle over financial reform continued on the Sunday morning shows on April 25, 2010, including the pivotal question of whether a pending bill in the Senate would end the notion that some giant financial services companies could receive special government protection because they are ""too big to fail.""On ABC's This Week, for instance, Austan Goolsbee, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, told host Jake Tapper, ""Well, the president is totally committed, and it's one of his key principles that we're going to end too-big-to-fail, we're going to end the bailout era that began under the last president, for good. That's not going to happen anymore."" Meanwhile, on NBC's Meet the Press, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chairman Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said that when it comes to the question of too big to fail, ""We're going to shut that down forever.""On This Week, Tapper asked Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, ""Sen. Brown, let me ask you a question about the legislation itself. I have a copy of it here, and it says right at the top of the bill that the purpose is to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end too-big-to-fail, and for other purposes. Sen. Brown, does this bill end too-big-to-fail?"" Brown responded, ""Yes, it does.""A spokeswoman for Brown amplified the senator's comments by telling PolitiFact that ""the bill would end the too-big-to-fail policy by setting up a clear process for liquidating large banks that was not available to regulators when faced with the insolvency of"" Lehman Brothers, AIG and Citigroup during the financial crisis of 2008. She added that the bill would constrain a Federal Reserve Board authority known as Section 13 (3) that allows the central bank to aid financial services companies ""in unusual and exigent circumstances.""However, despite some differences in wording, Brown's exchange mirrors a statement we analyzed four days earlier and rated Barely True. In that comment, we looked at what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in an April 19, 2010, floor speech -- that the bill ""will end taxpayer bailouts."" Bailouts have become a special focus of attention because they are especially unpopular among Americans today. Republican pollster Frank Luntz has advised opponents of regulation that ""the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout."" And when lawmakers talk about firms that are ""too big to fail,"" they are referring to the risk that the government -- and therefore the taxpayers -- could be on the hook for bailing them out if things turn bad.We rated Reid's statement Barely True because while the bill's provisions are designed to reduce the likelihood of future bailouts, the bill does not include a provision that actually bars future bailouts. As a result, we concluded that despite taking significant strides to curb future bailouts, Reid's use of the term ""end"" was too definitive to be accurate.After This Week aired on April 25, we asked several financial services experts whether Brown, like Reid, was too definitive in saying that too-big-to-fail would ""end"" with enactment of this bill. All agreed that Brown was indeed too definitive.To explain why, we'll recap the relevant provisions of the bill and how outside experts characterize what the bill does -- and does not -- do.The current version of the Senate bill -- which may not be the final version -- would, among other things, create a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse. The bill would set up a panel of three bankruptcy judges to convene and agree within 24 hours whether a large financial company is insolvent. For firms that are ""systematically significant"" -- a term considered equivalent to ""too big to fail"" -- the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The legislative language is very specific about the money being used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says:""In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.""The bill's language sets a clear intent: Don't keep a hobbled giant going by using taxpayer money; instead, use industry money to close it down in an orderly fashion. Free-market purists may see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a ""bailout."" However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company taxpayer money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as ""a rescue from financial distress."" And in this context, we don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a ""rescue."" But despite the bill's good intentions -- including its efforts to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place -- our sources generally agreed that Brown's statement, like Reid's, was too definitive about the bill spelling an ""end"" to bailouts for ""too-big-to-fail"" companies. If the danger to the wider economy from a potential collapse is perceived to be big enough some day, the federal government will probably bite the bullet and lend some financial support, our sources agreed.""The bill will reduce the likelihood of future bailouts, as well as reduce the magnitude of any that might nevertheless occur,"" said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""But 'end' is too strong for what can't be complete certainty under almost any conceivable circumstances.""Ronald H. Filler, director of the Center on Financial Services Law at New York Law School, said that he did not see ""how the proposed Senate bill completely eliminates the 'too big to fail' theory. If the Treasury secretary wants to bail out a General Motors or an AIG in the future, he should still have the right to act in an emergency state, in my opinion. Whether he will exercise this right, and whether he believes that he needs, and will seek, congressional approval before so acting, is a political question, but not a legal one.""""There is no way to know until the next crisis whether a proposal will 'end bailouts' -â it will depend on what policymakers do at the time,"" agreed Robert Litan, a senior fellow in economics at the liberal Brookings Institution.In the meantime, several sources pointed out that the bill's fund cannot be used to ""save"" a company or its shareholders, but a firm's creditors appear to remain eligible for payouts.""I realize that there are differing views on the necessity of such authority, and I don't question the sincerity of supporters who see this as the best way to reduce bailouts overall,"" said James Gattuso, senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""But I think that it should be acknowledged that the bill does authorize such creditor bailouts, however justified or unlikely one believes them to be.""It's worth pointing out that Brown is proposing an amendment that's intended to enhance the bill's ability to curb ""too-big-to-fail"" firms by limiting the amount of debt they can carry. ""Reining in Wall Street's cycle of excessive debt will ensure that no Wall Street bank ever becomes too big or too indebted to fail in a way that wrecks the entire U.S. economy,"" Brown's office wrote in a news release about his amendments to the bill. He also touted it during the interview with Tapper.But it seems clear to us that Brown's ""Yes, it does"" comment was not referring to his amendment, but rather to the bill as it is currently written. So we will not factor Brown's proposed amendment into our analysis of his comment.The argument that the bill as currently written will end bailouts and ""too big to fail"" is certainly one that holds political value for Democrats, and it's fair to say that that's the intention of the legislation. Presumably, that's why Brown, Goolsbee, Reid and other Democrats have continued to make that argument. However,Â it's an exaggeration to say that the bill would put an ""end"" to future bailouts. Short of, say, passing a constitutional amendment ruling out bailouts, any future Congress or administration would be able to act as conditions demanded, even after passage of this bill. So we rate Brown's statement Barely True.","[('Sen. Sherrod Brown, comments on ABC\'s This Week, April 25, 2010Sen.

Conspiracists falsely suggest U.S. reporterâs sudden death was linked to a story
","A young reporter died unexpectedly of swine flu and encephalitis on Dec. 28. Now conspiracy theorists are wrongly speculating that she was murdered for writing a story critical of the FBI. On Dec. 13, 2018, The Federalist published a seven-paragraph story by Bre Payton in which she wrote about an 11-page report from an Office of Inspector General investigation into text messages exchanged between two FBI officials. ""The Department of Justice wiped text messages between former FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strozk from their cell phones before the Office of the Inspector General could review them, a new report from the DOJ watchdog reveals,"" Payton wrote. ""Page and Strozkâs involvement with special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation has been heavily scrutinized after it was revealed they had sent numerous anti-Trump text messages back and forth to one another."" About two weeks later, The Federalist published another story, this one reporting on Paytonâs death. Some bloggers seized on the news. ""Reporter who broke story about Mueller destroying text messages found dead!!!"" reads one Facebook post accompanying a picture of Payton on Dec. 31. This story was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Some comments on the post agree with the suggestion that Payton was killed because of her reporting. ""You go against the Clintonâs (sic), or give information about criminal activity from the Democrats and you are risking your life,"" one Facebook user wrote. ""Lots of whistle blowers have mysteriously died."" Another user posted a link to a Jan. 3 blog post on LewRockwell.com, a self-described repository for ""anti-state,"" ""anti-war"" and ""pro-market"" thought. There, a story by Richard Enos on Paytonâs death reads: ""I donât have definitive âproofâ for the notion that Payton was killed because she was going to disclose some type of sensitive information against the Deep State; however, it must be said that the cause and circumstance of her death are befuddling enough for one to consider such an idea."" Other users werenât buying it. One posted a link to a Dec. 30 obituary in The New York Times that said Payton ""had H1N1 flu, also known as the swine flu, and encephalitis, according to her family."" Earlier in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that flu activity was elevated across the country. By Dec. 21, seven flu-related pediatric deaths had been reported. The New York Times obit cites a tweet from a friend, Morgan Murtaugh, who had asked Payton to stay with her for Christmas. ""24 hours ago I found my friend unconscious and called 911,"" Murtaugh tweeted on Dec. 28, before Payton died. ""Sheâs been in a coma since and really needs a miracle right now. Please, if youâre religious at all, send prayers this way. We really need them."" On Jan. 3, Murtaugh retweeted DC McAllister, a contributor to The Federalist among other publications. ""People who are saying Bre Payton was murdered bc she reported that texts were wiped from Strzok & Pageâs IPhones needs to stop,"" McAllister wrote. ""We are grieving her death and donât need this nonsense. She reported what was already in the OIG report. No cause for murder. She died of an illness.""

Are police warning the public about poison being injected into the caps of water bottles?
","A text screenshot-turned meme is going around the internet claiming that law enforcement is warning the public about someone injecting poison into the caps of water bottles. The post, shared on Facebook, appears to show a screenshot of a text message with ""spread the word"" written across the bottom. The message claims law enforcement sent out an alert instructing people to check the tops of water bottles because ""somebody is going around injecting poison"" into them. It goes on to say that ""a few people already died in the Richmond area,"" and said ""the sheriff"" just made an announcement. The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The rumor cites no evidence, identifies no sources, and does not specify which ""Richmond area"" â there are several throughout the U.S. We could not find any news or law enforcement reports that support or expand on the claim â and if several people had died from drinking poisoned bottled water, it would have garnered extensive national media coverage. A widespread recall of potentially tainted products would have also come in the wake of such an incident. Additionally, if government officials were, in fact, warning the public, it would be done on government websites and official social media channels. We found previous fact-checks debunking the same meme from March 2018. The timing suggests the rumor started then from a viral Facebook post on March 3. That post claimed that the caps of several bottles of water in a package purchased at a Walmart in Bennington, Vermont, had been punctured with a ""pin, needle, or similar sharp object.""  The Bennington Police Department launched an investigation into the matter shortly after the post was made, according to a news release issued March 22. ""Currently, there does not appear to be any danger to the public,"" police said in the statement. ""...No other cases of water have been located with punctures in them. The staff at the Bennington Walmart have been extremely cooperative and helpful with the investigation."" A rumor re-circulating on social media claims that law enforcement officials have asked people to check the caps of bottled water because someone is puncturing them to inject the water with poison. The warning message also said multiple people have already died as a result of the poisoning ""in the Richmond area."" There are no credible news or police reports that support such a claim, nor has there been any official warnings or product recalls. The same rumor was debunked months ago by other fact-checking websites.

Cuomo: New York's paid family leave is best
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo put forth his agenda for the first 100 days of his third term in a recent speech, and he repeated a major theme from his 2018 re-election campaign, calling New York the ""progressive capital of the nation"" while the federal government is ""taking us backwards."" He cited paid family leave as one of the policies that make New York more progressive than other states. ""We are the first state to truly attack economic injustice by raising the minimum wage to $15, and by passing the best paid family leave and free college tuition programs in the United States of America,"" he said. We wondered, does New York have the best paid family leave program in the country? The federal Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for 60 percent of the workforce. Â But only 13 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. have access to paid leave through their employer, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Four states -- New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and California -- have active paid family leave policies, according to the Congressional Research Service. Washington, D.C., Washington state, and Massachusetts enacted programs in 2017 or 2018 that will administer benefits in 2020 or 2021. Funding, eligibility criteria, the duration of benefits and the value of those benefits differ among the states. But every program provides leave to parents of a newly arriving child through birth, adoption or foster care, as well as the care of a close family member with a serious medical condition. New Yorkâs law is funded with employee contributions through a payroll tax. New York offered eight weeks of paid leave in 2018, and that increases to 10 weeks in 2019 and 2020, and to 12 weeks in 2021. A spokeswoman for Cuomo, Hazel Crampton-Hays, wrote in an email that New York ""offers the strongest active Paid Family Leave program in the nation,"" because it offers the longest amount of leave time, job protections for all employees, and the broadest uses of leave, including military-related leave. Â  Some experts agreed that New York has the strongest program that is currently active, but they warned that trying to determine the ""best"" has its pitfalls. Best for whom? Also, each program has its own complexities that can make comparisons difficult. Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,Â which employs experts with a variety of points of view, wrote in an email that ""the most important parameters are probably the amount of the benefit and how long it lasts."" Sawhill wrote that New Yorkâs program is ""very generous,"" depending on what someone values most, and that it might be the best, ""but I think thatâs a stretch."" An expert with the National Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy organization that is in favor of paid family leave, said New Yorkâs program improves upon the three others in place in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. New York offers job protections to all workers, including those in smaller companies, while New Jersey and California do not, said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies and strategies at the National Partnership. While Rhode Island offers job protection, it only offers four weeks of benefits, while New York offers 10 weeks. New Yorkâs duration of benefits is greater than those in the three other states, Shabo said. New Yorkâs law is also stronger than all, or most other states, in other categories, Shabo said in an email. When New Yorkâs law is fully phased in, workers will receive a higher replacement wage rate than in California (for all but low-wage workers)Â and Rhode Island. New Yorkers will also have a higher weekly maximum than New Jersey and Rhode Island. New York also offers benefits for military deployments of a close family member, while the other three states do not. ""New Yorkâs law will be less generous in wage replacement and duration than new laws that are not yet implemented in Massachusetts or Washington state, but Gov. Cuomoâs statement is definitely accurate as of right now when comparing New Yorkâs law to Californiaâs, New Jerseyâs or Rhode Islandâs,"" Shabo said. Washington state, which has a program that will begin to administer benefits in 2020, will offer up to 16 or 18 weeks of paid leave in some circumstances, though family leave and medical leave will each be capped at 12 weeks per year. Massachusetts will offer a maximum of 26 weeks per year when family and medical leave are combined, though family leave is capped at 12 weeks. Cuomoâs spokeswoman, Crampton-Hays, said that those programs that havenât been implemented ""cannot be evaluated in theory. We have the best paid family leave program that is real and functioning in the nation today, period."" Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning public policy think tank, directs a project on paid family and medical leave in partnership with the Brookings Institution. ""Itâs definitely more generous than existing statesâ paid leave laws,"" Mathur said of New Yorkâs law. ButÂ she said a ""more balanced picture"" would look at the costs of the program, and how businesses would deal with the absence of workers on leave. Similarly, Sawhill questioned whether generous benefits is the ideal way to evaluate the programs, as the cost and burden on employers should be considered as well. The Urban Institute, which is concerned about policy affects on low-wage workers, found that Californiaâs program is favorable for these workers in at least one respect: Its eligibility requirements are lower, said research associate Alex Stanczyk. Crampton-Hays, of Cuomoâs office, did not address the difference in eligibility requirements, but she called New Yorkâs program better for low-wage workers because of a higher weekly minimum wage replacement of $100 to Californiaâs $50, and better protections for workers in businesses of 50 or fewer employees, including job protection and continuation of health insurance. Â  Gov. Andrew Cuomo called New Yorkâs paid family leave policy the ""best"" in the country. Experts generally agreed that major features of New Yorkâs policy, such as duration, wage replacement, eligibility, and job protection are more favorable for employees on leave than programs in other states. Other states that have approved but not yet activated paid leave programs will offer more generous benefits in certain respects than New York does. Itâs also worth noting that while workers eligible for and interested in paid leave may think one program is ""best,"" their colleagues and employers may disagree. We rate Cuomoâs statement True.

"['City Budget', 'Education', 'Illinois', 'Paul Vallas']","
Vallas claims CPS healthier under his watch
","A big part of the mayoral campaign of Paul Vallas relies on his six-year record as CEO of the Chicago Public Schools under former Mayor Richard Daley. And the theme that Vallas often falls back on is that he was a turnaround specialist who revived a very troubled school system and left it in better financial and academic shape than he found it. ""I took over the school district when it had a $1 billion structural deficit and left them with $1 billion in cash and 70,000 more students than they have today,"" Vallas declared in a New Yearâs Eve interview on WGN radio. ""Iâve always been a problem-solver. My approach has always been to go in, bring financial stability to the systems that Iâve taken responsibility for, design budgets that are long-term financial plans that actually invest in the community to generate growth."" Vallas is facing a crowded field of contenders in next monthâs city elections to replace the retiring Rahm Emanuel as mayor, and the flagging condition of the cityâs public schools will be sure to present a major test for whichever candidate prevails. Having a proven track record as a school fix-it specialist could be a big plus for Vallas. But how valid are his claims? We decided to take a look. Vallasâ claims raise two questions. First, whether his basic facts check out. Second, whether they can be credited to his leadership. News clips and columns from the Vallas era at CPS, which began in 1995, back up the first beat of his claim. They note that district leaders had projected before he took over that CPS was on track to run a deficit of more than $1 billion by 1999. Under Vallas, that huge deficit never materialized, and district financial records he pointed to show that by his last year at the helm in 2001 CPS claimed a positive balance of nearly $1 billion in all of its financial accounts. But can Vallas credit his policy decisions entirely for that transformation? Not exactly. In 1995, lawmakers in Springfield turned over control of the district, which was facing one of many financial crises, to Mayor Richard M. Daley. He named Vallas, who had been serving as his budget director, chief executive officer. Daley also appointed Gery Chico, now a mayoral opponent of Vallasâ, as school board president. But the new guard at CPS also got to play by a different set of financial rules. Instead of receiving state aid earmarked for specific purposes, for example, the district started getting a significant amount of funding in the form of a block grant. Another big change that helped un-tie its fiscal hands: Lawmakers allowed property tax dollars, which had previously flowed directly into the pension fund for teachers, to go to CPS instead. And in 1997, legislators permitted the district to forego payments into the pension fund provided it hit benchmarks signifying sound fiscal health. ""He was not operating under the same conditions as the CEO that existed prior to 1995,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago. During Vallasâ six years with the district, and for several years following his tenure, CPS paid next to nothing toward teacher pension costs. The Vallas era at CPS coincided with the dot.com bubble that sent markets soaring, helping the pension fund stay healthy even without the annual injections of cash it began missing out on. Had Springfield not changed the law, the CPS teacher pension fund would have been paid $90 million in 1995 to cover the employer share of pension costs that year. Instead, it got $10 million. Over the next decade, the fund was out $2 billion. We asked Vallas in a phone interview why he opted to stop pension payments. ""The system was earning such strong returns, it didnât require that we make contributions during those few years,"" he explained. Kass said itâs considered best practice for local governments to continue employer share contributions regardless of the financial health of pension funds â something the 1997 law did not require. Had CPS continued contributions during the Vallas years, the pension fund would have had more cushion to weather the financial recessions that hit in 2001 and again in 2008, she explained. That said, Kass added that her observations come with the benefit of hindsight after watching the pension fund balance worsen dramatically after Vallas left and his successors continued to put off payments even as the fundâs fiscal viability declined. ""I do think that Vallas inherited a challenging situation,"" Kass said, noting that ratings of CPS bonds improved significantly during his tenure and enabled a system all but shut out of the credit markets to begin borrowing again. In short, CPS was on the financial ropes before Vallas took over but made significant fiscal strides under him. Changes in state law, however, gave him far more financial flexibility to operate than his predecessors. In touting his success as CEO, Vallas also pointed to the size of the district under his watch compared with much-diminished enrollment figures of today. Enrollment is important as a symbol of how attractive CPS is to families of school age children, but it also carries real financial weight because the fewer students attending classes the less state aid the district gets. Vallasâ numbers are roughly accurate. CPS enrollment stood at nearly 425,000 when he left the district, but now sits at about 361,000, state and CPS figures show. But in using enrollment data as a measuring stick of his success, Vallas ignores significant demographic changes in the city since his time at CPS that render such a comparison misleading. Chicago saw a period of population growth in the 1990s due in large part to a substantial increase in immigrants, largely from Mexico. With that increase in immigration came an influx of students into CPS, said Chicago demographer Rob Paral. ""The stuff going on demographically today is quite different than the forces that were in play in the â90s,"" he said. ""Chicago was a huge magnet for all that â90s immigration."" In the years after Vallas left CPS, the immigrant population of the city stopped growing and the African-American population began a significant decline. Minority students make up about 90 percent of CPS enrollment, so the changing demographics had a significant impact at the schools. Vallas said, ""I took over the school district when it had a $1 billion structural deficit and left them with $1 billion in cash and 70,000 more students than they have today."" The bond rating and bottom line at CPS did improve significantly under Vallas, but new laws passed in Springfield also removed fiscal handcuffs which gave him more flexibility to manage the districtâs finances than his predecessors enjoyed. And he is correct that CPS has nearly 70,000 fewer students today than in 2001 when he departed. But that is due at least in part to significant demographic changes in Chicago outside the control of any schools chief. His claim is accurate but requires additional information to understand the context. We rate it Mostly True.

No, Mexico isn't paying for border wall through USMCA trade deal, despite Donald Trump's claims
","President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that Mexico would pay for a border wall, yet stands firm on his call to U.S. lawmakers to provide money to construct it. All while also claiming that Mexico is already paying for the barrier. ""Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!"" Trump tweeted Jan. 2. Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback! The U.S. government is in a partial shutdown as Trump and Democrats are at odds over the appropriation of taxpayers funds to pay for the wallâs construction. Trump said that without money for the wall, thereâs no deal to reopen the government. Barriers in the form of fencing have gone up at the southwest border. But the wall Trump promised is not up. The question here is: Is Mexico paying for the wall through a renegotiated trade deal, as Trump claimed? No, trade experts say. There are a couple of immediate problems with Trumpâs statement. First, the renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement is not in effect yet. Trump rebranded the updated NAFTA as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but it still needs congressional approval. And the deal, literally, does not include any language saying Mexico will pay the United States for the wall. In addition, U.S.-Mexico trade has been duty free for more than a decade, and the renegotiated trade deal does not add new tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to the United States, said Lori Wallach, director at Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. ""I do not see any scenario under which the U.S. government gets more money from Mexico per se â and even if the U.S. tariffs had been raised, that would be paid by Mexican exporters not the Mexican government,"" Wallach said. Back on the campaign trail, Trump claimed that Mexico can afford to build a wall because Mexico's trade surplusÂ with America is billions of dollars. We rated that False as trade experts said there is no connection between the size of the trade deficit and finding money to build the wall. The trade deficit is based mostly on trading and investment by private individuals and companies â not the government itself, an expert then told us. Trumpâs latest claim hinges on changes negotiated for NAFTA by the three parties involved in the trade agreement â the United States, Mexico and Canada. As weâve already said, the renegotiated version of the trade agreement is not in effect yet. It has to clear several logistical hurdles and be approved by the legislative bodies of all three countries. If approved, it would likely take effect around 2020. Until then, NAFTA remains in place. (Trump also could choose to pull the United States out of NAFTA.) Among other things, the renegotiated deal increases the United Statesâ reach into Canadian milk and pharmaceutical markets, bolsters labor and environmental rights and broadens protections over intellectual property. It also aims to substantially increase the share of car and truck parts made in North America. It raises the proportion of North American parts and inputs that must be used in a car for it to qualify for duty-free treatment. Is there any provision in the agreement that would indirectly have money flow from the Mexican government to the U.S. government â and that money be designated for border security, specifically a wall? ""No,"" Wallach told us. ""Trade agreements do not really have terms that have one government pay another or otherwise transfer funds."" Trump has previously claimed that the new trade deal will pay for the wall, and reporters questioned White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders about it during a Dec. 18 press briefing. (The White House did not respond to PolitiFactâs request for comment.) The presidentâs positions is that ""additional revenue through that deal that would show that Mexico was paying for the wall,"" Sanders said in December. After a reporter noted that the trade benefits go to private citizens, not the U.S. treasury, Sanders said Trump was talking about the general revenue that comes from that. ""So you're going to tax?"" the reporter asked. No, Sanders responded. In a Dec. 18 post contributed to Forbes, Phil Levy, who served as a senior economist for trade for President George W. Bushâs Council of Economic Advisers, wrote that if automakers chose not to increase the North American content percentage for cars (as required by the new deal for it to be tariff-free), then there would be a tariff for imports from outside the North America trading bloc. But even in that case, that revenue from tariffs would not be earmarked for the wall, wrote Levy, a senior fellow on the global economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, who also teaches international business strategy at Northwestern Universityâs Kellogg School of Management. Also, still pending is an assessment from the U.S. International Trade Commission on the new dealâs economic impact. In a scenario where private American businesses significantly increase their revenue under the new deal, and overall U.S. tax revenues increase, then Congress might have those funds to appropriate, Wallach noted. But even then, lawmakers would have to agree to specifically allocate those funds for the wall. That seems dubious, given the ongoing government shutdown over border wall funding. ""I guess Trump could propose a new tax on increased revenue of U.S. firms related to trade with Mexico, but that is not passing through Congress,"" Wallach said. ""If they cannot get appropriations for a wall, imagine trying to pass a new tax to fund the wall."" Trump claimed, ""Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal."" USMCA is the name for the renegotiated NAFTA. USMCA is not in effect yet. Even then, there is no provision in the free trade agreement about Mexico directly paying for the wall. The new USMCA deal does not add new tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to the United States, an expert told us. Itâs unclear how the deal will impact U.S. businesses revenues. If U.S. tax revenue increases in response to increased revenues of U.S. firms, then Congress would still have to allocate that money for the wall. Thatâs questionable. Trumpâs claim lacks supporting evidence. We rate it False.","[('Twitter, @realdonaldtrump tweet, Jan. 2, 2019; tweet, Dec. 13, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1080457560291987457'), (""Forbes, Can The New NAFTA Pay For Trump's Wall?, Dec. 18, 2018"", 'No link'), ('Piie.org, The United StatesâMexicoâCanada Agreement: Overview and Outlook By Gary Hufbauer and Steven Globerman, November 2018', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2018/12/18/can-the-new-nafta-pay-for-trumps-wall/#6e897168ee10'), (""Email interview, Lori Wallach, director at Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, Jan. 3, 2018"", 'No link'), ('Email interview, Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics, Jan. 3, 2018', 'https://piie.com/system/files/documents/hufbauer201811-usmca.pdf'), ('PolitiFact Florida, Donald Trump says of course Mexico can pay for wall -- because of the trade deficit, Jan. 26, 2016', 'No link'), (""PolitiFact, Donald Trump's new NAFTA: A fact-checker's guide to the trade deal, Oct. 1, 2018"", 'https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jan/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-course-mexico-can-pay-wall-becau/'), ('CQ transcript, White House Holds News Briefing, as Released by the White House, Dec. 18, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/jan/04/donald-trump/no-usmca-trade-deal-wont-pay-border-wall-despite-d/

Has the Trump administration spent only 6 percent of border money?
","Has the Trump administration spent just 6 percent of the money allocated by Congress for border upgrades? As the parties battle over border funding â the fight that prompted the government shutdown that began Dec. 22, 2018 â the 6 percent figure has become a Democratic talking point. ""There are a million reasons why $5B for a wall is a ludicrous demand to shut down the government over,"" tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on Dec. 23. ""But hereâs maybe the best one: the 2017/2018 budgets gave Trump billions for border upgrades. Heâs spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. How about spending the money you have first?"" There are a million reasons why $5B for a wall is a ludicrous demand to shut down the government over.But hereâs maybe the best one: the 2017/2018 budgets gave Trump billions for border upgrades. Heâs spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. How about spending the money you have first? However, the 6 percent figure isnât the only way to look at this question â nor is it necessarily the best one, experts say. The accuracy of Murphyâs statement boils down to how to measure federal outlays. When Congress passes spending bills, it gives that money to a federal agency. The agency, in turn, does the preparatory work to get a particular project accomplished. So do you count it only when a check is cut to a vendor? Or do you measure it when the money is obligated for a specific use -- by signing a contract, for instance? As it turns out, the choice of measurement makes a big difference. The 6 percent figure first emerged from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee. (Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded his statement Three Pinocchios.) Leahyâs minority staff issued a news release Dec. 10 that said in part, ""Over the last two years, Congress has provided nearly $1.7 billion to build or replace fencing on the southern border, but the administration has hardly spent any of that money, and the projects it has undertaken have ballooned in cost. So far, only 6 percent of those funds have been spent. Six."" (For emphasis, the news release put ""Six"" in bold type.) According to the committee, Customs and Border Protection reported in late November that the total enacted funds for this purpose in 2017 and 2018 were $1,716,066,065. Of that, $1,602,675,723 was obligated, and $108,695,342 was formally spent. So, expenditures did amount to about 6 percent of the funds that Congress enacted, as Leahyâs news release said. But if you use the other data point, about 93 percent of those funds were obligated. Consider this analogy: You go to the dry cleaners and bring in a couple of suits. By handing over the suits to the cleaner, youâve committed to paying the cost, even if you havenât forked over the money yet. Steve Ellis, a veteran federal budget expert with the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact that obligations are a better measurement with construction funds. That doesnât mean you should run with the 93 percent number, either. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman told PolitiFact that 60 percent of the funds have gone so far as to reach the ""contract award"" stage. This means that ""a vendor begins work on the border wall, beginning with design and followed by construction,"" said spokesman Andrew Meehan. Expenditures happen at a later stage, when a contractor bills the government after the work has been completed, he said. Hereâs a breakdown of the projects, according to the agency: â¢ The fiscal year 2017 enacted appropriations provided $341 million to construct 40 miles of replacement primary pedestrian wall and vehicle barriers in multiple locations across the southwest border. So far, the Army Corps of Engineers has placed nearly $300 million on contracts, and as of Dec. 21, 2018, had completed work on 35 of those 40 miles. â¢ The fiscal year 2018 enacted appropriations provided $1.375 billion to construct about 82 miles of new and replacement border barriers in multiple locations across the southwest border. Between March and July 2018, approximately $1.2 billion had been obligated to the Army Corps of Engineers for construction, real estate acquisition, and program management. And by Dec. 31, 2018, the Corps had a little less than $700 million under contract for construction of new and replacement wall system in the Rio Grande Valley, Tucson, Yuma, El Centro and San Diego sectors. An additional $300 million or so is ready to award when the government reopens. Leahyâs office stood by its initial 6 percent calculation, telling PolitiFact, ""The fact is that as of the end of November, only 6 percent of the funds appropriated by Congress for physical barriers along the southern border over the last two years has actually been spent."" Murphyâs office also stood by Leahyâs calculation. Murphy tweeted, ""The 2017/2018 budgets gave (President Donald) Trump billions for border upgrades. Heâs spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%."" This is a misleading talking point that makes it sound as if Trumpâs administration is dawdling on the border wall at the center of the government funding dispute. The 6 percent figure refers to actual checks that have been cut. But at this early stage of a multi-year construction project, the more relevant figure is how much money has been committed under contract. Thatâs about 60 percent â 10 times the figure that Murphy and other Democrats have used. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.","[('Chris Murphy, tweet, Dec. 23, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1076842956399824896'), ('Senate Appropriations Committee minority, ""Statement of Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)

Would retail marijuana drive up roadway deaths in Vermont?
","Last month Tom Anderson, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety, said at a public hearing that the state should not move forward with a recreational market for cannabis until police have access to roadside saliva tests.Â  Anderson said roadside testing for cannabis impairment is necessary because if Vermont legalizes a market for cannabis, it will see an increase in impaired driving and roadway deaths. The saliva tests would enable police to determine when drivers have the drug in their system.Â ""If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up,"" Anderson said. A number of readers told us Anderson was off the mark. So we decided to find out: Have legal recreational cannabis markets in Colorado and Washington led to a rise in roadway deaths and impaired driving rates?Â  We reached out to the Department of Public Safety and asked for sources backing up the commissioner's claim.Â  In response, the department sent seven sources -- including five studies and two news articles from theÂ Denver Post and the Bellingham Herald. The sources all show that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased since cannabis was legalized.Â  However, even that data is contradictory. None of the sources have proven the increase was caused by the legalization of recreational cannabis markets alone, which was the point that Anderson seemed to be making. Â  Itâs also important to note that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists. At this point, law enforcement typically use blood tests to determine whether drivers have THC in their system. The drug, however, can remain in someoneâs blood for weeks, making it difficult to determine the time at which someone is actually under the influence.Â  Recreational cannabis has been legal in Washington and Colorado since 2012. Recreational stores opened in 2014. A study by the Foundation for Traffic Safety reported in 2016 that an estimated 303 drivers â 10 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes in Washington between 2010 and 2014 â had detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, in their blood at or shortly after the time of a crash. The number of drivers who tested positive for THC remained steady before and immediately after legalization took effect, according to the study. But researchers found that about nine months after cannabis was legally available for purchase, the number of drugged driving citations began increasing at a rate of almost 10 percentage points per year. It is unclear whether the increase was caused by the legalization of cannabis or by factors ""that were beyond the scope of the study.""Â  A study by the Colorado Department of Transportation published in August 2018 reported that overall, the number of fatalities involving drivers who tested positive for cannabis has nearly doubled since recreational legalization in 2014 -- from 75 that year to 125 in 2016 and 139 in 2017. However, in spite of cannabis-related driving fatalities going up, in the first quarter of 2017, the number of cannabis-related DUIs dropped by 33 percent from the same period in 2016, according to Colorado State Patrol. From January until March in 2017, 155 people received citations for cannabis impairment while driving, compared to 232 people in 2016.Â  The Colorado study does not point to legalization as the cause of the increase in cannabis impaired driving.Â  Another study last year, conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon, explicitly stated that the argument that legal cannabis has led to a spike in traffic deaths and impaired driving is misleading. The upward trend in cannabis-related fatalities in Colorado, and to some extent in Washington, would have taken place whether or not recreational cannabis was legalized, the authors say.Â  Some research clearly supports the claim that traffic accidents are on the rise in states that have legalized cannabis, but the reason behind why it is happening remains unclear to researchers. A study released in October by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), estimated that the rate of car crashes rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational cannabis in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Based on our research, Andersonâs statement that roadway deaths and impaired driving rates have gone up in Washington and Colorado is correct. But his implication that a legal recreational cannabis market is responsible for the uptick in impaired driving and traffic deaths has not been proven.Â  While the studies do not prove that legal recreational cannabis markets are the cause of impaired driving and traffic death increases in Colorado or Washington, it does serve as a ""solid indicator"" that cannabis can impact driver safety.Â  We rule Andersonâs statement is Half True.","[('VTDigger, ""Roadside testing, edibles debated in final public meeting of marijuana commission,"" December 13, 2018.', 'https://vtdigger.org/2018/12/13/roadside-testing-edibles-debated-final-public-meeting-marijuana-commission/'), ('Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area report, ""The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact, Volume 5,"" September, 2018.', 'No link'), ('The Denver Post, ""Traffic fatalities linked to marijuana are up sharply in Colorado.

Did Hillary Clinton in 2014 say migrant children should be sent back to their countries?
","A viral Facebook video claims that Hillary Clinton in 2014 said children arriving at the border should be sent back to their countries. The video is legitimate, and Clinton did make the remarks during a 2014 CNN interview. The 31-second clip has at least 13 million views on Facebook. It continues to be shared amid the ongoing national dialogue about separations of migrant families arriving at the border. The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video has a static headline that says: ""Hillary on child aliens in 2014: Send them back."" As the clip plays, a transcript of Clintonâs remarks is shown at the bottom of the video. The transcript highlights these particular lines: ""But we have to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay."" The clip comes from a June 17, 2014, CNN town hall called ""Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices,"" hosted by Christiane Amanpour. Amanpour asked Clinton, who had recently served as secretary of state during the Obama administration, if the thousands of children coming across the border alone (without their parents) should be allowed to stay in the United States or be sent back to their countries. The number of unaccompanied children arriving at the southern U.S. border peaked in 2014. Itâs important to note that Clintonâs remarks are not about family separations, a detail that may not be evident based on the trimmed clip circulating on Facebook. Hereâs the context: Clinton: ""Well, two quick points. One, the numbers are increasing dramatically. And the main reason I believe why that's happening is that the violence in certain of those Central American countries is increasing dramatically. And there is not sufficient law enforcement or will on the part of the governments of those countries to try to deal with this exponential increase in violence, drug trafficking, the drug cartels, and many children are fleeing from that violence. Amanpour: ""Should they be able to stay here? It's safer."" Clinton: ""Well -- it may be safer but that's not the answer. I do not --"" Amanpour: ""Should they be sent back?"" Clinton: ""Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide. We have children 5 and 6 years old who have come up from Central America. We need to do more to provide border security in southern Mexico."" Amanpour: ""So, you're saying they should be sent back now?"" Clinton: ""Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns about whether all of them can be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. And just as Vice President (Joe) Biden is arguing today in Central America, we've got to do more. I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence in this region to deal with border security. ""But we have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So, we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey."" So, speaking about children arriving alone at the border, Clinton said children who can be sent back, should be sent. Clinton noted that not all children could be returned to their home countries. Text for a video circulating on Facebook claims, ""Hillary on child aliens in 2014: Send them back."" Clinton during a 2014 CNN interview responded to a question about children arriving at the border. At the time, there was a surge of children arriving alone, without their parents. Clinton said that children should be sent back to responsible adults in their home countries, but noted that there were concerns about the plausibility of sending all of them back.

No, Hillary Clinton in 2013 did not say Donald Trump was honest, should run for office
","Thereâs no evidence that Hillary Clinton once said sheâd like to see ""people like Donald Trump run for office."" The widely debunked claim features a picture of Clinton standing next to Trump. Below the image is text that says, ""Hillary Clinton in 2013: âI would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; Theyâre honest and canât be bought.â "" Clinton did not say that.

The picture associated with the claim is from Donald and Melania Trumpâs 2005 wedding reception, which Clinton attended. The quote is a spinoff from a speech Clinton reportedly gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013. A transcript of the alleged speech was published by WikiLeaks, as it released emails stolen from John Podesta, Clintonâs 2016 presidential campaign manager. NPR reported in 2016 that the Clinton campaign refused to verify the documentsâ authenticity. Clinton, according to the Wikileaks transcript for that 2013 Goldman Sachs speech, was asked whether a ""wholesale change"" was needed in Washington in terms of people running for office. Clintonâs response: ""That's a really interesting question. You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office. I really would like to see that because I do think, you know, you don't have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom. And there's that memorable phrase from a former member of the Senate: You can be maybe rented but never bought."" The transcript doesnât say that Clinton specifically mentioned Trump by name.

No, 18 children didn't die in U.S. border protection custody under Obama
","The Trump administrationâs immigration policies have received even more scrutiny after an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy died while in U.S. border protection custody on Christmas Eve. He was the second migrant child to die in U.S. custody within a month. Some of President Donald Trumpâs supporters are lashing back at the criticism, pointing to migrant children deaths that supposedly occurred under the Obama administration. One meme, which has been shared more than 12,000 times on Facebook, claims that ""18 children died while in custody of border patrol"" during the Obama administration. ""Where was the media outrage then?"", it asks. The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence to suggest that 18 children died in U.S. custody at the border during Obamaâs two presidential terms. Following the boyâs death on Christmas Eve, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen released a statement, saying a ""dramatic increase"" in illegal border activity had pushed the immigration system ""to a breaking point."" In the statement, Nielsen also stated itâs been over 10 years since a child died in U.S. border security custody. ""To put this in perspective, there were six migrant deaths while in CBP (Customs Border Protection) custody during (fiscal year) 2018 â none whom were children,"" Nielsen said. ""In fact, it has been more than a decade since CBP has had a child pass away in their custody."" The number seems to come from a story by the conservative Daily Caller website, which reported that 18 adult detainees died in U.S. custody during the Obama years. The Daily Caller article acknowledges the detainees were adults between the ages of 24 and 49 years old, citing a 2016 report by Human Rights Watch, an international organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights. The report analyzed death reviews released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in June 2016. It also said that ICE had confirmed 31 detainee deaths since May 2012, but only released reviews for 18 at the time. Those reviews cover the deaths of 18 adults at 13 facilities between 2012 and 2015. Those who died included citizens of Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, Canada, Honduras, Jamaica, Antigua-Barbuda, and the Republic of Mozambique. Human Rights Watch also referenced an ACLU report that investigated another eight in-custody deaths, all of which were adults, that took place from 2010 to 2012. ""I had not realized the (Human Rights Watch)Â report was a possible 'source' for this claim, since it focused on adults,"" said Michael Bochenek, senior counsel for the organization's Childrenâs Rights Division. ""I can confirm that we have published no other report in which we documented the deaths of children while in immigration detention, and I have no reason to doubt the DHS Secretaryâs statement that these are the first such deaths in many years."" A meme on Facebook says that ""18 children died in U.S. custody at the border"" when Obama served as president. We were unable to find any documentation that supports the claim that any children died in U.S. custody at the border during the Obama administration. Trump's Homeland Security secretary also said that until the two recent deaths, it had been over a decade since a child died in custody at the border. The claim seems to have started by articles that re-circulatied a 2016 human rights watchdog report that analyzed the deaths of 18 adult detainees between 2012 and 2015.

Obama 2013 and Trump 2018. Are the shutdowns the same? Not exactly
","With no quick end to the recent federal government shutdown in sight, a Facebook post harking back to a 2013 shutdown under President Barack Obama has been shared over 71,000 times. The Dec. 22 post from Trump-backer Kristy Greczkowski said, ""Oct 2013, Obama shut down the government for 16 days to force Obamacare. A friendly reminder America. Secure our borders."" The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We thought weâd compare the two fiscal impasses. In September 2013, two issues were in play, the Affordable Care Act and raising the debt ceiling ââ the legal amount the government is allowed to borrow. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, was due to begin in earnest in 2014. The individual mandate requiring people to have insurance would come into force. Coverage would start for Americans who signed up through government insurance marketplaces (although the meltdown of the Â federal Healthcare.gov website was about to throw that step into chaos). Republicans, primarily in the House, aimed to defund Obamacare. None of the 12 regular appropriation bills to pay for government operations had been passed. A group of 80 House Republicans signed a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying this was the time to eliminate any dollars that would allow Obamacare to move forward. Before the shutdown, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned that a shutdown would be a bad idea and in any event wouldnât block most of Obamacare from moving forward. We rated that claim Mostly True. Most key parts of the law â the insurance marketplace, the premium subsidies, and the taxes and regulations âÂ would continue unimpeded. But if Obamacare was one rallying cry, the debt ceiling turned out to be just as important. The government was closing in on the legal limit of $16.699 trillion in debt. Without the flexibility to borrow more, Washington faced the prospect of not being able to pay back Treasury notes as they came due. Republicans wanted broader spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt limit. At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and Democrats held the Senate. Obama had said he would veto any bill that defunded Obamacare. His veto threat and the Democratic-controlled Senate doomed any measure that undermined the fledgling health care program. The House passed several bills that eliminated Obamacare funding, and the Senate kept stripping out those provisions. The government shutdown began on Oct. 1. On Oct. 15, the rating agency Fitch said the U.S. governmentâs credit worthiness would be reviewed. A downgrade would have dramatically increased borrowing costs. On Oct. 16, Senate Democrats and Republicans came to terms, agreeing to raise the debt ceiling and keep government open through mid December. Obamacare funding was untouched. The latest shutdown stems from President Trumpâs desire for $5 billion to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The Republican-controlled Senate declined to make that part of its funding plan because it couldn't get the needed 60 votes to eventually pass the spending plan. The House passed a measure with money for the wall. The wall appears to be the only significant element that separates the sides. A Facebook post said that Obama shut down the government in 2013 to force Obamacare. There are a couple of key differences between then and today. First, leading Republicans, including Ryan, noted that Obamacare largely would move forward even if some elements were defunded. In that sense, Obama was not fighting to ""force"" Obamacare, because he didnât need to. Second, in 2013, two issues, Obamacare and the debt ceiling, were on the table. In 2018, funding for the wall stands alone. In 2013, a compromise on the debt ceiling cleared the way to reopen the government. There is also a legal difference. In 2013, Obamacare was already law. Funding for the wall is not. The situation in 2013 was more complicated than today. Obama, like Trump, aimed to protect a favored policy. But he also wanted to raise the debt limit, an issue of at least equal importance. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Kristy Greczkowski, Facebook post, Dec. 22, 2018', 'https://www.facebook.com/kristy.greczowski/posts/985226278331582'), ('Congressional Research Service, Shutdown of the Federal Government: Causes, Processes, and Effects, Dec. 10, 2018', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, The Debt Limit: History and Recent Increases, Nov. 2, 2015', 'https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34680.pdf'), ('Reuters, Obama says he will not negotiate with Congress on debt ceiling, Sept. 16, 2013', 'No link'), (""Reuters, Fitch Places United States' 'AAA' on Rating Watch Negative, Oct. 15, 2013"", 'https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31967.pdf'), ('NPR, How We Got Here: A Shutdown Timeline, Oct. 17, 2013', 'No link'), (""PolitiFact, Paul Ryan says government shutdown wouldn't sideline Obamacare, Aug. 8, 2013"", 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-obama/obama-says-he-will-not-negotiate-with-congress-on-debt-ceiling-idUSBRE98F0OA20130916')]",/factchecks/2019/jan/02/blog-posting/obama-2013-and-trump-2018-are-shutdowns-same/

Trump wrong on size and timing of military pay increases
","During a holiday visit to troops stationed in Iraq, President Donald Trump bragged that he had secured them not only their first pay raise in over a decade, but ""one of the biggest"" ever. This is inaccurate and not the first time Trump has made false claims about annual military raises. His full remarks: ""..you just got one of the biggest pay raises youâve ever received ... You havenât gotten one in more than 10 years â more than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one. ""They had plenty of people that came up. They said, âYou know, we could make it smaller. We could make it 3 percent. We could make it 2 percent. We could make it 4 percent.â I said, âNo. Â Make it 10 percent. Make it more than 10 percent.â Because itâs been a long time. Itâs been more than 10 years. Itâs been more than 10 years."" We fact-checked a similar claim from Trump in May, when he told military mothers and spouses at a White House event that he signed a bill to give service members a raise for the ""first time in 10 years."" We rated it Pants on Fire. In reality, service members have received pay raises every year for more than three decades. The 2019 military pay increase of 2.6 percent is the largest in nine years, but it is not the ""more than 10 percent"" that Trump mentioned. The 2.6 percent increase military members will receive in 2019 is the biggest since 2010, but there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.4 percent. We previously reported that the last time service members didnât receive an annual pay increase was in 1983, but that was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the governmentâs fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year. Beyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase. Trumpâs remarks imply that the raise was more thanÂ ""10 percent,"" but that's not right, either. Military pay increases are determined by a statutory formula mandated by federal law â the raises must be equal to increases in the Employment Cost Index, or ECI. According to an April 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service, ""the president can specify an alternative pay adjustment that supersedes the automatic adjustment,"" and ""Congress can pass legislation to specify the annual pay raise, which would supersede the automatic adjustment and/or any presidential adjustment if it were enacted."" In fact, while the 2.4 percent increase for 2018 was the largest in eight years, Trump actually requested 2.1 percent, ""an amount below the automatic adjustment (of 2.4 percent) for 2018."" Congress ultimately overrode the administrationâs proposal. For 2019, the CRS reported that Trump requested 2.6 percent, which is a raise equal to the ECI, and one that the presidentâs 2019 budget called ""modest."" On his first trip to a war zone as president, Trump told service members that he got them ""one of the largest"" pay increases everÂ and said they hadnât received a raise in over 10 years. Thatâs wrong. Service members have received pay increases every year, as mandated by federal law, for over three decades and the 2019 increase is set at 2.6 percent. Even if Trump meant that members hadnât received that large of a raise in over a decade, that would also be false. The increase is exceeded by raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('Donald Trump, remarks to troops at Al Asad Air Base, Dec. 26, 2018', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-troops-al-asad-air-base-al-anbar-province-iraq/'), ('Defense.gov, ""Annual Military Pay Adjustment,"" Accessed Dec. 27, 2018', 'No link'), ('CNN, ""Trump misleads about military pay raises again,"" Dec. 26, 2018', 'https://militarypay.defense.gov/Pay/Basic-Pay/AnnualPayRaise/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Did Donald Trump sign the first military pay raise in 10 years?,"" May 10, 2018', 'No link'), ('FactCheck.org, ""The President and Military Pay Raises,"" May 10, 2018', 'https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/26/politics/trump-misleads-military-pay-raise-again/index.html'), ('Congressional Research Service, Military Pay: Key Questions and Answers, Accessed Dec. 27, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/dec/27/donald-trump/trump-military-pay-increases-wrong-size-timing/

Did police shootings plunge under McCarthyâs leadership?
","The public revelation of Laquan McDonaldâs shooting death at the hands of Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke rocked Chicago and cost then-police Superintendent Garry McCarthy his job. The late-2015 court-ordered release of video footage from a year earlier showing the white officer shooting the black teenager 16 times ignited protests over police treatment and calls for reform. Three years later, McCarthy, now running for mayor, is still defending his record from that era. ""As superintendent using the plan that we put together in Chicago, we were able to reduce crime by almost 40 percent over the almost five years that I was the superintendent,"" McCarthy told a crowd during a recent City Club speech before trotting out several other statistics from his time on the job. ""But the one that nobody seems to know is that there was almost a 70 percent reduction in police-related shootings under my tenure because of training, supervision and policy decisions. Almost 70 percent reduction in police shootings. But one shooting obviously blew up the world here."" We didnât know that for a fact, although weâd heard McCarthy make the claim before, so we decided to check it out. As he criss-crosses the city campaigning for mayor, McCarthy is clearly trying to blunt criticism he oversaw a police department that treated minorities unfairly. His argument about police shootings has become one of his talking points on the stump to try to upend what heâs previously described as the ""revisionist history"" that evolved surrounding him, the McDonald case and his oversight of the department. But McCarthyâs recent statement backing up that argument is less than clear. For one thing, he didnât specify the time period he was comparing his record against. Was it the single year before he arrived at police headquarters in 2011 or several years prior? And was he only comparing those stats to the tally for 2015, his final year on the job, or more than that? A spokesman for McCarthy didnât help clear up that issue. He told us only that his candidate had drawn his figures from a statistical analysis conducted by the police department itself, but provided no details on how McCarthy did his math or even where to find that report. So we turned to statistics reported by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which is a city agency that reviews allegations of misconduct against Chicago officers. Those reports list the number of notifications the agency has received from CPD of officers striking an individual after firing a gun. No matter how we crunched those numbers, the results generally supported the first beat of McCarthyâs claim. While the decrease didnât quite approach 70 percent, officer-related shootings did fall substantially during his time as the cityâs top cop. The number of police shootings that occurred during McCarthyâs final year on the job was 57 percent lower than it was in the 12 months before he took the post. When we broadened the range to compare his last two years with the two years preceding to his tenure, we saw a smaller but still significant decline of 38 percent. That data has a few limitations. Officer suicides may be included in the tallies, for instance. And the sample size itself is so small that a slight uptick or downturn can cause the percentage change to fluctuate substantially. The figures are also reported on a quarterly basis. Since current Mayor Rahm Emanuel ousted McCarthy on Dec. 1, 2015, we turned to the Chicago Tribune, which assembled its own database of police shootings between 2010 through 2015, to find out how many shootings occurred at the end of the year after McCarthyâs departure. Itâs worth noting that when we compared the number of shootings in McCarthyâs last year with those in the 12 months prior to him taking the job using the more comprehensive Tribune data, we got slightly more muted results: a 51 percent decrease, compared to the 57 percent result we got with the COPA numbers. The second beat of McCarthyâs claim â that the decrease can be chalked up to decisions made under his leadership â stands on shakier ground. For one thing, much of the decline under McCarthy took place in his final year, between 2014 and 2015. Police shootings have continued to fall since McCarthy left, suggesting greater forces may have been at play than McCarthyâs leadership alone. ""Thereâs an old adage that success has a thousand fathers,"" said Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and an expert on police accountability. ""Everybodyâs going to want to chime in and make claims â¦ something they did was responsible for this decline."" But the myriad factors affecting officers â both within the department and on the streets â are ""hugely complex,"" Walker cautioned, making it practically impossible to single out any one among them. Walker also pointed to the continued decline of violent crime in large cities in recent years, which can translate into fewer robberies and similar altercations that put officers in situations where they might be more likely to fire a weapon. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation backs that up. Nationally, the reported number of fatal shootings by officers â ""justifiable homicides,"" in FBI parlance â has fallen fairly steadily since 2013. McCarthy said, ""there was almost a 70 percent reduction in police-related shootings under my tenure because of training, supervision and policy decisions."" Heâs correct that a significant decline did occur on his watch, according to city figures, although the decrease was a bit smaller than he claimed. Experts, however, cast doubt on whether McCarthy could take credit for the decline, saying itâs virtually impossible to peg it to a single cause. And national crime data suggest Chicagoâs drop in police shootings could be part of a larger downward trend.

NC GOP leader mostly right about the lack of protests in the election fraud investigation
","The North Carolina Republican Party has urged the state elections board to certify the results of a congressional race that are under investigation. The N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement cited voting irregularities on Nov. 30 when it declined to declare Republican Mark Harris as victor over Democrat Dan McCready. Harris has about 905 more votes, according to unofficial results posted on the board website. The investigation is ongoing. In the meantime, the N.C. Republican Party has called on the board to certify the race results. The board should seat Harris while it investigates, NCGOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse has said. ""There are two different issues here. The horrific lack of transparency by the majority board members ofÂ @NCSBE,"" WoodhouseÂ tweetedÂ on Dec. 8, referring to the state elections board. ""With not one election protest filed, the candidate declining to call for a recount, the candidate conceding the race, and every local board of elections certifying the race,"" HeÂ added: ""Any political party with no public allegations would lose their damn minds over a board not certifying a race which was not in dispute at the time and not telling anybody why."" PolitiFact has previously reviewed his last point about the boardâs actions and found itÂ isnât true. For this fact-check, weâre going to examine his points that no elections protest was filed, McCready conceded and ""every"" county board certified its results. No protests, early concession No official election protest was filed in the Harris-McCready race, according to elections board spokesman Pat Gannon. UnderÂ state law, protests can be filed by any candidate or registered voter whoâs concerned about the validity of an election, and those protests can trigger investigations. Because Harris and McCready are separated by less than 1 percent of the vote, McCready was entitled to call for a recount. But he didnât. He conceded the race the day after the election, theÂ Charlotte Observer reported, only to renounce his concession on Dec. 6 after more irregularities came to light. As for Woodhouseâs claim that ""every local board of elections"" certified the Harris-McCready race results, the facts are more complicated than that. When PolitiFact asked the state elections board whether county boards had certified results in the Harris-McCready race, Gannon referred us to a Dec. 17 press release. The release provides details about an evidentiary hearing scheduled for Jan. 11. It says ""The proceedings affect the final certification of results in four contests in the 2018 general election: (1) U.S. Representative for North Carolinaâs Ninth Congressional District; (2) Seat 2 on the District Court in Judicial District 16B; (3) Bladen County Commissioner District 3; and (4) Bladen Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor (together, the ""Contests"")."" Josh Lawson, general counsel for the state elections board, said in an email that the board ""did not certify all races in Bladen, and that we withheld certification in any contest where the apparent margin of victory represented fewer votes than those under review by our Agency."" In Bladen, for instance, ""our Board ordered them to withhold their certificates,"" Lawson said. So at least one county board didnât certify, contrary to what Woodhouse said.Â Itâs unclear whether county boards wouldâve certified their results without intervention from the state board. But that question is moot. Irrelevant points Gannon, the elections board spokesman, referenced theÂ state lawÂ that guides elections investigations. The law says: ""The State Board may consider protests that were not filed in compliance with G.S. 163A-1177, may initiate and consider complaints on its own motion, may intervene and take jurisdiction over protests pending before a county board, and may take any other action necessary to assure that an election is determined without taint of fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of an election."" In other words, state law allows the N.C. elections board to launch investigations: âªÂ Even if a protest hasnât been filed, âªÂ Even if the candidate conceded, and âªÂ Even if the county elections board certified the same ballots that the state board wants to investigate. Our ruling Woodhouse tweeted that no elections protest was filed, McCready conceded and ""every"" county board certified its results in North Carolinaâs 9th Congressional District. Heâs right that no protest was filed and that McCready conceded â albeit before concerns of voting irregularities arose. But heâs not quite accurate about the results being certified. Itâs important to note that when it comes to the state election boardâs investigation, none of Woodhouseâs claims are relevant. State law doesnât require the board to consider any of those points. However, his statement meetsÂ PolitiFact criteriaÂ for Mostly True.

Donald Trump claims Russia is 'not happy' U.S. troops are leaving Syria. That isn't true
","President Donald Trump is facing backlash from Democrats and some members of his own political party after saying he will pull U.S. troops out of Syria, despite the ongoing fight in the region against terrorism. The decision is a ""premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States, but also emboldens ISIS, Bashar al Assad, Iran, and Russia,"" said a letter to Trump signed by six U.S. senators, including four Republicans. Trump on Twitter claimed that his move didnât favor Russia. After tweeting comments from TV pundits and Republican senators who praised his plan, Trump tweeted Dec. 20: ""Getting out of Syria was no surprise. Iâve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria & others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there (sic) work. Time to come home & rebuild. #MAGA ""Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight..... ""....Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us. I am building by far the most powerful military in the world. ISIS hits us they are doomed!"" We wondered about Trumpâs claim that several nations, particularly Russia, were ""not happy about the U.S. leaving."" Comments from Russian President Vladimir Putin and others contradict Trumpâs assertion. The White House did not respond to PolitiFactâs requests for evidence backing Trumpâs claim. A civil war started in Syria in 2011, after uprisings against President Bashar al-Assad. The conflict escalated and became more complicated, as different groups within the country and foreign countries â not to mention terrorist groups â got involved. In the complex struggle for power, Russia and Iran back the Syrian government. The United States supports opposition groups. The United States has long accused the Syrian government of atrocities against its own people, including a chemical weapons attack in April 2017 that killed more than 80 people. The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria supporting Syrian Kurds fighting the Islamic State terrorist group. Trump claimed via a tweet that ISIS had been defeated in Syria, and so U.S. troops no longer needed to be there. The senators who objected to Trumpâs decision disagreed with his assessment about ISIS. Signatories include Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who have supported him in other policy goals. ""While you believe the threat of ISIS has dissipated, the conditions of the ground paint a very different picture,"" the letter said. The senators added that the United Statesâ departure from Syria could embolden Assad ""to take further actions to solidify his power,"" and that Iran and Russia had used the Syrian conflict to ""magnify their influence in the region."" So is Putin unhappy about this? Quite the opposite. At an annual press conference on Dec. 20, Putin said he agreed with Trumpâs claim that ISIS had been defeated. Putin said he did not think the presence of American troops was required in Syria. He argued that U.S. presence there was illegitimate because it was not approved by a United Nations Security Council resolution, and because the Syrian government did not invite the United States into its country. ""Russian troops were invited by the Syrian Government,"" Putin said, according to the transcript posted on the Kremlin website. ""The United States did not get either of these so if they decide to withdraw their troops, it is the right decision."" Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, on Dec. 19 also welcomed Trumpâs decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. ""A milestone story which might evolve from this decision is a real prospect for a political solution,"" TASS Russian News Agency reported Zakharova as saying to another Russian news channel. ""Hope emerges that this location on the Syrian map will follow the example of Aleppo and other Syrian towns and villages which begin getting back to peaceful life,"" Zakharova is quoted as saying. ""Once Americans were there, there was no such hope."" The Center for Strategic and International Studies, which focuses on international public policy issues, said in a Q&A post about Trumpâs decision that throughout the conflict in Syria, the United States has been working with Syrians and outside groups to negotiate the countryâs political future. Parallel processes led by Russia in recent years seem to have overtaken the U.S.-sponsored discussions, the group said. ""With the precipitate U.S. withdrawal from Syria, the U.S. position in any negotiations over Syriaâs future has been inestimably weakened,"" wrote analysts Jon B. Alterman and Will Todman with the centerâs Middle East program. ""Perhaps most puzzling, U.S. adversaries have sacrificed nothing to obtain that outcome."" Brett McGurk, a special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told reporters on Dec. 11, before Trumpâs announcement, that he thought it was ""fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring."" Brian Finlay, president and CEO at Stimson Center, a nonpartisan policy research center, told PolitiFact that the ""vast preponderance of foreign policy thinkers"" seem to agree with McGurk.Â ""While it is clear that the president's critics are quite correct in saying those conditions have been far from met, it's also difficult to imagine a scenario where those pieces will ever be locked in place,"" Finlay said. U.S. withdrawal from Syria will leave ""a significant vacuum in the region,"" Finlay said,Â which Russia, Syria, and Iran will seek to exploit.

The Associated Press also reported Dec. 20 that a Syrian member of parliament, Peter Marjana, described the United Statesâ withdrawal from Syria as a ""recognition that Syria has won."" Many analysts have said that while Iran hasnât officially reacted to Trumpâs decision, it stands to benefit as it seeks to strengthen its role in the region. Trump said, ""Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy"" about U.S. troops leaving Syria. Putin has publicly welcomed the move, calling it the right decision. U.S. troops are in Syria supporting forces that oppose the Syrian government, and Iran backs the Syrian government. Six U.S. senators and analysts have said that Russia, Iran, and Syria are poised to embolden their power in the region without the United Statesâ presence. Trumpâs assessment is inaccurate.

Meme incorrectly attributes Winston Churchill for quote on Muslims and minority rights
","Winston Churchill wasnât known to shy away from making bold statements. But in todayâs world, internet quote generators make it incredibly easy to attribute any statement to any historical figure without proper sourcing or documentation. Such is the case for a meme recently shared on Facebook that quotes the famed British leader as saying, ""When Muslims are the minority they are concerned with minority rights, when they are in the majority there are no minority rights."" One user then captioned the post, ""From Winston Churchill: an undeniable source."" The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Spoiler alert: Thereâs no evidence that Churchill ever said that. We consulted the National Churchill Museum at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., for any record of the quote. Timothy Riley, chief curator of the museum, told PolitiFact he found no evidence to suggest that Churchill made the statement. ""There is no record in the vast written record to attribute this to Winston Churchill,"" Riley wrote. A search for the quote on the International Churchill Society website also yielded no results. Richard Langworth, senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, included the quote in his running list of ""All the âQuotesâ Winston Churchill Never Said."" Snopes reported that the quote doesnât seem to have appeared anywhere prior to 2015 â ""making it extremely unlikely they originated with a man who passed away in 1965.""
