Boustany says GOP health plan would lower premiums
","One of the recurring debates in the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit at Blair House dealt with how Democratic and Republican reform proposals would affect the cost of health premiums. Here we'll take a look at the House Republican proposal. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., one of the House Republican delegates to the summit and a physician himself, used a portion of his time to tout his party's plan. ""We put forth a plan earlier in the year, during the debate, that actually the Congressional Budget Office showed that it brings down the cost of premiums up to about 10 percent,"" he said to fellow summit participants. ""And, actually, for individuals [and] families seeking insurance in the individual market, those cost savings could even be higher."" Before we analyze Boustany's comment, let's take a look at the House Republican proposal, which, due to the Republican minority's lack of institutional power in the House, has garnered much less attention than its Democratic counterpart. A Democratic bill narrowly passed the chamber last fall. As we originally outlined in November, the Republicans produced a much smaller bill (219 pages vs. roughly 2,000 for the Democrats) and one with a more limited scope. It relies on GOP principles of consumer choice, no tax hikes, limited government involvement and caps on lawsuits. Here are some of the key provisions in the GOP proposal that are relevant to judging Boustany's statement: • More limited reach for the federal government. The GOP bill has no public option — that is, no government-run insurance program, or anything remotely like it. Nor does the GOP bill include an expansion of the federal-state Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. The House Democratic bill has both. The GOP plan also has no health care exchange, the government-run marketplace for people who are now uninsured. And consistent with Republican fears of government moving toward a system of deciding what treatments patients can receive, the GOP plan, unlike the Democratic bills, does not foster ""comparative effectiveness"" research that tries to determine which treatments are most effective. • Medical malpractice reform. Republicans have long sought to curb medical malpractice lawsuits, which they say needlessly raise health care costs. The Republican bill curbs malpractice lawsuits by capping noneconomic and punitive damages and making changes in the allocation of liability. The Democratic bill does not.• Favoring consumer choice over a guaranteed safety net and minimum benefits. The Republican plan would try to expand coverage and reduce costs voluntarily, primarily by increasing consumer options, rather than the Democratic method of using government leverage (such as mandates, penalties and subsidies) to corral more uninsured Americans into obtaining coverage. The Republican bill would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, something that is currently not allowed, and would allow small businesses to pool insurance coverage through trade associations, an option only allowed for larger companies and labor unions today. The bill would also expand the use of health savings accounts, which allow people to use pre-tax dollars to pay medical expenses. None of these programs would be mandatory. • High-risk pools. The Republican bill would offer aid to states to establish ""high-risk pools,"" groups of sicker (and thus more expensive) patients who typically have trouble finding insurance today because of restrictions on pre-existing conditions. It would also boost state-based reinsurance mechanisms that can help insurers that find it too costly to insure such pools. The Democratic bills use these pools, but only as a stopgap on the way to creating a new system. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress that analyzes legislation, took a detailed look at the Republican proposal when it was released. The figures Boustany cited in his Blair House comments come from this Nov. 4, 2009, analysis. The CBO projected that the cost of health insurance premiums would fall under the Republican plan, partly because of the medical malpractice reforms. In the market for individually purchased insurance policies -- ""the individual market"" -- premiums would fall by 5 percent to 8 percent by 2016. For the small-group pool, consisting of smaller businesses, premiums would fall by 7 percent to 10 percent. And in the large group market, for larger employers, they would fall by up to 3 percent. So when Boustany said that the CBO showed that the GOP bill would bring down the cost of premiums ""up to about 10 percent,"" he's correct. Granted, he cherry-picked the number at the high end of the scale, but by couching it with the language ""up to,"" it passes muster with us. Now we'll look at the second part of Boustany's statement -- that for ""insurance in the individual market, those cost savings could even be higher."" As indicated above, the CBO analysis concludes that the individual market could see premiums fall by 5 percent to 8 percent -- which is not a bigger drop than the 10 percent Boustany cited. So on this point he would seem to be incorrect. But we'll offer a caveat. CBO itself acknowledges that any exercise in projecting the future effects of a major policy change such as this one will be subject to uncertainty. In its study of the Republican proposal, the CBO acknowledged that some ""individuals and families within each market would see reductions in premiums that would be larger or smaller than the estimated average reductions, and some people would see increases."" This means that, in some cases, Boustany will be correct that ""for individuals [and] families seeking insurance in the individual market, those cost savings could even be higher"" than 10 percent. When we contacted Boustany's office, a spokesman argued that this caveat makes the statement true, given the congressman's use of the word ""could."" “Rep. Boustany highlighted CBO’s analysis that the House Republican plan would likely lower premiums by 10 percent, and could be even more,"" wrote press secretary Rick Curtsinger in an e-mail. We take his point, but we still think this part of Boustany's comment is somewhat misleading. CBO acknowledges that savings above 10 percent could happen for those in the individual market, but the agency's best estimate is that the reductions will be generally smaller than 8 percent, much less 10 percent. We find this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EC93F00>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/charles-boustany/boustany-says-gop-health-plan-would-lower-premiums/
"['Children', 'Education', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
Hutchison says one-third of kids drop out
","
In a TV ad titled ""Honest Leadership,"" U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican candidate for governor, courts voters by painting a bleak picture of Texas under Gov. Rick Perry.

Between swipes on taxes (""too high"") and the Texas Department of Transportation (""a wasteful mess""), Hutchison says that one in three Texas children are ""dropping out.""

The senator is not the only candidate airing such a claim. On a campaign flier, Rebecca Bell-Metereau, a local Democratic candidate for the State Board of Education, says that ""one-third of our students don’t graduate from high school.""

Dropout rates are such a complicated subject that we wondered if a simple statistic tells the whole story.

First, researchers and governments have many different ways of measuring how many students leave school before graduating. Analyzing different data with different methods yields statistical results that vary — a lot. To add to the confusion, any of those measurements might be termed the ""dropout"" rate in public discourse, depending on who is wielding the terminology.

Another source of confusion: Everyone who does not graduate is not necessarily a dropout. Graduation rates involve different data. Here, we'll focus on counting dropouts.

The ""one in three"" statistic that Hutchison and others cite refers to what is called the attrition rate, which tracks the decline in enrollment between one year and a later one: for example, the number of students in ninth grade compared with the number three school years later.

Hutchison’s campaign pointed us to several news stories that quoted the nonprofit Intercultural Development Research Association in San Antonio, which has its roots in the legal fight for school funding equity. The association, which has tracked high-school completion rates for more than 20 years, calculated a state attrition rate of 31 percent for the class of 2009 and 33 percent for the class of 2008 — hence, fuel for Hutchison's one-in-three claim.

IDRA says attrition rates are an ""indicator of a school’s holding power, or the ability to keep students enrolled in school and learning until they graduate.""

However, Linda Roska, director of the Texas Education Agency’s division of accountability research, said attrition rates are a simplistic measure because, among other things, they don't distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for reasons such as moving to another state or graduating early.

While TEA publishes a high school attrition rate (28.6 percent for the class of 2008, the most recent data available), it is not used in the state’s school accountability system.

Lori Taylor, an associate professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, said the best way to calculate dropout rates is to track individual students over time.

That's what TEA says it does when calculating two dropout rates that it uses: the percentage of high school students who drop out in a single year (3.2 percent in 2007-8) and the percentage of students in each class who drop out of high school before graduating (10.5 percent for the class of 2008). Both measurements are far below the ""one in three"" rate that Hutchison claims.

However, a 2009 report by Taylor’s students at Texas A&M says that the one-year rate potentially creates ""a distorted picture that underestimates the average dropout rate of a school, district, or system."" And the long-term rate excludes students who stay in high school longer than four years and may drop out later.

So what does ""dropping out"" really mean? According to TEA, a student becomes a dropout if he or she does not return to public school in the fall, is not expelled and does not do one of the following: graduate, receive a GED, continue school outside the public school system, begin college or die.

Some academics, researchers and activists have long disputed the agency's dropout numbers, partly because they said TEA excluded many students who should have been counted as dropouts. For instance, students who said they intended to get a GED after leaving school were not considered dropouts. Since the state adopted the federal dropout definition several years ago, those students are now considered dropouts if they fail to obtain their GED within a limited time frame — and the state's official dropout rates have gone up.

All this goes to show the difficulty that researchers have in trying to pin down dropout statistics precisely. In fact, the Bush School projected the dropout rate for the class of 2012 will range anywhere from 12.2 percent (40,519 students) to 22.2 percent (73,692 students). That's a lot of wiggle room.

Anyway, education experts contacted for this story generally agreed that the debate over whose numbers are best obscures the real issue: Too many Texas students are quitting school, period.

""It's most important to focus on the severity of the problem and what are the factors that are contributing to it,"" said Linda McSpadden McNeil, director of Rice University's Center for Education.

Our conclusion? If you ask how many Texas students drop out of school, you’ll get wildly different answers. In our own analysis, we found dropout rates that range from 3 percent (the one-year rate) to 33 percent (the attrition rate), and each one had its defenders.

Hutchison's dropout reference is based on student attrition, a simplistic measurement that is not the way the state prefers to count dropouts but is nevertheless accepted by some experts.

We find Hutchison's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EAB6580>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-one-third-kids-drop-out/
"['National', 'Bipartisanship', 'Health Care', 'Harry Reid']","
Reid says Republicans have used reconciliation more than Democrats
","Although the Feb. 25, 2010, televised health care summit was billed by President Barack Obama as an attempt to forge some bipartisan agreement, it didn't take long for the talk to turn to reconciliation. Reconciliation is a legislative procedure adopted in 1974 to balance budget bills. It can be a complex process, but what you really need to know about a reconciliation bill is that it can be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote supermajority Democrats lost when Scott Brown of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate. In other words, it's an option some Democrats are mulling if a bipartisan plan cannot be achieved. In the Republicans' opening statement, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said, ""You can say that this process has been used before, and that would be right. But it's never been used for anything like this. It's not appropriate to use to write the rules for 17 percent of the economy."" Alexander quoted Alexis de Tocqueville that the greatest threat to the American democracy would be the tyranny of the majority. Soon after, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of having a bit of amnesia on reconciliation. ""No one has talked about reconciliation, but that's what you folks have talked about ever since that came out, as if it's something that has never been done before,"" Reid said. ""Now, we as leaders here, the speaker and I, have not talked about doing reconciliation as the only way out of all this. Of course it's not the only way out. But remember, since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans for major things, like much of the Contract for America, Medicare reform, the tax cuts for rich people in America. So reconciliation isn't something that's never been done before."" We'll set aside some of the hypocrisy here (see Reid's comments in 2005 when he talked about the ""arrogance of power"" when Republicans were mulling reconciliation). Similarly, we'll set aside the hypocrisy of Republicans who used reconciliation in the past, but now denounce it. The issue we're looking at here is whether Republicans have really used reconciliation bills more than Democrats, as Reid claimed. On Nov. 14, 2008, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service put out a report on reconciliation bills between 1981 and 2009. There have been 22 of them, including three that were vetoed by President Bill Clinton. It's been used for health insurance portability (COBRA), nursing home standards, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increases in the earned income tax credit, welfare reform, start-up of the state Children's Health Insurance Program, major tax cuts and student aid reform. While some have tallied the Republican vs. Democratic report card on reconciliation based on the president in power at the time, we think it makes more sense to look at the party in power in Congress when the reconciliation procedure was initiated. By our count, eight of the reconciliation bills were initiated by a Democratic-controlled Congress. The rest, 14, were done by a Republican-controlled Congress. So by that measure, Reid is on target. ""It's a legitimate argument,"" said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""And Reid is absolutely right. It has been used a lot, and more by Republicans than Democrats."" On April 20, 2009, Mann co-authored an article in the New Republic, ""Truth and Reconciliation: Sidestepping the Filibuster,"" along with Molly Reynolds, also of Brookings, and Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, which concluded that ""Health reform 2009 style would be the most ambitious use of reconciliation but it fits a pattern used over three decades by both parties to avoid the strictures of Senate filibusters."" Still, we think looking at all 22 reconciliation bills casts too wide a net. Many reconciliation bills were not even all that controversial, and enjoyed wide bipartisan support. But other ones have clearly involved policy decisions that otherwise would likely have failed. Only eight involved votes where the winning side had less than the supermajority threshold of 60 votes. One could argue those were the times when Congress got around the need for the standard 60 votes. But even among that smaller group, six of the eight came courtesy of a Republican-controlled Congress. By way of counterpoint, Brian Darling, director of Senate relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that any comparison of past reconciliation bills to one on health care is flawed. ""This is a unique situation,"" Darling said. ""It's completely unprecedented to use reconciliation to amend a bill that is pending in Congress but has not passed."" Darling called the Democrats' threat of reconciliation a measure of last resort to steamroll through a bill that can no longer get 60 votes in the Senate and is unpopular with the American public. Whether or not a reconciliation bill on health care meets the intent of the legislative procedure is certainly a matter for legitimate debate. But Reid said reconciliation has been used 21 times since 1981, and that most of the time, it's been Republicans who have initiated it. We find that there have been 22 reconciliation votes, 14 of them by a Republican-controlled Congress, and that it makes more sense -- in light of the debate over making an end-run around the 60-vote threshold -- to focus on the reconciliation bills that passed without a supermajority. But even then, Republicans have reached for reconciliation bills more often than Democrats since 1981. We rule Reid's comment True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550695240>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/harry-reid/reid-says-repblicans-have-used-reconciliation-more/

Gov. Perry says he made tough decisions including $3 billion in vetoes to boost economy
","
UPDATE, Aug. 10, 2010: The article below corrects an error in the original on the percentage increase in non-dedicated state spending on Perry's watch. The increase amounts to 45 percent. This correction doesn't affect our rating of Perry's overall statement. 
Republican Gov. Rick Perry, seeking his party’s nod for a third full term, says he’s made tough decisions making Texas the best state for business.

In a TV ad that debuted Feb. 8, Perry lists seven reasons voters should support him in the March 2 primary: ""I vetoed more than $3 billion in spending. Lawmakers and I cut taxes for 40,000 small businesses. Now Texas is No. 1 in job creation. The nation’s five best housing markets are right here in Texas. We balanced five state budgets and we cut state spending. Today we have billions in surplus.""

Phew. Is all of that so?

We previously gauged Perry’s reference to the state having billions in surplus, a statement we rated as Barely True here.

As for Perry’s veto claim, his campaign told us it was based on adding up all spending that Perry vetoed after each of five regular legislative sessions.

That sounds straightforward. But it’s been debunked by the Dallas Morning News, which found that much of the vetoed spending never would have happened regardless. That’s because separate legislation authorizing the expenditures failed to pass into law. The newspaper said that nearly $2.5 billion of the more than $3 billion touted by Perry already was doomed because the required authorizing measures failed to pass.

The News said the funds at issue reflected ""agencies that were discontinued, federal money that had to be repaid anyway and spending that was shortly thereafter restored, with Perry’s general approval."" The newspaper's analysis continued: ""The governor has even acknowledged that the vetoes were merely procedural. In supporting materials for the ad, his campaign points to the veto proclamations Perry issued at the time, and in those, he explains that the underlying bills failed to pass the Legislature.""

Perry’s reference to cutting taxes for small businesses harkens to a proposal he signed last year raising the annual income threshold for businesses subject to the state’s retooled business franchise tax from $300,000 to $1 million. Thanks to the action, more than 130,000 businesses were exempted from the tax, including almost 40,000 that had to pay the tax in 2008 and 2009, according to the state comptroller’s office.

Perry's ad doesn't mention that on his watch, more than 940,000 businesses were subject to the revamped tax as of 2008, up from more than 692,000 businesses subject to the old version in 2007, according to the state comptroller's office.

Perry traces his statement that Texas is now No. 1 in job creation to a press release issued recently by Tom Pauken, who chairs the Texas Workforce Commission. Pauken compares the number of private-sector jobs in each of the most populous states in December 2009 to the number of jobs in December 1999. Texas saw a private-sector jobs increase of 9.3 percent over the period with Florida proving the only other big state with net job gains.

That's impressive history, though it doesn't confirm Texas is currently No. 1 in job creation, as Perry says in the ad.

The commission provided a national breakdown showing that between December 2008 and December 2009, only the District of Columbia enjoyed net job gains. Texas saw a 2.6 percent drop in employment over the year, faring better than 33 states though worse than 16.

More recently, Texas has fared better. In the last quarter of 2009, Texas enjoyed a net jobs gain of 49,100 to 10,355,000 jobs. Among the 10 most populous states, only Michigan enjoyed any gains, of 9,700 jobs. All in all, Texas's net job gains exceeded the total of 47,200 job gains combined reported by nine other states and the District of Columbia, the only other places in the United States that recorded net job gains in the quarter.

Perry ties his celebration of the Texas housing market to a February 2009 article in Builder 2009, a publication of Hanley Wood Market Intelligence, which rated Houston, Austin, Fort Worth, San Antonio and Dallas as the nation's best housing markets based on population and job growth changes, which its article calls ""perennial drivers of housing demand."" The publication states it also looked at what’s happened with home prices and new building permits. All the indicators were combined to score each community; the 15 cities with the best scores were featured. An October update of the rankings shows each of the Texas cities still among the country's top 10 markets.

As Perry says, Texas has balanced five state budgets on his watch. But he doesn't let on that it has to. It's constitutionally impermissible for the budget not to be balanced.

The governor makes a shakier claim when he says: ""And we cut state spending.""

That's not true if one compares how much state spending was budgeted before he became governor to the current budget. Spending of non-dedicated state general revenue has gone up about $25 billion since the 2000-01 budget -- an increase of 45 percent in Perry's time as governor.

Perry’s campaign notes correctly that twice in Perry's time as governor, lawmakers budgeted less spending from general revenue funds than had been spent in the previous two-year budget. The 2009 Legislature approved a budget that spent nearly $80.7 billion in non-dedicated state funds in 2010-11, down nearly 2 percent from the 2008-09 budget, thanks in part to federal stimulus aid. And in 2004-5, non-dedicated state spending dropped 1.6 percent as lawmakers adjusted to a projected $10 billion revenue shortfall.

All told, Perry talks a good game in his ad. Much of what he says has some truth to it.

Texas is a jobs Mecca. Several of the state's housing markets were national standouts last year. And Perry is correct too that about 40,000 businesses were exempted from paying the franchise tax though he fails to note that more businesses are subject to the revamped tax than before.

Not so good: Perry misrepresents the significance of balancing the state budget, a must-do for every legislature and governor. He distorts the size and substance of his budget vetoes. As previously reported, his claim that Texas has a surplus in the billions is Barely True since the state is expected to confront a revenue shortfall in 2012-13. Finally, Perry's claim to cutting state spending could lead viewers to think spending has decreased on his watch, which isn't so.

Perry’s ad drifts from evidence-strong facts to full-bore misrepresentations. We rate his statement altogether as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5506B5B00>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-he-made-tough-decisions-including-3/

Ad says Bachmann wants to 'wean' nation off entitlements, privatize Social Security
","Americans United for Change is after Minnesota's most outspoken lawmaker, Rep. Michele Bachmann.Comments made by the two-term Republican are the subject of a recent radio spot by the liberal group, which was founded in 2005 in opposition to former President George W. Bush's effort to privatize Social Security. The ad features a husband and wife discussing Bachmann and a proposal to ""wean"" people off Medicare and Social Security.Wife: ""Did you hear what that Michele Bachmann said this time?""Husband: ""No, what was it?""Wife: ""Congresswoman Bachmann actually said we should be 'weaned' off our Social Security and Medicare. She wants to privatize Social Security and replace Medicare with some kind of voucher system that won’t even cover the full cost of medical care or prescriptions."" We wondered if the ad by Americans United for Change accurately portrays Bachmann's positions. The first part of the statement -- that Bachmann said she wanted to wean people off the two entitlement programs -- is easy to find. At the Constitutional Coalition conference in St. Louis the weekend of Feb. 5, 2010, Bachmann told a group of attendees, including a reporter from the liberal blog Think Progress, that serious cost-cutting measures to Social Security and Medicare would be necessary to reduce the deficit. Those already collecting benefits should remain in the program, she suggested.To lower the deficit, Bachmann said that the government must reorganize Social Security and Medicare. ""What you have to do, is keep faith with the people that are already in the system, that don’t have any other options, we have to keep faith with them. But basically what we have to do is wean everybody else off. And wean everybody off because we have to take those unfunded net liabilities off our bank sheet."" So the Americans United for Change ad is correct that Bachmann said that people should be weaned off the entitlement programs.But in her comments, Bachmann did not say anything about trying to privatize Social Security or replacing Medicare with a voucher system.Via e-mail, Bachmann's spokesman Dave Dziok told us that he has ""no clue where they got the voucher comment from and she’s never once used the word privatize -- not in her initial comments in St. Louis, and not in subsequent interviews or statements. Furthermore, she never stated that she wants to eliminate these programs all together, but that younger generations should have other options in the way these programs are administered. While her critics are certainly doing their best to put words in her mouth, I don’t see how they can factually back it up.""Dziok said that Bachmann has not offered specific legislation on Social Security and Medicare reform.So we asked Jeremy Funk, communications director for Americans United for Change, for sourcing on the second part of the group's claim. He sent us a list of links to stories about Bachmann's comments, including one to an interview with the congresswoman in the St. Cloud Times, a Minnesota newspaper. Bachmann was asked what she thinks should be done about the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare, and here's what she said:""What we know right now (is) that going forward, Social Security and Medicare will be bankrupt and they will be broke. ... We have to take up the issue and we need to address it. There are a number of proposals on the table. One, my colleague from Wisconsin Paul Ryan has a proposal. I have taken a look at that. I am open to a number of different ideas. The one thing we do know, the current system isn’t sustainable. The system is going to be dead broke by 2017.""So, Bachmann didn't endorse any specific plan or idea, but indicated that she's open to proposals, perhaps including Ryan's. Ryan, who is the top Republican on the House Budget committee, has been touting his ""Roadmap for America's Future,"" a budget proposal meant to reduce the deficit by changing Social Security, Medicare and tax policy, among other things. Specifically, it would reduce federal Social Security benefits for those who are 55 or younger in 2011, and supplement the reduction with private accounts. Under Medicare, the elderly would be given vouchers to buy private insurance.His proposal (H.R. 4529) has made waves, mostly for two reasons.First, in its analysis, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that Ryan's proposal would eventually balance the budget. By 2080, it would generate a surplus equal to about 5 percent of GDP, according to the CBO. But that prediction has come under fire from tax experts because the CBO assumes that the revenue portion of Ryan’s plan will generate the equivalent of 19 percent of the GDP in taxes -- an optimistic assumption. And importantly for this analysis, the CBO predicts that the value of Ryan's Medicare vouchers would not keep pace with the cost of health care. Although the program would begin in 2021, the value of those vouchers would be pegged to 2010 dollars. ""According to CBO’s estimates, that average growth rate would be 2.7 percent over the long term,"" the CBO report says. ""In comparison, CBO projects, nominal per capita GDP will grow at an average rate of 3.4 percent annually over the next 75 years, implying that the value of the Medicare voucher would grow 0.7 percentage points more slowly."" In plain English, that means medical expenses will grow faster than the vouchers. So the vouchers will buy less medical care as time goes by, say opponents.Ryan responded to the criticism, saying that, ""Yes, Medicare costs will grow more slowly under the Roadmap than they would otherwise. ... That’s the point. Even the president acknowledges that, absent reform, Medicare will go bankrupt. ... After the program goes bankrupt, it will drag down the entire federal budget and U.S. economy.""But back to the claim made by Americans United for Change. The group said that Bachmann wants to wean people off Medicare and Social Security, which is true. But the group is exaggerating in the second part of its claim that Bachmann wants to ""privatize Social Security and replace Medicare with some kind of voucher system that won’t even cover the full cost of medical care or prescriptions."" To date, Bachmann has no specific proposal for how she would like to overhaul the two entitlement programs. Rather, she mentioned a separate proposal made by fellow Republican Paul Ryan, though she's made no commitments to his -- or anyone else's -- plan. As a result, we find the Americans United for Change claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A55068A900>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/americans-united-change/ad-says-bachmann-wants-wean-nation-entitlements-pr/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'C.W. Bill Young']","
Bill Young claims House plan was 'government takeover' of health care
","Many Republicans have said the Democratic health care plan is a ""government takeover"" of the nation's health system. The phrase has appeared in at least 700 newspaper articles in the past six months, according to a Nexis search. It's been a powerful weapon for the GOP opposition because it conjures images of a sluggish, state-run bureaucracy.So when 20-term U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young announced he was running for re-election in a speech to Pinellas County Republicans on Feb. 20, 2010, he mentioned his opposition to the health plan and other Democratic initiatives.""I voted against the bailout, and I'm going to do it again,"" the Indian Shores Republican said to applause.""I voted against the stimulus, and I'm going to do it again,"" he added. ""I voted against the government takeover of our health programs, and I'm going to do it again.""We should note that he was referring to the original Democratic health plan that passed the U.S. House last fall, not the one the White House unveiled on Feb. 22. But we suspect it wouldn't make much difference.The problem is, it's wrong.By any reasonable definition, there's no way that the Democratic plan could be considered a government takeover. Indeed, its primary approach is to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to provide more coverage and better services. The cornerstone of the Democratic program is actually the status quo. The majority of Americans would continue to get health coverage the way they do now -- from private insurance companies. That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover.The biggest new element in the Democratic plan is a health care exchange that is supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The government (or the states) would create the exchanges, which would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage.It's envisioned that most providers in the exchange would be private insurers, but the version of the bill that passed the House includes a ""public option,"" a government-run program. That's been the most controversial element of the Democratic proposal. Some Republicans think it could be a stalking horse for a future expansion of the government's role. But still, the exchanges rely primarily on private insurers, so it's incorrect to call them a government takeover. (The new Obama plan appears to abandon the idea of a public option.)The other element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the House bill, Medicaid would be expanded to cover anyone at or below 150 percent of poverty level. According to one estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, that would add 11 million people to Medicaid (on top of the roughly 60 million now in it), which would account for about an 18 percent increase. Harry Glenn, a spokesman for Young, said Young was stating an opinion. But given the congressman's wording, we believe it was stated as fact. And once again, we are faced with over-the-top rhetoric about the health care plan. It's perfectly legitimate to raise questions about the plan and the government's role, but it's wildly incorrect to label it a government takeover. Yes, the plan would expand the government's role, but it primarily would continue to rely on private insurers for the vast majority of Americans. And, for people who have trouble getting coverage, it would create a marketplace so people could shop for coverage from private insurers. It's ridiculously false to call that a government takeover. For this one, we need to strike a match and set the meter ablaze.

Florida Democrats say McCollum cost taxpayers billions
","The 2010 Florida gubernatorial campaign intensified this week, as allies of Republican Bill McCollum and Democrat Alex Sink exchanged television ads designed to highlight aspects of their rival's record that voters might not be happy with.On Feb. 23, 2010, we analyzed an anti-Sink ad placed by the Republican Governors Association. We ruled that the ad -- focusing on her tenure as a highly compensated bank executive during a time of job losses at her company -- was Mostly True.Today we look at an anti-McCollum response ad aired by the Florida Democratic Party. The ad begins with footage of McCollum telling reporters, ""I'm proud of my record of having been a congressman.""A voice-over continues, ""Really? Well, Bill McCollum, you cost the rest of us billions. He voted four times to raise his own pay. $51,000. Our tax money pays his congressional pension. Over $75,000 dollars a year. The national debt skyrocketed. $4.7 trillion. McCollum voted for debt-limit increases five times. Bill McCollum. Just another Washington politician Florida can't afford.""We'll address the issues of congressional pay raises and pensions in a separate item. Here we'll tackle the debt questions.Let's start with the details. The ad says that ""the national debt skyrocketed"" to ""$4.7 trillion."" Accompanying material provided by the campaign explains that this is the amount that the national debt rose during McCollum's tenure in Congress.We checked historical debt figures from the Treasury Department and confirmed that during McCollum's tenure in Congress -- Jan. 3, 1981 to Jan. 3, 2001 -- the debt did indeed rise by $4.7 trillion.The ad also claims that McCollum voted for debt-limit increases on five occasions. Before we analyze this, let's start with a primer on debt-limit votes. Their purpose is to raise the legal limit on how much debt the federal government can take on. Such votes are taken periodically as debt approaches the old limit, and if such a vote were to fail to pass by the deadline, the federal government would default on some of its obligations, potentially causing a financial panic. But while the votes are important, politicians hate taking such votes because they remind voters of how large the federal debt is.When we looked at the five votes cited in the ad, we confirmed that McCollum voted yes in all cases. But we noticed that while this claim is technically true, three of these votes were taken on the same 1995 bill, and two were votes on the same 1996 bill. In these cases, multiple votes were required because the bill passed through the House in different versions before becoming law.When we raised this discrepancy with the Florida Democratic Party, the party came back with additional documentation of 11 votes -- taken in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1989, in addition to 1995 and 1996 -- in which McCollum voted to increase the debt limit. If all of these citations are accurate -- and we were unable to check them independently because the new votes were all taken before congressional roll call votes were posted on the Internet -- then the Florida Democratic Party's ad actually undercounted by about half the number of occasions in which McCollum voted to raise the debt limit.We asked the McCollum campaign whether it had any quibbles with the additional votes. Staffers said that by their tally, McCollum had indeed voted to the raise the debt limit on 17 occasions, but that he voted against raising the debt limit on 20 occasions.So, according to the McCollum campaign, he voted against debt limit increases more times than he voted for them. Still, as far as the ad's language goes, it appears to be correct that McCollum ""voted for debt-limit increases"" at least five times, even if he also voted against them on other occasions.What about the overall impression -- that McCollum ""cost the rest of us billions""? When we asked the Florida Democratic Party what it meant by that phrase. A spokesman answered that it referred to votes like one footnoted in the ad, in which McCollum voted for a $600 billion debt-limit increase in 1996.But that raises some questions of its own. In that vote, the measure passed, 328-91 -- a broad, bipartisan victory. Even Democrats, then in the minority, voted for the bill by a 2-to-1 ratio -- including then-Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla., who now serves as chairwoman of the very same Florida Democratic Party that ran the attack ad against McCollum. Indeed, the McCollum camp notes that in the seven debt limit votes held between 1993 and 2000 -- the period when McCollum and Thurman served together in the House -- Thurman voted to raise the debt limit seven times while McCollum voted to support such bills four times.This leads to a larger point: It's not exactly fair to blame McCollum exclusively for all $4.7 trillion of accumulated debt during his tenure, especially given that he sometimes voted against the debt ceiling hikes. Using such a loose standard, the same blame could be laid at the feet of any House member who served during the same period as McCollum -- Republican or Democrat. All members of Congress vote on bills that ""cost the rest of us billions."" That is their job. Also, the statement doesn't address ways in which McCollum voted for policies intended to save taxpayer money, such as tax cuts.Ultimately, then, the ad is worded carefully enough to be accurate in its details, but it paints a more sinister picture of McCollum's actions than he probably deserves -- both given his votes against raising the debt limit and relative to the voting patterns by Democratic lawmakers during the same period. So we rate this claim Half True. UPDATE: This item uses updated numbers on the debt limit votes that were provided to us by the McCollumn campaign after this item was published. It does not affect our Truth-O-Meter ruling.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E3BE700>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mccollum-cost-taxpayers-bill/

Florida Democrats say McCollum voted to raise congressional pay, earns $75,000 pension
","The 2010 Florida gubernatorial campaign intensified this week, as allies of Republican Bill McCollum and Democrat Alex Sink exchanged television ads designed to highlight aspects of their rival's record that voters might not be happy with.On Feb. 23, 2010, we analyzed an anti-Sink ad placed by the Republican Governors Association.

Just another Washington politician Florida can't afford.""We'll address the debt questions in a separate item. Here we'll tackle the issues of congressional pay raises and pensions.Congressional pay raisesIn a footnote to the advertisement, the Florida Democratic Party provided bill numbers and dates showing the votes that enabled congressional salaries to increase. We checked the four votes -- in 1989, 1997, 1999 and 2000 -- with roll call records and confirmed that McCollum did vote yes in all four cases.In the case of the 1989 bill -- which combined landmark ethics reforms with a pay raise of more than 30 percent over two years -- McCollum praised the bill when it was introduced, saying that it's ""not about a pay raise -- it's about good government. ... It's about changing the ethical climate of Congress.""As for the amount of the salary increase, the ad actually understates it. Before the 1989 vote, congressional salaries were $89,500. On Jan. 1, 2001 -- two days before McCollum's final term officially ended -- congressional salaries went up to $145,100. That's a difference of $55,600, a bit higher than the $51,000 stated in the ad.The McCollum campaign points out that on several of these votes, a majority of Florida's Democratic Congressional delegation voted the same way McCollum did, and we think that's fair context to add. But looking specifically at the Democratic ad's charge, this part of the claim is accurate.Congressional pensionThe pensions issue is even more straightforward. The Florida Democratic Party sent us copies of three financial disclosure forms signed by McCollum, who is 65.The first was filed in 2005, when McCollum was a candidate for state attorney general, an office he won and continues to occupy. It reports that McCollum earned $76,704 in a federal pension, which covers his service in Congress. (This is distinct from his military pension, which earned him $13,455 that year; McCollum served in the Navy and the Naval Reserve from 1969 to 1992.)His 2006 report showed a federal pension worth $77,612, while his 2008 report showed a $77,280 federal pension.All three filings showed congressional pensions worth ""over $75,000 dollars a year."" So this claim is accurate as well.Both claims are supported by the evidence, so we're assigning it a rating of True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550726B40>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mccollum-voted-raise-congres/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Alex Sink']","
Sink says McCollum said tax cuts don't work
","A Republican candidate against tax cuts would be like President Barack Obama being against hope, right? But that's the accusation that Florida's Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for governor, makes against Republican opponent Bill McCollum, the state's attorney general. On her Facebook page Feb. 16, 2010, Sink wrote: ""Career politician Bill McCollum said tax cuts don't work. That's just plain wrong -- wrong for businesses, our economy, and everyday Floridians."" The charge refers to comments McCollum has made over the years, but the Sink campaign also cited some of McCollum's votes while in Congress from 1981 to 2001. First, his words.Sink's Facebook statement refers to a Feb. 15, 2010, article from the News Service of Florida about comments from three candidates for governor  -- Sink, McCollum and Republican Paula Dockery -- at a Tallahassee forum sponsored by the National Federation of Independent Business and Florida TaxWatch. Here is what the article said about McCollum's comments on tax cuts: While Democrat Alex Sink and Republican Paula Dockery both promoted the idea of offering tax breaks to spur job-creation, Republican Bill McCollum said the approach is not a panacea. ""Targeted tax credits, in my experience in Washington, were minimally effective,"" said McCollum, a former 10-term Congressman from the Orlando-area. ""They can be in the short run, but in the long run they are not effective,"" he added. ""But I think all of us wish there were a simple solution to the re-creation of jobs in Florida."" The article also stated that all three candidates ""vowed to steer clear from tax increases"" and ""supported delaying a sharp increase in the state's unemployment compensation tax that businesses now face paying on April 1."" Sink's campaign also cited a Nov. 5, 2000, South Florida Sun-Sentinel article in which McCollum, then a U.S. Senate candidate, discussed tax cuts. The article said that McCollum's ""stump speeches Saturday repeated his themes of 'better government, not bigger government.' And he continued his attack on [Democrat Bill] Nelson for his support of $500 billion in targeted cuts, rather than the $1.3 trillion in across-the-board cuts favored by Bush. ""'Targeted tax cuts are just a liberal's fancy way of saying they want government to decide who gets the money,' McCollum told a handful of supporters at a Punta Gorda retirement community."" Those passages indicate that McCollum's position on tax cuts has followed party lines; he was opposed to the Democrat's ""targeted cuts,"" but he appears to have supported an across-the-board tax cut favored by Republicans.To rebut the Sink claim, McCollum's campaign provided us with a few articles quoting him in favor of tax cuts. A Feb. 15, 2010, Newsmax article quotes McCollum saying, ""We need to reduce the capital gains tax"" and that he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate. In that article, he criticized Obama's proposal for a tax credit for businesses that hire new workers. ""I never thought targeted tax credits were very effective,"" McCollum said. In a transcript of a McCollum speech printed in the Florida Times-Union on July 31, 2000, McCollum said that Congress could ""not only cut taxes, but restructure the tax code.""To get a more complete picture of McCollum's position, we also looked at his votes on various tax cuts.His record shows that, contrary to Sink's claim, he voted for tax cuts several times. Even the Florida Democratic Party has noted that; it issued a news release Dec. 29, 2009, stating that McCollum has repeatedly voted in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. Sink's campaign provided two examples of when McCollum voted against tax cuts in the 1990s, but they were party-line votes that indicate he was voting with other Republicans in opposition to a Democratic proposal. By contrast, McCollum's campaign cited many other votes that McCollum took in favor of tax cuts, including votes to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the estate tax.So based on the news articles and our examination of McCollum's voting record, it's clear that he has often supported tax cuts -- particularly Republican proposals.So Sink is cherry-picking here. Although McCollum did say he was opposed to ""targeted"" (read: Democratic) tax cuts, he has spoken and voted in favor of them many other times, particularly the across-the-board proposals favored by Republicans. We find her statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A55072D180>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/alex-sink/sink-says-mccollum-said-tax-cuts-dont-work/

Republican Governors Association blasts Sink's record, compensation as bank executive
","On Feb. 23, 2010, the Republican Governors Association -- the gubernatorial campaign arm of the national GOP -- fired a shot at Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida. The RGA, which is backing Republican Bill McCollum, took aim at Sink's career as a top executive at Bank of America and its predecessor in Florida, NationsBank.Here's the entire text of the 15-second advertisement, to be aired on broadcast and cable television outlets:""As bank president, Alex Sink eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses. Alex Sink. Not one of us. One of them.""In a fundraising e-mail sent several hours after the ad was launched, the Sink campaign attacked it as ""full of dodges and distortions"" and said it ""misleads Floridians about Alex Sink's record as a business leader."" We see three questions to probe here. One is whether her banks eliminated ""thousands of Florida jobs"" on Sink's watch. The second is whether the ad correctly describes Sink's compensation. And the third is whether it's fair to lay the blame for the job losses on Sink.We'll take these questions individually.Job lossesWe were unable to track down any official NationsBank documents addressing the issue of job losses from the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's August 1997 acquisition of Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank. But news coverage at the time is consistent in reporting that the company planned to eliminate 6,000 jobs as a result of the merger.A Jan. 1, 1998, Miami Herald article quotes Rusty Rainey, who led the NationsBank-Barnett transition, saying that the merger would cut more than 6,000 jobs. Before the merger, the Herald reported, Barnett employed about 22,000 people and NationsBank had between 8,500 and 9,000 employees in Florida.It's worth noting that the 6,000 figure involves a bit of uncertainty. It's a prediction, rather than an after-the-fact accounting, so the final number may have been higher or lower. (In other reports, the Herald noted that new jobs might be created in back-office processing facilities in Jacksonville and with the expected addition of 60 to 80 supermarket branches.) In addition, Rainey said in the Herald article that the 6,000 target would be met largely by attrition rather than layoffs -- not an implausible goal, given the high rates of employee turnover in the banking industry and the relatively low unemployment levels at the time.Also, the subsequent merger of NationsBank with Bank of America in 1998 created an expected 8,000 job cuts. But that was a national number; the number of jobs lost in Florida specifically was not reported.Ultimately, none of these caveats matter much because the RGA ad was carefully worded. It speaks of ""thousands of Florida jobs,"" rather than citing a specific number of job losses, and it refrains from describing the eliminated jobs as ""layoffs."" So we find this description accurate. CompensationHere too, we were unable to obtain original tax forms from the Sink campaign, but their contents were widely and consistently reported in 2002, when the gubernatorial campaign of Sink's husband, Democrat Bill McBride, released them to the public.The McBride campaign released Sink's tax returns for 2000 and 2001, which had been filed independently of her husband. Earlier, the campaign had released the couple's jointly filed return from 1999.When her income from these three years is combined, Sink earned in excess of $8 million. According to various news reports at the time, which were based directly on the tax returns released to the media, Sink earned $2.6 million in 1999, $3.4 million in 2000 and $2.8 million in 2001. (She took early retirement in a management shakeup in 2000.) That equals $8.8 million over three years. While that amount squares with the dollar figure cited in the ad, it's worth noting two caveats.One is that this income was earned between two and four years after the merger was announced. However, Sink held the same position at the time -- president of Florida operations for the bank -- and was presiding over the merged entity. So that doesn't strike us as being a major flaw.The other caveat concerns the ad's use of the term ""salary and bonuses."" In 2002, the Associated Press reported that Sink's 2000 income included ""stock-options and lump-sum pension payments"" and that her 2001 income included ""stock options, deferred compensation and pension"" payments. None of the coverage mentions ""bonus"" payments, and the campaign was not able to clarify whether she received any bonuses or not for those years. The RGA stands behind its characterization. ""To most normal people, any compensation that is over and above your typical salary would be called a bonus,"" said spokesman Tim Murtaugh. ""Very often, these bonuses take the form of some combination of stocks and other compensation.""But we think the distinction is worth mentioning because in today's post-Wall Street crash environment, saying that a financial-services employee received a lucrative ""bonus"" at the same time the company was cutting jobs is a pretty loaded accusation. Absent any hard evidence that she received what experts would consider a ""bonus,"" we'll downgrade the accuracy of this part of the ad slightly.Who's to blame?So our analysis suggests that the core facts in the ad are pretty accurate. But what about the larger context? Two banking experts noted that Sink did nothing unusual compared to other bank executives during that period of aggressive mergers. Stanley D. Smith, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida, said that the elimination of those jobs in the merger ""would have and should have occurred no matter who the Florida CEO was. That merger was what is called an intramarket merger, where the two banks’ branches and operations overlapped. The premium that NationsBank paid was based on the savings that would occur from the elimination of overlapping branches and operations. Any competent banker would have done the same thing, and those unfortunate job losses are just a normal part of that type of merger.""James McNulty, a finance professor at Florida Atlantic University, agreed. ""Bank mergers very often involve job losses,"" he said. ""The major reason that banks merge is to improve efficiency, and that involves eliminating positions that are redundant in the combined organization. In many cases jobs are reduced by attrition rather than by firing people -- those who leave are not replaced, and good people that the bank wants to retain are moved to new positions. This happens in most large bank mergers. Blaming it on Alex Sink is preposterous.""There's one other issue worth considering: Was Sink as personally responsible for slashing jobs as the ad claims?Last May, Sink told reporters in the St. Petersburg Times-Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau that the decision to merge with Barnett was made by corporate executives at NationsBank headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. ""I got a call one day just like the people at Barnett did that said an agreement has been reached,"" she said.Murtaugh of the RGA responds that ""Sink was the president of the bank. Of course she was responsible for decisions made. If she says she wasn’t responsible and was only following orders, what does that say about her ability to tout her business experience? She can’t claim that she wasn’t in charge of decisionmaking and then also claim that she has business decisionmaking experience.""On that point, we agree. Even if she were not the architect of the deal, she helped implement the merger over the next few years, and received a generous compensation package at the same time. With the exception of the term ""bonus,"" which we think is a bit of a stretch, the RGA ad strikes us as generally accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E88A480>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-blasts-sinks-reco/

Gelber claims Florida leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes
","In a blog posting and press conference on Feb. 8, 2010, Florida attorney general candidate Sen. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, said it was time to take aim at a ""culture of corruption in the state of Florida."" Gelber said he supports legislation to make the willful nondisclosure of a financial conflict a criminal offense, and said that as attorney general, he would push for more manpower to investigate public corruption.""For those few officials who end up exploiting their public offices for personal gain, it’s time to get serious,"" Gelber said in his blog posting. ""Florida leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes.""We asked Gelber where he got the statistic about Florida leading the nation in elected officials charged with crimes, and he referred us to a Dec. 13, 2008, story in the New York Times. The story cited a Department of Justice report that found that in the decade ending in 2007, Florida had the highest number of convictions in federal public corruption cases at local, state and federal levels.We checked out the Department of Justice statistics, and updated the tally to include the most recently available figures for 2008. And over the decade ending in 2008, Florida remained atop the list of states when it comes to the sheer number of public corruption convictions, with 794. Rounding out the top five were California, with 728; New York, 662; Texas, 624; and Pennsylvania, 555.Those also happen to be five of the six most populated states. You might expect the most populated states to have the highest number of corruption cases. So we also compiled a list of the most public corruption convictions on a per capita basis. By that measure, Florida comes in at No. 10. Topping the list was Alaska, followed by North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana and Montana.There are lots of ways to slice and dice statistics, Gelber told PolitiFact, and he was referring to the sheer number, rather than per capita.Florida is fourth in population, he noted, but first in volume of corruption cases. ""That suggests we're outperforming our size,"" Gelber said.North Dakota and Alaska are so lightly populated, he said, that one big prosecution with lots of defendants could greatly skew their rankings. Indeed, Florida ranks higher per capita than any of the other 10 most populated states.When you've got as many people as Florida, he said, ""You don't get to be No. 1 unless you’re working every day at it."" You have to have a ""tradition"" of corruption, he said.We think per capita is probably the fairest way to rank states, but our bigger issue with Gelber's statistic is that he said Florida leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes.The Department of Justice report is not just about elected officials, but rather all local, state and federal officials (the great majority of them unelected), as well as private residents, convicted in public corruption cases.The Department of Justice does not compile statistics on just elected officials charged with crimes, said Mark Motivans, a spokesman for the department. Neither does the FBI, said spokesman Stephen G. Fischer Jr.. In other words, no one can say for sure which state leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes.Gelber, a former federal prosecutor who has handled a number of public corruption cases, said the statistic is still valid. ""The corruption of the government is the corruption of the government,"" Gelber said, whether it be an elected official or a restaurant inspector or building department employee getting a kickback. ""It could be anyone who has the public trust.""The issue, he said, is how many people do you have looking at public corruption in Florida. And in his opinion, the answer is not enough.""I think we probably need more bodies,"" Gelber said.The Department of Justice statistics go a long way toward bolstering Gelber's argument about public corruption in Florida. Florida has had a higher number of public corruption convictions than other similar-sized states. That's not good. But Gelber misstates the statistic by saying that Florida has the highest number of elected officials charged with a crime. That's not what the DOJ report tracks. Rather, Florida has the highest number of people convicted of public corruption crimes, only a fraction of whom are actually elected officials. And again, while it's certainly valid to note that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of public corruption convictions, we think that when it comes to ranking states, it makes more sense to look at per capita rates. By that measure, Florida still ranks up there (No. 10) -- particularly when compared to other highly populated states -- but it's not tops on the list. And so we ruleGelber's   statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EC72180>],/factchecks/2010/feb/25/dan-gelber/gelber-claims-florida-leads-nation-elected-officia/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Jon Kyl']","
Polls show public dubious on current health care proposals
","With a big meeting at the White House scheduled for health care reform, Republicans have been marshaling their best arguments against the Democratic proposals. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., discussed the meeting, set for Feb. 25, 2010, on Fox News.""President Obama seems intent on the other hand of ramming his agenda through, no matter what,"" Kyl told Greta Van Susteren. ""One of the problems with that is that the American people have said that isn't what they want in health care reform.""""I think you have to listen to the American people,"" Kyl added. ""One of the most recent polls said 75 percent of the American people have said either don't do anything or start over.""We've been fascinated with health care polls since Democrats started moving forward with legislation in 2009. Several reputable polls indicate people aren't sure what's actually in the bills, which regulate private insurers more heavily, require people to have health insurance and offer tax credits to small businesses and people with low incomes. Our favorite poll question involved a proposal put forward by the more liberal members of the Democratic caucus: the public option. A Vanity Fair/60 Minutes poll asked, ""In the health care debate, there's been much back-and-forth over the so-called public option. Could you confidently explain what exactly the public option is to someone who didn’t know?"" Two-thirds said they couldn't.In reviewing the more recent polls on health care, most show that a narrow majority of the public opposes the current plans, though a few polls show a roughly even split.Still, we were interested in Kyl's statement that 75 percent of respondents said do nothing or start over. We asked Kyl's staff about the number but didn't hear back, so we started looking around on our own.We soon found a CNN poll conducted at the end of January that asked the question, ""What do you think Congress should do on health care -- pass a health care bill similar to the legislation that Congress has been working on for the past year, start work on an entirely new bill, or stop working on any bills that would change the country's health care system?""The poll found that 48 percent said ""start a new bill,"" while 21 percent said ""stop working on health care."" Add those together and you get 69 percent, which is not far from 75 percent. (And 30 percent said Congress should pass one of the current proposals.)The CNN poll also showed that 58 percent oppose the current proposals, while 38 percent favor them. (This leads to the odd conclusion that some people, about 8 percent, favor the current proposals but also want Congress to start over.) Democratic analysts have claimed that some of the opposition to health care found in the poll numbers comes from Democrats who believe the current proposals don't go far enough. That may be so, but we're not ruling on that here. For our rating, Kyl was careful in how he phrased his statement. He said, ""One of the most recent polls said 75 percent of the American people have said either don't do anything or start over."" We found a recent poll that put those two categories at 69 percent. That's a little short, but pretty close. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E512280>],/factchecks/2010/feb/23/jon-kyl/polls-show-public-dubious-current-health-care-prop/
"['National', 'Energy', 'Stimulus', 'Sarah Palin']","
Palin claims that most of the renewable energy stimulus dollars have gone to Chinese turbinemakers
","The best way to find out what Sarah Palin is thinking these days is to visit her Facebook page.For example, on the anniversary of the passage of the stimulus bill, the former Alaska governor jotted down her thoughts on the $862 billion legislation meant to boost the economy. ""One year ago today, President Obama signed a nearly trillion dollar stimulus package and handed our children the bill. What did we get for that massive price tag? Many promises, but the promises have proven false,"" she wrote on Feb. 17, 2010. Among those broken promises is the administration's pledge to ""provide 'green jobs' for Americans, but 80% of the $2 billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China.""That's a lot of money, so we wondered whether Palin is correct. The stimulus bill, otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, includes tax credits to develop alternative energy, including solar, geothermal and wind energy. In lieu of the tax credit, investors can opt to take a cash grant of up to 30 percent of the cost of their project, an alternative that has turned out to be very popular.To support her statement, Palin's Facebook missive links to a Feb. 11, 2010, op-ed in Investor's Business Daily, a conservative news source. The editorial states that, according to the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, nearly $2 billion from the stimulus bill has been spent on wind power, and that 80 percent of that has gone to foreign manufacturers of wind turbines.""The goal was to further energy independence while creating American jobs. It has done neither,"" the editorial said.The Investigative Reporting Workshop's story on stimulus dollars and the wind industry came in two parts. In October 2009, it published its first analysis. The group found that of the $1.05 billion in clean-energy grants already handed out by the Department of Energy, about 84 percent -- or $849 million -- ended up in the hands of foreign wind companies. We spoke with Russ Choma, the story's author, who explained that these grants are given to U.S.-based wind projects, but that many of these projects are being built by the American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. For instance, on Sept. 22, 2009, the DOE awarded $464.2 million to wind projects, and all of it went to local subsidiaries of foreign companies, according to the report. Those companies include Iberdrola, a Spanish company that received $250.9 million; the American subsidiary of Japan's Eurus Energy, which got $91.3 million; and the American subsidiary of Germany's E.ON Group, which received $121.9 million. Choma also points out that the wind turbine manufacturing industry in the United States is relatively weak compared to those abroad; of the 1,807 turbines erected in the United States as a result of the stimulus grants, foreign-owned manufacturers made 1,219, according to the report. On Feb. 8, 2010, Choma updated his original findings, reporting that an additional $1 billion had been handed out in renewable energy grants, bringing the grand total to $2.1 billion. Of that, about 79 percent has gone to overseas firms. The news prompted indignation from some lawmakers concerned that stimulus dollars are not being spent effectively. Sen. Charles Schumer had some choice words about an October announcement that a Chinese wind-turbine company would be selling turbines to a wind project in Texas. Chinese banks have said they will bankroll the project, though there have been no final decisions on whether stimulus money will be tapped as well.""In all due respect I remind the secretary (of energy) there is a four-letter word associated with the stimulus -- J-O-B-S,"" Schumer said. ""Very few jobs here, lots of jobs in China. That is not what I intended or any other legislator who voted for the stimulus intended. ... It is fine that the Chinese make them. But why don’t we use the stimulus money to start building up an industry to build them here, that was the very point of the stimulus.""The same quote was picked up by the IBD op-ed. Hence, China enters our story. Energy Secretary Steven Chu and the American Wind Energy Association also weighed in on Choma's story. Their point: Wind energy projects supported with stimulus dollars create and save American jobs.On Facebook, Chu wrote that, ""Every dollar awarded through this program helps put Americans to work. ... All of the wind turbine installation jobs are created here in America.""Christine Real de Azua, a spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association, credits the stimulus bill with saving and creating 40,000 jobs; at the start of 2009, her organization expected that wind power development might drop as much as 50 percent from 2008 levels. Midyear, the trend turned around, she said. Most of those 40,000 jobs are in the construction sector; jobs in the manufacturing sector fell last year. That said, the American Wind Energy Association estimates that more than 50 percent of turbine parts, such as towers, blades, nacelle assembly, and some internal components are made in the United States, a number that is growing.Clearly, jobs are being created and saved in the United States as a result of these projects. But what about overseas? We were hard-pressed to find an exact number, though using data from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, a group that advocates for clean energy, Choma estimated that as many as 4,500 foreign manufacturing jobs have been created with stimulus dollars. We spoke with George Sterzinger, executive director for REPP, about that figure. He said it's just an estimate, ""but with the present momentum in the world, you can bet (stimulus money) is going to stimulate foreign manufacturing jobs.""On that point, Sterzinger said that Obama's stimulus plan for renewable energy has missed the boat. The jobs that have been created or saved in the United States are construction jobs, which are temporary. Creating a robust local industry for wind energy will require jobs in the manufacturing sector, an area where the United States still lags. Back to what Palin said, that ""80% of the $2 billion they spent on alternative energy went to purchase wind turbines built in China."" There is a small amount of truth to Palin's underlying point: Because many parts of these turbines are being made overseas, some of the stimulus money is supporting jobs abroad. But that's not to say that no wind energy-related jobs have been created in the United States. Aside from that, Palin -- and the IBD editorial -- misrepresented Choma's story in a number of ways. First, while Choma found that many of the grants given so far have been for wind projects -- and that many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies -- the 79 percent of the $2.1 billion he cites in his story (Palin's rounded that number up to 80 percent) is the amount that has gone overseas for all renewable energy projects, not just wind projects. Choma shared his data with us, and it shows that, as of February 2010, only 73 percent has gone to foreign companies involved in wind projects. The rest of that 79 percent has gone to geothermal projects. And, more importantly, says Choma, none of these American subsidiaries is owned by Chinese companies. While the Texas deal may eventually shuttle some stimulus dollars to China through the purchase of turbines, the deal is still in the works. So, it's incorrect to say that any stimulus money has gone to Chinese turbine manufacturers, let alone 80 percent of the $2 billion spent on renewable energy projects. Ultimately, we found that Palin mixed up and misrepresented the facts. For that, we find her claim to be False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EC6E9C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/23/sarah-palin/palin-falsely-claims-most-renewable-energy-stimulu/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
Democrat Bill White says Gov. Rick Perry has never had private-sector job
","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said last week that his November opponent, Gov. Rick Perry, has never held a private-sector job, the Wichita Falls Times Record News reported. Never is a long time. Is White right? First, we checked on whether the newspaper correctly quoted White. Why? The comment isn't in quotation marks in its article, raising the possibility the reporter made an inference. However, Lynn Walker, the Wichita Falls newspaperman who spoke with White on Tuesday, told us he jotted down “Perry never held a private-sector job” because that is what White told him “word for word.” When we called White's campaign about his comment, White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said White realized afterward he should have instead said something like Perry had “barely” or “hardly” any private-sector experience. She said a clarification was sent to the newspaper. Indeed, Perry has been a full-time state official for nearly 20 years. Before succeeding George W. Bush as governor in late 2000, he was lieutenant governor in 1999-2000 after serving two four-year terms as state agriculture commissioner. So how much private-sector experience does the governor have? Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle reminded us that Perry's background lies in his family's farming and ranching business in Haskell County, where he grew up. Born in March 1950, Perry attended Texas A&M University. After graduating in 1972, he was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force until he was discharged in 1977, with the rank of captain, according to his biographical entry in the Texas State Directory. In his autobiographical 2008 book, ""On My Honor,"" Perry describes his return: ""Dad still thought I was there to do chores. I reminded him that I had just finished commanding a multi-million-dollar piece of government equipment and a number of grown men. He reminded me that the chores still needed tending to."" In a profile published by the Austin American-Statesman, Perry is quoted saying that in 1978 he was within weeks of starting training as a Southwest Airlines pilot when a heavy rain prompted him to knuckle down. “I just made the decision that this is where I need to be,” Perry said. Perry subsequently ran for the Texas House -- a position intended to be part time, paying less than $10,000 a year -- and won the first of his three two-year terms in 1984. Two former Haskell residents who’ve long known Perry said he worked in various ways in the 13 years between returning from the Air Force and being elected in 1990 to his first statewide office as agriculture commissioner. Semi-retired pharmacist Doyle High, who lives in Austin, said Perry farmed and ranched with his father and also worked as a pilot for someone who lived in Abilene. Consultant Don Comedy of Marble Falls, who said he lived near Perry at that time, also recalled Perry farming and ranching. Comedy said Perry and his father leased a ranch covering some 8,000 to 12,000 acres, making provision for hundreds of cows. “That first winter,"" after Perry left the Air Force, Comedy said, ""we had several, eight to 10 days in row, the temperature never got above freezing. Rick was leaving the house in the morning before daylight, breaking ice on ponds so those cows could drink water... hauling hay, doctoring sick cows, riding horseback, coming in at night after dark... He was joking that at least in the Air Force, they had heaters in the airplane.” Comedy said Perry also went into business with a partner buying and selling airplanes; the partner has since died. Comedy said Perry also rented out space in buildings that he owned in Haskell. Andrew Gannaway, president of Haskell National Bank, said Perry served on the bank’s board of directors from 1983 through 1988, subsequently serving as an advisory director from 1989 to 1996. “He was involved in a family farming and ranching operation,” Gannaway said. “They were looking for local businessmen and folks who were a good representation of the community to serve on the board.” Perry's pre-government employment may not have been in typical 9-to-5 occupations, but it certainly qualifies as a ""private-sector job."" Bacon, White's spokeswoman, said he was making the point that he has considerably more private-sector experience — as a lawyer and businessman — than Perry does. That's not entirely what White said in Wichita Falls. We rate his statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D9C1CC0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/26/bill-white/democrat-bill-white-says-gov-rick-perry-has-never-/
"['National', 'Financial Regulation', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Bob Corker']","
Corker claims the financial regulation got a speedy vote
","Financial regulation reform was the topic of the day on the latest edition of ABC's This Week.Among the guests was Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who has played a key role in negotiating the Senate version of a bill meant to crack down on Wall Street.Corker said that, before the bill goes to the Senate floor, lawmakers still need to work out some major disagreements over the details of the legislation.""So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans will block the motion to proceed to debating this bill?"" This Week host Jake Tapper asked Corker on the April 25, 2010, show.""I think that's very likely,"" Corker responded, adding that the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs voted the 1,336-page bill ""out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement."" In a chamber notorious for being slower than molasses, a 21-minute committee passage for a major bill is unheard of. Could Corker be right?Indeed, news reports of the March 22 Banking Committee vote all noted its unusual speed. According to Congressional Quarterly, the panel ""approved the legislation in less than 30 minutes."" A Fox Business article noted that debate ""lasted less than 20 minutes."" And a reporter for the Atlantic wrote that consideration started at 5 p.m. and ended at 5:22 p.m.So, Corker's pretty accurate with 21 minutes.And he's right that the Democratic leadership promised to negotiate further with Republicans before the legislation hits the floor. Sticking points include new regulatory authority over consumer financial products, such as credit cards and mortgages, as well as regulation of derivatives. Here's what Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd had to say the day his committee passed the bill:""The legislation I present today contains bipartisan ideas and is the result of a bipartisan effort. It does not, as of yet, enjoy bipartisan support. And so, while I will continue to work with my colleagues to build support and make the case for reform, I am moving forward today. ""Sen. Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the committee, also acknowledged further bipartisan work, according to Congressional Quarterly. ""By coming out today, working in a spirit of, down the road, a bill we can both be proud of, we’re not polarized,"" he said. (He didn't exactly complete his thoughts in that sentence, but his point was clear that he expected more bipartisan talks.)In fact, on the same day Corker appeared on This Week, the Associated Press reported that bipartisan talks were continuing on Capitol Hill. So, Corker is on solid ground when it comes to his claim that the mark-up was short and that he and other Republicans were promised another attempt at a bipartisan bill before the Senate takes up the legislation.But Corker's comment that the bill passed with ""no amendments"" is not entirely true. When it came time to actually debate the bill in committee, panel members first approved something called a ""manager's amendment,"" shorthand for an updated version of the bill that serves as a legislative blueprint for lawmakers to discuss and amend. That version included some important changes. For instance, Dodd scrapped his original idea to create an entirely new agency to regulate consumer financial products. Rather, he opted to establish a new regulator inside the Federal Reserve. Furthermore, the manager's amendment included more than 20 Democratic amendments. One, for instance, would give a new council looking for emerging threats to the financial system the authority to decide what events are likely trigger a liquidity crisis. It's also important to note that Republicans had many amendments of their own in addition to the ones in the manager's amendment. GOP members ""had queued up hundreds of amendments before abruptly withdrawing them,"" said an account in Congressional Quarterly. Dodd said his committee ""held an open markup. 401 amendments were filed with the committee, but my Republican colleagues did not bring up a single amendment and declined my offer to include some of their amendments in the manager’s amendment."" So, while it's unclear why GOP members decided to withdraw their amendments, it appears they had the opportunity to offer them. For his part, Corker lamented his leadership's decision not to offer amendments, telling the Huffington Post it was ""a very large strategic mistake. We had an opportunity to pass out a bill out of our committee in a bipartisan way, and then stand on the Senate floor and hold hands and say that we would keep amendments that were unnecessary and improper from coming onto this bill."" Corker's spokeswoman, Laura Herzog, told PolitiFact that in his comment on This Week, Corker wasn't trying to insinuate that the Republicans were somehow blocked from offering amendments but simply saying that he expected bipartisan talks after the bill passed the committee.But to say that no amendments were adopted at all is incorrect.  So Corker is correct that it only took the committee about 21 minutes to debate and vote on the bill, and he's also right that Democratic leaders promised more bipartisan negotiation before the legislation comes to the Senate floor. But he's wrong that the bill was passed without amendments. Dodd rolled more than 20 Democratic amendments into the final version of the bill. And Republicans had the opportunity to offer their own, but declined to do so. As a result, we find Corker's statement to be Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D9C1940>],/factchecks/2010/apr/25/bob-corker/corker-claims-financial-regulation-had-speedy-vote/

White says Perry's rental home will cost taxpayers more than $360,000
","With the state facing a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White recently aired advice to GOP Gov. Rick Perry on how to save the state some money: Move.In fall 2007, the state rented a home for the governor and his wife, Anita, about 11 miles southwest of downtown Austin so the Governor's Mansion could be renovated. In an April 13 press release, White, who faces Perry in November, calls the monthly rent an ""extravagant, unwarranted use of taxpayer dollars,"" adding that by the end of his current term, Perry ""will have drained Texas taxpayers ... of more than $360,000 to pay for the rental mansion he has been living in while the historic Governor's Mansion is repaired and renovated.""White then calls on Perry to ""set a budget-cutting example for other state employees and move out."" We wondered whether White's right about how much Perry's rented pad will cost taxpayers.Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, pointed us to a column in the Houston Chronicle that mentioned the monthly rent of the 4,600-square-foot home and to an earlier PolitiFact Texas item, in which we rated as Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that Perry ""lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month.""The lease for the house at 8113 Hickory Creek Drive, which last year was appraised by the Travis Central Appraisal District at $1.1 million, was initially for one year starting Oct. 1, 2007. The rent was set at $9,900.Less than a year after the Perrys moved into the rental home in a gated community near Barton Creek, the Governor's Mansion, just southwest of the Capitol, was heavily damaged in an arson fire for which no one has been arrested. Work has stopped on the mansion pending a decision on options for rebuilding the historical structure.In fall 2008, the lease on the rental home was renewed through October 2011 with the rent lowered to $9,000. Through this April, the state has paid $290,700 in rent. Toss in the eight months left in Perry's current term -- as White does -- and the total rental payments come to $362,700.So, does White get the tab for Perry's rented digs right? Yes -- and that's not counting other housing-related expenses.The state has not responded to requests for information on the costs of security at the governor's home-away-from-mansion.However, $197,000 has been spent on utilities and other items, such as preparing the rental residence for the governor, according to the Texas Facilities Commission and State Preservation Board. While we don't have an exact comparison of the ancillary costs of living at the Governor's Mansion, we know that in 2007 -- the last year that Perry lived there -- those bills, including for grounds work and utilities, totaled more than $330,000. (Kay Molina, assistant executive director of the Facilities Commission, said high maintenance costs that year reflected the fact that the mansion needed to be renovated.)Regardless, White nails the expected rent costs for the Perrys to reside in suburban Austin. We rate White's statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E4E32C0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/25/bill-white/white-says-perrys-rental-home-will-cost-taxpayers-/

Obama didn't expand offshore drilling, Boehner says
","UPDATE: This item was originally attributed to House Republican Leader John Boehner because we found this news release on his website. But after we published it, Boehner's staff pointed out to us that it actually originated with the Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee. So we are republishing the item and attributing it to them. Our analysis and ruling has not changed. A few weeks ago, President Barack Obama announced that he's going to open up new areas for offshore drilling.But according to conservative members of Congress, he's actually closing them.Here's such a claim in a news release from the Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee. ""Obama did not open new lands to offshore drilling – all of these areas were already open for drilling once Congress and President Bush lifted the moratorium in 2008. Instead, President Obama yesterday announced what areas he would CLOSE to offshore drilling.""The claim has been made by other Republicans, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin who said at the April 9, 2010, Southern Republican Leadership Conference that, ""after inheriting a good pro-development GOP plan, that opened up both coasts for drilling, the Obama administration halted development."" So yeah, we're confused.Obama's March 31, 2010, announcement about offshore drilling didn't come as too much of a surprise to those who have been following the issue closely. During the campaign, Obama went from being staunchly against the idea of allowing more drilling to saying he would be open to the prospect, a shift for which we gave him a Half Flip. So, when he said on March 31, 2010, that he'd be allowing new drilling, we made the call that he hadn't drifted too much from where he'd ended up at the end of the campaign.Here are the basics of Obama's plan, which lasts from 2012 through 2017: • The coasts of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and part of Florida's eastern seaboard will be open to ""exploration, study and potential development."" • The northern coast of Alaska in the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas will also be open to study and potential development. • The Bristol Bay area off of the southern coast of Alaska in the North Aleutian Basin is now protected by a presidential memorandum until 2017. Investigating whether the Republicans are right about Obama's drilling proposal requires a little history.In 1981, Congress authorized an annual offshore drilling moratorium, which was renewed regularly until 2008. Included in that ban were almost all of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts as well as parts of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1990, former President George H.W. Bush imposed an executive moratorium that overlapped with the areas prohibited from drilling under the congressional ban.In 2008, former President George W. Bush lifted his father's ban on drilling. And in the same year, amid high gas prices and election pressures, Democratic leaders allowed the nearly 30-year-old ban on drilling to lapse. Shortly before Bush left office, the Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior issued a new five-year leasing plan that proposed opening up areas in the Pacific, Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico to new drilling. Also included in the proposal were Bristol Bay as well as the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas.So, Obama was left with a drilling plan from the former administration, and choices to make as his administration crafted its own energy policy. Under the Bush plan, those areas would have been opened quickly with only a short period of time for citizens, lawmakers and others involved in the process to vet the proposal. So, on Feb. 10, 2009, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar decided to extend the comment period on the new plan for another 180 days. During that time, Salazar held public meetings in the areas that would be impacted by the new drilling. And that brings us to March 31, when Obama announced that he would be allowing new drilling. Looking at his plan -- and the proposal Bush put on the dockets right before he left office -- it's clear that Obama decided to move forward on some parts of the Bush proposal, including drilling in the Atlantic, but scrap other parts, such as drilling in the Northeast and in Bristol Bay.So, generally speaking, the Republicans are correct that the areas where Obama is proposing new drilling were already open when Bush and Congress lifted the bans in 2008. But there is one area that is part of Obama's proposal that was not protected by either ban. It's a swath of ocean in the eastern Gulf of Mexico that is off limits until 2022 as part of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. Congress will have to rescind this law in order for drilling to take place there. The Republicans on the committee also said that the only news in Obama's drilling announcement is what areas he plans to close to drilling. Indeed, Bristol Bay has been closed to drilling until 2017 by presidential memorandum. But areas off the coast of California, for instance, have simply not been included in Obama's current drilling plan, which lasts until 2017. So, they're not officially closed, just off the table for now. Republicans also point out that most areas in Obama's plan will be studied for potential drilling first, which could slow the entire process. In theory, some of those areas may never be leased at all, but that remains to be seen.Let's recap: There is some truth to the Republicans' assertion that Obama hasn't opened new areas to drilling given the Bush proposal that was already on the books. But he overlooked the patch of ocean in the eastern gulf that was not part of Bush's plan and is in Obama's proposal. On their second point, the Republicans are also on less than solid ground. Indeed, Bristol Bay -- which likely would have been leased for drilling under the Bush administration -- is closed to drilling, at least until 2017. But other areas not included in Obama's current five-year drilling plan, such as areas in the Pacific, are not technically closed; they're just unavailable for the time being. As a result, we give the Republican members a Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E4F3DC0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/23/house-natural-resources-committee-republicans/obama-didnt-expand-offshore-drilling-boehner-says/
"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Wasserman Schultz says health care law doesn't require Americans to get health insurance
","One of the most controversial elements of the recently passed health care law -- indeed, it has prompted lawsuits by state attorneys general, including Bill McCollum of Florida -- is a provision that tries to corral uninsured Americans into health plans.In a Jan. 19, 2010, news release, McCollum -- echoing the complaints of many fellow Republicans -- said that ""Congress's unprecedented mandate on every citizen to purchase health insurance coverage or to face a penalty raises serious constitutional concerns. The health care individual mandate provisions as currently drafted violate constitutional principles and lack constitutional authority for Congress to enact.""But some supporters of the bill object to the characterization of the new law as including an ""individual mandate"" to buy health insurance. One of the most forceful proponents of this view is U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from South Florida. At an April 5, 2010, town hall meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., an attendee asked, ""Congresswoman, who gave you the right or the authority to determine whether or not I have to purchase health care?""Wasserman Schultz responded, ""That's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. We actually have not required in this law that you carry health insurance. Let me explain what we did: What we did is that, just like when you're treated, that we categorize you differently in terms of your tax return when you're married versus single, just like we categorize you differently when you are a homeowner versus someone who doesn't own a home, just like we categorize you differently when you have children versus not having children -- what we are doing is you will be in a different tax status if you carry insurance versus not carrying health insurance. So you can feel free to choose not to carry health insurance. That's just going to be reflected in the tax category that you're in on your tax return. But there is no requirement in this law that you must carry health insurance.""Clearly, there's a huge gap between what McCollum believes and what Wasserman Schultz believes. In fact, the two camps don't even agree on the terminology. Health care experts have traditionally called the provision an ""individual mandate."" Critics of the bill tend to use this term as well. But the official term written into the bill is a ""shared responsibility payment"" -- a euphemism that downplays how mandatory the payment is.Confusing matters further is that the bill includes provisions that are contradictory, in spirit if not in letter.Section 5000A is titled, ""Requirement to Maintain Minimum Essential Coverage."" It reads, ""An applicable individual shall for each month beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage for such month. ... In general, if an applicable individual fails to meet the requirement ... for one or more months during any calendar year beginning after 2013, then, except (for hardship cases) there is hereby imposed a penalty"" on a predetermined schedule.So except for people who are exempt -- those for whom insurance premiums would be a financial hardship, Americans with religious objections, American Indians, undocumented immigrants and prison inmates -- this section of the law uses the word ""requirement"" twice and ""shall"" once. That sounds like a mandate to us.Not so fast, says Jonathan Beeton, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz. He cites two other provisions that would undercut the notion that the law imposes a mandate.The law also includes a section titled, ""Prohibition Against Compelled Enrollment,"" referring to the newly created health care exchanges -- the virtual marketplaces where uninsured Americans and those without affordable insurance, starting in 2014, can go to buy a health plan.""Nothing in this title,"" the section says, ""shall be construed to compel an individual to enroll in a qualified health plan or to participate in an exchange.""In a separate passage titled, ""Freedom Not to Participate in Federal Health Insurance Programs,"" the law says that ""no individual ... shall be required to participate in any federal health insurance program created under this act (or any amendments made by this act), or in any federal health insurance program expanded by this act (or any such amendments)....""So, even as the bill talks of a ""requirement"" to obtain health insurance, it also issues a ""prohibition against compelled enrollment"" and a guarantee of ""freedom not to participate in federal health insurance programs.""What to believe? Essentially, it comes down to the eye of the beholder.The mechanism for enforcing the policy is the tax code. Indeed, the formula on how the penalties will be levied is defined in a way that only a tax accountant could love. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation summary of the law, ""those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income. The penalty will be phased in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1 percent of taxable income in 2014, 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment.""Got that?Some health care experts suggest that the tax penalties are not high enough to push uninsured Americans into health plans. The experts suspect that many people will opt to pay a modest penalty rather than pay for coverage.So there is indeed an opt-out. But it's a matter of interpretation whether you consider that more like a tobacco tax (in which the government uses taxes to to advance the policy goal of reducing smoking but stops short of using law enforcement to compel people to do so) or like a requirement for car insurance.For this reason, we don't think Wasserman Schultz's comment merits a False. But we also find that it's a significant exaggeration because she ignores what many people would reasonably describe as a mandate. Using government power to enroll people in health plans has never been a trivial part of the reform effort; it's always been central to the goal of getting more healthy people to pay into the system.When House Democrats first introduced their health care bill, the summary they released said, ""All individuals would be required to get coverage, either through their employer or the exchange, or pay a penalty."" While the summary cites the availability of subsidy assistance, it says nothing about ways to get around the requirement.The White House's own website explains that the law ""asks everyone to take responsibility for improving America's health care. In order to lower costs for all Americans and extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, all Americans who can afford to purchase insurance will be asked to."" And at the Blair House health care summit on Feb. 25, 2010, President Barack Obama acknowledged that when he ran in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, he was ""opposed"" to the individual mandate. But he added that he was later ""dragged, kicking and screaming, to the conclusion that I arrived at, which is, is that it makes sense for us to have everybody purchase insurance.""So, critics of the bill are not dreaming when they say that the individual mandate, by whatever name you prefer to call it, has always been a key part of the Democrats' health care reform push.Like many complex laws, the health care bill is sometimes contradictory, a reality that has fed confusion over what the newly enacted measure would actually do. We believe that on a technical level, Wasserman Schultz is correct -- Americans are ""not required"" under the law to carry health insurance. But her statement is still misleading. The bill's supporters may have been loath to remind voters about the individual mandate for understandable political reasons, but the notion of a ""shared responsibility"" to obtain health insurance has always been a publicly acknowledged part of the Democratic approach to overhauling health care. Wasserman Schultz's comment strikes us as a too-cute attempt to spin the bill in the wake of attacks by the bill's critics.

Is Rick Scott the top Republican governor candidate on Facebook?
","Wealthy Florida businessman Rick Scott entered the Republican primary for governor on April 9, 2010, promising to wage a new kind of campaign against the veteran politicians running for the GOP nomination, state Sen. Paula Dockery and Attorney General Bill McCollum. Scott launched his first TV ad on April 13, 2010, and quickly set up a Facebook page.In just a week, Scott says, that new campaign already is showing promise.Scott, a former hospital CEO and outspoken opponent of President Barack Obama's health care reform, said on April 19 that his fan page on the social networking website Facebook already reaches more people than the pages of Dockery and McCollum, who both have been running for months.""Thanks to you, in under one week we have the largest GOP (Facebook) page in the Governor's race!"" Scott said in a status update.The number of people who follow a Facebook page isn't the most significant measure of support (the press secretary for Dockery follows Scott's Facebook page to keep track of her opponent's campaign, for example, and political journalists and strategists follow most candidates' pages in case they make news). But the total number of followers on Facebook and Twitter is a statistic campaigns like to throw around in order to appear web-savvy and more popular.It also can be a way for a campaign to test messages, or organize events.We measured the three Republican candidate fan pages at 11:30 a.m. on April 21, 2010. Scott had 5,611 people who ""like"" his page.McCollum had 5,070.Dockery had 4,281.We should point out, however, that likely Democratic nominee Alex Sink, the state's chief financial officer, had 10,779 people who ""like"" her page.Still, when it comes to the Republican campaign for governor, newcomer Scott says he can reach more people on the social-networking website Facebook than either McCollum or Dockery and he's right.

The facts on the risks of nuclear power plants
","Not only is nuclear power reliable and efficient, it's also extremely safe, Sen. Lamar Alexander wrote in an op-ed column in the newspaper The Hill. ""No member of the American public has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power — a record unmatched by other fuels,"" wrote Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, along with Theodore Rockwell, a fellow of the American Nuclear Society and a vice president of Radiation, Science and Health Inc. Considering the history of incidents like Three Mile Island and the deadly Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, we decided to take a closer look at the history of commercial nuclear power plants, and see if, in fact, no one has ever been killed by commercial nuclear power in the United States. In order to help narrow our search, we decided not to count a death from a workplace hazard, for example slipping and falling. We're specifically looking at the workers in plants who are killed from the process of creating nuclear power. Alexander's staff told us the senator got his facts from the American Nuclear Society Web site, which states in a ""Myths and Facts"" section that ""No member of the public has ever been injured or killed in the entire 50-year history of commercial nuclear power in the U.S."" We confirmed that with David Decker, congressional analyst for the government's Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal agency in charge of nuclear plants. ""I believe that the senator's statement was that there have been no deaths due to nuclear-related accidents at commercial nuclear power plants. From our perspective, this would be true,"" Decker said. There have, however, been deaths at nuclear plants. Some people have died in workplace accidents in non-nuclear areas of the plants. And three fatalities occurred at a research reactor rather than a commercial plant (Alexander specified commercial plants). Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Oversight Project at Beyond Nuclear, a group that works to eliminate nuclear use in the United States, cited an accident that killed three men in 1961. They were members of the military working at an experimental nuclear plant in Idaho Falls, Idaho. They died in an accident related to the improper removal of control rods and a chain reaction of the uranium, according to a 1961 Milwaukee Journal article. The explosion released so much radiation that rescuers could only enter the area to recover the bodies for one minute at a time. The bodies were so radioactive that they were buried in lead caskets. (One is at Arlington National Cemetery.) In a 1986 incident, four workers were killed at the Surry power plant in Virginia from the rupture of a pipe that sprayed workers with scalding water and steam. But the accident happened in a non-nuclear portion of the plant. Despite these deaths, nuclear power does stack up as one of the safest forms of energy. It's difficult to get a good comparison with other power-source fatalities because the numbers don't necessarily separate between common workplace hazards and those specifically related to the power source. But for comparison, 13 people have been killed in hydroelectric power generation since 2003, and fossil-fuel electric power generation has killed 23 since then, said Andrew Marsh, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So while people in the United States have been killed in non-commercial plants and in non-nuclear areas of a commercial plant, Alexander is right that no has been killed ""by commercial nuclear power."" And those statistics and the most complete numbers we can find for other energy sources confirm his claim that it is a record unmatched by other fuels. So we find his claim True. Update: This report mistakenly said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not keep numbers on injuries in nuclear power generation plants. We have removed the inaccurate sentence. Our ruling and analysis has not changed.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D90D280>],/factchecks/2010/apr/22/lamar-alexander/facts-risks-nuclear-power-plants/
"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama campaign financed by large donors, too
","New financial regulations are pending in Congress, but both political parties get a lot of campaign contributions from the people they intend to regulate -- Wall Street. The financial sector donates millions to both Republican and Democratic candidates. And during the last couple of election cycles, Democrats have outstripped Republicans, who have traditionally been thought of as more business-friendly. Those political realities have made for interesting dynamics as the negotiations on financial regulation continue. President Barack Obama answered questions on this topic in an interview with CNBC's John Harwood on April 21, 2010.""In the 2008 campaign, you got a lot of money, about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs,"" Harwood said. ""Your former White House counsel Greg Craig is apparently going to represent Goldman Sachs. In light of this case, do either of those things embarrass you?""""No,"" Obama said. ""First of all, I got a lot of money from a lot of people. And the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country. And moreover, anybody who gave me money during the course of my campaign knew that I was on record again in 2007, and 2008, pushing very strongly that we needed to reform how Wall Street did business. And so, nobody should be surprised in the position that I'm taking now because it is one that I was very clear about in the course of the campaign.""What jumped out at us in this exchange was Obama's statement, ""the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country."" We've seen that statement repeated elsewhere, but the evidence doesn't back it up.Campaign contributions are public record, so there's verifiable data on how much political candidates receive and who gives it to them. Obama did raise a lot of money from small donations collected over the Internet, and several groups have analyzed the information to determine how much that was. While Obama got more money from small donors than his opponents, they did not account for the majority of his funds. We're setting the bar for a small donor as someone who gives $200 or less. The Federal Election Commission rules say that someone who gives this amount does not need to publicly disclose their name, address, occupation and employer.In the general election, Obama got about 34 percent of his individual donations from small donors, people who gave $200 or less, according to a report from the Campaign Finance Institute. Another 23 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and another 42 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. His numbers for the primary were similar. He got about 30 percent of his money from donors who gave $200 or less. Another 28 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and 43 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more.These numbers were compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, and included in a report Reform in an Age of Networked Campaigns, which was published jointly with the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute.  During the campaign, Obama ended up opting out of the public financing system for presidential candidates, because the system limits how much money candidates can raise, and Obama realized he could raise much more money outside of the system. (Read more details from our previous report, 'Parallel public financing'? Only partly.)Obama was bothered about opting out of the public financing system, because he believed it would undercut his moral authority in arguing for campaign finance reform, according to Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, who wrote about the decision in his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win. So the campaign considered opting out of the federal system but limiting contributions to $250.""The idea sounded appealing,"" Plouffe writes. ""But when our finance staff ran the numbers, it became clear this option would produce the worst of both worlds: we would not raise enough money to justify the pummeling we would take.""Obama supporters like to counter that Obama raised more money from small donors than any previous candidate for president, which is true. But Obama still needed large donors to fund his campaign. Obama implies that he won the presidency without much money from large donors, and the evidence does not support that. In fact, even if we set the bar for small donors higher -- if we stipulated that everyone who gave less than $1,000 was a small donor -- that still means 43 percent gave more. And the interviewer, John Harwood, was correct when he said Obama got about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs; the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics puts the number at $994,795. Obama's skill at raising money from small donors for the 2008 campaign was significant. But Obama was also skilled at raising money from large donors. His statement was, ""the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country."" That's not the case. Only 32 percent of his general election money came from people who gave $200 or less.

"['History', 'States', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry recaps his comment on Texas seceding from the United States; does he repeat accurately?
","
Last week marked the anniversary of Gov. Rick Perry’s oft-quoted Texas-can-secede comments after a tea-party rally outside Austin’s city hall. Coincidentally, the Texas Tribune and Newsweek interviewed Perry in his Capitol office on April 15 and the opening back and forth between editor Evan Smith and Perry touched on what the governor said about secession the year before. 
""I always like to try to clear that up,"" Perry tells Smith. ""It was asked as a, you know, what do you think about the people who shout out the word 'secede.' And I say that we live in an incredibly wonderful country and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen…"" 
We wondered if Perry accurately recaptured his 2009 remarks. 
Perry's office didn't respond to our inquiry. Next, we turned to the original exchange as recorded by Kelley Shannon, Austin correspondent for the Associated Press. She spoke to him shortly after Perry spoke at the rally. (The audio and a transcript are fetchable from the ""About this statement"" section of this article, to the right.) 
According to the recording, Shannon initially asked if he thought the gathering reflected a national movement. Perry answered that it could be and that people feel strangled by spending and taxation; they want help. 
Shannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. Perry gave a 40-second reply, which we transcribed and provide here.

""Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios,"" Perry said. ""Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. 
""You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot."" 
Perry next fielded a question from someone else about whether Texas might now be considered a natural terorrist state — no, Perry said — and the less than three-minute question-and-answer period ended. 
At the time, Perry’s comments were widely interpreted as indicating the Republican governor believed secession could legally occur; he subsequently did not back down from that conclusion. 
However, a constitutional expert advised at the time that the Civil War long ago vanquished secession as a legal option. 
Sanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said within the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States of 1845, there is no explicit right for the state to return to its days as a Republic. Levinson said there is ""no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a 'right' to secede."" 
Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows for Texas to break into five new states, and it doesn’t specify whether that would require congressional approval. But, he said, that's distinct from secession. 
In looking back at his 2009 comments, Perry told Smith that at the time he was focusing on economics -- ""people’s concern and anger about what this administration is doing from an economic standpoint in particular and the long-term debt that was being created for not only them but for future generations."" 
All in all, does Perry accurately revisit his original comments on secession that day? 
For the most part, yes. However Perry doesn't get to his assertion that Texas has the right to secede or his speculation about ""who knows what may come"" from people angry about actions in Washington. 
We rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E01AF40>],/factchecks/2010/apr/22/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-recaps-his-comment-texas-seceding-u/
"['Science', 'Texas', 'Kay Bailey Hutchison']","
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison says if the space shuttle program is retired, Russia and China will be the only countries capable of launching humans into space
","
Pushing a plan that would land astronauts on Mars within the next 30 years, President Barack Obama envisions private companies ferrying American astronauts to the International Space Station until rockets are devised to reach deep space. 
Not thrilled: U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas and the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Hutchison recently blasted a budget request Obama sent to Congress that effectively dashes hopes of funding additional space shuttle flights after the last mission slated for the end of this year. The station has been orbiting Earth some two hundred miles up since 1998. 
""We must close the gap in U.S. human space flight or face the reality that we will be totally dependent on Russia for access to space until the next generation of space vehicle is developed,"" Hutchison said in a March 3 press release. ""If the space shuttle program is terminated, Russia and China will be the only nations in the world with the capability to launch humans into space."" 
Hutchison introduced legislation the same day to delay the shuttle program's retirement until the United States develops its next-generation space vehicle. 
""The Administration proposes to retire the shuttle as scheduled while discontinuing years of work on development of a new launch vehicle and provides no short term solution to deliver critical equipment and components to the International Space Station that are essential to extending the life of the station until 2020,"" according to the press release. 
Ground control to Moscow and Beijing? 
Obama has elaborated on his NASA plan since Hutchison objected. On April 15, at a White House-sponsored space conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Obama outlined his vision for space exploration, which included restoring a space capsule that could be used as an emergency escape vehicle for crew members on the space station. 
The president still wants to shelve the 30-year-old shuttle program as planned. He said, however, ""we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable."" The shuttle program's last flight is expected to occur in September. 
By 2025, under Obama's plan, the U.S. would have a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts into deep space; trips to Mars would begin in the mid-2030s. And NASA would have until 2015 to finalize plans for a heavy-lift rocket to carry astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit. 
Where does that leave Hutchison's claim that if the shuttle program is shuttered, Russia and China will be the only nations capable of launching humans into space? 
For starters: John Yembrick, a spokesman at the NASA office of space operations, told us that between the time the space-shuttle program is set to shut down later this year until the commercial sector becomes capable of sending astronauts into orbit — lately projected at 2015 — American astronauts would travel into space on Russian spacecrafts. 
Next, the Senate Commerce Committee pointed us to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website, where we brushed up on space-race history. 
The Soviet Union launched the first satellite to orbit Earth in 1957. Yuri Gargarin, a Russian, became the first person to travel in space in 1961; Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to set foot on the moon in 1969. In 2003, China sent its first astronaut into space. In 2004, test pilot Michael Melvill became the first astronaut launched into space by a private company — Scaled Composites of Mojave, California. 
Most U.S. astronauts work for NASA, and live and train at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. Their Russian counterparts, cosmonauts, train near Moscow and launch from and land in Kazakhstan, the nation sharing part of Russia's southeast border. NASA launches astronauts into space aboard shuttles while cosmonauts travel aboard space vehicles called Soyuz, which, unlike the shuttles, are not reusable. Both 'nauts helped build and then worked aboard the space station. 
Byron Tapley, director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, said other countries are striving to launch people into space, including India, Japan, Ecuador, Iran and Malaysia. ""India and Japan are the most developed of this set,"" Tapley said. ""But neither is very close to being able to claim 'current capability.' The capability for safely placing a human in orbit is much more demanding than the capability for placing a satellite in orbit."" 
We rate Hutchison's statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA0C080>],/factchecks/2010/apr/22/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-if-space-shuttle-pro/

Charlie Crist website stripped of Republican references, state lawmaker says
","Now that Gov. Charlie Crist is openly flirting with an independent run for the U.S. Senate, many of his old Republican friends are dashing for the exits.Crist's mentor, former Florida U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, yanked his support on April 15, 2010. House Speaker Larry Cretul, who had been neutral, didn't just endorse Crist's rival Marco Rubio on April 20, 2010, but openly bashed Crist in the process.State Rep. Tom Grady, R-Naples, became the latest Crist backer to jump ship in an e-mail to Crist dated April 20, 2010.Grady, who said Crist convinced him to run for the Legislature, said he was resigning from Crist's statewide finance team and would no longer be the Southwest Florida regional chairman of Crist's campaign.""This evening, as I reviewed your updated campaign website, I noticed a disheartening fact,"" Grady wrote in an e-mail. ""Your website has eliminated all references to our Republican Party, or as you frequently refer to it, the party of Lincoln.""As a long-time personal friend, I suspected you were considering a break from the party when my recent calls went unanswered. This comes at a time when we clearly differ on what it means to be a conservative with a firm belief in less government, less taxing, less spending and more freedom.""Crist has said he hasn't made up his mind whether he will continue to run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, or as an independent candidate with no party affiliation. (He has to decide by April 30th).But is Crist's campaign website already tipping his hand?Indeed, the website, http://CharlieCrist.com, is largely devoid of mentions that Crist is a Republican. That's not unusual -- candidates often don't emphasize their party in hopes that they can attract more broad support. But it's not hard to figure out what party he represents -- at least for now.His homepage has a link to the ""Charlie Crist Conservative Record,"" and his official biography describes his as a ""common-sense conservative"" who was ""Florida's first elected Republican Attorney General.""The website includes an electronic button for people to download that says ""Conservatives for Charlie Crist"":  And it still includes a press release from April 8, 2010, in which campaign manager Eric Eikenberg says Crist would run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, not an independent. The Palm Beach Post went back and found other press releases referring to Crist speaking at Republican events and Lincoln Day dinners, and also commenting on the resignation of his hand-picked Republican Party of Florida chairman, Jim Greer. In a Jan. 5 press release, Crist said: ""I call on Florida Republicans to unite behind our common values of less government and more personal freedom and sincerely hope that we can move forward together to ensure statewide Republican victories in 2010.""Crist campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Palm Beach Post that ""no Republican references have been scrubbed from our website, period.""The St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald also asked Crist about Grady's comments. Q: Did you remove any references to the Republican Party from your website, as alleged by Rep. Tom Grady and other Republicans who have withdrawn their support?A: ""No.""Q: What's your reaction to Grady’s repealed endorsement? A: “So be it.” Looking for additional proof, PolitiFact Florida went to a website called Internet Archive, which stores versions of old websites. But that site hasn't created a moment in time snapshot of CharlieCrist.com since July 30, 2008.Post reporter Michael Bender used another website, ChangeDetection.com, that tracks changes to specific websites and e-mails people when a change occurs. Bender, who says he has been following changes to CharlieCrist.com ""for the past couple years,"" said no reference to “Republican” has been eliminated from the site. We couldn't independently verify Bender's claim because we just started following Crist's website on ChangeDetection.com.But what's even more critical is that Grady, himself, said he has no proof Crist “eliminated” anything from his website. He said it was fair to make the accusation, according to the Post. “This wasn’t a trial,” he said.By contrast, the front page of Marco Rubio's website has images of Rubio and 2008 GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney and features the endorsements of U.S. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, Cretul and has the message ""Will Charlie Abandon the GOP again? Marco is the only Republican we can trust to stand up to Obama, and trust to stay a Republican."" But Rubio's campaign biography does not say that he's a Republican. Back to Grady's statement. In rescinding his endorsement, Grady said Crist removed Republican references from his U.S. Senate campaign website. No, there's not a prominent picture of Crist hugging Ronald Reagan on the site, or a big splashy ""R"" next to Crist's name, but there is still considerable talk about Crist's conservative credentials. It's in his biography, detailed in press releases and on issue statements, and available for viewing on a computer near you. Plus, if you were going to remove reference to the GOP, you would likely also remove the press release promising not to run as anything other than a Republican. There's no evidence the website has changed. We rate Grady's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E360180>],/factchecks/2010/apr/21/tom-grady/charlie-crist-website-republican-independent/

State Sen. Dan Gelber boasts about raising the most money in Fla. attorney general race
","State Sen. Dan Gelber says he has received more contributions than any other candidate in the race to become Florida's next attorney general.''We received over $325,000 in contributions – and we did this during a shortened fundraising quarter of two months,” he wrote. ''I have received more contributions than any other candidate in the race – Republican or Democrat. Since announcing last year, our contributions total just under $1 million.''We wondered if this was accurate, so we checked in with the Gelber campaign where aide Christian Ulvert told us the actual number was $321,000.We went to the Division of Elections website to see how that stacked up with the other candidates.We confirmed the $321,000, but noted that he included in-kind donations. Those would include restaurants comping Gelber for campaign events and the Democratic party sending staffers to assist from elsewhere but not charging for the hours.So we ran our own numbers using the same yardstick for first-quarter figures and found that state Sen. Dave Aronberg, another Democrat in the race, raised more -- $328,543 to Gelber’s $321,426. None of the Republican candidates broke $100,000. (Holly Benson raised $97,566.48; Pam Bondi raised $44,337 and Jeff Kottkamp, $27,230.)We also decided to check the total for the entire campaign, which goes back to June 2009. There again, Aronberg edged out Gelber, $999,609.87 to Gelber’s $991,922.35.Ulvert, Gelber's aide, then tried to move the goalposts by suggesting his boss' claim was true because ''we have the greatest number of contributors to our campaign. Our total contributors are 3,487.'' This, in fact, is true. The state database counted 91 more individual contributors to Aronberg’s 3,396 with none on the GOP side breaking the 2,000 mark.We don't accept that interpretation. When someone says contributions, we believe it's universally interpreted as the dollar amount.Said Aronberg campaign spokeswoman Allison North Jones: ''He is leading the public to believe -- and his supporters and his donors and everyone else -- that he had raised significantly more than his opponents.''For his part, Gelber conceded in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida that he did not outraise his opponent in the race. Rather, he said, ''We were innocently and unknowingly comparing apples to oranges,'' because Aronberg had published his fundraising totals first, minus in-kind donations. The Gelber campaign believed Aronberg's figures included in-kind contributions.''Of course the difference turned out to be very, very minor ($8,000 in a million dollar race),'' wrote Gelber. ''Although I did not know or try to say when I wrote the e-mail that we had a greater number of contributors than Dave (which is pretty important as it shows actual level of support) -- I assumed we did and that did turn out to be totally true and accurate.''The e-mail didn't focus on number of donors.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Retirement', 'Social Security', 'Taxes', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan's federal dole statistics omit important details
","In a recent speech, Paul Ryan, top Republican on the House Budget Committee, made the case that President Barack Obama's policies are only making people more reliant on federal assistance.He used recent passage of the health care overhaul to make his case to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs on March 31, 2010.""A growing centralized bureaucracy will provide for everyone's needs, care for everyone's health, direct everyone's career, arrange everyone's important private affairs, and work for everyone's pleasure,"" the Wisconsin congressman said. ""The only hitch is, government must be the sole supplier of everyone's happiness ... the shepherd over this flock of sheep."" Even before Obama entered office, citizens were getting too much help from the government, Ryan contends. According to a 2007 report by the Tax Foundation, he said, in 2004, ""20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. In other words, one out of five families in America is already government dependent. Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent of their income from federal programs, so another one in five has become government reliant for their livelihood.""Ryan went on to say that more families are supporting themselves ""plus - through government - supplying or supplementing the incomes of... other households. As a permanent arrangement, this is individually unfair, politically inequitable, and economically dangerous.""On Ryan's latter point, we checked a similar claim made by Sen. John McCain during the presidential campaign. He said that ""50 percent or 40 percent of the American people — of taxpayers — American citizens don't pay taxes, federal income taxes,"" a statement we found to be Mostly True. Ryan adds a new dimension to McCain's previous claim, that many people are making much of their income off the government, and we wondered if he's correct. The Tax Foundation report in question looks at data collected between 1991 and 2004. It concluded that in 2004, the federal government's ""effective spending rate,"" or the percentage of household income received from the government, on the poorest households that Ryan refers to in his statement was about 74.5 percent. The federal government's effective spending rate on the second poorest group of households was 38.7 percent.Those figures include benefits from Medicare and Medicaid, housing services, Social Security and welfare programs. We ran Ryan's quote by one of the authors of the report, Gerald Prante, who made two important points.First, he noted that the effective spending rates are an average. So, for instance, some households in the bottom 20 percent are getting more than 75 percent of their income from the government, but some are getting less, he explained. So, it's incorrect to say that each family in that bottom 20 percent is making 75 percent of their income from the government.The same holds true for the second quintile that Ryan also references.More importantly, Prante pointed out that the figure Ryan cited also includes federal spending on public goods -- resources that benefit everyone including national defense, natural resources, and so on. ""While technically defense spending could be counted as adding to one's income, broadly defined, the hint that this is all transfer spending is incorrect,"" he wrote to us in an e-mail. ""Part of that 75% is defense spending 'received' by low-income people.""In fact, another table in the report shows that, excluding effective federal spending rates on public goods, the poorest households get about 56 percent of their income from the government and households in the second lowest income bracket get about 27 percent of their income from the government. In an e-mail, Angela Kuck, Ryan's Budget Committee's spokeswoman also mentioned that the income from the government drops when you subtract spending for national defense and other costs that all U.S. citizens share. Ryan left out this important detail.  Still, although the numbers he cites are arguably inflated, that doesn't negate his underlying point -- that many people are getting a significant amount of their income from the government. But there is another weakness in Ryan's statistics. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, pointed out that the study includes elderly people, who draw heavily on government support in the form of Medicare and Social Security. ""Do we want to include the elderly in this picture? Is Social Security a pure transfer? It's not like it's free money,"" because people spend their whole life paying taxes into those programs, Williams said. The report is pretty up front about that fact. High spending rates in the lowest income brackets are ""largely driven by spending on government transfer payments to elderly households — many of whom reside in the lower income quintiles — and other government aid to low income households. Nevertheless, when spending on Medicare and Social Security are removed, lower income households still benefit more from the government than higher income households.""       So, where does that leave Ryan's claim? It is true that many people get assistance from the government, and many of them are in the lowest income brackets, but Ryan has cherry-picked numbers from the report and omitted crucial information about what the figures represent.  The percentage of households getting 75 percent of their income from the federal government is an average; some get more and some get less. Also, a significant chunk of that federal spending is on public goods that benefit every member of society. And a notable number of people who get the most assistance are the elderly receiving benefits they paid for earlier in life. As a result, we find Ryan's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550642D00>],/factchecks/2010/apr/21/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-federal-dole-statistics-omit-important-/

Reid says financial regulation bill 'will end taxpayer bailouts'
","As the long-awaited bill to curb risk and excess on Wall Street nears a Senate vote, key Republicans and Democrats have sparred over what the bill does and does not do.Much of the debate has been over whether the bill stops or encourages ""bailouts."" This became a special focus of attention after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised opponents of regulation that ""the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout.""In an April 19, 2010, floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that the bill ""will end taxpayer bailouts."" That came a few days after Reid's Republican counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at an April 14 press conference, ""In fact, if you look at it carefully, it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks."" McConnell added that the bill ""actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks"" and that it sets up ""in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions.""In a separate item, we ruled McConnell's statement False. Here, we'll tackle Reid's claim.First, some background on the financial regulations now under consideration in the Senate, with the caveat that the bill is something of a moving target. There are separate House and Senate versions, and once a unified version becomes law, there may be specific regulatory aspects delegated to federal agencies. That said, the Senate bill would grant the government additional authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds. It would establish a new consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve to regulate financial products, and it would create a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse.On this last point, the bill would set up a panel of three bankruptcy judges to convene and agree within 24 hours whether a large financial company is insolvent. If a ""systematically significant"" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The FDIC ""shall impose assessments on a graduated basis, with financial companies having greater assets being assessed at a higher rate,"" according to the legislation. We should clarify that there will be no change for small, mid-sized and even fairly large banks; when they're in trouble, there's already a well-established mechanism, under FDIC authority, that is not considered a bailout.Instead, the ""bailouts"" at issue are those for the small number of very large, highly interconnected institutions -- those sometimes called ""too big to fail"" because their collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy.The legislative language is very specific about the money being used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says:""In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary.""There is some speculation that the industry-financed fund, envisioned to be $50 billion, could be dropped from the bill, since it wasn't in the White House's original proposal. But the provision was still in the bill when Reid spoke, so we'll factor it into our analysis.A big challenge in analyzing Reid's statement, or any like it, is figuring out what exactly the word ""bailout"" means.""It is almost impossible to pin politicians down on this one because 'bailout' has no clear meaning,"" said Douglas Elliott, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank. ""It could cover a very wide range of things, some of which involve taxpayer money and some don't, and some of which are traditional central banking or deposit insurer roles and others of which are novel.""Free-market purists may see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a ""bailout."" However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company taxpayer money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as ""a rescue from financial distress."" We don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a ""rescue."" In fact, the bill would pay for the so-called ""orderly liquidation"" by assessing a fine on the firms themselves, not by using general revenue, a situation somewhat similar to the way the FDIC has handled failing banks for many years now, using fees it collects from other banks to pay for orderly shut-downs. So, if we use our preferred definition, does the bill truly ""end taxpayer bailouts""? We spoke to a variety of financial-services experts, and most (though not all) agreed that the bill would be a step in the right direction, in all likelihood reducing the risk of the government having to undertake another bailout. That's the case in part because the bill aims to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place.Still, even those who felt favorable toward the bill's aims found Reid's statement to be too definitive.For a truly large and interconnected institution, several sources said, $50 billion probably won't be enough to do an ""orderly liquidation."" Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, said that given past history, that figure is ""laughable"" and that ""$300 billion would be the minimum reasonable starting point.""And if the danger to the wider economy from a potential collapse is perceived to be big enough, the federal government will probably bite the bullet and lend some financial support, our sources agreed.""No matter who is in charge, administration officials faced with the threat of a systemic/liquidity event will feel the need to 'pull out all the stops' to avoid it – in which case, at that moment, they may actually be justified,"" said Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The bill gives ""somewhat wide latitude"" that makes a ""straightforward unwinding unlikely,"" Thallam said. ""Any little bit of light underneath the door will inevitably be exploited.""Ultimately, our sources agreed that while the bill makes aggressive efforts to reduce the likelihood of bailouts, it doesn't make them illegal. And short of, say, passing a constitutional amendment ruling out bailouts, any future Congress or administration would be able to act as conditions demanded. ""Nothing, not even a bill by Mr. McConnell, would rule out bailouts,"" said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. ""There's no realistic legislation that could absolutely guarantee no bailouts.""Finally, a word about Reid's reference to ""taxpayer."" It's true that the bill, as of now, would use an industry fund to pay for winding down troubled companies, meaning taxpayers would not be directly involved. But James Gattuso, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, writes that whether the money comes from other banks or from taxpayers is ""a distinction without a difference,"" since the costs would eventually be passed on to consumers. In addition, Peter J. Wallison, a fellow with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, added that the message communicated to financial services firms -- that someone will be there to help you out if you get in trouble -- undercuts the bill's stated effort to reduce lending risks and prevent institutions from becoming ""too big to fail.""When we contacted Reid's staff to elaborate on his comment, a spokesman cited an interview with Sheila Bair, the head of the FDIC who was appointed by George W. Bush and who continues to head the agency under President Barack Obama. Asked whether the bill would ""stop"" bailouts from happening, Bair responded, ""It makes them impossible and it should. We worked really hard to squeeze bailout language out of this bill.""We agree that the bill takes genuine steps toward reducing bailouts. But we find it a stretch to argue, as Reid does, that the bill will ""end"" them. So we rate his statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EB88100>],/factchecks/2010/apr/21/harry-reid/reid-says-financial-regulation-bill-will-end-taxpa/
"['Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Democratic National Committee']","
Texas organizer for Democratic group says student-lending law is largest-ever investment in higher education
","A Texas-based Democratic activist hailed recent congressional action on student loans by laying claim to history. Luke Hayes, Texas state director of Organizing for America, which is part of the Democratic National Committee, said in an April 7 press release: ""The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act is the largest-ever investment in higher education..."" Ever? We endeavored to learn more. Ricardo Ramirez, a DNC spokesman, said Hayes' statement was based on a Web page kept by the House Committee on Education & Labor, chaired by U.S. Rep. George Miller, D-California. A sentence on the page when we visited said the adopted Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act makes the ""single largest investment in higher education ever."" Miller spokeswoman Rachel Racusen told us that the law frees up close to $40 billion over the next 10 years by ending government subsidies to student lenders. The money is to be spent on bolstering the Pell grant  program, which serves needy college students, and funding other college grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the fiscal impact of legislation, has said the student-lending changes will save the government nearly $61 billion in the 10-year period. The office estimates that of those savings, $36 billion will go to Pell grants, $2.2 billion to assist colleges historically serving blacks or other minorities and $750 million to other college-access grants. Racusen said another $7 billion will go to higher education thanks to health-care related changes in law, putting the historic total investment headed to higher education at more than $45 billion over the 10 years. That's not chicken feed, but we wondered how the roughly $4.5 billion per year compares to past investments in higher education such as the GI bill, which started funding college for veterans after World War II, or the flurry of scholarship grants and loans launched in the 1960’s. Over two days, we were unable to come up with total expenditures for those developments, but experts on higher education agreed that spending on those efforts has been substantial. Donald Heller, director of the Center for the Study of Higher Education at Penn State University, advised us of at least two flaws in the ""largest-ever"" claim posted by the House committee: the projected spending will be spread over 10 years, and the annual total will run short of what the federal government already delivers to higher education. One example: Pell grants for this year alone will account for more than $30 billion in spending, according to Jason DeLisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation, a non-partisan public policy institute. Heller suggested we check research by the authoritative Chronicle of Higher Education. In 2008, the Chronicle said federal spending on research at U.S. colleges and universities exceeded $25 billion during fiscal 2006. Multiply that by 10, representing a decade, and the ballpark federal spending on research at colleges and universities is $250 billion. Racusen, Rep. Miller’s spokeswoman, conceded there may have been larger expenditures in higher education over the years—such as that $250 billion in federal research aid. However, she said, it’s not appropriate to compare research dollars to direct spending on students. Racusen said in an e-mail: ""There is a significant difference between research funding, which may be sent to a university but is not considered supporting higher education because it is not used to help students pay for college, or other purposes that involve a students' quality of education at a particular university (such as improve dorms, fund campus services, etc.), and investments in higher education, which are intended to help support the student side of higher education."" Also, Racusen said, discretionary spending—which requires annual action by Congress—doesn't have the oomph, or stability, of the student-loan law, which remains in place unless a future Congress changes course. Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the Washington-based American Council on Education, offered his take: ""This is the single-biggest concrete investment in Pell grants that we’ve ever had … Is it absolutely positively the highest investment in higher education we’ve ever had? I’m not sure that’s the case. But this is a certifiably big deal."" Hartle later shared figures reflecting several such large funding streams. For instance, some $650 billion in college loans are currently in ""repayment"" by students and their families, evidence of a mammoth commitment to higher education. Hartle said a revision of veterans' benefits after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 promised more spending on higher education -- $60 billion in benefits over 10 years -- than the latest action on student lending, though individual veterans still would have to request the approved assistance. And, Hartle said, a 2007 college-cost reduction act was estimated to have a $32 billion value over 10 years. All in all, he said, ""an enormous amount of money has been made available to help low and middle class families over just (the last) four years.""Hartle said it'd be correct to say the lending-law change is ""damn close"" to the largest-ever investment in college student aid. DeLisle suggested the new law's significance lies less in the amount of money generated for higher education than in the fact that powerful lending interests were overcome to make it happen. ""Congress was able to shut out one of the biggest and most effective lobbying machines that has ever been around Washington,"" he said. Adding everything up: Hayes' claim would have been close to spot-on if he'd limited the ""largest-ever investment"" descriptive to ""one-time decisions by Congress boosting grants to needy college students,"" admittedly a not-so-pithy mouthful. We're not the only ones to divine this difference. As we finalized this article, the House committee rewrote its online statement to state that the law is the ""single largest investment in federal student aid ever."" Racusen told us: ""Given your feedback, we wanted to make sure we were as clear as possible."" We rate Hayes' statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DFB2A40>],/factchecks/2010/apr/21/democratic-national-committee/texas-organizer-democratic-group-says-student-lend/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist said he wasn't thinking about it, but now he is
","UPDATE: Crist announced April 29, 2010, that he is running for the Senate as a candidate ""without party affiliation."" So we have published a new item on this and rated it Full Flop. ""I'm running as a Republican. I'm very proud to be from the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, others that really have stood up for our party, like Ronald Reagan. This is a great party. It has a great future. We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we put a candidate up that can win in November.""(Q: So are you ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th deadline?)""That's right. That's right. I'm running as a Republican.""- Gov. Charlie Crist, March 28, 2010""I'm getting all kinds of advice. I take my cues from people in Florida. That's what I care about. I want to be very thoughtful in this. This is a decision that has to be made by (April) 30th, and I want to do what's right for the people of our state.""- Gov. Charlie Crist, April 19, 2010 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gov. Charlie Crist's admission that he could skip the primary election for U.S. Senate and run as an independent in November has thrown political analysts and the GOP establishment into a frenzy.It also means that we get to unveil our first item for the Florida Flip-O-Meter.The Flip-O-Meter was created during the 2008 campaign to examine how a candidate's position on an issue has changed over time. We then declare whether the candidate has truly flipped using three ratings:No Flip No substantial change of position. The candidate has been consistent.Half Flip A partial change of position or inconsistent statements.Full Flop A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.As PolitiFact editor Bill Adair pointed out back in 2008, we're not making a value judgment about flip-flopping. Some will say it shows inconsistent principles and lack of backbone. Others argue it's just pragmatism and willingness to compromise. In this case, we're examining Crist's statements on whether or not he'd consider an independent bid for the U.S. Senate. Under Florida law, Crist must declare whether he's running for the GOP nomination or as an independent by April 30. There's no sore-loser provision like in Connecticut, for example, where Sen. Joe Lieberman lost a Democratic primary in 2006 but was able to win the general election as an independent.If Crist ran as an independent, he could remain a registered Republican, and keep much of the money he has raised to date and use it for the November general election. While polls show him trailing far behind former House Speaker Marco Rubio in a GOP primary, he is even in a three-way November race with Rubio and likely Democratic nominee U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek.It appears the first published mention that Crist could run as something other than a Republican fell at the bottom of a South Florida Sun-Sentinel column on Jan. 3, 2010. The columnist, Stephen L. Goldstein was writing a piece about nine things Crist could do to reinvent or revive his political fortune now this his once insurmountable lead against Rubio had vanished.""9. If Charlie really wants to win the U.S. Senate seat, he could pull a Joe Lieberman and become an Independent. That would turn the race into a brawl. He'd draw Republican and Democratic votes -- and probably win,"" Goldstein wrote.The line, however, got little additional attention.It took another month, until February, for talk of a Crist-indie bid to get a full airing in the mainstream press.That was fueled by two polls in early February that had Rubio ahead of Crist by 12 and 14 points. At a news conference, reporters asked if he would run as a Democrat or an independent.""Not a thought in my mind,"" he said.By the end of February, still trailing in the polls, Crist said he was still running as a Republican, but didn't categorically rule out a run as no-party candidate.To a reporter for the conservative news website Human Events: ""Some friends of mine talked to me about it, but I haven't embraced it. I'm running as a Republican.""To the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald: ""It's not something I'm thinking about,"" Crist said. ""I'm comfortable about the race. I know what the numbers are, but we've got six months to go, and the public really doesn't know the opponent.""Then came the March 28 debate on Fox News Sunday. Moderator Chris Wallace pressed Crist on his plans. (By now, pollsters were asking Floridians about Crist running as an independent). Here's the exchange: WALLACE: There have been persistent rumors in Florida that you are so far behind, at least currently, in the polls — double digits to Mr. Rubio — that you may run instead as an independent. Here is your chance to dispel all the rumors. Are you willing to pledge right here, right now that you will run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and not run as an independent?CRIST: I'm running as a Republican. I'm very proud to be from the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, others that really have stood up for our party, like Ronald Reagan. This is a great party. It has a great future. We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we put a candidate up that can win in November.WALLACE: So are you ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th deadline?CRIST: That's right. That's right. I'm running as a Republican. On April 8, 2010, Crist campaign manager Eric Eikenberg sent out a similarly strong and clear message.""To put these rumors to rest once and for all, as we have said countless times before, Governor Crist is running for the United States Senate as a Republican,"" Eikenberg said. ""He will not run as an Independent or as a No Party Affiliation.""“This should completely and utterly put to rest any of the unfounded rumors coming from the Rubio campaign that Governor Crist would run as anything other than the Republican that he is.” But it didn't. Not in the least.Crist, who was 46 percentage points ahead against Rubio in a Quinnipiac University survey last year, now trails in the same poll by 23 percentage points.Talk about a party switch only intensified after Crist vetoed a Republican-led teacher pay bill that would have linked pay raises to student performance infuriating many in the state GOP. Then, on April 19, 2010, Crist said he was considering a different course.Crist told the Associated Press that he could quit his GOP primary race and run for the Senate as an independent. Crist said in a phone interview he intends to be ""very, very thoughtful and deliberate"" as he makes up his mind.He told the St. Petersburg Times that ""this is a decision that has to be made by (April) 30th, and I want to do what's right for the people of our state.""And the The New York Times: ""What I think is right for me to do is to be guided by the people of Florida, not by people in Washington, D.C.”So to review the change: Crist and his campaign repeatedly said he would run as a Republican, first during a debate broadcast nationwide on FOX News Sunday and then again in a campaign press release. And now, Crist says he is pondering a party switch ahead of an April 30th deadline.When asked how he would explain a no-party bid after repeatedly saying he would not do so, Crist said, ""Things change.""We'll be watching to see how this shakes out, and we're prepared to update our ruling. But for now it's clear that Crist has opened a door he once locked shut. We rate Crist's statements a Half-Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E003C80>],/factchecks/2010/apr/20/charlie-crist/crist-said-he-wasnt-thinking-about-it-now-he/
"['Energy', 'Florida', 'Paula Dockery']","
State Sen. Paula Dockery says state constitution bans oil drilling off Fla. coast
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Paula Dockery said in a video interview that there’s a constitutional amendment that protects Florida’s coastline from oil drilling.She made the claim in an April 5, 2010, interview with Kathleen Walter on the conservative Newsmax.TV website, as part of a wide-ranging interview in which she discussed the state's economic challenges and the need to proceed carefully with plans to tap offshore oil resources.""First of all we have constitutional amendment that says that there's a ban on drilling right off Florida's coast,"" she said. ""So the devil's in the details …"" Offshore drilling is a hot topic in Tallahassee this year because of now stalled legislation that would allow drilling in state waters that extend about 10 miles into the Gulf of Mexico and 3 miles into the Atlantic Ocean. The federal government generally controls waters more than 10 miles offshore, while Florida and other states control the waters inside 10 miles and could reap a windfall from new oil leases. Fueling the debate is President Barack Obama's plans to lift drilling barriers farther from the shore. He wants to open up the Atlantic from Delaware to central Florida and plans to ask Congress to repeal a ban on drilling in the gulf within 125 miles of Florida's beaches. Statewide candidates in Florida walk a difficult tightrope on drilling. They want to appeal to voters who are paying $3 a gallon for gasoline and support new offshore sources of oil, but the candidates don't want to alienate coastal voters who oppose drilling because of the possible impact on beaches and tourism. Dockery, a state senator from Lakeland, was trying to talk along that thin line when she made her comment. But we consulted the Florida Constitution, and several experts, and could find no such amendment.Rather, the experts told us that the fate of near-offshore drilling is in the hands of the Florida Legislature, which in the 1980s adopted a ban in state waters. It was passed ""in the wake of the Exxon-Valdez spill by the Florida Legislature"" and designed to protect their coastal waters, said Mark Ferrullo, executive director of Progress Florida, a drilling opponent.The lack of a constitutional protection is ""why they’re trying to do it through legislation"" in a bill that was tabled April 16. So we checked with candidate Dockery, who explained why we couldn’t find the relevant constitutional amendment: Because it doesn’t exist.""I meant to say a statutory ban but I misspoke,"" the state senator wrote in an April 19 e-mail.She cited the Florida statute that specifies the restrictions. The statute prohibits oil and gas drilling leases within Florida's ocean boundaries, while the feds have jurisdiction outside that boundary. One expert we consulted, advocate Adam Rivera at Environmental Florida, which likewise opposes drilling, wondered if the senator’s soundbite was actually ""wishful thinking on her part -- and ours. Hey, if she’s looking to get that process started, we’re right there with her.""To be sure, it was an error. But Dockery owned up to the mistake when PolitiFact Florida inquired about it. So we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DFD0040>],/factchecks/2010/apr/20/paula-dockery/state-sen-paula-dockery-says-state-constitution-ba/
