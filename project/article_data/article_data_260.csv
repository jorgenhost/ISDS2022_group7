Minnesota tops Wisconsin on average wages by $5,000 a year, Mary Burke says
","Democrats ripping jobs gains under Republican Gov. Scott Walker often point to the post-recession progress in Minnesota, where the jobs recovery has outpaced that of Wisconsin. Walker, meanwhile, prefers comparisons to Illinois and its budget problems and big tax hikes. In September 2013, we rated Half True a Minnesota lawmaker’s claim that the Gopher State is ""kicking butt relative to Wisconsin"" on employment, school test scores, workforce education and other rankings. But we haven’t, until now, tested claims of an income gap. Gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke proclaimed such a gap in June 6, 2014 remarks to delegates gathered in Lake Delton for the state Democratic Party’s annual convention. ""As you know,"" Burke said, ""our current governor has made quite a name for himself. His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin."" She added: ""But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We’re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota."" Let’s see if Burke’s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up. What the numbers show Burke’s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others. All show Minnesota on top. -- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2013 data is the most recent available. -- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin’s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers’ wages and salaries but ""proprietor’s income"" from self-employment. -- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor’s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota’s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. So Burke’s figures are solid. More about the numbers In her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker’s policies are linked to the wage gap. Given all the factors that influence a state’s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke’s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker. The Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs. When we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker's economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven't improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker’s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase. By any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker’s first two years. It grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods. The average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent. The gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker’s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge. It’s not that Wisconsin’s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It’s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase. But Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap. In combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs. Minnesota ran up part of its lead on these: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Registered nurse $71,160 $64,460 Management, all positions $107,130 $97,920 Dentist $193,100 $177,430 Police and sheriff patrol officer $58,220 $54,140 Social worker (child/family/school) $59,830 $49,720 School bus driver $32,500 $29,190 Computer systems analyst $81,560 $75,170 Lawyer $126,520 $105,080   Wisconsin holds the upper hand in other categories, including: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Farm, fishing, forestry $30,910 $31,260 Retail Salesperson $23,730 $24,420 Mortician, undertaker, funeral director $58,340 $65,720 Chiropractor $72,810 $90,170 Pediatrician $185,550 $200,480 According to a bankrate.com calcuator, the Minneapolis area’s cost of living is 8.5% higher than that of the Milwaukee metro area. Our rating Burke told delegates at the state Democratic convention that ""the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota"" under Walker’s policies. The gap is real and Burke hit the mark with her description of it. The gap has grown or held steady in Walker’s time depending on the measuring stick used. Burke didn’t say Walker created the gap, but the disparity is a longstanding one, and one that existed and grew under governors of both political stripes. We rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/18/mary-burke/minnesota-tops-wisconsin-average-wages-5000-year-m/
"['Georgia', 'County Government', 'John Albers']","
Is it illegal if Fulton skirts the law?
","The curious image of Fulton County commissioners being led away in handcuffs – for the crime of voting on their annual budget – recently popped into PolitiFact’s head. The reason? Fulton is taking steps to raise its countywide tax rate for the first time since 1991. Leaders in Georgia’s largest county say the state constitution was on their side when they voted last year to repeal a property tax cap that affects only Fulton. That set the stage for this year’s proposed increase. But state lawmakers point to House Bill 604, which bars Fulton from raising taxes until 2015. Any tax increase above the rollback rate – the millage that would raise the same money as last year – violates that law. ""Contrary to law, the Fulton County Commission has taken preliminary action to move forward to increase property taxes,"" state Sen. John Albers, R-Roswell, wrote in an email blast to constituents. ""This is both illegal and immoral."" Illegal? That gives us the image of time in the clink – and makes it necessary to vet this one quickly since Fulton is taking up the issue of advertising the tax increase at its meeting Wednesday. Fulton Commission Chairman John Eaves says the law created by HB 604 violates the state constitution by singling out the county and removing the job of its leadership to set taxes. Moreover, advertising a rate increase doesn’t mean the County Commission will move forward to raise taxes, he said. The commission could lower the rate from the one advertised when it adopts the final rate this summer. ""A final millage rate will not be set until our citizens have had an opportunity to be heard,"" Eaves said. ""We are duly elected to ensure that the services our citizens have come to expect are available to them."" The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.211 mills. That’s about $817 on a $275,000 home with the $30,000 homestead exemption. The proposed rate of 11.781 mills – a 17 percent increase above the rollback and a 15 percent jump from the existing rate -- would add about $125 to the bill from last year and $140 from the rollback rate. State lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission for years, saying their constituents do not get their money’s worth for those taxes. After unsuccessfully pursuing state legislation to split Fulton into two counties by lopping off the northern part, lawmakers drove home their belief that county government spends too much money by passing HB 604. ""Fulton County already has a bloated budget, and this is us trying to make them responsible and follow the law,"" Albers said. ""If not, we will seek a court battle, and that just means taxpayers will be paying even more to fight themselves. That makes no sense."" But does disagreeing with a law mean acting against it is illegal? Reminding us of why people hate lawyers (and reporters), the legal experts say no. Unlawful, and illegal, are not synonyms in the technical sense, said Jack Williams, a professor of law at Georgia State University. The legislative branch of government – whether it’s the Legislature at the state level or a county commission locally – can adopt laws and speak to whether something is lawful, Williams said. But in our separated system, it’s up to the courts to decide whether a law is legal. For instance, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But not until 2012, when the Supreme Court upheld what’s become known as Obamacare, did it become legal. ""It’s a political statement. It’s not a legal one,"" Williams said of the ""illegal"" claim. ""He may be right in the end, but we don’t know yet. That’s why we pay taxes to build courthouses."" But does it matter that most people aren’t attorneys and therefore have a different understanding of what ""illegal"" means? Maybe. After all, elected officials are sworn into office promising to act in accordance with state law and the constitution, said Mary Dudziak, a professor of law at Emory University. ""Acting contrary to (the law) would be a law violation, whether or not a court has ever ruled on it,"" Dudziak said. ""And it is not out of line for a lawmaker to say that a local tax is ‘unlawful’ because it is in conflict with a state statute."" Ah, which brings us back to the difference between unlawful – something that violates a law – and illegal – a court’s decision on whether a law can be enforced. In that sense, parsing words matter. Albers said it would be ""illegal"" for Fulton to raise its taxes. That isn’t up to him any more than it is to the commission, regardless of common understanding of the word. For that reason, we rate his statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/18/john-albers/it-illegal-if-fulton-skirts-law/

Rick Scott took the 5th Amendment 75 times, Democratic party ad says
","The Florida Democratic Party launched its first TV ad this year in the governor’s race and the subject is a familiar one: the investigation into Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s former health care company. ""Maybe you’ve heard about what was the largest Medicare fraud in history, committed when Rick Scott was a CEO,"" the narrator says. ""Or that Scott’s company paid record fraud fines of $1.7 billion dollars. And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times. Meaning, 75 times, Scott refused to answer questions because – if he had – he might admit to committing a crime."" The ad launched June 17, 2014, and is airing in West Palm Beach and Orlando, as well as Tampa Bay, which is home turf for Democratic front runner Charlie Crist. Earlier this year, we fact-checked a similar claim by the Democrats about the $1.7 billion fine, rating it Mostly True. Here we will fact-check whether Scott took the Fifth Amendment 75 times. It’s not a new topic, for Scott or for us. We fact-checked similar claims during Scott’s first race in 2010. Columbia/HCA Scott started Columbia in 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country’s largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals. In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from facilities across the country including in Florida. Scott resigned in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations, but the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion. Scott’s deposition Scott gave a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one ""shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."" But that deposition was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government. In fact, Scott was never officially questioned during the federal criminal investigation. The deposition was part of a civil case in which Nevada Communications Corp. alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. (The records of Scott’s deposition were distributed to reporters by Scott’s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum in 2010.) The deposition shows that Scott repeatedly refused to answer questions. Scott's lawyer first interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking simply if Scott was employed. ""Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today,"" Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. ""Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself."" Scott then went on to read the same answer, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- ""Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution."" The Democrats’ ad doesn’t tell viewers that the deposition was part of a civil case unrelated to the federal government’s criminal fraud investigation. However, Scott’s reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment was as a result of the criminal investigations, his lawyer said. What about other depositions? The Democrats’ ad makes a reference to multiple lawsuits: ""And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times."" ""The Nevada Communications Corp. case is the only lawsuit where Scott took the Fifth 75 times,"" Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida. (The ad includes video footage of Scott from a 1995 case -- not the 2000 case which is the focus of the ad.) Karp pointed to a 2010 Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times article which stated that Scott gave ""murky testimony"" in a series of depositions. An example: In a 1997 deposition when he was asked about an apparent agreement he made with a Texas doctor, Scott said: ""I don't know what your definition or anybody's definition of an ‘agreement’ is, or an ‘offer’ is, or ‘promise’ is.'' What he ‘might’ admit to if he had testified The ad states that ""Scott refused to answer questions because, if he had, he might admit to committing a crime."" We can’t fact-check what Scott might or might not have admitted, but it’s worth noting a few things about the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal court to suggest guilt, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1956. In a civil case, things get a little murkier, and judges or juries can infer what they want from  a person using the Fifth Amendment. ""The bottom line is that in a civil case, the judge and jury are free to draw the inference that 'a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,' "" George R. Dekle, Sr., a professor of law at the University of Florida, told PolitiFact Florida in 2010. ""However, there can be myriads of reasons other than guilt which prompt a person to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, and it might be just as reasonable to infer that the witness refused to answer for some other reason."" Scott’s response During the Univision debate in October 2010, Scott was asked about the deposition: ""With regard to that deposition, that was years after I left HCA. It was just, you know, all the same trial lawyers that are supporting my opponent, they were doing a fishing expedition, and they sat there, you know, it was a case I knew nothing about, I was not involved, I was not a defendant. So to stop the fishing expedition I just didn't do it."" As for the case itself, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times in 2010, ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader."" Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party’s TV ad states that when Rick Scott ""was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times."" We have two quibbles with the ad: the Democrats don't specify that the deposition was from a civil business case -- not the federal government’s criminal fraud investigation into Columbia/HCA. However, Scott used the Fifth Amendment due to that federal investigation. Also, the ad refers to multiple lawsuits -- Scott was deposed in separate lawsuits, but he took the Fifth Amendment 75 times in only one of them. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/17/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-took-5th-75-times-democratic-party-ad-s/
"['Georgia', 'Census', 'Stacey Abrams']","
Is most of Georgia's population growth from minorities?
","Georgia’s changing demographics has become fodder in political circles about what those numbers could mean come November. The talk focuses broadly on the population growth in the state and just who has been moving in. The Democrats’ idea: follow the Obama administration’s successful playbook and win over those folks with voter registration and turnout efforts to capture their party’s bid for U.S. Senate and governor. We decided to check claims by House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat who also heads a nonprofit focusing on voter registration, on the numbers involved. ""In Georgia, during the previous decade between Census counts, more than 1.5 million new neighbors set up homes in the state,"" Abrams wrote in the Huffington Post. The majority of those arrivals were minorities, she said. In Georgia, race is often a good predictor of political affiliation. Racial minorities in the state tend to vote Democratic, according to experts. With polls showing both the Senate and governor’s race as competitive, those numbers could matter, so we decided to take a look at how they stack up. Abrams told us she got the numbers from the U.S. Census, the actual count of people living in the United States that the government takes every 10 years. The primary focus of that numerical snapshot is to decide the number of seats each state will get in the U.S. House of Representatives. For that reason, the total count is quite reliable. In 2000, Georgia had 8,186,453 people. A decade later, the count was 9,687,653. That’s almost exactly the 1.5 million Abrams cites to HuffPost. More complicated is the question of minorities. The Census form specifically states that Hispanic origin is not race. For that reason, most recent Census form asked two questions about race – identifiers such as white or black – and ethnicity, which includes the question about Latino or Hispanic origin. Yet a growing share of Americans don’t pick a race category on the form, according to Census news releases. That results in figures that aren’t quite as refined, especially over time when the questions regarding race and ethnicity have changed somewhat. Robert Bernstein, a Census spokesman in Washington, D.C., walked us through the numbers as the agency sees it. Tucked into one table in both Census sets were population counts by race, and a separate breakout of those not considered Hispanic or Latino. ""That is effectively the minority population,"" Bernstein said. For Georgia, there were 3,057,772 non-white people in the state in 2000. By 2010, that number increased to 4,273,733. That means 1.2 million of the 1.5 million new people in Georgia between Census counts were non-white – or 81 percent. Abrams said her focus was meant to be the substantial numbers involved in the population and how that matches up with voter registration. ""The conversation is about engagement,"" Abrams aid. ""There is an important philosophy of having all citizens engaged in the process."" Citizen is the key word. The Census counts all people – regardless of age, legal status or citizenship – living in the state. Voting, of course, is open only to citizens who are at least 18 years old. That explains, in part, the other demographic reality: the majority of Georgia’s active voters, generally defined as someone who has voted in the past three years, are white. Data from the Secretary of State’s office shows that, in May 2002, 72 percent of the state’s active voters were white. That number plunged to about 59 percent as of November, data shows. But the 2013 figures also show more than 323,000 new white voters. That means the percentage of non-Hispanic whites is smaller than it had been, but even there, Georgia is seeing more voters, said Alan I. Abramowitz, an expert on American political demographics at Emory University. ""There is a lag between the changing demographic of the population and the changing of your electorate,"" Abramowitz said. ""Both are definitely changing, that is true, but not at the same rate."" To wrap it up, Stacey Abrams hit the mark with her numbers. The significance of those changes, though, don’t immediately translate into similar shifts in the makeup of the state’s voters. If the point is to identify and register more would-be voters, more refined numbers about citizenship and age would be needed. For that reason, we rate Abrams’ statement as Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2014/jun/17/stacey-abrams/most-georgias-population-growth-minorities/

Viral meme says gun homicides are down 49 percent in past 12 years
","In the social media wars over gun control, a new social-media meme makes the case that gun violence is wildly exaggerated by the media. ""Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years. Only 12 percent of Americans know that. Tell us again how unbiased our media is,"" the Facebook post said. A reader sent us the posting and asked us to fact-check it. We’ll focus our attention on the claim about gun homicides, but we’ll also touch on the media question later on. Trends in gun homicide We began by looking at year-by-year statistics on gun homicides compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the meme’s language was clear about focusing on ""homicides,"" we didn’t include statistics for suicides, gun shootings with undetermined causes, or ""legal interventions,"" such as justified shootings by police. The most recent data is for 2010, so we went as far back as 1998 to define the 12-year period. This table summarizes what we found:   Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1998 11,798 4.28 1999 10,828 3.88 2000 10,801 3.84 2001 11,348 3.98 2002 11,829 4.11 2003 11,920 4.11 2004 11,624 3.97 2005 12,352 4.18 2006 12,791 4.29 2007 12,632 4.19 2008 12,179 4.01 2009 11,493 3.75 2010 11,078 3.59   This disproves the clear wording of the meme. Over the past 12 years, the number of gun homicides is down 6 percent, and the rate of gun homicides is down 16 percent. Both are well below the 49 percent claimed in the post. However, we also found that the statistic did come from somewhere. The 49 percent decline emerged from 2013 report by the Pew Research Center. It found that gun homicides (or more specifically, the rate of gun homicides per 100,000 residents) had declined by 49 percent between their peak in 1993 and 2010, a period of 17 years. We double-checked Pew’s calculations of the CDC figures and found that they were correct. Between 1993 and 2010, the gun homicide rate fell from 7.02 per 100,000 to 3.59 per 100,000, or a decline of precisely 49 percent. Here’s the rundown of those earlier years:   Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1992 17,488 6.82 1993 18,253 7.02 1994 17,527 6.66 1995 15,551 5.84 1996 14,037 5.21 1997 13,252 4.86   It’s possible to chalk this mistake up to a simple typo -- after all, if the claim had said 17 years rather than 12, it would have been correct. However, the time frame raises important issues. For one thing, the CDC data show that the big decline in gun homicides came between 1993 and 2000, which happens to coincide with the years Bill Clinton was president. While Clinton and his policies are hardly the only reason for this decline, his signing of tighter gun-control legislation makes him unpopular among the kinds of gun supporters who might have created this meme. By contrast, by framing the decline as happening over the past 12 years, the meme implies that George W. Bush -- a president much more friendly to gun-rights supporters -- can take some credit for the decline.      More importantly, by making this mistake, the meme misunderstands the overall trend lines of gun homicides. Gun homicides didn’t decline 49 percent over the last 12 years -- rather, they declined precipitously over six years in the 1990s, then have remained basically stagnant for the past decade or so. Why is this important? Because the decline, to a large degree, has to do with a specific reason -- the end of the crack epidemic. The decline in gun homicides in the 1990s ""was largely a reversal of an upward trend that occurred in the mid-to-late 1980s,"" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ""There would not have been much of a downturn were it not for the surge. This up-and-down change was primarily in cities and among offenders under age 25, and indeed have much to do with crack markets and gang activity."" In fact, the Pew study made the same point, noting that ""by the early 1990s, crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand, and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime. At the same time, a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated, due in part to stricter laws, which helped restrain violence among this age group."" Fox said another reason for the decline in gun homicides overall was a specific decline in cases that involved intimate partners. After 1993, when the pro-gun-control Brady Law was passed, ""there was a decline in gun homicides by women against their partners, but no decline in non-gun killings,"" he said. Media bias? The meme also takes a shot at the media for burying this large decline. But that’s not deserved. Just the first two pages of Google search results show articles about the Pew study appearing in the following outlets: • Associated Press • Washington Post • CNN • NPR • NBC News • Yahoo News Oh, and PolitiFact. As for the claim that ""only 12 percent of Americans know that,"" the meme got the percentage right, though of course it got the substance of what that 12 percent knew wrong. ""Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago,"" the report said. ""According to a new Pew Research Center survey, today 56 percent of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12 percent think it is lower."" Our ruling The social media meme said that ""gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years."" The gun homicide rate is actually down by 49 percent over the past 17 years, but this seemingly minor mistake betrays a significant misunderstanding of how rates have fluctuated over the past two decades. During the past dozen years, gun homicide rates have been largely static; their big decline mostly came in the years before the meme even started counting. The meme is not just incorrect; it’s a distraction from what actually happened. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/16/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-gun-homicides-are-down-49-percent-/

Nugent ties gory photo to Bergdahl prisoner swap as 'one of the subhuman mongrels our president set free'
","Ted Nugent, the one-time rock guitarist turned Second Amendment rights activist, could probably stand to brush up on his Web surfing skills. A few days ago, Nugent posted a horrific photo on Facebook of a bearded man, bloody knife in hand, squatting behind five gory heads. ""One of the subhuman mongrels our president set free,"" Nugent wrote in the caption. ""Feel safer yet?"" (Nugent created a controversy earlier this year when he called President Barack Obama a ""subhuman mongrel."") A reader alerted us that Nugent's post was spreading fast (users have shared it more than 100,000 times) so we wanted to check whether the man in the photo is one of the five Taliban leaders released from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. He is not and there is no way that he could be. The image reportedly was tweeted by the man in the photo on March 15 and not one of the five Taliban prisoners. We say reportedly because the original tweet has since been removed. However, we can use news accounts to piece together what happened -- and why this image is not of the Taliban prisoners.  For starters, the five Taliban officials were released May 31, 2014, more than two months after the image was first released. Tha man who originally tweeted the image goes by the name Abdurahman. Abdurahman came from Iraq and lived in Holland for 10 years before returning to fight in Syria and Iraq. The image was the source of an article in de Volkskrant, a major Dutch newspaper, on March 17. The article identifies the man in the image as Khalid K. from Almere, Netherlands. Although the photo itself is no longer available on the Web, the description in the Volkskrant article matches the image in Nugent’s post. An American blog post from March 23 leaves no doubt the images are the same. The site D.C. Clothesline links back to the Volkskrant and includes the photo. On April 17, Live Leak, a British-based image and video sharing website, carried an entry with the photo. The headline was, ""Dutch-Iraqi ISIS terrorist cannibal butcher and behead five Al Qaeda terrorists beheader (sic)."" How'd things get mixed up? The image returned recently with people claiming it was Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners swapped in exchange for Bergdahl. The urban myth website Snopes reviewed the revival of the disturbing photo on June 10. It noted that the image had appeared many times on Facebook with the claim that the man was ""Mohammad Fazi (sic), just one of those great terrorists that this administration traded for the deserter. He seems like a really proud terrorist in this photo. I sure hope everyone feels safer knowing this guy is now free."" Without using Mohammed Fazl’s name, Nugent apparently borrowed much from such posts.

Bill Cassidy said Senate Democrats only moved to fund new VA clinics after scandal
","As details of the turmoil within the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to unfold, Congress is scrambling to pass legislation to fix to the problem. One House Republican accused Democrats of closing the barn door after the horse got out. ""It’s been more than 177 days since the House passed bipartisan legislation that would authorize these VA clinics,"" Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement on June 5, 2014. ""Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action. We need to continue working towards patient-centered solutions so all veterans have access to quality healthcare."" Is it true that Senate Democrats only moved to fund new veterans health clinics after the scandal broke in April? In a word: No. The bill Cassidy references is H.R. 3251, the Department of Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Lease Authorization Act of 2013. The bill, authored by Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., authorized the funding of 27 new Veterans Affairs health facilities around the country. On Dec. 10, 2013, the House passed the bill almost unanimously with a vote of 346 to 1. (Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., was the lone ""no"" vote.) The bill stalled in the Senate. In fact, it never made it out of the Veterans' Affairs committee. But as is so often the case, the Senate was working on its own bill, and that one failed because Senate Republicans objected to it. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced S. 1950, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014, on Jan. 16. (It would later be renumbered S. 1982). The scope of the bill was much broader than just funding 27 new VA health clinics. For example, it also included an expansion of physical and mental health benefits for some veterans and their families. Whereas Miller’s bill was nine pages, Sanders’ was 367 pages. Republicans objected to several components of Sanders’ bill, including its funding mechanism. Sanders would pay for his bill with money that would have gone toward the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Republicans said those savings were already expected, so it wasn’t a real source of money. (For what it’s worth, the House bill did not really specify where its funding would be taken from.) Republicans also hinged support for the bill on the inclusion of sanctions against Iran. Democrats tried to bring Sanders’ bill up for a vote on Feb. 27. Republicans made a parliamentary maneuver that imposed a 60-vote threshold to bring it to the floor. With just 56 Senators voting ""yea"" — including two Republicans — the bill failed to advance. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Veterans' Affairs committee, said he was concerned about the costs and the expansion of the VA when there were already considerable problems with wait times. In a press release, the American Legion lamented the bill’s failure. ""There was a right way to vote and a wrong way to vote today, and 41 senators chose the wrong way,"" American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said. ""That’s inexcusable."" That said, there wasn’t unanimous backing of the bill by veterans groups. In an op-ed, Stew­art Hickey, national exec­u­tive direc­tor for American Veterans, or AMVETS, said Sanders’ ""kitchen sink-like"" bill ""would be morally irre­spon­si­ble and fis­cally unsound."" For the next couple months, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Sanders went back and forth on the status of the veterans bill. On March 11, Vitter offered an amendment to to the House bill that would pay for the new VA clinics through price controls for prescription drugs purchased by the Defense Department. Sanders said he supported the new clinics, but also wanted other provisions included in the comprehensive legislation. On April 9, Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, announced that dozens of Arizona veterans died waiting for care from the VA, and he had evidence showing that administrators at the Phoenix office were forging wait times. There were multiple points along the way when Sam Foote, a doctor of internal medicine at the Phoenix VA before he retired, attempted to blow the whistle on the bad practices in Arizona, including a December meeting with the Arizona Republic and a letter to the VA inspector general. But it wasn’t until Miller’s comments that the story broke and became a national scandal, eventually leading to the resignation of Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Also on April 9, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. — who Cassidy is challenging for Senate in November — actually called for the House Republican bill to be discharged from the Senate Veteran Affairs committee. But that effort was blocked by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who asked for Vitter’s amendment to be included. Sanders objected. ""Both parties had a role in this,"" said Joe Davis, spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars. A spokeswoman for Cassidy said the congressman was only referring to Senate inaction on the House measure in his statement. However, that isn’t how his statement reads. If that were the case, it would mean that Senate Democrats had decided to take up the House bill after the scandal hit, which isn’t true. Our ruling Cassidy said that ""only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action."" That’s not accurate. Democrats tried to pass an expansive veterans’ bill that included funding for the same 27 new clinics that Cassidy and the House passed last December. The bill was blocked by Senate Republicans, who were concerned about its funding and its scope. They also wanted to include sanctions against Iran. It’s fine for Cassidy to say Democrats bear some responsibility for not taking up the simpler House legislation, but it’s incorrect for him to claim that it took the scandal to propel Democrats into efforts to pass a VA bill. That’s revisionist history, so we rate Cassidy’s statement False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/16/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-said-senate-democrats-only-moved-fund/
"['Veterans', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee']","
Democratic group says Rep. Sean Duffy has a long record of votes against VA backlog fixes
","As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats’ campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out a news release claiming that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.)  -- and other Republicans -- voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014 news release, which was headlined ""Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."" ""As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congressman Sean Duffy’s votes tell the true story of his record: when he had a chance to fix this problem, he voted against the fixes."" The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, ""It’s a shame that when Congressman Duffy had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA he voted no. Congressman Duffy voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better."" PolitiFact National rated a similar DCCC claim against U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami and rated it False. (The DCCC issued a series of virtually identical news releases) Leaning heavily on PolitiFact National’s work, here is a look at how the claim fares when used against Duffy. VA backlog In the item on Ros-Lehtinen, PolitiFact reporter Amy Sherman wrote: We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Duffy  as voting against veterans’ interests. Of course, political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. As the Ros-Lehtinen  item noted: It’s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Duffy voted against a service for veterans, there are other votes which he voted for veterans’ services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Duffy joining his Republican colleagues. That said, let’s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes • Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn’t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Duffy voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the ""previous question"" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated ""if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act."" Enyart then explained his veterans’ bill and urged a ""no"" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted ""no"" while the Republicans voted ""yes,"" which defeated his effort. Something the DCCC omitted is that in October 2013, Duffy had voted to establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure passed, 404-1. • Increasing funds to reduce the backlog in disability claims: The DCCC said Duffy  voted no, along with nearly every Republican, on a motion that would have added $9.2 million to hire an additional 94 VA claims processors tasked with reducing the disability claims backlog. The June 2013 motion was a ""motion to recommit"" on an appropriations bill to fund military construction and veterans affairs. A ""motion to recommit"" in the House refers to a last-ditch attempt by the minority party to amend a bill before it passes. Left unsaid: The overall bill, which did pass, provided money to address the backlog, just not as much as Democrats proposed. • Mental health funds: On June 2, 2011, Congress agreed in a voice vote to set aside $20 million for suicide prevention for veterans. On June 14, 2011, Duffy voted against a Democratic motion to recommit that would add $20 million for veterans’ suicide prevention. The GOP argued that such services were already funded, and the motion failed. Duffy, along with nearly every member of Congress, voted for the overall bill, which increased money for the military. The bill included an additional $20 million for suicide prevention outreach, according to Congressional Quarterly. • Medical and prosthetic research: In May 2012, Duffy joined all but three Republicans in voting against a motion to recommit that would have increased funding for veterans’ medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. Here too, Duffy joined the overwhelming majority in passing the overall bill. The bill provided a $1.7 million increase for medical, rehabilitative, health services and prosthetic research -- an amount equal to the Obama administration’s request, according to CQ. The DCCC also cited votes Duffy took leading up to the October 2013 federal shutdown. In August, he voted for a House Republican ""continuing resolution"" -- a stopgap funding bill -- that the Associated Press reported would ""likely result"" in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. The shutdown led to a delay in death benefits for veterans among other delayed services, the Washington Post reported. DCCC also cited a pair of votes Duffy took in September, including one on a motion to commit to H.J. Res. 59, to make continuing appropriations that would have ensured veterans benefits wouldn’t be delayed during a shutdown. All but one Republican voted ""no."" However, left out of the DCCC’s account is that Duffy voted for in favor of H.J. Res. 72, the ""Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution"" -- a mini-funding resolution favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The measure passed the House with unanimous Republican support and overwhelming Democratic opposition. (Showing how both sides play this game, the RNC plucked out that vote to attack DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a claim we rated False.) Democrats also cited multiple other votes including a few that related to housing for veterans but Republicans could point to other votes on bills that did provide housing assistance. Veterans’ group report card Meanwhile, we found a veterans’ organization that issue voting ""report cards"" for members of Congress: The American Veterans (Amvets) gave Duffy an A-minus in 2013, based on eight pieces of legislation. In response to questions from PolitiFact National, DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner said, ""These Republicans’ votes speak for themselves. Taken in their totality, they show an unfortunate pattern of refusing to cross party lines and vote for commonsense fixes to the problems at the VA."" However, we don't think the votes chosen show the ""totality"" of Duffy’s record. Our rating The DCCC said ""Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."" The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans’ services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Duffy took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans’ services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Duffy’s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC’s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the ""A-minus"" rating he's received from a veterans' advocacy group, undercut the DCCC's claim that he has a ""long"" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-rep-sean-duffy-voted-against/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Laura Ingraham']","
Laura Ingraham said Eric Cantor co-wrote House GOP's immigration principles
","Guests on the Sunday news shows traded explanations for last week’s stunning primary defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor -- including Cantor himself. Some pundits said the loss to professor Dave Brat showed Cantor was out of touch with his Virginia constituents. Others brought up the role immigration reform played in his race. ABC’s This Week fill-in host Jonathan Karl asked Cantor about controversial comments from conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, who led the charge against Cantor and quipped that President Barack Obama should have traded him for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl instead of five Taliban members. Cantor dismissed her rhetoric as ""just not serious and, frankly, it cheapens the debate."" Minutes later, Ingraham responded from her seat on This Week’s Powerhouse Roundtable, highlighting Cantor’s immigration strategy as proof he lacks grassroots credentials. ""Eric Cantor wrote, he was the co-author of the House GOP principles on immigration reform,"" she said. ""Both the New York Times and the Washington Post said that that captured the essence of what was in the Senate immigration bill."" PunditFact wanted to know if her retort was accurate. The House GOP’s ‘Standards on Immigration Reform’ Ingraham is referencing a one-page document that emerged at a Maryland retreat for House GOP members in late January 2014. Politico called the list ""one of the most hotly anticipated documents in recent memory."" Entitled ""Standards for Immigration Reform,"" the memo detailed what should be included in a ""step-by-step"" immigration package. It was handed down from House leadership, which included Cantor as the No. 2 ranking member in the House. Though the document was unsigned, several reports that either previewed the release of the immigration principles or spotlighted Cantor’s defeat referred to him as part of the leadership team that drafted the immigration standards. (A spokesperson for Cantor did not respond for comment.) The leaders said this would serve as a jumping off point for developing a substitute for the Senate’s comprehensive immigration bill, a bipartisan measure that passed in June 2013. The Senate bill included billions for border security and a route to citizenship for the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. The process could take up to 13 years and prevented people from an initial provisional status if they had felony convictions and did not reside in the U.S. before Dec. 31, 2011. Applicants would have to pay penalties and back taxes. The House standards for reform stressed the need for border security, an electronic employment verification system, and granting legal status and citizenship to children who entered the country with their parents if they serve in the military or get a college degree -- a point Cantor reiterated as important to him on This Week. By contrast, the House principles did not include a possibility of citizenship, but they did include (at the very bottom) a vague avenue for people to remain in the country legally ""only if they were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families (without access to public benefits)."" The document generated plenty of news coverage and editorials, partly for its poor reception among rank-and-file members who disagreed with House leaders. The New York Times characterized it as ""more of an attempt to test the waters than a blueprint for action."" The next week, Boehner succumbed to the rebellion, saying he likely could not pass an immigration bill and blaming Obama for not being trustworthy in enforcing immigration laws. For all of the talk of Cantor being an immigration softie, Cantor is hardly the immigration cheerleader that Ingraham and Brat presented him to be. He is often blamed for holding up House votes on immigration legislation. His campaign highlighted this in a mailpiece in the closing weeks of his campaign, describing the legislation as the ""Obama-Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty"" (a characterization PolitiFact rated Mostly False.) In an op-ed for Politico Magazine, conservative National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote that Cantor’s immigration offense was showing support for a law like the DREAM Act ""and making occasional favorable sounds about more far-reaching legislation, including by signing off on those January principles."" Ingraham claimed the New York Times and Washington Post characterized the GOP principles as having ""captured the essence of what was in the Senate immigration bill."" We could not find examples of those newspapers straight-up saying the principles essentially amounted to the Senate bill, but the newspapers did portray the document as a much-anticipated starting point for negotiations with the upper chamber. A Jan. 31 Times editorial, for instance, listed the legalization language among ""a palmful of blessings to count"" from the document, but criticized the blueprint for not including ""the real possibility of immigrants becoming Americans."" The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, had described the document as voicing ""support for the major planks of the comprehensive bill that cleared the Senate last summer."" Our ruling Ingraham did not back down from her criticism of Cantor, saying he ""was the co-author of the House GOP principles on immigration reform"" and adding ""both the New York Times and Washington Post said that this captured the essence of what was in the Senate immigration bill."" As the second highest-ranking member in the House, Cantor was part of top-level conversations that led to a (swiftly rejected) one-page document outlining the House GOP’s starting points for immigration reform. The New York Times and Washington Post did not describe the House’s principles as capturing the essence of the Senate bill. (For one thing, it was only a page long.) Their reports often highlighted the House document’s lack of opportunity for citizenship for most undocumented immigrants and explored whether that was a deal-breaker for Democrats.

Reince Priebus says Hillary Clinton's poll numbers have plummeted
","Two huge political news stories collided this week on CBS’ Face the Nation — the release of Hillary Clinton’s new memoir and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s head-scratching Republican primary loss to a poorly funded novice candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was on set to answer how the GOP, still waging an internal war, would come together to defeat Clinton in 2016, assuming she runs. Priebus, though, said Republicans have a much deeper bench of heavyweights, adding that Clinton’s star is fading. ""We're now running with a lot of great people that have a vision for this country like Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, and others, in my own state of Wisconsin, that are very dynamic,"" Priebus said. ""And it looks like Hillary Clinton is getting ready. She went from a 70-percent approval rating down to ... 52 in 18 months."" (Priebus stumbled slightly over the final approval number but corrected himself to say 52.) Has the shine really worn off that much since Clinton left office in January 2013? We asked Priebus to back up his numbers. GOP spokesman Sean Spicer pointed us to new data from a Bloomberg National Poll. In December 2012, Clinton received very high marks from Bloomberg’s respondents. At the time, 70 percent of those surveyed had either a very favorable or mostly favorable view of the Secretary of State. And how did she do in Bloomberg’s recent poll? On June 12, 2014, Clinton had a net favorable rating of just 52 percent, a drop of 18 points. So, Priebus is right, right? Not entirely. The Bloomberg poll released in 2012 is pretty far off the average for polls taken around that time, making it a bit of an outlier. While a couple of other polls in late 2012 and early 2013 put Clinton's favorability at 67 percent, other polls (like CBS) had it around 55 percent. The Huffington Post Pollster, which aggregates and averages most credible polls, put Clinton’s favorability rating at 58.2 percent on Dec. 9, 2012. Where is it at now? It’s at 52.6 percent. That’s definitely lower than where it was just 18 months ago, but it’s not nearly as drastic of a drop as Bloomberg found. It’s also up from where it was in December 2013, when Clinton bottomed out at 49.3 percent favorable, suggesting perhaps that Clinton is on the rebound, instead of a downward spiral. (The high point for Clinton since 2009 was actually January 2011, when about 62 percent viewed her favorably.) Here’s Clinton’s favorability over time.  ""If we look at individual polls, then one can find results close to those cited (by Priebus), but only by ignoring other polls,"" said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. ""The trend, which doesn’t cherry-pick polls but averages across all of them, finds a move from 56.1 (when she left office) to 52.6."" For PolitiFact, Franklin analyzed polls that have asked Clinton-specific questions at multiple times and found an average decline in those polls of about 8 points in the last 12-20 months. This won’t weigh into our rating, but since Priebus singled out a few names, we thought it would be interesting to compare Clinton’s performance against them in a hypothetical election. We used Pollster’s average (which didn’t have enough data on Clinton vs. Jindal to for us include the Louisiana governor). Opponent January 2013 June 2014 Clinton vs. Jeb Bush 55.7 to 35.8 53.5 to 39.8 Clinton vs. Chris Christie 49.1 to 40.0 51.9 to 39.9 Clinton vs. Rand Paul 52.2 to 41.6* 52.9 to 40.3 Clinton vs. Paul Ryan 55.7 to 37.2 52.0 to 37.9 *Earliest polling data was March 2013 So, while Priebus makes the case that the GOP has a handful of candidates well suited to take on a diminishing Clinton brand, actually, despite a drop in favorability, she continues to do relatively well against the Republicans he mentioned. She would beat all four we looked at if the election were held today, and has only seen her lead shrink slightly against Bush and Ryan. (It’s gone up against Christie and Paul.) Our ruling Priebus said Clinton ""went from a 70-percent approval rating"" down to ""about 52"" in 18 months. Her favorability dropped 18 points in one poll from Bloomberg during that time. But Bloomberg’s poll from December 2012 had Clinton’s favorability 12 points higher than the average poll taken around the same period. It’s true Clinton’s numbers are down overall since the end of 2012, so we’ll give Priebus credit for identifying the trend and accurately citing one recent poll, but we’ll also knock him a few points for cherry-picking his findings to exaggerate her fall.

Wisconsin GOP claims ""employer confidence"" at 95 percent under Gov. Scott Walker and 10 percent under Democrats Jim Doyle and Mary Burke
","Gov. Scott Walker has used surveys by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group and a key supporter of his, to make statements about how good business leaders feel about Wisconsin since he took office. Some of the claims have been off the mark. In February 2012, Walker said 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state ""is heading in the right direction"" and a majority say they will ""grow their companies in 2012."" We rated his statement Half True. While the figures were cited correctly, they came from a relatively small Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce survey that was not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. Walker presented the figures without noting the critical limitations. On May 30, 2014, the Wisconsin Republican Party issued a statement about unemployment that contrasted Walker with Mary Burke, the leading Democratic candidate in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. Burke served as state commerce secretary under Walker's predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for part of Doyle’s tenure. The GOP’s claim: ""Under Walker, employer confidence now stands at 95 percent; at the end of the Doyle-Burke administration, employer confidence was only 10 percent."" The GOP's evidence When we asked for evidence to back the claim, the party cited the latest WMC survey, which was released in January 2014. WMC said that from November through mid-December 2013, it sent surveys by mail and email to 1,291 chief executive officers who are WMC members, and that 341 (26 percent) responded. The GOP said its claim centered on Question 21, which asked: ""Do you think things in Wisconsin are going in the right direction, or on the wrong track?"" The results: Right direction -- 95 percent; Wrong track -- 5 percent. In contrast, in WMC’s June 2010 survey, the last done before Walker’s election, the figures were 10 percent ""right direction,"" 90 percent ""wrong track."" But Burke served as Doyle’s commerce secretary for less than three years of Doyle’s eight-year tenure, leaving the post in November 2007. In WMC’s June 2007 survey, the final one before Burke left Commerce, 59 percent said things in Wisconsin were going in the right direction -- much greater than the 10 percent in the June 2010 survey. Moreover, like Walker's claim, the GOP claim was broad and without any qualifications. As stated, the claim suggests the overwhelmingly positive figures for Walker reflect the opinions of business leaders statewide. But as we noted in our Walker factcheck,  the survey respondents don’t match up well with Wisconsin’s statewide business profile. A majority of survey respondents in the latest survey were chief executive officers of manufacturing businesses. But manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. Similarly, WMC represents some small businesses, but half its 3,500 members have more than 50 employees. On more specific questions, the results of the latest survey weren’t quite as positive for Walker. For example: 44 percent of the responding CEOs said they planned to add employees in the next six months; 65 percent said they expected moderate growth in the Wisconsin economy in the next six months and 2 percent expected good growth. Our rating The state Republican Party said that under Walker, ""employer confidence now stands at 95 percent,"" compared to ""only 10 percent"" at the end of the Doyle- Burke administration. The statement contains an element of truth, in that 95 percent of chief executive officers who are members of Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, and who responded to the latest WMC survey, agreed that ""things in Wisconsin are going in the right direction"" rather than ""on the wrong track."" But the claim ignores critical facts in suggesting that the 95 percent figure applies to all Wisconsin employers, when in fact the CEOs responding to the survey are not a representative sample of all employers. And although only 10 percent said the state was going in the right direction at the end of Doyle’s term in 2010, the rate was 51 percent in the survey done shortly before Burke left Commerce in 2007. We rate the state GOP’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/15/republican-party-wisconsin/employer-confidence-sky-high-under-gov-scott-walke/

Jack Reed says the minimum wage of the 1950s and 1960s would lift a person out of poverty
","In the battle to raise the federal minimum wage, proponents have been arguing that the minimum wage now buys far less than it has in the past, and is no longer high enough to lift someone out of poverty. During a May 1 speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Jack Reed (D-RI) offered a version of that argument. ""The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 2009 and today an individual who works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks a year, at the federal minimum wage earns $15,080 per year, and that is nearly $5,000 below the federal poverty level for a family of three, and almost $9,000 below the poverty level for a family of four,"" he said. ""People who work hard for a living shouldn't have to live in poverty, and that was not the case in the ‘50s and the ‘60s when the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty,"" Reed said. ""And I think that's what we have to do today."" Reed supports a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, which would bring a family of three above the poverty threshold. For this fact check, we are going to examine whether the minimum wage was really high enough in the 1950s and 1960s to pull people out of poverty. We asked Reed's spokesman for the source of his statistic. While we waited for a response, we looked on our own. For historical minimum wage data, we went to the U.S. Department of Labor. During the time period Reed was talking about, the minimum rose six times, starting at 40 cents per hour and eventually reaching $1.60. How much did it take to lift someone out of poverty during that era? That's a much harder question to answer, and it depends on the size of the family, something Reed wasn't specific about. The federal poverty level, the adequacy of which is still the subject of debate, wasn't developed until the early 1960s, so it wasn't even in existence during the start of the time period Reed was talking about. The first ""poverty threshold,"" in 1963, was about $3,100 for a family of four. Someone earning the minimum wage that year would have earned $2,460, enough for a family of three but not a family of four, according to the ""Social Welfare and the Economy"" page on the Social Security Administration's Office of Retirement and Disability Policy website. Those data only go back to 1959. We used a cost of living calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a rough idea of living costs from 1950 through 1958. According to our calculations, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the minimum wage was high enough to keep an individual above the poverty level The first time it was enough to push a two-person family above the poverty level was in 1956, when it jumped to $1 an hour. But throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in most years, the minimum wage couldn’t lift a family of three out of poverty and was never enough for a family of four. When we shared our information with Reed's office, they provided information that confirmed our findings. Reed spokesman Chip Unruh said the senator’s statement about the minimum wage and poverty levels in the ‘50s and ‘60s is accurate. ""I think it is very clear that Reed is talking about his perception that hard work used to get you a livable wage,"" he said. ""The federal poverty rate as measured today didn't always exist as a unit of measurement, but that doesn't mean poverty itself didn't exist . . . Reed referenced families earlier in his speech, but he also was referencing individuals."" Our ruling Sen. Jack Reed, lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage, said that in the 1950s and 1960s, ""the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty."" We found that during that period, the minimum wage always generated enough income to keep an individual out of poverty. But when it comes to making enough money to support a family -- and Reed made several references to families -- that wasn't always true during those two decades. Based on federal data, the minimum wage didn't become high enough to support a two-person family until about 1956 and it wasn't consistently high enough to lift a family of three until 1967. It never covered a family of four, regarded as a typical family size in that era. One might assume that Reed was talking about families, but the statement we're checking isn't specific. Because that statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

Chain email says Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine voted to allow U.N. to seize guns
","A chain email lists Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine among 46 ""legistraitors"" in the U.S. Senate who voted to let the United Nations seize the guns of Americans. ""Folks: This needs to go viral,"" the email said. ""These Senators voted to let the UN take OUR guns. They need to lose their next election. We have been betrayed."" A reader recently sent us the dispatch and asked if it is true. We took a look, mindful that Warner, a Democrat, is up for reelection this fall. No group or individual takes credit for the email, which denounces the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, while North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it. The treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, is aimed at restricting the international flow of large and small arms to nations beset by terrorists or dictators with poor human rights records. President Barack Obama said he would sign the pact. But before the U.S. can be bound by any treaty, the agreement must be approved by the Senate. The U.N. treaty had long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups, who said it could infringe on constitutional rights to own arms in the United States. Before the U.N’s approval of the accord, the Senate passed legislation, by a 53-46 vote, stating opposition to the treaty. Warner and Kaine voted with the minority that favored the pact. The email says that the treaty, in addition to allowing the U.N. to seize guns, ""would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this, on all private guns and ammo."" Facts about the treaty Let’s look at the what the treaty actually does. It states its purpose is to ""establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms"" and to ""prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion."" It requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take ""appropriate measures"" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps. The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons. The treaty has no enforcement power, but supporters hope it will create common standards among countries for international trade of weapons. To go into effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36 countries. The U.S. State Department says the treaty, if joined by the United States, would not put additional controls on the import or export of guns in America. Instead, it would require other countries to establish ""control systems that are closer to the high standard the United States already sets with its own national standards,"" the State Department wrote in a fact sheet last September. What about the email’s contentions that the treaty would ""let the U.N. take OUR guns,"" and ""implement and international gun registry ... on all guns and private ammo?"" There are no provisions for any of that in the treaty. To the contrary, the pact’s preamble affirms ""the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" Our ruling A chain email says Warner and Kaine were among 46 senators who voted to ""let the U.N. take our guns."" This is a wild distortion of the senators’ support for a U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that has no enforcement power but encourages nations to adopt common standards to block the flow of arms into nations beset by terrorists or dictators with brutal human rights records. The goal is to raise the international arms trade rules to standards already used by the United States. The treaty explicitly recognizes the sovereign rights of nations to control gun laws within its borders. So the assertion that the U.N. would be empowered to take guns from United States citizens is outlandish.

Ohio auditor candidate misleads about his role in online school ECOT shutting down
","Investigations into the now-shuttered Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, called ECOT, have roiled statewide elections in Ohio. The Columbus public online school launched in 2000, founded by software executive William Lager. By the end, nearly two decades later, the school received $1 billion from the state, and Lager, who once had financial problems, became a millionaire. Now politicians on both sides are spinning answers to key questions: Who is to blame for the online school bilking state taxpayers? Who gets credit for the school’s demise? The Ohio Department of Education is seeking to recoup $80 million from the school, while State Auditor Dave Yost referred his findings to state and federal prosecutors for potential criminal prosecution. State Rep. Keith Faber, the Republican candidate for state auditor, took some credit for the school shutting down. ""Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President and the diligent work of Auditor Yost and his staff, ECOT was caught and is out of business,"" he said in a May 11 statement to the press. Democrats pounced on Faber for taking credit. Faber’s Democratic opponent Zack Space tweeted: ""Keith Faber’s complicity in this — perhaps the largest political scandal in Ohio history — should disqualify him from serving as Auditor, the top taxpayer watchdog in the State."" Time for PolitiFact to weigh in: Is Faber accurate in claiming credit for ECOT shutting down? We found that when Faber was Senate president, the Legislature voted for a bill that included attendance rules for online schools in 2015. But the main reason the school shut down was a change in the type of student participation data that the state education department sought. And the department began seeking the data before the 2015 legislation passed. Faber’s spokeswoman Allison Dumski pointed to his role as Senate president in passing HB 2, a charter schools bill. The final version passed the Senate unanimously and the House overwhelmingly in October 2015. A provision added in the Senate required online schools to keep ""an accurate record of each individual student's participation in learning opportunities each day."" The bill said that the records must be kept in a manner that could easily be submitted to state officials. ""ECOT was unable to provide these attendance records or comply with Ohio Department of Education's student count, requiring them to repay the state, which ultimately put them in financial distress and caused them to close,"" Dumski said. The passage of the bill drew praise from newspaper editorial boards and education advocates. But the bill essentially codified what the education department had already started. The wheels were already in motion for the state to seek millions from the school. For years, news reports showed the online charter school had problems with poor record keeping, high student turnover, suspicious attendance reports, poor performance outcomes and graduation rates, and inflated enrollment. State audits showed problems as early as 2001. While the school racked up troubling headlines, Lager (the school's founder) gave campaign donations, largely to Republicans. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Lager and other executives made $2.1 million in donations. The FBI is examining whether the company reimbursed employees for donations, the Dispatch found. (Faber announced in May that he would donate the approximately $36,000 he received to other schools.) By 2015, the state began to suspect that some schools were inflating their participation numbers. So it began to request actual log-in data for students. For ECOT, that meant trouble. The department found that for the 2015-16 school year, the online school could only account for 6,300 of its 15,300 claimed students. That eventually led the state to demand that the school repay $60 million, and later an additional $20 million for the next school year. The school argued that the department illegally changed its rules for counting students. But the courts have sided with the state. The school continues to appeal. In 2017, the state started withholding $2.5 million per month from the school. In January, the school’s sponsor, The Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West, cut off ties. Charter schools must have a sponsor to operate. About 12,000 students had to find new schools. Faber said, ""Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President"" the online charter school ECOT ""was caught and is out of business."" Faber was referring to House Bill 2, which passed in 2015 and required online schools to keep accurate and accessible attendance records. But Faber is overstating credit by hanging the demise of the school on that bill. The key change that led to the school shutting down was when the education department decided to require e-schools to provide student log-in data. This showed that that the school couldn’t account for many of its supposed students, leading the state to conclude the school owed $80 million. Faber doesn’t get credit for that. The only kernel of truth here is that the bill that passed under his leadership was another affirmation by the state that e-schools had to provide attendance data. We rate this claim Mostly False.

","A progressive super PAC slammed the congressional record of Democrat Gwen Graham as too conservative for Florida’s next governor. The Collective super PAC paid for the 30-second spot. The group supports black, progressive candidates and is backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the Florida Democratic primary. The ad portrays Graham, who served one term in the House representing North Florida’s District 2, as a contrarian to former President Barack Obama. ""Gwen Graham says she is the progressive candidate for governor,"" the voiceover says, ""but while in Congress she voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time.""

You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! We found the claim slightly overstates Graham’s votes against Obama by focusing only on part of her time in Congress, rather than both years of her term. Graham’s breaks with the White House were on issues of national security, foreign policy and energy. Sometimes, she was one of just a handful of Democrats to do so. Graham voted more reliably liberal on health care and abortion. Still, according to VoteView.com’s analysis of every roll call vote, Graham was ""more conservative than 91 percent of Democrats in the House at the time."" The breakdown comes from an analysis by Congressional Quarterly, which tracked how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as statements by the president or his designated spokespersons. CQ offered a percentage for votes in both 2015 and 2016. In 2015, CQ counted 89 House votes where the White House had a stated preference. According to CQ, Graham supported the president on 49 percent of those votes in 2015. In other words, she voted against Obama 51 percent of the time. One of the most controversial pieces of legislation that Graham voted for in 2015 was a Republican bill that authorized the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline (HR 3). Twenty-eight Democrats including Graham voted in favor of authorizing the pipeline’s construction, which also passed the Senate. But Obama vetoed the bill. More examples: • Graham voted for the Republican-backed North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act (HR 8), which supporters said would have helped modernize infrastructure and federal policies. But the Obama White House threatened to veto the bill because ""it would undermine already successful initiatives designed to modernize the nation's energy infrastructure and increase our energy efficiency."" It did not make it to a vote in the Senate, however.

•  Graham voted in favor of legislation (HR 37) that would have amended the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Obama had signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010. The bill did not pass the Senate. In 2016, however, the percentage of Graham’s votes with Obama increased. Of 54 votes, CQ found Graham voted in line with the White House 65 percent of the time. Or, she broke with Obama on 35 percent of those votes. Some examples: • Graham was one of only three Democrats to vote for the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would have increased congressional oversight of sanctions against Iran. It passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate, but Obama had threatened to veto the bill.  • Graham joined 11 Democrats in voting for a GOP-backed bill that would have prohibited the transfer of a Guantanamo Bay detainee to a facility in the United States. • Graham also voted for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, which would have placed significant hurdles on the processing of some refugees, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. The Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States by adding significant new certification requirements. Graham spokesman Matt Harringer said the claim doesn’t tell the whole story. ""Gwen disagreed from time to time with President Obama, like on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but she is proud of her progressive record and overwhelmingly voting to support President Obama's agenda — including voting eight times to save the Affordable Care Act, to defend the Clean Power Plan and to protect the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau,"" he said. Graham voted multiple times against Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while in Congress. The White House only weighed in on half of those votes, despite the fact that Obama would have likely opposed the measures. Harringer pointed to CQ’s party-unity scores, which are included on the same study as the presidential positions. Graham’s average party-unity score was 84 percent after two years in Congress. He also pushed back on VoteView.com’s characterization of her as a ""conservative"" Democrat. ""You could just as easily say she was the most bipartisan Democrat in the Florida delegation at the time,"" Harringer said. The Collective super PAC said Graham ""voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time."" In her two years in the House, Graham stood out as a Democrat who did not always vote the party line, siding with conservatives on some significant measures about foreign policy and defense. But the group’s ad overstates the percentage in which Graham voted against what Obama wanted by only looking at part of her time in Congress.  Graham voted against Obama’s stated policy preference around half the time in 2015, but only 35 percent of the time in 2016. On average for those 143 votes, she broke with Obama 45 percent over two years.

Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Patriot Act The USA Patriot Act was introduced by Sensenbrenner in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and was signed into law by GOP President George W. Bush in October 2001. (Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold cast the lone no vote in the Senate.) The measure granted law enforcement increased surveillance powers to intercept phone and email communications in the name of fighting terrorism, but with little judicial or congressional oversight. Based on a law he signed in 2015, PolitiFact National gave Democratic President Barack Obama a Promise Kept on his pledge to revise the law to increase oversight on government surveillance. So, what else has Sensenbrenner done?

We were expressing the opinion that over a 40-year career, he doesn’t have a lot of major legislation to his name. The Patriot Act is the only thing of note. That said, it’s not 100% accurate, in that he has had his name on other pieces of legislation, and I apologize for that. Twitter can be hazardous, of course. But we found that Palzewicz also made the attack on a website he’s using to raise money for his campaign. 500 sponsorships The state Republican Party responded to us on Sensenbrenner’s behalf, citing Congress.gov data. That data shows that in his career, Sensenbrenner was the lead sponsor on 500 bills or amendments, 99 of which passed the House and 34 that became law. The measures include these three, each of which was signed into law in 2006: Voting Rights Act: A 25-year extension of the act was signed into law.

TV ad’s False claim about Antonio Villaraigosa and LA’s rape kit backlog
","A new TV ad in the campaign for California governor attacks former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for what it calls his ""reckless"" role in Los Angeles’ massive rape kit backlog. But is it accurate? The ad was paid for by the John Chiang for Governor campaign. It began airing in markets statewide this past weekend. Chiang, the state treasurer, and fellow Democrat Villaraigosa are in a tight and increasingly heated primary race with several others to emerge as one of the top two candidates in November’s general election. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, is considered the race’s frontrunner. Below is the part of the ad that attacks Villaraigosa. For this fact check, we focused on the last portion about his role with the rape kit backlog: ""He was called ‘a failure.’ An ‘embarrassment.’ As mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa drove L.A. to the brink of bankruptcy,"" a narrator says, as news headlines from 2009 and 2010 flash on the screen. ""Villaraigosa’s recklessness threatened jobs, the economy and left no funding to test 7,000 rape kits, putting public safety at risk.""  The ad above was paid for by the John Chiang for Governor campaign.  Villaraigosa served as mayor of Los Angeles from July 2005 to July 2013. The ad seizes on critiques of the former mayor during the height of the Great Recession, when cities and states across the country slashed budgets as tax revenue cratered. More specifically, the ad addresses the frustratingly slow process of clearing rape kits in California, as well as nationwide. State lawmakers this week held a press conference on a bill that would require the prompt testing of all kits in the state. Last month, Chiang made a similar call to action when he announced the circulation of a petition to have all rape kits in the state tested immediately. The use of DNA testing to find suspected criminals gained renewed attention with last month’s arrest of the suspected Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, who faces a dozen murder charges across California. Investigators said they have also linked him to nearly 50 rapes and three attempted sexual assaults from 1976 to 1986. Given the importance of this law enforcement tool, we wanted to know whether the TV ad accurately describes Villaraigosa’s role in LA’s pileup of untested rape kits. We set out on a fact check. Background on the LA backlog An October 2008 audit by Los Angeles Controller Laura Chick detailed the extent of the rape kit backlog. It criticized the Los Angeles Police Department for its lack of a comprehensive plan to end the backlog and its mismanagement of federal grants awarded for DNA testing. Specifically, the LAPD lost nearly $500,000 in grants for testing due to its ""lax oversight"" of the money, Chick wrote in the report. ""Right now the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has about 7,000 rape kits sitting on freezer shelves waiting to be analyzed. Despite having been awarded nearly $4 million in grant funds for the LAPD's crime lab, this unacceptable backlog still exists."" The audit was sent to Villaraigosa, who along with the LA City Council was responsible for oversight of the LAPD, as well as establishing its priorities. Chick did not place blame solely on the former mayor, nor did she describe any reckless acts that prevented funding. Instead, her audit spreads blame across city leadership. ""How is it possible we are in this situation?"" she wrote. ""The answer is simple and obvious: The City, its elected leadership, as well as the Police Department, has not given this issue the attention, resources and priority it deserves."" Evidence from Chiang’s campaign We asked Chiang’s campaign for evidence supporting the ad’s claim that Villaraigosa’s ""recklessness"" …  ""left no funding"" for the DNA testing. A spokesman pointed to several news articles and editorials that criticized LA city leadership for not acting fast enough to fund crime lab technicians. Some mentioned Villaraigosa’s focus on hiring more police officers in contrast with lab techs. ""Hiring more officers remains a worthy goal,"" The Los Angeles Times editorial board wrote in October 2008, ""but it need not be done foolishly and with contempt for rape victims whose cases deserve attention. The City Council -- and the LAPD -- must make funding the necessary lab work a priority."" More specifically, Chiang’s campaign pointed to a May 2008 request by the city’s finance committee to add $400,000 to Villaraigosa’s budget for LAPD contractual services to pay for DNA testing, which they say he denied. The city’s June 2008 budget signed by Villaraigosa however, shows the police budget for contractual services increased by $400,000, suggesting he did approve the increase. The request for additional funds was made by former LA City Councilman and prosecutor Jack Weiss, who The Pasadena Star-News editorial board said in August 2008 had been ""complaining about the backlog of criminal lab work for years, noting that it hasn’t been the priority it should."" The editorial also said Weiss in 2007 ""called the backlog of criminal-case DNA the ‘public safety scandal of our era,’ and asked Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and (then-LAPD Chief William Bratton) to hire new criminalists. He said he would push the council for $10 million in funding for this problem this year. That funding has not materialized, and the backlog hasn’t gone away."" Weiss could not be reached for comment. Villaraigosa campaign’s response A Villaraigosa campaign spokesman said the ad is wrong for two reasons: the backlog started before Villaraigosa became mayor in July 2005 and was eliminated under his watch in 2011. The audit backs up the first point. It shows the backlog had reached 3,300 rape kits by 2003, two years before Villaraigosa took office. On the second point, several news articles detail the city’s elimination of the backlog in 2011, two years beforeVillaraigosa’s tenure as mayor ended.  The Los Angeles Times in April 2011 reported on the elimination of what it called a ""decades-old"" backlog: ""LAPD officials have spent the last two years scraping together federal grants, public funds and private donations to outsource the testing to private labs. They have also lobbied elected officials for special permission to add more analysts to the LAPD's lab despite a citywide hiring freeze."" Our ruling  A TV ad by John Chiang’s campaign for governor attacked former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for what it calls his ""reckless"" role in the city’s massive rape kit backlog. It said he ""left no funding to test 7,000 rape kits, putting public safety at risk."" A Los Angeles city audit from 2008 blamed elected leaders and the Los Angeles Police Department for their lack of attention and resources paid to the problem. The audit notes, however, the problem started well before Villaraigosa took office. Also, it doesn’t single out Villaraigosa and we found no evidence of any ""reckless"" acts by the former mayor. Additionally, the ad ignores the fact that the city eliminated the backlog near the end of Villaraigosa’s term in 2011. It gives the wrong impression that Villaraigosa ""left no funding"" whatsoever to pay for DNA testing when his tenure ended. That’s simply not the case. We found plenty of information that criticized Villaraigosa and the city for a slow start to addressing the problem. Chiang’s ad, however, distorts the facts and creates a narrative that’s simply not supported. We rated the ad’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Steve Adler']","
Steve Adler incorrectly says Austin creating more jobs than any other U.S. city
","Austin’s mayor made a best-in-the-nation claim about local job gains that made us wonder. Steve Adler, who seeks a second term in November 2018, was asked on KLBJ-AM’s morning May 8, 2018, ""Todd and Don Show"" about ending ""the red tape and paperwork that businesses have to go through just to expand in this city."" Adler replied: ""You ought to minimize the bureaucracy as much as you can. But we’re doing something right in this city, you guys have to admit, right? We’re creating more jobs than any other city in the country. We have an economy that’s on fire. I mean, we’re doing something right,"" Adler said, going on to agree that he also wasn’t trying to take personal credit for the gains. Some background: We recently found accurate an Adler tout of Austin’s jobless rate. From January through March 2018, Austin’s unemployment rate ran shy of 3 percent; the rate had mostly stayed under 3 percent since the start of 2017. So, we wondered, is Austin flat-out growing more jobs than any other city in the country? Mayor cites local sort of federal data By email, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford told us the mayor made his job growth claim by drawing on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Stanford included in his reply a chart from the Austin Chamber of Commerce indicating that between March 2017 and March 2018, the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan area--which takes in five Austin-area counties--saw greater percentage gains in nonfarm payroll jobs than nine other high-growth areas:                  SOURCE: Web post, ""APRIL 24, 2018 - JOB GROWTH & UNEMPLOYMENT,"" Austin Chamber of Commerce, April 24, 2018 The Austin area was home to 1,060,200 jobs in March 2018, the chart says, and that count was up 36,800 jobs, or 3.6 percent, from March 2017. Listed as metro areas with the next-most percentage gains: Orlando (3.5 percent); Phoenix, Seattle and Riverside, Calif. (3.2 percent each); Jacksonville and Dallas (3.1 percent each). We noticed, though, that the Austin area ranked sixth among the selected regions in raw jobs gained. According to the chart, the Dallas area had 78,400 more jobs in March 2018 than in March 2017; the Phoenix area had 65,600 more jobs than before; the Seattle area had 53,200 more jobs than before; the Riverside area had 45,900 more jobs than before; and the Orlando area had 43,700 more jobs than before. To our inquiry, a chamber expert, Beverly Kerr, pointed out the chamber’s April 2018 web post showing Austin’s No. 1 rank. Kerr also commented: ""The mayor might better have said Austin is creating jobs faster than any other major metro, rather than creating more jobs, since some slower growing much larger metros are bound to actually be creating a larger number of jobs."" Job gains in more metro areas We sought to look over the figures. So Kerr emailed us what she described as her full fetch of job changes within 426 U.S. metro areas for the selected months, enabling us to conduct our own shake-outs. We sorted all the figures by percentage gains in jobs--finding that Austin’s 3.6 percent growth placed the area in a national tie with the Idaho metros of Idaho Falls and Pocatello and behind 28 similarly less populous areas, including three in Texas. From March 2017 to March 2018, the Midland area saw a nationally leading 9.9 percent bump, gaining 8,900 jobs; the adjoining Odessa area had a gain of 6.6 percent, 4,700 jobs; and the College Station-Bryan area saw an increase of 4.3 percent with 5,100 jobs gained, the figures indicate. We also sorted the provided figures by limiting our focus to the nation’s 49 metro areas that were home to 1 million jobs or more in March 2017. Among those areas, the Austin area’s 3.6 percent growth rate as of March 2018 placed it No. 1, we found, though 14 other areas recorded greater raw job gains. Next, we queried the BLS directly about the mayor’s claim and backup information. By email, Dallas-based economist Cheryl Abbot confirmed that the figures behind Adler’s claim were rooted in the bureau’s supplemental table posted online gauging over-the-year job changes from March 2017 to March 2018 in total nonfarm employment in metro areas with a population of 1 million residents or more as of 2010. Among the 51 areas clearing the declared population hurdle, Abbot wrote, the Austin area ranked No. 1 in percentage job growth. ""And even on a net change basis, Austin ranked 11th on our table (jobs up by 36,800), competing with the likes of NYC, LA, DFW, and Atlanta, among others,"" Abbot said. A national analysis We also consulted Aaron M. Renn, an economist with the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. Asked to provide a long perspective on the Austin area’s job gains, Renn emailed us a chart based on BLS figures showing that the Austin area topped 52 other metro areas--leaving out many--with a 51 percent uptick in nonfarm jobs from 2000 to 2017; California’s Riverside area placed second with a 46 percent increase. But among the selected metro areas, the Austin area’s raw gain of nearly 350,000 jobs over those years placed the area 10th nationally behind the metro areas of New York, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Houston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, Riverside, Phoenix and Atlanta, according to the chart. Our ruling Adler told the morning radio hosts that Austin is creating more jobs than any other U.S. city. To the contrary, federal figures show the five-county Austin metropolitan area (not Austin alone) trails some other U.S. metros including the No. 1 Midland area for its pace of jobs gained and it lags more than 25 metro areas in raw jobs gained. It would be accurate to say the Austin area lately has enjoyed greater percentage job gains than other metro areas of 1 million residents or more. We rate this Adler claim False.

"['National', 'Religion', 'Mike Pence']","
Is Mike Pence right that religion is gaining new life in US?
","  Speaking at a commencement ceremony at Hillsdale College in Michigan, Vice President Mike Pence told the graduates that religion in the United States is going strong. ""The percentage of Americans who live out their religion on a weekly basis — praying, going to church, reading and believing in the Bible — has remained remarkably consistent over the decades, even as the population of the United States has grown by leaps and bounds,"" Pence said during his May 12 speech. ""I mean, think about it, today, relative to the population, four times as many Americans go to church on a regular basis than at the time of our nation’s founding. Religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day."" We wondered whether Pence is right that ""religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day."" Based on data and scholarly opinion, Pence overlooked some notable nuances in the long-running data on religion in the United States. ""Since 1990, weakly religious people have increasingly chosen between a stronger religious identity or none at all,"" said Michael Hout, a New York University sociologist. ""The middle spot of being blandly religious and occasionally attending became harder and harder to maintain."" Religious practice on the more intense end of the spectrum has held its own in recent years, according to data. However, Pence ignored that the share of Americans without a religious affiliation has risen, and the share of Americans with lower levels of described religiousness has steadily declined. Landon Schnabel of Indiana University, who co-authored a 2017 study on religious data with Sean Bock of Harvard University, said that ""Pence's statement isn't totally wrong, but it is a misinterpretation."" Schnabel’s issue is that Pence focused only on one trend line, rather than the entire landscape. The metaphor Schnabel uses to describe the changing shape of religion is ""espresso versus coffee. There's less of it, and it's stronger. And if some people didn't like how coffee tastes, they're really not going to like espresso."" You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! To illustrate some of the longer-term trends, we examined data from the General Social Survey, produced by the University of Chicago. In this first chart, we see the breakdown of Americans by whether they identify as Protestant, Catholic, another religion, or no religion. The most striking increase is in those who do not have a religious affiliation. The portion of the population without a religious affiliation has quadrupled over a 40-year span from 5 percent to more than 20 percent. Additional data illustrates another question: the strength of religious affiliation. This chart looks at that data over the period: The percentage of respondents saying they had a ""strong"" religious affiliation has been more or less constant for 40 years, bouncing between 35 percent and 40 percent of the population. This slice of the data supports Pence’s view. But other portions of the data run counter to Pence’s stated trend. Notably, the segment of the population that reported either a ""somewhat strong"" or ""not very strong"" religious affiliation has declined. This group peaked at about 55 percent in the late 1970s but has since fallen to a little more than 40 percent. (This category doesn’t include those with no religious affiliation.) Finally, we looked at another measure of religious strength — the frequency of attendance at religious services. This data mirrors that for strength of religious affiliation. The percentage attending services between zero and two times a year has risen from 29 percent to 46 percent since the early 1970s, while the percentage attending services on a roughly weekly basis fell from 35 percent to 22 percent. Those attending more than weekly — the most intense group — has remained notably stable. We also looked at findings from the Pew Research Center, which conducted comprehensive Religious Landscape Surveys in 2007 and 2014. Pence could find support there, too — as well as findings that undermine his position. ""Among the roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults who claim a religion, there was no discernible drop in most measures of religious commitment"" between 2007 and 2014, said Gregory A. Smith, Pew’s associate director for research. ""Indeed, by some conventional measures, religiously affiliated Americans were, on average, even more devout than they were a few years prior."" By contrast, Pew found ""small but statistically significant declines in the share of Americans who say they believe in God (from 92 percent to 89 percent), in the share of Americans who say they pray every day (from 58 percent to 55 percent), in the share who say religion is very important in their lives (from 56 percent to 53 percent), and in the share who say they attend religious services at least monthly (from 54 percent to 50 percent)."" One reason for the shift may be generational. ""Older generations of American adults who were overwhelmingly Christian by affiliation and comparatively devout in belief and behavior are gradually passing away,"" according to the Pew report. That said, Pew’s data shows indications that Americans are becoming more spiritual outside of the context of organized religion. ""About six in 10 adults now say they regularly feel a deep sense of ‘spiritual peace and well-being,’ up seven percentage points since 2007,"" the study found. Pence’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but his office told the Washington Post Fact Checker that they had relied on the Schnabel-Bock study, as well as an article that addressed the Schnabel-Bock study in the Federalist, a conservative publication. That article, headlined, ""New Harvard Research Says U.S. Christianity Is Not Shrinking, But Growing Stronger,"" was written by Glenn T. Stanton, the director of family formation studies at Focus on the Family. When we reached out to Stanton, he said he was unaware that Pence had picked up on his article, or that it had inspired fact-checking. Stanton acknowledged that ""the mainline denominations are hemorrhaging members. This goes a long way in the fact that some forms of faith are indeed shrinking in America. Those denominations that are compromising on tradition and orthodoxy are shrinking at alarming rates. No question. As Schnabel and Bock explain, it is the very serious and rigorous portions of Christianity that are holding solid."" Overall, Stanton said he felt Pence was giving a reasonable, boiled-down version of the Schnabel-Bock research. Pence said, ""Religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day."" The data on religion in the United States has been fairly consistent over the past four decades. The share of the population that is more strongly religious is holding steady, providing Pence some support. However, the share who consider themselves only modestly religious is in a long-term decline, and the share without any religious affiliation is growing.

Lupe Valdez says Texas schools in some counties shut down for opening of hunting season
","The former Dallas County sheriff running for governor made us wonder about Texas schools that shut down when it’s hunting time. We failed to find evidence for Lupe Valdez’s claim, although state law permits school districts to manage their own calendars so it’s possible for a district to declare a holiday for a community activity (including hunting) so long as schools stay open long enough through the year. Valdez faces Houston investor Andrew White in a May 22, 2018 Democratic primary runoff with the victor facing Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November. She was asked in a May 8, 2018 Facebook Live interview by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram editorial board if she still carries her service firearm and how she believes gun laws should change. Valdez, who favors universal background checks for gun purchases, replied: ""You know, I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in all the amendments. And I continue to carry my weapon. That’s part of my morning routine. It’s been for over 40 years. Valdez went on to say that a person ""who cannot solve their issues by other than total violence should never be allowed to carry a weapon."" Next came her hunting claim. Valdez said: ""There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting. That’s a source of sports for them. But that isn’t a source of violence for the majority of those folks."" Valdez’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries about the basis for her hunting claim. Agencies, school districts unaware of hunting holidays When we queried the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded that districts set their own calendars. State law requires each district to operate for at least 75,600 minutes a school year unless the state education commissioner grants permission to run short. ""While districts may consult agency staff for guidance as they adopt a local calendar, they do not submit the calendars to us for approval once they are adopted,"" Callahan said by email. At the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, Steve Lightfoot replied by email that in 2018, the Texas dove hunting and deer hunting seasons begin on Saturdays--Sept. 1 and Nov. 3, respectively. The Parks & Wildlife Commission, Lightfoot said, ""supports providing opportunities to get youth involved in Texas’s rich hunting traditions, and sets aside youth-only weekends for that reason. I checked with staff who would know and they are unaware of schools or districts that close in recognition of hunting season,"" Lightfoot said. We also connected with Don Rogers, executive director of the Texas Rural Education Association; Rogers told us he was about to huddle with directors of the state’s regional education service centers. After that meeting, Rogers said by phone that none of the directors was aware of a district currently calling a holiday at the start of a hunting season. By phone, we also came up empty with a pair of Central Texas districts in hunting communities. James Payne of the Llano Independent School District said he’s worked in varied districts for 26 years and not heard of a district taking a holiday for the sake of a hunting season. ""Do you think she was saying that in jest?"" Payne said. Duane Limbaugh, superintendent of the Brady ISD, said that district doesn’t take a day off for the sake of hunting though he’s heard of districts declaring a staff work day for the start of a hunting season. In his experience, he said, most student hunters get their hunting done in time to be in school by mid-morning. Our ruling Valdez declared: ""There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting.""

He's on his 4th run for office in 6 years, but 'IronStache' Randy Bryce says he's not a politician
","""IronStache"" Randy Bryce, then a little known ironworker, burst onto the national political scene in June 2017 with an online ad that went viral. Standing at a job site in a hard hat, Bryce announced his run for the U.S. House seat that Paul Ryan has held for nearly 20 years. With a distinctive Wisconsin tone, Bryce said: ""Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C."" At least in Democratic circles, Bryce became a sensation. Ten months later, his prospects improved dramatically when Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, announced he would not seek re-election to his southern Wisconsin seat. But despite Bryce’s everyman image, which he has continued to cultivate in the campaign, a claim he made on the May 6, 2018, edition of ""The Circus,"" a weekly political program on the Showtime cable network, caught our attention. It came during this exchange with co-host Mark McKinnon, as Bryce made a reference to President Donald Trump: Bryce: Last year at this time, I was working on a parking structure, and just talking with the co-workers, just really ticked off at what's going on, and they're like, what are you going to do? And I was like, well, I'll show you.

McKinnon: So you're not a politician?

Bryce: No, and I think that's what people like. But I mean, people voted for Trump because he was seen as a non-establishment type guy. Nationally, Bryce is a newbie; but this isn’t his first electoral rodeo. So, let’s check his claim that he is not a politician. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc No clear definition Dictionaries aren’t much help on this claim, given how widely the definitions of politician vary: Merriam-Webster A person experienced in the art or science of government; especially one actively engaged in conducting the business of a government. Dictionary.com A person who is active in party politics. Safire’s Political Dictionary One who engages in a career either in government or in a political party on a full-time, usually professional basis. Vocabulary.com A person who campaigns for or holds a position in government. But the more, and more deeply, involved you become in politics, the closer you are to being a politician -- a label many want to avoid. ""In common current parlance, the word definitely has taken on a pejorative connotation,"" said Wendy Scattergood, a political science professor at St. Norbert College in DePere, Wis. ""People use it as an easy way of calling somebody a bad name."" On his fourth run For Bryce’s part, his campaign defended Bryce’s claim by saying he has been an ironworker and union member for 20 years. On one level, it’s easy to argue that the Racine-area resident is not a politician — he has never held public office. But in the space of just over two years, Bryce ran for three different offices, including two that are partisan: 1. August 2012: Bryce lost, 70 percent to 30 percent, in the Democratic primary for an open seat in the Wisconsin Assembly. 2. February 2013: Ten candidates, including Bryce, ran for three seats on the Racine Unified School Board. Four of them, including Bryce, were eliminated in the primary. 3. November 2014: Bryce lost in the general election for an open seat in the state Senate. He was defeated, 61 percent to 39 percent, by a Republican who formerly held the seat. To Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee political science professor and former Democratic state lawmaker, Bryce seems more like ""a wanna-be politician."" ""It’s easier to say who is a politician,"" Lee said, referring to current elected officials in jobs that pay more or less a full-time salary. ""Short of that, it sort of becomes a rhetorical somersault."" But his current campaign means Bryce is now making his fourth run for public office in six years — arguably, enough to make him a perennial candidate. And running for Congress is a much larger venture than school board, or even the statehouse. ""There’s not an obvious point when a person becomes a politician,"" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, ""but Bryce has done enough things that he’s clearly moving toward that category."" Taegan Goddard, publisher of Political Wire, was stronger. ""If you continue to run, you’re spending a decent amount of effort trying to win public office — you’re a politician in that case,"" he said, adding: ""If you’re going to spend that much time running for a congressional seat,"" he added, ""that is a full-time job."" Indeed, for Bryce to flatly reject the label of politician as he did on Showtime, verges on disingenuous. In the eyes of a typical ironworker who has never run for public office, Bryce’s four runs might make him look very much like a politician. And he hasn’t been working the iron during 2018, his campaign told us, as he runs full time for Ryan’s seat. More Randy Bryce fact-checks: His campaign staff ""first to unionize in the history of politics."" Mostly True. Under his own bill, Trump's family could not have come to U.S. Half True. Ryan hasn’t held a public town hall in the district in 600 days. Mostly True. Moreover, Bryce’s campaign says it has raised $5.5 million, while winning endorsements from the likes of a former presidenetial candidate -- U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders -- and national unions such as the United Auto Workers. That’s high-level stuff, not just a citizen tossing his hat in the ring for a part-time gig on the local school board. And while Bryce hasn’t won public office or held a government position, he has been active in party politics; he is currently chairman of the veterans caucus of the Wisconsin Democratic Party and first vice chairman of the Racine County Democratic Party. Our rating Bryce says he is not a politician. The ironworker and candidate for Ryan’s U.S. House seat has not been elected to public office and has not held a government position. And there is no universal definition of politician. But Bryce, who is active in the Democratic Party, is making his fourth run for public office in the past six years. And his current run is by far the most involved -- as the nearly $5 million he has raised, his national endorsements and leaving his job to campaign full time would attest. Bryce’s statement has some element of truth but is misleading. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/may/16/randy-bryce/randy-bryce-has-never-held-public-office-his-4th-r/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'North Carolina', '  Stokes County school teacher']","
NC teacher: I make $53 per day. Records show he's wrong.
","For the hottest debate in North Carolina politics, look no further than teacher pay. Gov. Roy Cooper often talks about the need for higher teacher pay. Meanwhile, Republicans in the GOP-controlled legislature brag about raising teacher salaries each of the past five years. Now, with teachers scheduled to rally in Raleigh on May 16 to raise awareness about the need for more education funding, one teacher’s story has gained traction in the politisphere. Nick Cols, a teacher from Western North Carolina, posted on Facebook that his ""take home pay"" for April was $1,715 after insurance and child-care and taxes were deducted. ""I am roughly being paid $53 a day to educate your child,"" he posted. PolitiFact usually sticks to fact-checking politicians, pundits, fake news sites and prominent organizational leaders. But this claim quickly gained traction not only in North Carolina news but across the country. His story was shared by Cooper and others to emphasize their position that state lawmakers aren’t properly funding education. With that in mind, PolitiFact found it necessary to review his claim. We reached out to the teacher for comment on specifics of his salary, but didn’t hear back. He also deleted the post. So we then reached out to the public school system in Stokes County, where he works. What records show Wage information for public school teachers — and all government employees — is public record. So Melisa Jessup, executive director of human resources for Stokes County Schools and the district’s lead spokeswoman, provided PolitiFact with the teacher’s information. The teacher — whose full name is Nicholas Brandes — works at North Stokes High School and has been a teacher for nine years and eight months, Jessup said. That means, under the state’s salary schedule for teachers with bachelor’s degrees, he qualifies for an annual salary of $40,550 from the state. (A first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree would receive a $35,000 salary, which would jump above $40,000 after 10 years, $45,000 after 15 years, and $50,000 after 23 years.) North Carolina’s public school teachers also receive supplements from their county governments. In Stokes County, that means Brandes gets about 4 percent of his annual state salary added to his pay from the county. That would mean a teacher with his level of experience makes about $42,172 per year before taxes. On top of that, Brandes is currently an assistant coach for the football and wrestling teams. So he receives an additional $2,300 for each year that he coaches those teams. How his pay compares So that puts his annual salary at $44,472 before taxes, health insurance and childcare costs are taken out. That $44,472 salary is slightly higher than the most recent median income calculated for Stokes County — $42,489 — but lower than the most recent median income calculated for all North Carolina residents, $48,256. The average salary for North Carolina teachers across the board (including all levels of experience) is $51,214. Some teachers choose to only accept checks during the school year, which runs from mid August to early June. Brandes chose to have his salary spread out over 12 months, so his monthly income is about $3,706. And, according to Jessup, his deductions for ""optional supplemental insurances and various other pre-tax deductions, as well as health insurance costs"" come out to about $954 a month. That includes childcare. That leaves him with about $2,752 a month. Now let’s look at weekly and daily pay. Excluding holidays or days off, there are typically four five-day work weeks in a month. A monthly $2,752 paycheck spreads out to $688 a week and $137 a day. Checking the check Rather than speak hypothetically, let’s return to the $1,715 paycheck Brandes posted on Facebook. There appear to be problems with the teacher’s math. To arrive at the $53-per-day figure for April, Brandes would’ve had to divide $1,715 by 32 days. However, there were 30 days in April. More importantly, the school system told PolitiFact that Brades worked approximately 21.5 days in April. So his check for that month — $1,715 — divided by 21.5 equals $79.76 per day. That difference of $26.76 per day doesn’t sound like much. But extrapolated over 21.5 days, there’s a $575 difference between what readers might think Brandes earned in April versus what he actually made. Apply the same math ($575 times 12) over a year and there’s a difference of $6,906 between what Brandes could be taking home annually compared with what could be derived from Facebook and in the media. Our ruling A teacher in western North Carolina said he makes $53 a day, spurring politicians to use his claim to support their position that teachers across the state are underpaid. The difference between what the teacher claimed and what the records show is about $26.76. In other words, his daily pay in April was about 50 percent higher than he claimed it was. What teachers make is an important debate — one that should be won or lost on solid numbers. There are many ways of illustrating a correct number, but the $53/day is not the poster child it was made out to be.

Is the ACLU really to blame for Chicago’s murder spike?
","U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently told a conference on policing that a 58 percent spike in Chicago murders in 2016 could be blamed on the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. The settlement, Sessions said, led to a sharp reduction in ""stop and frisks"" by officers. Speaking to the Gatlinburg Law Enforcement Training Conference in Tennessee on May 8, Sessions highlighted the conclusions of a recent research paper on Chicago violence by two University of Utah professors that focused on what it called the ""ACLU effect."" ""They concluded the 58 percent increase was caused by the abrupt decline in ‘stop and frisks’ in 2015,"" Sessions said. ""The settlement of that lawsuit resulted in a decline in stops from 40,000 per month to 10,000 per month. Arrests fell also. In sum, they conclude that these actions in late 2016, conservatively calculated, resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone."" Sessions cited those statistics in stressing the consequences of restraining police. But was the attorney general’s interpretation of the study accurate? And, more significantly, was the research itself academically sound? We decided to take a look. Sessions’s remarks to the police crowd were premised on a significant factual inaccuracy. The ACLU did not sue Chicago over stop-and-frisk, though it had threatened to. The city entered a voluntary agreement to end the policy in August 2015, five months after the Illinois chapter of the civil rights group issued a report indicating Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as much as New Yorkers before that city discontinued stop-and-frisk. In the summer of 2014, Chicago police stopped more than 250,000 people without making an arrest, taking into question the policy’s effectiveness, the ACLU report stated. In the agreement on stop-and-frisk, Chicago police said officers would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there is a ""reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct."" Also imposed were more thorough requirements for documenting every stop that did occur. The University of Utah research by Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and economics professor Richard Fowles found the agreement between Chicago and the ACLU was followed by a steep decline in street stops by police — from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000. The study attributed a surge in homicides, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to the sharp reduction in police stops. But the work by Cassell and Fowles has fueled sharp criticism from some criminal justice experts. John A. Eterno, a criminal justice professor at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York, identified the study’s limited time frame as one flaw. He noted that, while Chicago did indeed jump in 2016 following implementation of the ACLU agreement, they dropped somewhat the following year. ""It doesn’t make sense,"" said Eterno, a retired New York City police captain. ""The data is just not there to recommend what (the study) is recommending."" Eterno noted that New York City’s murder rate declined or remained steady after it ceased stop-and-frisk — a fact Casell’s study suggested was an ""anomaly."" But the cities of Newark, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, all experienced similar changes to their murder rates after contemplating stop-and-frisk changes, suggesting a broader trend, according to an earlier Washington Post story examining the issue. Edwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for ACLU of Illinois, also questioned the study’s dismissal of other factors potentially contributing to the uptick in murders, such as intense local reaction to public release in late 2015 of police dashcam video that showed a Chicago officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. The video caused an uproar in Chicago and across the nation and led to the filing of first-degree murder charges against the officer, Jason Van Dyke. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose administration fought release of the video in the 2014 shooting for more than a year, also fired his police chief, Garry McCarthy, after a court ordered the footage be made public. The Utah researchers dismissed the video as ""an unlikely candidate to explain the Chicago homicide spike."" They contended that awareness of Van Dyke’s actions and allegations of a cover-up were ""widespread"" as early as April 2015 when the Chicago City Council agreed to pay McDonald’s family $5 million.""They say everyone knew what was on the video before it was released,"" Yohnkasaid. ""I don’t think that’s even close to being true.""Cassell defended his work. ""It’s always easy to throw out allegations that something else caused something and how do you falsify that particular claim?"" said Cassell, a former federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush. ""It’s not scientific if you just throw something out and say ‘well there's no way to test it.’"" Citing a study by University of Utah researchers, Sessions claimed that a legal settlement over police conduct between the ACLU and the city ""resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone."" Sessions misstated the ACLU’s involvement with the Chicago police department — there was no lawsuit. He did, however, correctly recite conclusions of the study. The overriding question, then, is whether the study reaches sound conclusions. On that, there is considerable disagreement. Chicago police stops did indeed dramatically plunge in the wake of a city agreement with the ACLU to overhaul its stop-and-frisk policy. A big jump in the city’s murder rate also coincided with the end of policy’s end. Even so, New York and other big cities did not experience hikes in violence and murders after curtailing stop-and-frisk. Other academics express serious reservations about the research methods used by the Utah study. The skeptics also point to an array of factors that may also have contributed to the murder and violence spike — not the least of which was the wrenching impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video. There is considerable debate about that. There is some element of truth in the statement made by Sessions, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Did Cecile Richards say there's room in 'her movement' for people who think abortion is wrong?
","Houston investor Andrew White says he’ll protect abortion rights if elected governor despite personally believing abortion to be wrong. During the debate for the Democratic nomination to Texas governor, White declared that a national abortion rights leader, Cecile Richards, said there’s room for people like him in ""her movement."" We wondered about that. Richards, the Texan who has stepped down as president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, doesn’t support White’s candidacy. She told us by email that she backs the February 2018 endorsement of Lupe Valdez for governor by Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. White and Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff, are vying in the May 22, 2018, Democratic runoff for the opportunity to challenge Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November. White cites Richards White made his claim citing Richards, whose mother, Ann, served as governor from 1991 through 1994, during the May 11, 2018 Democratic governor’s debate in Austin. At the debate, White initially said that as governor, he’d veto anti-abortion legislation and approve legislation reversing abortion restrictions put in place by Republicans who’ve held majorities in both chambers of the Texas Legislature. Moderator Gromer Jeffers followed up: ""Wendy Davis, the 2014 (Democratic) nominee for governor, told her social media followers not to trust you. She didn’t trust you on this issue. Aimee Cunningham also doesn’t trust you on this issue. You’ve read her piece in TribTalk. How do you respond to that?"" WHITE: ""Do you know, do you know who trusts me on this issue?"" JEFFERS: ""Tell me."" WHITE: ""Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned Parenthood, recently came out and said there is room in her movement for people with this perspective. And do you know who they are? They are people like Joe Biden and Tim Kaine. So this issue is, in my opinion, not really an issue. Again, my personal opinions are not what’s important in this election and I have made that clear this entire time. So I would listen to Cecile, and I think that her leadership in this process is worth listening to."" Before White announced his candidacy, Davis in a November 2017 Facebook post called White an ""anti-choice man asking for our support as the Democratic choice for governor."" Cunningham, a community activist and Democratic donor, said in the Feb. 28, 2018, TribTalk commentary mentioned by Jeffers that White earlier told her he’d support ""anti-choice"" legislation--a position he disputed taking. White has said he personally believes life begins at conception yet he recognizes that abortion is legal. ""My personal beliefs are my personal beliefs. This would pertain to my wife and my children, the beliefs I would grow my children to believe in,"" White said after announcing his candidacy. ""But as it relates to other people in America, we live in a free country and we're ruled by law and that rule of law is set by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court has already determined that law. And I don't see them overturning themselves any time soon."" White offers backup We asked White to tell us when Richards, who’s been touring behind her memoir of activism, made the statement touted in the debate. By email, White pointed us to Richards’ comments while talking up her book, ""Making Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out and Finding the Courage to Lead,"" on the April 17, 2018, edition of MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe."" On the program, Joe Scarborough asked Richards: ""What can someone who’s pro-life learn from this book? Because, I mean, obviously there are a lot of pro-life women out there running as well and what message in here is universal?"" Richards replied: ""I think the universal message is that women can’t wait until it’s their turn. I really do think that’s true. We now see women in the United States Senate, 23 women, in record numbers, but still we’re debating over basic health care issues for women. Also, I think a lot of this book too is really, Joe, about the fact that you can be pro-life and you can also understand that that isn’t something necessarily that government should be deciding for every woman in America. And that’s overwhelmingly where people are."" Richards: Yes, but When we reached out to Richards about White’s reference to her statement, Richards said: ""Abortion is a deeply personal issue. I have known and worked with many people, including politicians, who believe that abortion is not a decision they would make -- and they also respect the important right of women to make their own decisions about their pregnancy. Vice President Biden and Senator Kaine, regardless of their personal views, have been consistent in their strong support for women's health and rights. That is not the case for Mr. White."" Following up, we asked how Richards determined that White hasn’t consistently supported women’s health and rights. Lauren Peterson, Richards’ co-author, said by email that Richards relied on ""accounts of people on the ground in Texas, including Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, who have raised concerns when it comes to his consistency on reproductive rights, and women's ability to trust that he would support their access to health care as governor."" We shared Richards’ responses with White, who said by email that Richards’ comment on MSNBC ""could have come straight from my campaign website. Since day one, I’ve stated my personal views on this matter, while making my support for Roe v. Wade clear. I’m glad to know that Cecile accepts the position that Joe Biden, Tim Kaine and I hold."" Our ruling White said that Richards said there’s room in ""her movement"" for people who personally believe abortion is wrong. White accurately echoed what Richards told MSNBC -- that a person can be pro-life and also understand that government shouldn’t make abortion decisions for all women. But White left out that Richards doesn’t think White has consistently showed strong support for women’s health and rights. That's vital clarification. We rate this debate statement Mostly True.

Donald Trump exaggerates on number of MS-13 gang members deported
","In a ceremony honoring law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, President Donald Trump underlined the threat of MS-13 gang members and his administration’s efforts to deport them. ""Recently, MS-13 gang members called for the assassination of New York City police officers so the gang could quote, ‘take back the streets.’ They got it wrong. We are the ones who are taking back the streets. We are getting them out of our country by the thousands,"" Trump said May 15. ""Every week we're setting new records on — we have a ‘catch and release’ program, too. It’s called we catch them and we release them in the country they came back from, we are getting them out. Or we are putting them in prison."" There are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. Not all are immigrants. Some are U.S. citizens who can’t be deported. Still, we wondered about Trump’s claim that MS-13 gang members are being deported ""by the thousands."" We found that thousands of gang members have been deported under Trump’s administration. However, it’s unclear how many of them were MS-13 gang members, because U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement does not track removals by specific gang affiliation. An expert who researches gangs and criminal justice said there is a lengthy process between a gang member’s arrest and deportation. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! ICE does not track gang removals by specific gang, but the agency does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations, said Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for the agency. Bourke said 5,396 gang members were removed in fiscal year 2017 (which includes about four months of the Obama administration, running from Oct. 1, 2016 through Sept. 30, 2017). From Oct. 1, 2017 through Dec. 16, 2017 (the latest data available), 1,082 gang members were removed. It’s impossible to determine how many of them were MS-13 gang members. There is other data indicating the Trump administration’s efforts to deport MS-13 gang members, but that doesn’t necessarily support Trump’s claim. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division arrested nearly 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017.  ICE’s investigations division arrested 405 MS-13 gang members, Bourke said, citing first-quarter data for fiscal year 2018. ""The time it takes to remove a validated gang member can vary depending on whether the alien has started removal proceedings; whether the alien has a final order of removal; or whether the alien has pending criminal charges in a local jurisdiction,"" Bourke said. It’s unlikely that all of the MS-13 gang members arrested in 2017 were already deported, because of the time required to remove someone after an arrest, said Jorja Leap, an anthropologist and adjunct professor at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs who researches gangs and criminal justice. ""Most members of MS-13 that I know that have been arrested are being held in court pending trial,"" Leap said. ""The process is lengthy."" Trump said of MS-13 gang members, ""We are getting them out of our country by the thousands."" It’s difficult to determine how many MS-13 members have been deported under Trump’s administration, because immigration officials don’t break down deportation data by gang affiliation.  At least 1,200 MS-13 gang members were arrested from Oct. 1, 2016, through the end of Trump’s first calendar year. The time between an arrest and deportation varies per case, but an expert told us the process is lengthy.
