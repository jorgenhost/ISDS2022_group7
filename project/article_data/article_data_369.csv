No, Virgil Abloh wasn’t a defendant in the Ghislaine Maxwell case
","On Nov. 28, designer Virgil Abloh died after a more than two-year battle with cardiac angiosarcoma, a rare form of cancer. But in the days since, some social media posts have wrongly tried to connect Abloh’s death with the criminal trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of trafficking girls to have sex with financier Jeffrey Epstein.  ""Virgil Abloh defendant in Maxwell case dies 1 day before trial,"" one post says. ""And here we go.""  That’s wrong. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Maxwell’s trial, which started on Nov. 29, is taking place in federal district court in Manhattan. Court records show that she is the sole defendant in the case. The criminal docket in the case — case number 1:20-cr-003300-AJN —  does not name Abloh. The Justice Department is also posting some updates about the case on its website. A separate, civil case — case number 1:20-cv-07102-LLS — was filed in federal court in August 2020 against numerous people, including Maxwell, Abloh, Beyonce, the New York City Police Department, the Walt Disney Company, Harvey Weinstein and Kanye West.  According to the complaint filed by Texas resident Charlene Latham, among other plaintiffs in the case, ""over the course of decades, the defendants established a lucrative but sociopathic, criminal enterprise where defendants engaged in decades of human trafficking, sexual assaults and various abuses.""

There’s no proof athletes collapsed with heart issues because of COVID-19 vaccination
","A video shared widely on social media flashes through dozens of news clips of athletes who reportedly collapsed and, in some cases, died of heart problems. Set to ominous music, it implies that the incidents were linked to COVID-19 vaccines. ""24-year-old hockey player dies after collapsing on ice in cardiac arrest — 80% of league is vaccinated,"" read one headline, which we found had been pulled from a website called Team Tucker Carlson.

The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was posted on a website called The HighWire, which is associated with the anti-vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network. The video’s caption further ties the incidents to the vaccines with a question and a series of leading hashtags: ""They are at the peak of health, and the top of their profession. So, why are dozens of amatuer and professional athletes around the world inexplicably collapsing on the field, with heart-related issues, in just the past few months? #CollapsingAthletes #Covidvaccine #Myocarditis #TheHighWire."" But there is no evidence COVID-19 vaccines led the athletes in the video to collapse. We reviewed the news reports mentioned in the video and spoke with a number of sports cardiologists, and we found the claim connecting the two is unfounded. ""To date, I am not aware of a single COVID vaccine-related cardiac complication in the professional sports,"" said Matthew Martinez, a sports cardiologist who works with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Soccer and who is the director of sports cardiology at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. The same goes for Jonathan Kim, an associate professor of medicine and chief of sports cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta. ""I am not aware of any reports that vaccines in athletes are causing cardiac issues,"" he said. He called the HighWire video ""a classic example of disinformation."" The video mentions Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen, 29, who, according to his team director, wasn’t vaccinated for COVID-19 when he collapsed June 12. So the vaccine couldn’t have been the reason he collapsed. It also includes a clip about Keyontae Johnson, 22, a college basketball player who collapsed on Dec. 12, 2020, days before the COVID-19 vaccine was given to people in the U.S. His collapse also wasn’t related to the COVID-19 illness, according to a Feb. 3, 2021, statement from his family. Dutch speed skater Kjeld Nuis, 32, who is also included, did have a heart problem in July 2021 a week after he received the COVID-19 vaccine, according to news coverage at the time. Nuis posted on Instagram later that month saying that he was fine and that he was at training camp. He did not say whether his COVID-19 vaccination contributed to his heart problem or whether it was linked to his athletic activity. Nuis had tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020.  A young athlete experiencing cardiac arrest is not common, but it’s also not unprecedented. And there are different reasons an athlete might collapse. Michael Emery, co-director of the Cleveland Clinic Sports Cardiology Center, said that dehydration, heat stroke and genetic heart conditions, among other factors, can lead to collapse. The COVID-19 disease and vaccine have, very rarely, led to heart problems. The virus or the vaccine can inflame the heart muscle, called the myocardium, or the heart muscle sac, called the pericardium, Martinez explained. That can lead to chest pressure, breathlessness and, in some cases, long-term damage to the myocardium or pericardium. Myocarditis and pericarditis in general are rare, but when they do occur, they’re often caused by viral infections, according to the Myocarditis Foundation and the Cleveland Clinic. Among athletes, heart problems are rare even after having COVID-19 itself. In a study that Martinez co-published in March in the American Medical Association’s journal JAMA, fewer than 1% of athletes who had COVID-19 were found to have inflammatory heart disease. Martinez said he hasn’t identified any athletes who had the COVID-19 disease and a heart-related complication and then died. Having a heart problem from the COVID-19 disease or vaccine is ""super rare,"" according to Emery. And it is ""way more rare from a vaccine than it is from a native infection from COVID-19."" The video’s caption asks why dozens of athletes are collapsing ""in just the past few months."" But sports cardiologists aren’t seeing a sudden rise in athletes collapsing. ""We have no data to suggest that the frequency of sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in athletes is higher now than it was in the past,"" said Emery. A video shows news clips of athletes collapsing to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines cause heart problems in otherwise healthy athletes. The video makes an assumption and offers no proof. Athletes in the video did not all collapse from COVID-19 vaccines, and leading sports cardiologists we reached out to said they haven’t seen athletes collapse after getting vaccinated for COVID-19. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809754B380>],/factchecks/2021/dec/01/blog-posting/theres-no-proof-covid-19-vaccines-are-causing-heal/

No indication Malcolm X’s daughter’s death linked to info she released about her father’s murder
","A viral Facebook post attempts to cast suspicion on the Nov. 22 death of Malcolm X’s daughter, Malikah Shabazz. The image post says, ""Malcolm X’s daughter found dead in NYC days after she exposed NYPD and FBI were behind Malcolm X assassination.""  ""Why is this not being broadcast over social media and news outlets,"" reads the text caption next to it. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Evidence does not support the claim that there is a link between Shabazz’s death and her family’s request to reopen the investigation into their father’s assassination.  Shabazz, who was 56, had a long-term illness before her death, the New York City police commissioner said. The city’s medical examiner released a statement that the cause of death had not been determined, but ""the death does not appear to be suspicious following initial review.""  On behalf of the family, Shabazz’s sister thanked people via social media for the outpouring of kindness after the death. We did not find any statements from the family that publicly addressed Shabazz’s cause of death.  Malcolm X was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965, in New York City as he was beginning to speak to a gathering in a ballroom. On Nov. 18, 2021, two men convicted in the killing were exonerated after a review of the case showed that authorities had withheld information during the investigation. A 2020 documentary series, ""Who Killed Malcolm X?"" helped spur the reopening of the case.  The Facebook post also says, ""The family revealed a letter written by a New York police officer that they say shows the NYPD and FBI were behind the 1965 assassination of their father.""  The family did reveal a letter they said was written by a now-deceased New York City police officer, which allegedly said police officials had been involved in Malcolm X’s assassination. However, the post leaves out that the letter’s authenticity was disputed by the daughter of the police officer who was said to have written it. Though the claim says the information was revealed a few days before Shabazz’s death, the family shared the letter publicly in February 2021, nine months prior. A post says, ""Malcolm X’s daughter found dead in NYC days after she exposed NYPD and FBI were behind Malcolm X assassination.""  In February 2021, Shabazz and her family revealed a letter they said shed new light on the circumstances of Malcolm X’s death, though the letter’s authenticity is under dispute. But they released the letter nine months before Shabazz died on Nov. 22. And there’s no indication that the two events were connected, as the post suggests. Shabazz had a long-term illness before her death and authorities said the death does not appear to be suspicious. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809724E1C0>],/factchecks/2021/dec/01/facebook-posts/no-indication-malcolm-xs-daughters-death-linked-in/

Alex Berenson misrepresents data on death rates by vaccination status in England
","Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who has questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and whose posts are sometimes cited for misinformation, made what appears to be an alarming claim about the vaccines in England. ""Vaccinated English adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age"" was the headline on his blog post, which cites a Nov. 1 data release from the United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics. ""I don’t know how to explain this other than vaccine-caused mortality,"" Berenson wrote in the text of the blog post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The data Berenson cited are based on real numbers from the government agency. But the office that issued the data told PolitiFact that the numbers don’t support Berenson’s claim about vaccine-caused mortality. Berenson’s blog post includes a chart that he says indicates that among people in England ages 10 to 59, the death rate from all causes is higher for those who have received two COVID-19 vaccine doses than for people who are unvaccinated. Berenson wrote that the chart he included with his post was based on the data from the Office for National Statistics, and cited a specific table in the government’s Nov. 1 release. The headline on his blog gave the impression that he compared people of the same age; in fact, his comparison was between people in a 50-year age range. His conclusion did not take into account how vaccination patterns and other health issues vary across that broad age range. The government issued a summary of its conclusions based on the mortality data set Berenson cited and other data sets. Its conclusions take into account the age distribution in the population that Berenson didn’t.  Between Jan. 2 and Sept. 24, the report said, the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 was 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals. Age-standardized mortality rates allow comparisons between vaccination status groups, though they don’t account for certain other variables, such as health status, that may also influence the findings. These mortality rates ""were consistently lower for people who had received two vaccinations compared with one or no vaccinations,"" the report said. Berenson cited a specific table from the government data set for his conclusion that a higher mortality rate among vaccinated people in the 10-to-59 age group pointed to no explanation other than ""vaccine-caused mortality."" But a footnote on that same table provides an explanation. It says: ""For the 10-59 age group, the vaccinated population will on average be older than the unvaccinated population due to age-based prioritization in the vaccine roll-out. As mortality rates are higher for older people, this will increase the mortality rates for the vaccinated population compared to the unvaccinated population."" That is, the vaccinated population skews older. And older people naturally have higher mortality rates. A spokesperson for the office elaborated, telling PolitiFact: The weekly data provide mortality rates for the 10-to-59 age group, and for much smaller age ranges, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 and over.  The lowest age group is broad, ""so it needs to be considered that this group will contain older people with high vaccination rates and younger people with much lower levels of vaccination."" The 10 to 59 age group is ""too wide to infer what is happening. Vaccinated people are more likely to be older and unvaccinated people more likely to be younger, therefore increasing the all-cause mortality rates for the vaccinated."" It’s also worth noting that England has a relatively high percentage of its population fully vaccinated — 68.6% compared with 57.9% in the United States, according to Our World in Data.  ""In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalizations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective,"" the government health agency said in its weekly vaccine surveillance report covering the same 38-week period in 2021. ""This is especially true because vaccination has been prioritized in individuals who are more susceptible or more at risk of severe disease."" Our World in Data reported Nov. 23 that, for all ages, the COVID-19 death rate for the unvaccinated in England is nearly five times higher than for the vaccinated. When we asked Berenson for comment, he referred us to a much longer post he published about eight days after his original post, in which he said the chart he cited ""was not perfect"" but was meant to raise questions about vaccine effectiveness. He concluded the update by stating:  ""Something is wrong. The promises that the health authorities have made over the last 12 months about the vaccines are not coming true. Despite near-complete levels of adult vaccination in Europe, many countries are seeing skyrocketing Covid cases and deaths."" Berenson claimed in a Nov. 20 blog post that vaccinated people under 60 in England ""are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age. ... I don’t know how to explain this other than vaccine-caused mortality."" Berenson’s claim uses a chart based on real mortality statistics from the government. But it reaches a conclusion that is not supported by the data in that report.  For a post that has an element of truth but leaves a misleading impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096654080>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/alex-berenson/alex-berenson-misrepresents-data-death-rates-vacci/

Many news outlets have reported on the mild symptoms of omicron infections in South Africa
","Amid fears about the new omicron coronavirus variant, a claim is being shared on social media that news outlets are failing to report that, in fact, a doctor who discovered the variant says its symptoms are mild.  ""The S African MD who first detected omicron, Dr. Angelique Coetzee, says its symptoms are ‘very mild.’ That story does not appear on any major news network in the US.

First we looked for that Reuters story.  On Nov. 28, the news organization reported that Dr. Angelique Coetzee of South Africa told Reuters that ""she noticed seven patients at her clinic who had symptoms different from the dominant Delta variant, albeit ‘very mild.’"" Coetzee is credited as one of the first doctors to alert authorities about the new coronavirus strain. CNN reported that day what Coetzee had told Reuters. Fox News cited an interview Coetzee gave the Telegraph, saying that the symptoms of the patients she had treated were ""unusual but mild."" Newsmax also reported on the Telegraph story, saying that Coetzee treated people with symptoms of intense fatigue but no loss of taste or smell.  We didn’t find any news reports about Coetzee calling the omicron symptoms mild on the websites of MSNBC, ABC News or CBS News, but we found stories from Nov. 28 on the websites of local affiliates of ABC and CBS.

Vaccinated people in England are not dying at a faster rate than the unvaccinated
","Referencing one chart in a 30-page report while omitting important context, bloggers falsely claimed in an article that COVID-19 death rates in England are much higher among vaccinated people than unvaccinated. The article included the headline, ""COVID death rates 4 to 1, vaccinated to unvaxxed."" It was shared on Facebook in a post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim makes a statistical error. The ratio it cites is based on raw numbers of deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. It does not compare death rates, which would take into account the size of each group. The claim references a chart in a UK Health Security Agency report that indicates during a three-week period in October and November, England had 3,430 deaths from COVID-19. Of those deaths, 2,822 were people who had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 587 were unvaccinated people. The rest were people whose vaccination status was not known. The article linked in the claim doesn’t include those specific data points, but cites the ratio between them — 4.8 to 1 — as evidence that ""The vaccine is deadlier than the virus."" However, ""it’s not a valid comparison,"" said Luke Weeks, senior communications officer for the UK Health Security Agency, which recently replaced the agency known as Public Health England. ""Well over 90% of the adult population is double vaccinated, so the vaccinated cohort is over nine times the size of the unvaccinated cohort,"" Weeks said, ""A very small percentage of a large population is still more people than a higher percentage of a very small one."" The same vaccine surveillance report the blog post cites provides the statistics in this context. During the three-week period, it says, England had 54.9 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people among those who were vaccinated and 125.4 deaths per 100,000 among those who were unvaccinated. The vaccines offer more than 90% protection against mortality, the health agency’s report says. Though the vaccine surveillance report was issued by the UK Health Security Agency, which encmpasses all countries in the United Kingdom, the data in the report is only from England, Weeks said. The claim was published by Mic Drop Politics, which copied the text of its post from another blog called The Expose. The data about the numbers of deaths among the vaccinated and unvaccinated from the UK Health Security Agency is included in the Expose version, but not in the Mic Drop Politics article, which mentions only the ratio. We rate the claim, ""COVID death rates 4 to 1, vaccinated to unvaxxed,"" False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A1C80>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/blog-posting/vaccinated-people-england-are-not-dying-faster-rat/

Claims that vaccines won’t work against omicron variant are premature and not based in science
","If you google ""omicron variant"" and ""vaccine,"" you’ll find a lot of speculation, expectations and unknowns.  ""Omicron vs. Delta: More mutations don’t necessarily make a meaner COVID-19 virus,"" says one CNN headline.  ""COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness will likely drop against omicron variant, Moderna CEO says,"" Fox Business reported on Nov. 30.  In the Wall Street Journal that day: ""Omicron unlikely to cause severe illness in vaccinated people, BioNTech founder says.""  The omicron variant of the coronavirus, recently declared by the World Health Organization as a ""variant of concern,"" has fueled fears about how well the COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available will fare against it. But some takes are being shared prematurely.  ""Breaking news,"" one Nov. 26 Facebook post says. ""None of your previous vaccines will protect you now from the emerging variant omicron.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As the aforementioned news headlines illustrate, researchers don’t yet know how well the vaccines will protect against the new variant. We’ve previously dug into what we do know about omicron and other coronavirus variants. In short: While the variant includes some potentially worrisome mutations, it’s not guaranteed to become as strong as or stronger than the delta variant. It will take a few weeks to know whether it’s significantly more transmissible, whether it causes worse illness, and whether it will be able to evade our current vaccines.  As of now, according to the WHO, ""it is not yet clear"" whether omicron is more transmissible when compared to other variants or if it causes more severe disease. Preliminary data suggests that hospitalization rates are rising in South Africa, where scientists first detected the variant, but, the WHO said, ""this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with omicron."" As of Nov. 30, the presence of the variant had been confirmed in at least 20 countries, and health leaders in western Europe announced they had found samples that predate those found in southern Africa. The WHO didn’t offer much information about vaccine effectiveness against omicron as of Nov. 28, noting that it was working to understand ""the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines."" Still, the WHO said, ""current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.""  Scientists are cautiously optimistic. ""Most scientists believe we should still have protection against severe disease with vaccinations, and vaccination remains the mainstay of control,"" Dr. Monica Gandhi, professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, told PolitiFact.  Studies are underway to assess vaccine performance against omicron. The New York Times reported on Nov. 28 that ""early findings are a mixed picture."" Experts old the Times that ""the variant may be more transmissible and better able to evade the body’s immune responses, both to the vaccination and to natural infection, than prior versions of the virus"" and ""vaccines may well continue to ward off severe illness and death, although boosters may be needed to protect most people.""  Pfizer’s chief scientific officer compared the company’s researchers to firefighters, STAT reported — they don’t know how serious the blaze will be, but they need to prepare for the worst, which could potentially require new vaccines.  Moderna’s chief executive, meanwhile, told the Financial Times that he thinks ""there is no world"" in which the vaccines will be as effective against omicron as they are against the delta variant.  Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, told the New York Times that ""probably in a few weeks we’ll have a better sense of how much this variant is spreading and how necessary it might be to push forward with a variant vaccine.""  But to claim definitively in November 2021 that the vaccines won’t work against omicron is not accurate. It’s yet unknown and subject to more research.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A3240>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/facebook-posts/scientists-are-unsure-how-well-covid-19-vaccines-w/

Wisconsin has seen more than two 500-year storm events within the last several years
","In July 2016, northern Wisconsin was battered by severe storms that devastated the area.  The storms led to flash flooding, which overwhelmed small creeks and rivers and washed out roads. Culverts overflowed along rural roads, with the water damage leaving them no longer drivable.  More than 80 boats were damaged or destroyed in Saxon Harbor, where the heavy rainfall caused flooding that almost washed away boat slips and trees, and pipes and cement culverts up from the ground, according to a July 2016 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Rainfall totals reached 14 inches in some parts of the Northwoods. A broad swath of destruction lingered for years in its path, according to a July 2021 report from the Wausau Daily Herald.  In June 2018, heavy rains pummeled the Northwoods again, dropping 10 or more inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.  U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, cited the two storms in a Nov. 6, 2021 panel discussion at the United Nations Climate Change conference, highlighting how unusually  strong the storms have gotten in Wisconsin since she took office.  ""Within two years, there were two 500-year events,"" she said.  But were the storms really that strong?  First, let’s take a look at what a 500-year storm is. It has nothing to do with five centuries of history. A 500-year storm is an event with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring, according to the United States Geological Survey, or an annual probability of occurrence of around .2%.  That is, it’s just a way of defining the statistical probability of a severe storm. For instance, just because there were 11 inches of rain in one day in one year, doesn’t mean that Wisconsin won’t see 11 inches of rain in one day again for another 500 years.  In theory, these types of events with such low statistical probabilities are rare, meaning that it might not make sense for cities, engineers and others to plan around the possibility of them happening -- though that is being rethought, as 500-year storms and floods are happening more often due to climate change, according to an August 2017 report from Vox.  When we asked Baldwin’s team about her claim that the storms were both 500-year events, they sent a host of links from the National Weather Service with data from both events.  According to the data, the 2016 storm did indeed reach the threshold for a 500-year storm in some places, including the community of Saxon Harbor. In other places, the storm reached even higher thresholds.  The storms that pummelled the area in 2018 also reached similar thresholds, with some areas sustaining 500-year rainfalls or higher, according to the NWS.  But the Northwoods aren’t the only area where severe storms have risen to the same 500-year level. Storms in southern parts of the state around the same time also met that definition.  So, Baldwin is a bit off -- though in a way that actually reinforces the point she was making. Daniel Vimont, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Madison received more than 11 inches of rain on August 21 2018. The threshold for a 500-year rainfall within 24 hours is 9.5 inches.   Then on Aug. 28, 2018, Cashton received over 10 inches of rain within 24 hours, which again rose to the level of a 500-year storm.  Baldwin claimed that since she took office, two ""500-year"" storm events occurred in northern Wisconsin.  Data from the National Weather Service shows that 500-year storms did indeed strike the northernmost counties in Wisconsin in 2016 and 2018, overwhelming creeks and rivers.  But storms in Cashton and Madison in 2018 lso rose to the same level, meaning that there have been more than two such storms within two years in the state.  So Baldwin actually undershot the number of high-impact storms within the state between 2016 and 2018. We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C1D400>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/tammy-baldwin/wisconsin-has-seen-more-two-500-year-storm-events-/

A Facebook post states, ""If you think the Omicron hysteria popping up 2 days before the Ghislaine Maxwell trial starts is ‘just a coincidence,’ then you don’t know who she was trafficking underage girls to. They don’t want us paying attention!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The ""omicron hysteria,"" refers to media coverage of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus that was first detected by health experts in South Africa in mid-November. Health leaders in western Europe have since announced they’ve identified samples of the variant that predate those discovered in southern Africa. The variant has been confirmed in 20 countries, including Canada, and was suspected in three others as of Nov. 30, according to the Washington Post.  The day after Thanksgiving, President Joe Biden announced air travel restrictions for travelers coming from South Africa and seven other countries starting Nov. 29. Multiple countries have enacted travel bans in response to the variant, drawing criticism from the World Health Organization. Biden said the variant is ""a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,"" and urged Americans to get vaccinated and get booster shots. No case had been confirmed in the U.S. as of Nov. 30. The WHO said the variant was first reported to it on Nov. 24 from a specimen collected on Nov. 9. It called omicron ""a variant of concern"" on Nov. 26, noting a high number of mutations which may be associated with ""immune escape potential and higher transmissibility."" It said the global risk ""is very high,"" but noted there are ""still considerable uncertainties.""  It’s still unclear how big a threat the new variant is. In countries with lower vaccination rates, the virus can sweep through the unvaccinated population and give the virus more chances to mutate, according to Tara Reid, an epidemiologist with Kent State University. ""Occasionally, some of those mutations (individually or in combination with each other) can make a virus more ‘fit’ — more able to easily spread to a new host. This is what we’re concerned has happened with omicron in South Africa — that it is out-competing the delta variant in that country, and possibly could do so elsewhere,"" Smith said. The variant is certainly a topic worthy of national media coverage. But some people think that it’s an invention meant to distract from coverage of the Maxwell trial. But the media has also given a lot of attention to the Maxwell case and the accusations against Epstein over the past two years — and there is no evidence the trial will be ignored. In fact, the story garnered national and international attention starting in 2018 due to the investigative reporting of journalists at the Miami Herald. Major media outlets covered the first day of the Maxwell trial on Nov. 29, including CNN, The New York Times, The Associated Press, NBC News, NPR, The Washington Post and others. The case has been covered extensively before the trial, as well. Here is all the New York Times and CNN coverage, for example. Some social media claims have misleadingly pointed to hand-drawn illustrations from the Maxwell trial as evidence that the case is not being covered on the scale that Kyle Rittenhouse’s trial received, with its televised live-stream. But Maxwell’s trial is not being televised because it’s a federal case, and federal courts have long banned cameras and recording devices from courtrooms. John Gregory, the deputy health editor at NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, said claims that one story is being covered to distract from another are common on social media. Users make such claims because ""they're easy and evidence-free,"" and they don't have to back them up, he said. ""It's appealing to the people who are already going to buy into that way of thinking."" Gregory said that NewsGuard looked at data over the past three days from NewsWhip, a social analytics company, and found that social interactions were consistently higher for stories about the omicron variant than they were for stories about the Maxwell trial. He said a BBC story from Nov. 27 about two cases of the variant being discovered in the U.K. garnered the most interactions on Facebook with 183,000. A Daily Wire explainer about the Maxwell trial had 17,000 interactions, the most among that topic. ""That's not an indicator of lack of coverage. You can find stories today from most major outlets,"" Gregory said. ""The stories and coverage of the trial is there. It's just that omicron is getting more attention from readers."" He also noted that far more people are interacting with stories covering the trial than those that say the trial is being covered up, according to NewsWhip data from that same period. It’s also not the first time that someone has claimed the omicron variant is being used as a distraction from other news. Texas U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House doctor who oversaw former President Donald Trump’s treatment for COVID-19, on Twitter called omicron the ""Midterm Election Variant,"" writing that Democrats ""NEED a reason to push unsolicited nationwide mail-in ballots."" It’s not clear where the Maxwell claim originated or whether it’s related to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that holds among other things that Democrats and celebrities are part of a Satan-worshipping cabal that runs the world. Whether it’s related to QAnon ""doesn't matter,"" said Joseph Parent, a University of Notre Dame professor and coauthor of the book ""American Conspiracy Theories."" ""They may be tied, they may not, but the outcome would be the same. Conspiracy theories come cheap and are easily twined."" Parent said conspiracy theories usually originate from people ""politically out of power,"" and that people fall for such claims ""because they want to believe it. Everyone wishful-thinks and most of them can come up with reasons for it.""  Mike Rothschild, the author of ""How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything,"" said ""it's absolutely not surprising to see two hot-button issues (the pandemic and the Maxwell trial) tied together, even though they have literally no link."" ""COVID conspiracy theories have really become the touchstone for the modern conspiracy movement, because people want to believe that there's a deep state fighting with patriot truth tellers for the fate of the world,"" Rothschild said. ""For these people, everything that happens in the world, no matter what it's actually about, is part of the secret war that's going on that they feel like they're let into because of their devotion to alternative media.""  Rothschild said the ""entire pandemic was seen by many people as some kind of a distraction from something else, or as a deep state false flag to swing the 2020 election to Trump. So there's really very little here that's new, just another ‘battle’ in the endless secret war.""  Most conspiracy theories take hold with people because of a need to bring order to chaos, particularly with COVID, Rothschild said.  ""It will never stop until the pandemic is truly over, then it will just start up again for something else in the news,"" he said. A Facebook post said that ""hysteria"" over the omicron coronavirus variant was timed so that it would coincide with and distract from the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.  The two events have nothing to do with one another. Viruses mutate over time and are unpredictable and omicron is not the first coronavirus variant to gain worldwide attention.  And the case against Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein has been widely covered leading up to Maxwell’s trial and that coverage continued on the first day of her trial. It’s common on social media for some people to claim that one news topic is being used to distract from another, experts say. But in this case, it would require a ridiculously implausible level of worldwide coordination by hospitals, local and national leaders, patients, scientists, journalists and more, as the new variant is seeing a global reaction. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.  PolitiFact senior correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this report.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972AA380>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/facebook-posts/no-omicron-variant-was-not-timed-distract-ghislain/

The new coronavirus variant is named for a letter in the Greek alphabet
","On Nov. 26, the World Health Organization classified a new coronavirus variant as a variant of concern.

The organization convened ""an expert group of partners from around the world to do so, including experts who are part of existing naming systems, nomenclature and virus taxonomic experts, researchers and national authorities.""  Omicron is the 15th letter of the 24-letter Greek alphabet. When the WHO runs out of Greek letters to use, it will announce a new naming system for variants.  This time around, the WHO did skip two letters to get to omicron. The previous key variant was called mu, which is the 12th letter. The 13th letter in the Greek alphabet is nu, but officials thought it could be too easily confused with the word ""new,"" the New York Times reported. The letter after that is xi, which a spokesperson for the organization told the Times wasn’t used ""because it is a common last name."" It’s the spelling of the surname of the leader of China, for example — Xi Jinping — though the pronunciations are different. The Times reported that because WHO didn’t initially explain why it skipped nu and xi, it prompted speculation that the organization has been too deferential to the Chinese government.  But it’s not evidence that the pandemic is a hoax.  We rate those claims False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B64C0>],/factchecks/2021/nov/30/viral-image/new-coronavirus-variant-named-letter-greek-alphabe/

Yes, there are just a few Wisconsin school districts still doing largely virtual learning
","Wisconsin students, parents and educators shouldered a heavy burden over the past year: A patchwork of in-person, hybrid and virtual schooling as the coronavirus devastated the state. Last March, Gov. Tony Evers closed K-12 schools in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. A closure meant to last two weeks ended up lasting till the school year’s end, and in the fall, only some returned to the classroom full-time. Reopening decisions have been fraught with controversy. In Madison, teachers taught outside school buildings in early March 2021 to protest their district’s plan to resume in-person learning, arguing it should have been postponed until staff could get vaccinated. On the flip side, in early February Republicans in the state Legislature moved to send $66 million in federal aid to schools already holding in-person classes. ""The bottom line is our kids need to be in school,"" state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, said at the time. Evers has said he wants the decision to reopen to be left up to individual school districts because those officials will best understand how much of a threat COVID-19 poses in their community, a stance in line with Wisconsin’s status as a local-control state. Appearing on Capital City Sunday on March 14, 2021, the governor said he’s spoken with many superintendents who’ve successfully managed in-person school since last September. That success depends on class sizes, building ventilation and the landscape of local virus transmission — all factors he said would make it difficult to make a statewide judgment on returning to classrooms. ""There’s still a handful of school districts out,"" Evers said, but added that he’d like to get students back in school. Is he correct that just a handful of districts are still learning largely online? Let’s take a look. State officials have chosen not to track district reopenings since the end of mandatory closures last June. However, a USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin survey of Wisconsin’s regional education agencies found that every district currently has at least some in-person instruction, and only the Madison Metropolitan School District and Milwaukee Public Schools remain mostly virtual. In Madison, only the youngest students have returned to school buildings, while students in grades 3 and up are set to return in phases beginning in April. MPS offers an in-person option for some students with disabilities and could begin bringing others back starting April 12, 2021. Wisconsin has 12 Cooperative Educational Service Agencies, known as CESAs, that help communicate between the state’s Department of Public Instruction and its 422 school districts. Seven CESA administrators surveyed said collectively, there were 150 districts in their jurisdiction where all students can attend school five days a week. Thirty-nine districts use a blended model, where students are in school part of the week and learn virtually on other days. Other CESA administrators said they weren’t tracking how many districts were teaching students in-person or blended, but did say all districts were back to some in-person learning. While some students have been back in the classroom since September, more moved to come back after winter break. Such was the case for the Appleton Area School District, for example, the sixth-largest in the state. School districts generally have virtual options for students and families who did not feel safe returning to the school building, the survey found. David Honish, agency administrator of CESA 8 in northeastern Wisconsin, told a reporter that ""you have people almost making the assumption"" that districts aren’t back face-to-face, even when that isn’t the case. While many districts in his region began the school year virtually or in a hybrid model, most have returned to in-person learning, Honish said, with a few exceptions — including one high school that went virtual for two weeks after a COVID-19 outbreak. Districts are required to notify their local health department when they learn of at least two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the same building within two weeks.  Evers said there were still a handful of districts learning mostly virtually. A USA TODAY Network-Wisconsin survey found only the state’s two largest school districts were keeping students mostly virtual, although even they have limited in-person options and are planning April returns.

"['Elections', 'California', 'Guns', 'Alex Padilla']","
In majority of states, it's faster to obtain a rifle than to register to vote
","Shortly after high-profile mass shootings in Georgia and Colorado, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on gun violence. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., used an analogy with voting rights to make the case for stricter gun control. ""In a majority of states, new voters are able to obtain a rifle quicker than they’re able to cast their first ballot,"" Padilla said on March 22. ""It seems to me we have our priorities entirely backwards when it comes to this, when we make it easier to buy a gun than we do to cast a ballot."" Some critics disagreed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that Padilla’s statement was ""demonstrably, laughably false."" This is demonstrably, laughably false. Find me the Dem that says “it’s abusive to require a photo ID to buy a gun!”They ALL say that about voting.(Except for the CA gubernatorial recall....) https://t.co/YEVqiIbzTq As support, Padilla’s office referred PolitiFact to statistics from the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures; the pro-gun-control Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence; and an analysis by the Washington Post. When we reviewed these sources, we found Padilla’s assertion to be largely supported by the evidence, though we found some nuances. In his analysis, Philip Bump of the Washington Post compared every state and the District of Columbia on how quickly a resident could secure a rifle and cast a ballot after registration. (Bump noted that policies for purchasing a handgun are different, but Padilla specifically mentioned rifles at the hearing. A rifle is a type of ""long gun,"" which is a firearm with a longer barrel that is meant to be held with both hands.) In 13 states, going through either process is equally fast: In Vermont, for instance, it’s possible to buy a rifle without a waiting period, and you can register to vote on Election Day itself.  Three states — Illinois, Minnesota and Washington — make it faster to cast a ballot after registering than to secure a rifle. (There are some complications in some states, such as rules applying to certain types of rifles but not others, Bump noted.) But the majority of states — 34 states plus D.C. — have a longer wait time to cast a ballot than to obtain a rifle, according to Bump’s analysis. . According to Giffords, some states have waiting periods for firearms generally, including rifles. For instance, in Hawaii, the waiting period is 14 days, while in both California and D.C. it takes 10 days. In Florida, the law is three days or however long it takes to complete a background check, whichever is longer. Only two states have waiting periods specific to rifles — Minnesota at seven days and Washington state at 10 days.  As for voting, registration is mandatory in every state except for North Dakota. However, the last day one can register before casting a ballot — in effect, the ""waiting period"" to vote — varies by state. According to data compiled by the group Vote.org, some states like Alaska and Arkansas require registration 30 days prior to Election Day, while in other states like Colorado you can register on Election Day if you are going to vote in person. The fastest voting procedures are in force in 17 states and D.C., where a resident can register and vote the same day, said Danielle Lang, co-director of voting rights and redistricting for the Campaign Legal Center.  ""So there is essentially a waiting period for voting in all other states,"" she said. ""You have to plan to vote ahead of time and can’t do it on a whim the day of."" The bottom line, then, is that about two-thirds of states have a faster process for obtaining a gun than for being able to vote. That’s a ""majority,"" as Padilla said. While Padilla is right on the numbers, the elements of his comparison — guns and voting — are not entirely parallel.  Bump noted in his article that voting ""necessarily involves the state, while a gun purchase doesn’t. One can buy a rifle from a friend, for example; you can’t vote with a friend. That by itself tends to lower the benchmarks required"" for clearing a new gun owner. In addition, election bookkeeping is focused on the smooth functioning of a specific event on a specific date, said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University law professor who specializes in election law. The purchase of a gun isn’t. ""Once a background check has been done on a potential gun owner, is there any reason for the government to keep track of the gun owner’s identity?"" he said. ""A gun ownership ‘registry’ would be different than a background check."" Padilla said, ""In a majority of states, new voters are able to obtain a rifle quicker than they’re able to cast their first ballot."" By the numbers, this is accurate: About two-thirds of states have a faster timetable for obtaining a gun than for casting a ballot after registration. Obtaining a gun and casting a ballot aren’t exactly parallel activities. An election is an event on a specific day that requires some degree of advance bookkeeping by state officials to be prepared. Gun purchases do not require advance work to prepare for a deadline. With that clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C2A5C0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/29/alex-padilla/it-easier-obtain-rifle-register-vote-alex-padilla-/

Clean energy depends on Chinese materials. Is expanding it pro-China?
","A Democratic-led plan to cut carbon emissions and expand cleaner energy sources would play into the hands of China, some Republicans argue. At a hearing on the CLEAN Future Act, the Democrats’ climate bill, Rep. Cathy Rodgers, R-Wash., contended the plan could make the United States vulnerable. Rodgers, the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce committee, said: ""90% of the solar panels, 80% of the wind machines, 90% of the rare earth minerals (for) the batteries are in Asia or in China. So a clean energy future that is based upon those kinds of solutions that are dominated by China is really a pro-China agenda."" While Rodgers singled out China, she also included all of Asia, which would include longtime allies such as Japan and South Korea. With an eye on the geopolitical angle she emphasized at the end, we looked at what the numbers say about American reliance on China for renewable energy materials. China’s current dominance in key materials is real. Whether that means a clean-energy policy amounts to a pro-China agenda is another question. We’ll go through the three renewable power systems Rodgers listed and weigh whether the data support her broader concern. Rodgers is right that most solar panels come from Asia. The solar supply base extends beyond China, but it does have a critical reliance on Chinese materials and companies. Rodgers’ staff pointed to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, that said ""the United States is most exposed in the solar sector, followed by energy storage and then wind."" The study detailed China’s key role in producing the parts that go into solar panels. A silicon wafer is the building block of a solar panel. It’s the piece that turns sunshine into electricity, and ""more than 90% of the world’s capacity is in China,"" the February report said. The wafers are used to make solar cells and clusters of cells are assembled into solar panels, sometimes called photovoltaic modules. And here’s where the solar supply chain takes a geographic hop. In 2019, the latest year for which the U.S. Energy Information Administration has data, China — even grouped with Singapore by the EIA —  accounted for less than 6% of the solar panels imported to the U.S., as measured by their generation capacity. Malaysia was the single largest supplier, representing about 38% of all shipments. Vietnam came in second with 25%.   Does that mean the U.S. relies more on Malaysia than China? Not really. Many of the Malaysian-based solar factories are Chinese-owned. And wafers, which primarily come from China, remain a key component. (Solar companies based in Japan, the U.S., South Korea and Singapore also own plants in Malaysia.) David Sandalow, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations now at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, says such concentration in the supply chain is not a good thing, and it will be important to see production spread more evenly around the globe. But he noted that the dependence is mutual: Chinese companies need American buyers. ""If Chinese manufacturers stopped selling to the U.S., other manufacturers would enter the market,"" Sandalow said.  The authors of the CSIS report caution, though, that ""wafer factories are expensive and technically challenging to build."" Rodgers’ claim that 80% of the wind machines are from China or Asia is not right. Three large components go into wind turbines — towers, blades and generators, the units that actually convert the motion of the spinning blades into electricity. The import patterns look a little different for each. The U.S. Energy Department’s latest report shows China providing a fifth of all the imported blades. But for towers, China doesn’t rank in the top five among countries selling to the U.S. And for wind-powered generating systems, China accounts for about 5% of imports. In dollar terms, China represents only 16% of imports to the U.S. for all wind power parts, nowhere near the 80% Rodgers claimed.   However, wind turbines rely on powerful magnets, and those magnets need compounds that tend to come from China.  Rodgers specifically highlighted rare earth minerals and their tie to renewables. The connection is strongest for wind power and electric vehicles. The magnets in wind turbines and electric car motors require neodymium and dysprosium, two of the 17 rare earth minerals. She also mentioned batteries, which are essential to storing power from wind and solar, and for running electric cars and trucks. Batteries rely on cobalt and lithium, which are not on the list of rare earth elements. The Democratic Republic of the Congo dominates the cobalt supply. Australia and Chile produce most of the world’s lithium. China dominates the production of rare earth minerals on a commercial scale. Between 2016 and 2019, China supplied 80% of the U.S. demand for these materials. China also accounts for about 80% of global production.   The main caveat is that supply chains aren’t locked in for all time. While these minerals are called ""rare earth,"" they are not rare. Neodymium, for example, is about as common as zinc or lead. The problem is they generally aren’t concentrated enough to make commercial extraction worthwhile.  In testimony March 22 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, former Obama administration Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said ""there’s no doubt, as a sane energy security issue, we need to work to diversify these sources of minerals and their processing.""  That effort is underway. In 2019, the Trump administration triggered the Defense Production Act, and the Pentagon signed contracts with domestic suppliers. The U.S. government now has a stockpile of 600 tons of neodymium. Building more robust supply chains even rated an executive order from President Joe Biden. With an eye toward finding chemical substitutes, the government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency is backing research to make magnets that are rare-earth-free.  However this pans out, part of current clean-energy policy focuses on weaning the U.S. off its dependence on China. Rodgers said that the Democratic clean energy plan is pro-China, because ""90% of the solar panels, 80% of the wind machines, 90% of the rare earth minerals … are in Asia or in China."" China produces over 90% of silicon wafers, a key building block in solar panels. China produces 80% of the rare earth minerals used in the U.S. for magnets used in electrical vehicles and wind turbines, though its role in wind power overall is far less dominant. But Rodgers' conclusion that the Democrats’ legislation amounts to a pro-China agenda omits key context about the overall direction of U.S. government policy. For some time and continuing today, the U.S. has been working to diversify its supply base and shrink its reliance on Chinese materials.

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s stats on children arriving at the border
","President Joe Biden sought to downplay the current surge of migrants arriving at the southern border, saying it’s due not to his policy but is the result of a normal seasonal pattern and driven by difficult circumstances in their home countries. ""Truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. As many people came, a 28% increase in children to the border in my administration, 31% in the last year, in 2019, before the pandemic in the Trump administration,"" Biden said during a press conference March 25. ""It happens every single solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year."" The early months of the year, he said, are when ""they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat and the desert."" PolitiFact decided to fact-check Biden’s claims that the increase in children arriving during his time in office is similar to what happened in 2019, and that the increased arrivals at the border are part of a seasonal pattern. For this analysis, we looked specifically at encounters with Border Patrol agents, who apprehend people suspected of illegally entering the United States. And we looked at data from January and February 2021, the latest months for which data are available, compared with the same months in 2019. Here’s what the numbers showed for Border Patrol encounters with children who arrive alone: January 2021: 5,694
February 2021: 9,297
Month-to-month increase: About 63% January 2019: 5,105
February 2019: 6,817
Month-to-month increase: About 33% So while Biden’s number for 2019 was close to the mark, he understated the rate of increase of children arriving in 2021 by more than half. Counting all migrants — children, families and single adults — there was a 28% increase from January to February 2021, but Biden’s claim was about just children. In 2019, the increase for that period was 39%. Biden also said that every year, ""there is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March."" Typically, southern border apprehensions start picking up in those months: February numbers exceed January’s, and March’s numbers top February’s. The one exception over the past two decades was fiscal year 2017, during Donald Trump’s first months in office. Even with the seasonal trend, Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of homeland security, said earlier this month that the U.S. is ""on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years."" Biden said there was a ""28% increase in children to the border in my administration"" and ""31% … in 2019."" The increase in migration in January, February and March ""happens every year."" Biden is wrong about the increase in children’s arrivals during his administration — it’s 63%, more than twice what he said. His figure for 2019 was roughly accurate. Biden is correct that rising border apprehensions in February and March are part of a seasonal pattern, but his claim ignores that the total number of encounters this year is likely to be the highest in 20 years. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Energy', 'Texas', 'Allen West']","
No, Texas has not given $19 billion in wind subsidies
","The deadly winter storms last month that left millions of Texans shivering in their homes without power has reinvigorated the debate over fossil fuels versus renewable energy, as many tried to cast blame for the outages even though all types of generators struggled to produce during the freeze. Among the renewable energy critics was Texas GOP Chair Allen West, who wrote on social media: ""Since 2006 Texas has given $19B in taxpayer subsidies to wind energy companies. Over the past 2-3 years Texas has tripled our dependence on wind energy to 23-25 percent of our energy distribution system."" Those figures appeared high at first glance, but we wanted to check with experts. Here’s what we found. Wind energy generators have received subsidies on the federal, state and local levels, as have other types of generators. West claimed that the state has given out $19 billion since 2006. The party’s spokesman Luke Twombly did not respond to multiple requests for an explanation of the number’s source. Carey King, research scientist at the University of Texas and assistant director at the university’s Energy Institute, who wrote a paper on state energy subsidies, said he could not see how West was coming up with that figure. The 2018 white paper that King co-authored looked at state-sponsored subsidies for various types of electricity generation. The paper found that renewables do receive a lot more financial help than conventional technologies. Wind receives between $16 to $30 per megawatt-hour while conventional power sources receive up to $2 a megawatt-hour. The wind number is so high because it includes the cost of $7 billion Competitive Renewable Energy Zone transmission lines, a ratepayer-funded project that helps bring power from West Texas wind and solar generators to large Texas cities hundreds of miles away. Because the transmission line project is not a traditional subsidy and there is debate over whether it should be counted as such, the researchers opted to calculate state subsidies with and without it. One argument for excluding it is that subsidies are usually meant to incentivize investment; however, in the case of the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone lines, consumers, not generators, are paying for an investment, the paper points out. It adds that the wind farm developers aren’t the ones benefiting from cost savings here, but rather transmission and distribution utilities. King added that the lines, which are also hooked up to traditional energy generation units, transmit more than just electricity produced by renewable generators. If that project is removed from the calculation, researchers found that wind receives a comparable amount to other generators with $2 to $3 per megawatt-hour. But even including the $7 billion, King said he has ""a hard time coming up with that ($19 billion) number for wind."" King guessed that West might mistakenly be including federal production tax credits, which were established in 1992 and provide a tax credit for the first 10 years of electricity generation for large-scale wind farms. An April 2019 report by the conservative think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, came up with a similar number when estimating state and local subsidies in Texas that are to be paid out through 2029 at nearly $18 billion. West’s tweet, however, implies the time period he is referring to is 2006 to the present. Brian Phillips, a spokesman for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, confirmed that the figure referred to subsidies that extended through eight years from now. The Texas Public Policy Foundation paper’s calculation included the transmission line project but claimed the true cost was more like $14 billion when factoring in costs to transmission companies to use the lines that the paper assumes will be passed on to customers through rate increases. West’s spokesman, Twombly, said the party chair misspoke in the second part of the statement. ""The Chairman meant to put double in his tweet not triple,"" Twombly said in an email, referring to the state’s increasing dependence on wind power in the last two to three years.  Data from the state’s electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, shows that wind grew from comprising 17 percent of the state’s energy mix in 2017 to 23 percent in 2020 -- an increase of 35.3%. Asked about this, Twombly referred to an earlier PolitiFact that discussed how wind had become the state’s second-largest resource after natural gas since 2014, when wind provided just 11 percent of the state’s fuel. But that would be a five year, not a 2-3 year time frame. West said the state has given $19 billion in taxpayer subsidies to wind energy companies since 2006. He also said the state is using three times as much wind energy as it was using two or three years ago.  Slicing the numbers various ways, it's impossible to arrive at West's $19 billion figure. And the wind energy composition has doubled, not tripled, over a five-year period, not a two to three year period. We rate this claim False.

"['Health Check', 'Coronavirus', 'Rand Paul']","
In his continued sparring with Fauci, Sen. Paul oversimplified the science
","That Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky often disagrees with infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci is well known. Recently, the pair clashed at a Senate hearing when Paul, a Republican, argued against mask recommendations for people who have had Covid-19 or have been vaccinated against it. At the hearing, Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, pushed back against Paul’s characterization of wearing masks as ""theater."" Continued caution is advised, Fauci said, as scientists study the new variants now circulating in the U.S. and other countries. Paul, an eye doctor by training, continued the squabble a few days later, calling out Fauci in a tweet, pointing to a study that he said ""shows vaccines and naturally acquired immunity DO effectively neutralize COVID variants."" The tweet linked to a study published online at the JAMA Network, a family of specialty medical journals. We reached out to Paul’s office for additional sources for his tweet but did not receive a reply. So, we asked the experts: Are Covid variants effectively neutralized by vaccines or natural immunity conferred on people who recover from the illness? In short, the research cited by Paul does show good blood levels of neutralizing antibodies against at least some of the current variants following infection or vaccination. But they’re not the whole story. Mehul S. Suthar, an author of the study Paul cited, said the results are encouraging but should not be seen as all-encompassing: ""Our interpretation is that our study looks at one aspect of immune response, antibodies."" Neutralizing antibodies are important because they can block the ability of a virus like the one that causes Covid to infect cells. But the body also has other defenses. T cells, for example, can be spurred by infection or vaccination, Suthar said, although the study was not designed to look at those. For the study, researchers gathered blood samples from 40 people who were in the hospital with Covid or had recovered from it. From the National Institutes of Health, they also received blood samples drawn from 14 people who had gotten both doses of the Moderna vaccine, said Suthar, an assistant professor at Emory University’s vaccine center. Then they ran tests on those samples against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and three variants, including the one dubbed B.1.1.7, which first appeared in the United Kingdom and is now circulating widely in the U.S. They wanted to know: Did antibodies produced by being infected or vaccinated neutralize B.1.1.7? ""We are lucky with B.1.1.7 that our antibodies appear to work well against this virus,"" Suthar said. However, as with any study, there are caveats. For one thing, the results were based on a small number of samples. And the analysis did not include other variants of concern, such as the ones that emerged in South Africa and Brazil, which limits the ability to draw broad conclusions. Finally, antibodies are just one measure of potential protection against disease. Laboratory research measuring antibodies indicates that some immunity is created by both illness and vaccination, but the strength and longevity of that protection — the effectiveness in the real world — is a separate question. That’s partly because the ideal level of neutralizing antibodies needed for protection is not known and other immune protections, such as T cells, aren’t measured. Also, in the real world, other factors — such as the variant a person is exposed to, and the presence of  other mitigating factors, including masks and good ventilation — can make a difference. ""Part of the reason that real world data are so important is looking at the whole picture of immunity,"" said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Also, with the level of community transmissions of disease, I would be concerned that there will be more variants that emerge."" Paul’s tweet — taking aim at what he sees as an overcautious approach by public health experts — doesn’t capture that type of nuance, nor does it reference studies on the other emerging variants. ""Blanket assertions made by non-scientific experts are not going to help,"" said Gronvall. Dr. Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases at Georgetown University, agreed. ""It’s wrong to declare victory and say there’s no problem with variants and that everyone previously infected will be fine,"" said Goodman, who served as chief scientist of the Food and Drug Administration under the Obama administration. Viruses naturally mutate as they replicate. So it’s not surprising that the coronavirus has done so. Several variants have emerged, including home-grown ones from California and New York. Lab tests on blood samples from vaccine trial participants in South Africa showed lower levels of neutralizing antibody production, possibly related to the variant circulating there. How big a difference the lower levels measured in those samples make isn’t yet known. Levels are still high and could ""effectively neutralize the virus,"" Fauci wrote in an editorial published Feb. 11 in JAMA. Even so, clinical trials used to test Covid vaccines before they were approved for emergency use showed lower efficacy when tested in areas where the South African variant was circulating. ""We expect vaccines and prior infection to offer significant protection against variants that are closely related,"" said Goodman. ""But as they become more genetically different — like the South African one — that protection could go down."" The main goal of the vaccines is to prevent hospitalization and death, and all the vaccines in use in the U.S. appear to substantially reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid, according to research. ""Even if the current vaccines may not be perfect, they do appear to prevent more severe outcomes,"" Goodman said. Don’t assume, as Paul’s tweet implies, that recovering from covid or getting vaccinated means zero risk of infection. For one thing, reinfection is rare but can occur. Goodman pointed to a recent study conducted in Denmark showing that a small percentage (0.65%) of people who tested positive for Covid in the spring fell ill again. ""People should not presume that even if they had the vaccine or were previously infected that there’s no future risk,"" Goodman said. Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, Gronvall at Hopkins said not to use that as an excuse to avoid inoculation. ""The vaccines appear to be great,"" she said. ""Get one when you can."" Paul is correct that the JAMA study showed vaccination or previous infection appeared, based on a small sample of people, to help neutralize the virus. However, he left out important details that make his position an oversimplification of a complicated issue. The study considered only one variant — the one that emerged in the U.K. — and did not include an analysis of other types now circulating, or the potential for additional variants that could emerge. Also, the type of antibody studied is just one factor in protecting against disease, and just what those levels of neutralizing antibodies  measured in a laboratory experiment may mean in the real world is not known. So, for those reasons, we rate the senator’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4E6B80>],/factchecks/2021/mar/26/rand-paul/his-continued-sparring-fauci-sen-paul-oversimplifi/
"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Coronavirus', 'James Edming']","
Yes, data shows COVID-19 vaccines are safe despite quick timeline
","State Rep. James Edming doesn’t trust the COVID-19 vaccine. He even told a Wisconsin Assembly committee, ""we should eliminate"" it. Explaining his objection, the 75-year-old Republican from Glen Flora, in rural northern Wisconsin, has repeatedly cited a personal anecdote, most recently in a March 23, 2021, floor session of the Wisconsin state Assembly. As lawmakers debated several bills that would prohibit mandatory vaccinations, Edming told of a friend whose wife died of cancer. ""His wife was 70 years old, and 71 years ago, there was a vaccination that they gave women so they wouldn’t have a miscarriage, and his mother-in-law took that vaccination,"" Edming said. ""His mother-in-law died at age 70. His wife died at age 70, and their daughter is sterile. ""That’s what the research has been able to follow up on in 70 years, and you think I’m going to take something because some scientist says that it’s good for me. And looking at and listening to what my friend has to say, there’s got to be a little more research before I take something. There may be a vaccination that’s for this, but you can’t tell me they can solve this in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that. There hasn’t even been any animal research on this."" Edming covers a lot of territory here. A few quick notes before we go deeper. His anecdote references a treatment that has indeed proven to have tragic, long-term consequences. But it wasn’t a vaccine, and it was developed in very different circumstances more than 80 years ago. More on this later. Edming is flat wrong about animal research. All three vaccines in use now in the U.S. were tested on animals in addition to the expansive human trials. But we’ll focus mostly on the timing-based claim. Is it really not realistic to develop a safe vaccine in less than a year? The most obvious rebuttal to Edming’s claim is that millions of Americans have been safely vaccinated. The CDC requires all deaths following vaccinations to be reported, which sparks a review of the death certificate, autopsy and other documents to check for a connection. Through March 22, 2,216 deaths were reported among 126 million vaccine doses administered so far in the U.S. But that doesn’t mean those are tied to the vaccine. In a sample so large, there will be people who die of other causes and, according to the CDC, those documents ""revealed no evidence that vaccinations contributed to patient deaths.""  Meanwhile, some people have reported side effects, including two to five per million who experience anaphylaxis — a severe allergic reaction. But Edming’s criticism focused on the speed of the process, so let’s dig in to how the vaccines got to this point so quickly. Defending Edming’s claim, his staff pointed to a vaccine history website from the College of Physicians of Philadelphia that says, ""Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years."" However, the same website details CDC guidance on the COVID-19 vaccines, including this: ""Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history."" That gets to the heart of where Edming goes wrong. The process that led to today’s COVID-19 vaccines is unlike anything that came before it. The unprecedented global consequences of the coronavirus pandemic spawned an equally unprecedented global cooperation in pursuit of a vaccine. This was made possible by a new method of developing vaccines, mass numbers of infections that accelerated clinical trials and governments willing to eliminate bureaucratic and financial roadblocks, the New York Times reported. While the vaccine process involved breakthroughs, they were built on research that goes back decades.  ""These vaccines were fast-tracked, but the parts that were fast-tracked were the paperwork; so the administrative approvals, the time to get the funding,"" Dr. Andrew Badley, COVID-19 Research Task Force Chair at the Mayo Clinic, said in a video produced by the hospital system. ""Because these vaccines have such great interest, the time it took to enroll patients was very, very fast. The follow-up was as thorough as it is for any vaccine."" Each of the three vaccines now in use in the U.S. went through the standard three phases of human testing. Stage 3 testing conducted prior to receiving emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration involved 43,448 people for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 30,420 people for Moderna and 43,783 people for Johnson & Johnson. The FDA describes the process this way on its website: ""In public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, the development process may be atypical. For example, as demonstrated by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has coalesced government agencies, international counterparts, academia, nonprofit organizations and pharmaceutical companies to develop a coordinated strategy for prioritizing and speeding development of the most promising vaccines. In addition, the federal government has made investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at its own risk, giving companies confidence that they can invest aggressively in development and allowing faster distribution of an eventual vaccine. However, efforts to speed vaccine development to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have not sacrificed scientific standards, integrity of the vaccine review process, or safety."" In the U.S., that government funding came from Operation Warp Speed, an initiative launched under the Trump Administration that laid out $18 billion to accelerate vaccine development and manufacturing. Steps to speed the process included beginning large-scale manufacturing during clinical trials, running some phases of clinical trials at the same time and investing in multiple types of vaccines to increase the chances of success, according to a February 2021 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Among the six potential vaccines Operation Warp Speed invested in, two used messenger RNA, two used viral vector technology that deploys an altered cold virus and two focused on the virus’s spike protein. The first two vaccines approved here — Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — are particularly noteworthy in their use of messenger RNA, a new approach to vaccine creation. Vaccines built on mRNA have a general structure into which the genetic code needed to address a virus can be quickly loaded, rather than developing an entire vaccine from scratch. Moderna likens the process to loading a program or app into a computer’s operating system. Drs. Sabrina Murphy and Maggie Nolan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health reviewed research on the matter at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""There have been over three decades of mRNA vaccine research and development on vaccines for other disease such as influenza, Zika virus, and rabies virus. Additionally, mRNA-based cancer vaccines have been used in numerous cancer clinical trials with promising results,"" the doctors said in a joint statement. ""The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine development was actually preceded by decades of research into understanding the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines and has made the COVID-19 vaccine a miracle of circumstances. It has allowed for a COVID-19 vaccine to be developed and tested much more rapidly."" Before we wrap up, let’s circle back to the anecdote Edming cited. It’s the same story he shared in a March 3 hearing before the Committee on Constitution and Ethics, where he recalled the friend’s deceased wife as an ""awesome, awesome lady."" Tyler Longsine, a research assistant for Edming, said they didn’t know the nature of the drug involved — despite Edming’s repeated use of the story. But experts consulted by PolitiFact Wisconsin say his description lines up with the history of a drug called Diethylstilbestrol, or DES. It’s a hormone supplement that was given to between 5 and 10 million women as a pill, injection, cream or suppository from the 1940s to the 1970s, the CDC reported. Doctors believed it would prevent miscarriages. The National Institutes of Health said few studies were done on the drug before it was produced, however, causing it to be given to women worldwide in inconsistent doses. DES was in use long before a sweeping 1962 bill overhauled FDA drug approval requirements, making manufacturers prove the effectiveness of drugs before marketing them. By 1953, research had shown DES did not prevent miscarriages or premature birth. But many doctors continued using it until research in early 1970s revealed children exposed to DES in utero were more likely to suffer from infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues — in line with Edming’s story. As tragic as this outcome was for Edming’s friend and countless other families, their situation is not comparable to the COVID-19 vaccine. DES was a medication, not a vaccine. And it was developed 82 years ago under looser standards that led it to be administered erratically. ""The only similarity between DES and vaccines is that both may be given through injection,"" Murphy and Nolan said in their statement. ""We give many medications by injection — think of insulin, for example — and they have nothing to do with vaccines."" In a speech detailing his distrust of scientists and the COVID-19 vaccine, Edming said, ""You can’t tell me they can (develop a safe vaccine) in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that."" Edming leaned on criticism of a medical treatment — not a vaccine — developed in the 1930s and released without a fraction of the scientific scrutiny given to the COVID-19 vaccines. And in any case, his conclusion is contrary to the overwhelming medical consensus and what we can clearly see from the worldwide rollout. Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (with others on the way) were able to develop as quickly as they did due to a breakthrough vaccine mechanism, billions in federal funding and an array of bureaucratic fast-tracking that allowed faster production, simultaneous trials and timely approvals. Those vaccines were together tested on more than 100,000 people. And with millions of people now safely and effectively vaccinated, we see that safety claims made based on the trials were indeed valid. Which makes Edming’s claim ridiculous. We rate Edming’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BEFC00>],/factchecks/2021/mar/26/james-edming/yes-vaccines-are-safe-despite-quick-timeline/

Charles Schumer misleads on Georgia voting legislation
","Sen. Charles Schumer said Republican state legislatures have ""seized on the former president’s big lie that the election was stolen"" and introduced bills that aim to limit the right of citizens to vote. Schumer, the Democratic majority leader from New York, said the most ""reprehensible effort"" might be found in Georgia. ""Republicans recently passed a bill to eliminate early voting on Sunday — a day when many churchgoing African Americans participate in voter drives known as Souls to the Polls,"" Schumer said during a March 24 Senate committee hearing on S1, a federal voting rights bill. ""What an astonishing coincidence: outlaw voting on a day when African American churches sponsor get-out-the-vote efforts."" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said that Schumer was wrong about the status of legislation in Georgia. ""They are not eliminating voting on Sunday,"" he said. ""It did not pass the Legislature."" Schumer’s spokesperson said he was referring to two Georgia bills, HB 531 and SB 202. Neither one had made it into law at the time of Schumer’s remarks. By the time Schumer made his comments, lawmakers were on track to allow the option of Sunday voting. In 2020, Georgia voted for Democrat Joe Biden and, in January, Democrats won the two Senate runoffs, putting the state in battleground territory for future elections. State Republican lawmakers then proposed bills that they said would protect the integrity of the vote, despite the fact that state GOP election officials said the election was secure. Under Georgia law for the 2020 election, counties had to offer one Saturday of early voting. Counties had the option to provide an additional Saturday and two Sundays. Generally larger, diverse Democratic-leaning counties held Sunday early voting. HB 531, a sweeping elections bill introduced by state Republicans in February, initially got rid of Sunday early voting. Civil rights advocates said the legislation was a racist attempt to suppress the Black vote. Republicans rewrote the bill to provide the option of one Sunday of early voting, and the House voted in favor of the bill March 1 along party lines. But after Schumer spoke, a separate elections bill ultimately moved forward.  SB 202 passed both chambers along party lines with GOP support. And on March 25, the day after Schumer’s comments, Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law. The new law requires two Saturdays of early voting and provides for the option of two Sundays of early voting, Keith Williams, general counsel to Republican House Speaker David Ralston, told PolitiFact. The law specifies that the early voting Sundays fall two or three weeks before Election Day, which means no Sunday voting is allowed two days before Election Day. The early voting period under Georgia law previously ended the Friday before Election Day; so, unlike in some states, Georgia already disallowed early voting on the last Sunday before Election Day. The bill also shrinks the voting period in a runoff election, which happens when no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote. Williams told PolitiFact that the new law will allow for Sunday early voting during a runoff if election officials meet certification deadlines and there is time left to hold weekend voting. That means practically speaking, we don’t yet know if Sunday voting will occur in future runoffs. The shorter voting period for runoffs was among the objections raised by voting rights groups who immediately sued to challenge the new law. The lawsuit stated that ""the change eliminates the guarantee of early voting on weekends, which racial minorities disproportionately rely on to cast their ballots."" Schumer said that ""Republicans recently passed a bill to eliminate early voting on Sunday"" in Georgia. Schumer’s statement provides a misleading impression that Georgia Republicans completely got rid of Sunday voting. Republicans initially proposed getting rid of Sunday early voting, but by the time of Schumer’s remarks, the state House had passed a bill that allowed for one Sunday of voting. A day after Schumer spoke, a bill was signed into law that allowed the option of two Sundays of voting. Schumer misstated the effect of the bill that Republicans advanced and ultimately passed..

Yes, Wisconsin inmates are eligible for stimulus checks -- just as before
","Another round of stimulus payments is hitting the bank accounts of eligible Wisconsinites — but some state lawmakers have strong opinions about who should be able to receive them. State Sen. Julian Bradley, R-Franklin, and state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, introduced legislation that would require money sent to Wisconsin prisoners under the latest COVID-19 relief package to be spent on any restitution they owe. Bradley made his argument for the bill in a March 15, 2021 report from the Associated Press. ""President Biden's irresponsible stimulus package sends stimulus checks to imprisoned murderers, rapists, and child molesters,"" he said. This issue has been discussed often amid the debate over how to respond to the COVID-19 crisis — and even factored into packages passed under former President Donald Trump. Let’s break it down. Are prisoners eligible? Our friends at PolitiFact National dug into this question after U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said Democrats ""voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison."" They rated the claim Mostly True.  While Bradley described some crimes in detail for dramatic effect, the crux of his claim is the same as Cotton’s.  Before the Senate passed the relief package, Democrats rejected an amendment from Cotton and Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana that would have barred stimulus checks from going to prisoners. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., argued this would harm the Black and brown families of prisoners already disproportionately affected by mass incarceration.  And without that amendment, the bill that was passed said incarcerated people were eligible for stimulus checks as long as they’re a citizen or legal U.S. resident and either filed a tax return or requested a payment from the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS further notes that inmates can’t be denied relief if they meet those criteria. That said, this isn’t new.  Prisoners were eligible for checks through similarly broad requirements in the CARES Act and a supplemental package passed in 2020 with Republican support under the Trump administration. The IRS attempted to block that group from receiving payments under the CARES Act, but a federal court ultimately rejected that effort.  So, Republicans like Bradley who want to pin the blame solely on President Joe Biden and other Democrats are a bit off the mark. In an interview, Bradley said the latest stimulus checks are going to ""imprisoned murderers, rapists, and child molesters."" Prisoners can, in fact, receive payments under the latest COVID-19 package — something that’s been true since the federal government started providing pandemic relief.  Implying that this is the work of Democrats, as Bradley did, leaves out the fact the same was true of packages passed under Trump. We rate his claim Mostly True.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967AC400>],/factchecks/2021/mar/26/julian-bradley/yes-wisconsin-inmates-are-eligible-stimulus-checks/

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim about families at the border
","President Joe Biden in his first press conference as president sought to relieve concerns about the numbers of people arriving at the southern border, claiming that the vast majority are ""being sent back,"" including families. ""Thousands, tens of thousands of people who are over 18 years of age and single people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home,"" Biden said March 25. ""We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We are trying to work out now with Mexico their willingness to take more of those families back."" Data reported by Customs and Border Protection shows that he’s right about adults coming alone — most encountered by Border Patrol agents are being expelled under a public health law invoked by the Trump administration and still in effect under Biden. But Biden’s claim about families facing the same outcome is wrong, according to the latest monthly data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. February’s numbers are all we have so far on enforcement actions during Biden’s tenure. (Most of January’s data came during the Trump administration.) The numbers cover how many people were apprehended and placed into deportation proceedings as well as the number of people who were turned away under a public health law invoked last year. Border Patrol in February encountered close to 19,000 ""family unit aliens"" (this can include a child and at least one parent), and around 7,900 were expelled. So more than 11,000 — the majority — were let in and placed in immigration proceedings. The White House did not provide data that supports his claim. (March data is expected in early April.) ""Given that migration flows and Mexican capacity fluctuates, one month of statistics doesn’t reflect the full picture,"" said Vedant Patel, a White House spokesperson. The administration’s policy remains that families are expelled, and when expulsion is not possible due to Mexico’s inability to receive the families they are placed into U.S. immigration proceedings, Patel said. He also said that many families placed in immigration proceedings are ultimately deported when it’s determined that their case for asylum doesn’t have grounds. Even if the families let in eventually leave, ""it likely won’t occur for years given the extreme backlogs in immigration court that have long predated the Biden presidency,"" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a policy counsel at the American Immigration Council. The situation at the border has been ""complicated and rapidly-changing,"" Reichlin-Melnick said. In January, more than half of families were expelled, but in February that stopped being the case, he said. Biden said, ""We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming."" Border Patrol data shows that in February the majority of families were not expelled, they were let in and placed in immigration proceedings. So far, February is the only full month of the Biden administration for which data is available. In January, more than half of families were expelled, but most of that period covered the Trump administration. Biden’s claim is inaccurate.

""An early morning accident on Airport Road led to the accidental release of over a dozen bull sharks into the Ouachita River, one being 15 ft in length."" The screenshot is being shared as authentic news, but if you search for the story online, you’ll find that it originated on a self-described ""fake news"" website.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story was posted on the website Spa City Chronicle on Feb. 25. It’s labeled ""Fake News"" and details the hunt for the largest shark —  ""Jaws"" — who was supposedly captured attacking a small boat.  Bull sharks are no strangers to rivers. They prefer low-salinity waters and can thrive in freshwater, according to Louisiana Fisheries, which noted that they’ve been found as far up the Mississippi River as St. Louis, Mo.  But this story isn’t true.

Fact-checking Kirsten Gillibrand on military sexual assaults
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has made tackling sexual assaults in the military one of her signature issues. Gillibrand is backing the Military Justice Improvement Act, which would place the decision to prosecute serious crimes in the military, such as sexual assault, in the hands of independent prosecutors rather officials within the military chain of command. Gillibrand argues that doing this would reduce conflicts of interest and inspire more confidence in the system among survivors. Several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Ted Cruz of Texas, have joined more than two dozen Democrats in co-sponsoring the measure. During a radio interview with WNYC on Feb. 23, Gillibrand argued that there’s still a long way to go in solving the problem of military sexual assault, and that the problem worsened under President Donald Trump. ""Unfortunately, under Trump, it got even worse than it ever was,"" Gillibrand said in the interview. ""We had the highest number of sexual assaults ever reported in the last year. We had a retaliation rate against those people that reported, left statistically unchanged from the last few years. We had the lowest conviction rate and the lowest prosecution rate since the time I've been working on this. Everything is going in the wrong direction, and it is untenable."" Is it correct that reported sexual assaults are the highest they’ve ever been, and that conviction and prosecution rates are at a low point? We found that Department of Defense statistics show that Gillibrand is largely accurate, though we noticed some nuances. Evan Lukaske, Gillibrand’s communications director, pointed us to Appendix B of the fiscal 2019 edition of the Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military. The report was released in April 2020. The data for reported sexual assaults shows an increase every year except one — 2015, when the number dropped slightly. All told, there were 3,327 sexual assaults in 2010 and 7,825 in 2019, meaning that the number more than doubled over the course of a decade.  The Pentagon data supports Gillibrand’s statement about reported assaults. However, it’s important to note that this is just one of two measurements the Pentagon uses to count sexual assaults.  The other is a biennial estimate of sexual assaults, based on survey responses. The idea is that some servicemembers who are sexually assaulted will not file a formal complaint, but would still be willing to tell a survey taker about it. So the estimated number of servicemembers experiencing sexual assault is always significantly higher than the number officially reported. There have been six surveys taken so far, starting with 2006. The 2018 level of 20,500 estimated incidents — the most recent data point — is well below the estimate from 2006, which was 34,200. But the 2018 level represented a notable increase from 2016. This increase also supports Gillibrand’s argument.    The Pentagon told PolitiFact that both measures are important, but that they show different things. There’s no question that officials would like to see fewer assaults. However, an increase in reported sexual assaults may or may not reflect a worsening problem, depending on whether the increase stems from a greater willingness of survivors to come forward and report the incident. ""Fundamentally, while the department wants to see prevalence decrease, we also want servicemembers who experience a sexual assault to come forward and report it in order to get restorative care, receive support, and aid efforts to hold offenders appropriately accountable,"" said Lisa Lawrence, a Pentagon spokesperson. The Pentagon report doesn’t provide clean figures for prosecution and conviction rates, but Gillibrand’s office provided PolitiFact with their calculations of data in the report, and we double-checked their work. We have used the data on reported assaults for these figures, rather than the survey estimates, since they are available for each year. In general, the data between 2013 and 2019 shows a downward trend in prosecutions — from 23% in 2013 to 10% in 2019. In the most recent two years for which data is available, 2018 and 2019, the percentage going to trial dropped modestly, from 11% to 10%. The same pattern held for convictions, which fell from 17% in 2013 to 7% in 2019. During the past two years, 2018 and 2019, the percentage held steady at 7%. It’s worth noting, however, that the total number of sexual assault reports has risen over the same period, from 5,518 to 7,825. It’s possible that in 2013, only the most severe cases were being reported, resulting in higher prosecution and conviction rates than today. Today, there may be more cases reported in which a lack of evidence or witnesses may make them tougher to prosecute. Although Gillibrand cast blame on the Trump administration for rising rates of assault, these trends were not confined to Trump’s presidency. For instance, in five of the six years when Barack Obama was president, the number of reports rose. And the single biggest year-to-year increase, between 2012 and 2013, came under Obama.  Gillibrand said, ""We had the highest number of (military) sexual assaults ever reported in the last year"" and ""we had the lowest conviction rate and the lowest prosecution rate."" The number of reported military sexual assaults increased in all but one year between 2010 and 2019, and the number reached a record in 2019. The number of estimated assaults based on survey data also increased between 2016 and 2018, the most recent two years for which data is available. Conviction and prosecution rates have also dropped in most years since 2013. However, the decline in prosecution and conviction rates may be related to an increase in reported assaults, changing the mix of cases that are most prosecutable.

Mexican nationals must show a valid passport when traveling to the United States by air. But a Border Crossing Card can also be used in lieu of a passport to travel from Mexico to the United States by land, personal boat, or ferry. The cards are issued only to citizens and residents of Mexico. Applicants must meet eligibility standards to qualify and show that they have ties to Mexico that would compel them to return.  U.S. citizens, meanwhile, must have a valid U.S. passport book or card to fly or drive across the border into Mexico, according to the State Department. All U.S. citizens traveling internationally must have a valid U.S. passport to board a flight to the United States, but there are more options for U.S. citizens traveling within the Western Hemisphere: Canada, Mexico, the Carribean, and Central and South America.  U.S. citizens entering the United States from within the Western Hemisphere by air must have a valid U.S. passport or NEXUS card, which is issued to eligible pre-screened travelers to expedite travel when entering the United States and Canada..

Citizens traveling by land or sea into the United States must show one of several documents approved under the so-called Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, including passports, enhanced driver’s licenses, military identification cards, or ""trusted traveler cards."" These include the NEXUS card, which U.S. citizens, U.S. lawful permanent residents, Canadian citizens, Canadian permanent residents and Mexican nationals can apply for. Americans and Mexican nationals can enter Canada without a passport if they have a NEXUS card. And the card can be used to enter the United States under some circumstances, too. Ultimately, travelers to the United States need something to prove their citizenship, Rhonda Lawson, a spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, told USA Today. That’s also true of travelers to Mexico and Canada. In most cases that’s a passport, but some people are able to cross borders without one if they qualify for another travel document proving their citizenship.  We rate this post Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4729C0>],/factchecks/2021/mar/25/facebook-posts/yes-passports-are-generally-required-enter-us-some/

The Evergreen ship blocking the Suez Canal is not linked to Hillary Clinton
","What do the Suez Canal, Hillary Clinton and a Taiwanese shipping company have in common?  Conspiracy theorists on Facebook insist they’re all part of an international human trafficking scheme.  Egyptian authorities are working to remove a 1,300-foot cargo ship that got stuck March 23 in the Suez Canal, a critical shipping route that connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The boat is operated by the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan shipping conglomerate. Some Facebook users took that as a signal of Clinton’s involvement. ""HRC = Hillary Rodham Clinton. Evergreen = Hillary’s Secret Service name. Evergreen Call Sign: H3RC,"" a March 24 post about the shipping accident says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) Similar false claims about Clinton, ""evergreen"" and human trafficking surfaced after the Beirut port explosion in August. The newest example is similarly bogus and traces back to a baseless conspiracy theory that’s been circulating since 2016. First, let’s review some facts about Evergreen. Evergreen Line is the trade name for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group. The companies comprise the fourth largest container fleet in the world, according to the JOC Group, a logistics intelligence firm. An Evergreen ship got stuck in a bank of the Suez Canal during a dust storm with high winds, the Wall Street Journal reported. The incident involves an Ever Given ship, which is one of the largest ocean vessels in the world. More than 100 ships are waiting to traverse the canal, dealing a blow to global shipping. The story turns into fiction with the added elements of Clinton and human trafficking. The conspiracy theory goes like this: Clinton is part of a global child sex trafficking cabal, and her Secret Service codename was ""Evergreen."" (She confirmed the codename during the 2016 campaign.) Therefore, Clinton is using Evergreen to transport children. That baseless line is related to the broader Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories about prominent Democrats and child victims. After the Ever Given ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, QAnon supporters on Telegram and Gab, social media platforms that are popular among conservatives, pointed to the boat’s call sign, H3RC, as evidence to support their theory. Clinton’s initials are HRC. It’s unclear what cargo the Evergreen ship is carrying, but there’s no evidence that it’s people. We reached out to Evergreen through its website for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. The post is inaccurate, ridiculous and free of proof.

Yes, West Virginia is the only state to lose population over the past 70 years
","During the 2021 West Virginia legislative session, Gov. Jim Justice has pushed his marquee proposal: a repeal of the state income tax. West Virginia would become the 10th state without an income tax, and Justice said the switch could help bolster the state’s stagnant population. In a March 4 tweet announcing the proposal, Justice wrote, ""Today I submitted my plan to repeal our state personal income tax, putting more money in every West Virginian’s pocket on day one. WV is the only state to decline in population over the last 70 years. Our opportunity to change is now!"" Today I submitted my plan to repeal our state personal income tax, putting more money in every West Virginian’s pocket on day one. WV is the only state to decline in population over the last 70 years. Our opportunity to change is now!Read my plan here ⬇️https://t.co/vWU6QOTESc Is Justice right about West Virginia being the only state to see its population decline over the past 70 years? Justice’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but we looked at the underlying census data, and it backed him up. An analysis of population numbers by state from the 1950 census and the 2019 census estimates show that West Virginia is the only state to see a decrease in population over that time span. We looked at every state’s population in the decennial census, starting in 1950. Because final 2020 census results haven’t been released yet, we relied on the 2019 population estimate, which is released by the U.S. Census Bureau using a different method. At the top of the list are California, Texas, and Florida, each of which gained between 18 million and 29 million residents during that 69-year period. And at the bottom? West Virginia, with a loss of about 213,000 residents, or 11%. The other states near the bottom all had small gains rather than losses: North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont each gained a small number of residents, from 142,000 to 246,000. On a percentage basis, Iowa, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, New York and Rhode Island were the states with the smallest increases. But only West Virginia actually lost people.   We checked with William Frey, a census specialist at the Brookings Institution, to see whether there were any caveats we should note. The only issue Frey pointed out was that West Virginia’s population has not been in continuous decline during that period. There was a short and temporary bump in West Virginia’s population during the 1970s, and another modest one from 2000 to 2010.   It’s also worth noting that the bulk of West Virginia’s population decline occurred before 1970, and that the population has been roughly flat since 1990. Had Justice chosen 1970 as a starting point instead of 1950, the comparison would have shown a small increase in population. For the record, there’s some correlation between the lack of an income tax and fast population growth, but it’s not perfect. Several of the fastest-growing states do lack an income tax, including Alaska, Florida, Nevada, Texas and Washington. But other states without an income tax have seen slow population growth, including South Dakota and Wyoming. Justice said that West Virginia ""is the only state to decline in population over the last 70 years."" That’s correct. Every other state gained at least 142,000 residents during that period.  We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096710080>],/factchecks/2021/mar/25/jim-justice/west-virginia-only-state-decline-population-over-l/
