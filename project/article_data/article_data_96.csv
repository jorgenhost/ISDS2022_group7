Most immigrants in US illegally aren't eligible for direct $1,400 stimulus checks
","A widely shared Facebook post claims that people living in the country illegally will get payments from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus pandemic relief package. The post states: ""Illegal aliens will receive $1,400 stimulus checks."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) One user commented in response: ""Can someone fact check this?"" We did. Here’s what our fact-check finds:  With a few exceptions, you must have a Social Security number to receive the $1,400 stimulus payments for yourself. (The exceptions are for dependents who have an adoption taxpayer ID and for people who are married to members of the military.) Among noncitizens, generally, only those who are authorized to work in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security can get a Social Security number, including legal permanent residents. The vast majority of people in the country illegally don’t have a Social Security number, so they wouldn’t qualify for payments for themselves, even if they met the income limits. However, their dependents who have Social Security numbers will qualify for $1,400 payments. Whether you are eligible for a direct payment, and how much, depends on the adjusted gross income you reported in the latest tax return you filed, either for 2019 or 2020. (Adjusted gross income is annual gross income minus certain deductions such as contributions to retirement accounts, alimony paid and educator expenses.) Single tax return filers whose adjusted gross income was up to $75,000 are eligible for the full $1,400. A head of household whose adjusted gross income was up to $112,500 also gets the full amount. A couple who filed joint tax returns and had an adjusted gross income of up to $150,000 would get $2,800. Taxpayers who meet those income criteria also get $1,400 per eligible dependent (including older children and adult dependents). People who earned slightly more than the income caps still get a payment for themselves and their dependents, but not the full $1,400 per person. H.R.1319 says ""any nonresident alien individual"" is not eligible for the $1,400 stimulus check. That term refers to people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful residents. And the law says recipients generally must have a Social Security number to qualify.  Some foreign nationals and others who don’t have a Social Security number are issued an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number so they can pay U.S. income taxes. They are not eligible themselves for stimulus checks. But their dependents who have Social Security numbers, such as a U.S.-born child, would qualify. If a couple files a joint tax return — one using an ITIN and another using a Social Security number — only the spouse and dependents who have Social Security numbers are eligible for a payment. (Under the rules of the first stimulus check offered, U.S. citizens were ineligible for a check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an ITIN.) As was the case with previous stimulus payments, when a married couple files a joint return and at least one spouse is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces during the tax year for which the return is filed, the full $2,800 credit is allowed (if they meet income criteria) even if only one spouse has a Social Security number. A Facebook post claimed: ""Illegal aliens will receive $1,400 stimulus checks."" Under the law, with some exceptions, only people who have a Social Security number can receive a $1,400 stimulus check for themselves. The vast majority of immigrants who are in the country illegally don’t have a Social Security number. The law would still pay $1,400 for each of their dependents who has a Social Security number. The statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out important context that would give a different impression.

No, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not paid $7 million for Oprah interview
","In the interview heard across the pond and around the world, tens of millions of viewers tuned in March 7 to watch Oprah Winfrey interview Prince Harry and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle in a prime time special aired on CBS.

The only party that profited was Winfrey’s production studio when it came time to sell the rights to broadcast the special. The blockbuster interview was a product of Winfrey’s production company, Harpo Productions, and was ultimately picked up by CBS Entertainment Group for an undisclosed sum. Hettrick declined to discuss the figure that CBS paid for licensing rights. Chris Ender, executive vice president for CBS Entertainment, also declined in an email to PolitiFact to reveal the agreed upon license fee. However, on March 5, two days before the interview was slated to air, The Wall Street Journal reported that CBS shelled out between $7 million and $9 million for the license fees, adding that a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not being paid for the interview. Representatives for Archewell, the organization founded by the couple that includes audio and video production arms as well as a nonprofit, did not respond to an email from PolitiFact.

No, COVID-19 vaccines do not contain nanoparticles that will allow you to be tracked via 5G networks
","Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines continues to run rampant online, even as President Joe Biden addressed the nation on March 11 and instructed states to make all adults eligible for the vaccines by May 1.  In one nearly nine-minute Facebook video, which appeared to have originally been recorded in French before being dubbed over with an English translation, the speaker makes some outrageous claims.  ""Here is the truth about the vaccine that the new world order wants to impose on us all,"" the narrator says, before going on to claim that the COVID-19 vaccines will contain ""nanoparticles.""  The English-language narrator describes nanoparticles as ""a bit like a microchip implanted under your cat or dog’s skin. The difference is you’re going to find thousands, millions of them in just one vaccine dose."" The claims about the vaccine don’t stop there, though. The narrator continues: ""The vaccine and the nanoparticles are mixed in the syringe. The vaccine and the nanoparticles are then injected simultaneously into your body. From that moment on, your mobile phone will locate you immediately. And by the magic of 5G network, your location is no longer a secret to the authorities."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence the approved COVID-19 vaccines contain nanoparticles similar to microchips implanted in pets that would allow recipients to be tracked via the 5G network.  Versions of the claim have been checked by other fact-checking organizations, and French publications have debunked the original video.  The video posits the idea that ""nanoparticles"" are actually small robots or computers — a notion we saw emerge from another viral video about vaccines that was later debunked. The term ""nanoparticles"" refers to ""materials with dimensions in the nanoscale,"" according to a study published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s website. It refers to the size of a particle, and nothing else. The ingredients of the three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the U.S. have been released publicly (Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson). Lipid nanoparticles are included on the list of ingredients in the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.  Lipids are molecules such as fats or oils that aren’t soluble in water. In the vaccines, lipid nanoparticles encase, protect and transport the mRNA — essentially acting as ""tiny ‘delivery vehicles,’"" according to one biotechnology company that helped develop them.  Nanoparticles are not microchip technology, nor do they have any connection to 5G networks. Furthermore, there is no evidence the vaccines contain any sort of technology that would allow someone who has been vaccinated to be ""located"" using 5G. Conspiracy theories about the coronavirus and 5G networks aren’t new, and several have been fact-checked and debunked since the start of the pandemic. A viral video claims that ""nanoparticles"" in the COVID-19 vaccines are similar to pet microchips, and that once you’re injected, ""by the magic of 5G network, your location is no longer a secret to the authorities."" The term ""nanoparticles"" refers to the small size of a material. The nanoparticles used in the COVID-19 vaccines are lipids. They have nothing to do with microchip technology or 5G networks.

No, Biden didn’t promote ‘mandatory’ COVID-19 vaccines in primetime address
","The White House will direct state, local and tribal governments to make all American adults eligible to register for COVID-19 vaccines by May 1, President Joe Biden announced March 11. In a primetime address delivered hours after he signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law, Biden said his goal is to make small-group gatherings possible by July 4. He encouraged Americans to get vaccinated and follow public health guidelines to make that happen.  But the president did not say he would mandate that everybody get the vaccine, despite what one conservative commentator said in a Facebook live video reacting to the address. ""Now he is promoting, what sounds like to me, as mandatory vaccines for everybody, and then we could maybe celebrate the Fourth of July in small groups,"" David J. Harris Jr., a supporter of former President Donald Trump, said before showing clips from Biden’s address. The video, which is accompanied by text directing people to support My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Harris Jr. did not respond to a request for comment sent via his Facebook page.

Let me say that again. All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That's much earlier than expected. Let me be clear, that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot."" Biden promised a new website to help people find vaccines near them, and he said additional guidance would be coming on what vaccinated people can and can’t do. Then, he urged ""every American to do their part"" to ""beat this virus,"" saying: ""I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated, as well. Because here's the point. If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together."" Biden said the shots are safe, noting that he and Vice President Kamala Harris got theirs in front of cameras. ""We need everyone to get vaccinated,"" he said. But the president never said he was mandating that everyone get a vaccine. The federal government’s ability to impose vaccination requirements is limited, although states have some authority to do so, PolitiFact previously reported. Biden, like Trump before him, has not announced plans to make the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory. ""No, I don’t think it should be mandatory,"" Biden said in December. ""I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.""  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who Biden implored Americans to ""listen to"" during his address, has also said he does not support mandating vaccines, although he told Newsweek he expects certain institutions like hospitals to require vaccinations.  The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Facebook post said Biden promoted ""mandatory vaccines for everybody"" in his March 11 address. That’s inaccurate. In his address, Biden said the White House would direct state, local and tribal governments to make all American adults eligible to sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine by May 1. He urged Americans to get the vaccines, but he did not make them mandatory. Biden previously said he would not institute a federal vaccine requirement.

A majority of Iowans and Americans support background checks for gun buyers
","An effort to strengthen gun owner rights with an Iowa Constitution amendment affirming the right to bear arms and to give strict scrutiny to restricting gun ownership heads to voters next year, but not without a fight from Democrats who oppose the amendment. Both the Republican controlled Iowa Senate and House passed the bill on Jan. 28 along party lines and the proposed constitutional amendment will go before Iowa voters in the 2022 general election. State Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeshell, D-Ames, wrote in an Iowa Standard article, Jan. 22, that the bill supporting the amendment would roll back gun control regulations and reform throughout the state. ""Republicans are back this year with a bill that aims to eliminate background checks, remove the requirement for a permit to carry a concealed handgun, and allow guns in our safest spaces, schools, hospitals, child care centers, and courthouses."" she wrote in the article.  She also wrote: ""Statistic: 86% of Americans and 82% of gun owners support requiring all gun buyers to pass a background check, no matter where they buy the gun and no matter who they buy it from."" Wessel-Kroeschell did not cite or link in her article to the poll she received the statistic from, so we asked. She responded in an email, ""I hope this helps,"" and attached a RABA Research Poll from February 2019. The survey was taken Jan. 30 and 31, 2019, of 939 Iowans likely to vote in 2020. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.18 percentage points.  The poll, conducted for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, showed that 89 percent of Democrats and 83 percent of Republicans in Iowa favor background checks. But, the report does not state how many Republicans or Democrats were polled or the margins of errors for each of those groups.  One of the survey’s questions was: ""Do you support or oppose requiring a background check on all gun buyers?"" 86 percent of respondents said support, 7 percent said oppose, and 8 percent said unsure, according to the Giffords report on the poll. The goal of Wessel-Kroeschell and other Democrats has been to show bipartisan support for some gun control measures, like background checks, as Iowans consider the proposed strict scrutiny constitutional amendment that could overturn them. More than one survey exists on the topic. In September 2020 Giffords commissioned a Public Policy Polling Iowa Survey, which found 79 percent of 1,151 Iowa voters — 91 percent of Democrats, 70 Percent of Republicans, and 77 percent of Independent voters,  said they supported background checks for all gun sales. That poll’s margin of error plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. According to a 2019 SurveyUSA poll commissioned by gun-control advocacy group EveryTown for Gun Safety Action Fund, 92 percent of Iowa gun owners, ""support the state’s background check requirement for all handgun sales,"" with a majority of both Democrats and Republicans supporting background check laws. The poll was conducted among 1,239 registered Iowa voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Iowa’s margin of supporters for universal background checks on gun owners was comparable to results from nationwide polls on similar questions. In August 2019, NBC News and the Wall Street Journal asked 500 adults if they supported, ""expanding background checks to all firearm sales and transfers."" In that survey, 75 percent said they strongly supported it and 14 percent said they somewhat supported it. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for 1,000 interviews among adults, and 3.39 percentage points for 834 interviews among registered voters. In September 2019, National Public Radio (NPR), PBS Newshour, and Maris College asked 1,317 people in a nationwide poll if they thought Congress should pass legislation that requires background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales. Of those answering, 83 percent said yes, 14 percent said no and 3 percent said they were unsure. That poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. A 2019 Pew Research Center Poll showed that Democrats more strongly favored gun control reform, but data showed a majority of Republicans also favor tighter restrictions like background checks. In September 2019, the center partnered with the American Trends Panel to survey 9,895 U.S. adults and found that 93 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans said they favored, ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks."" The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. A national Gallup Poll conducted in March 2018 with 766 national adults found that when asked if they favored or opposed 92 percent of people supported ""requiring background checks for all gun sales,""  to prevent mass shootings at schools. The poll had a margin of error of less than .5 percentage points. A March 2019 poll conducted by Quinnipiac University found that 87 percent of national gun owners support ""requiring background checks for all gun owners."" The poll surveyed 1,120 national voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Wessell-Kroeschell wrote, ""86% of Americans and 82% of gun owners support requiring all gun buyers to pass a background check ."" The 2019 study she cited in her article compares with both national and Iowa poll results. National polls generally align with her statistic, with an EveryTown for Gun Safety Action Fund-SurveyUSA poll showing 92 percent of Iowa gun owners supported background checks on handguns. The more recent 2020 poll of Iowa voters by the Giffords center showed 79 percent of survey respondents supporting universal background checks.  While the numbers aren’t exactly the same in each poll, they show a consistent story of Iowans favoring background checks for gun purchases when surveyed in multiple polls.

No, El Chapo didn’t testify that he paid off Pelosi
","In February 2021, a U.S. judge ordered Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of infamous Mexican drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, to be detained on charges she conspired with her husband to run a multibillion dollar drug enterprise while he was behind bars.

In February 2019, Guzmán was found guilty on 10 counts of federal charges after a three-month trial exposed the inner workings of his Sinaloa cartel, which funneled drugs into the U.S. for decades. He was later sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years. According to the trial’s transcript and several media reports, Guzmán chose not to testify at the trial and his defense only called one witness, FBI agent Paul Roberts. The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzmán, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies between the notes and the testimony the trafficker gave during the trial. Alex Cifuentes, a former Guzmán associate, took the stand and testified that, among other Mexican officials paid off by Guzmán, former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about Pelosi or any other American official. Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, told us the claim is ""obviously false,"" and Jeffrey Lichtman, the attorney who represented El Chapo in the trial, confirmed to Reuters that it was not part of his team’s defense or testimony. A Facebook post claims El Chapo testified that he paid off Pelosi to keep the U.S.-Mexico border open for drug cartels. This is bogus.

Fact-checking Florida attorney general on Biden’s immigration detainer policy
","Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration, arguing that interim guidance on immigration enforcement prevents the arrest and deportation of criminals illegally in the country.  Moody appeared on Fox News to talk about her lawsuit and said the Biden administration is requiring law enforcement authorities to release criminals. ""And now they've released guidance which is basically releasing into our streets serious criminal offenders,"" Moody said on Fox & Friends March 9. ""They are canceling detainers and requiring our law enforcement leaders to release them back into our states. And this includes heroin traffickers, people that are breaking into homes, use of a firearm with some of these felonies."" We took a closer look at Moody’s comment about detainers, which are a tool used by immigration authorities to take custody of people who are slated to be released from local or state law enforcement agencies. Moody’s office provided evidence that Immigration and Customs Enforcement did lift detainer requests for certain inmates in Florida, based on new enforcement priorities. But Moody’s claim about the effect of these moves needs more context. Lifting the detainers doesn’t mean ICE forced law enforcement agencies to release people. Law enforcement agencies are forced to release people because their sentences are complete. And law enforcement agencies aren’t required to comply with detainer requests. In addition, ICE told PolitiFact it is still issuing detainers. But the agency said its priority is removing the most serious offenders, such as gang members, murderers and terrorists. An immigration detainer is a notice that the Department of Homeland Security sends to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies informing them of ICE’s intent to assume custody of a person who is being released from law enforcement custody. ICE can lodge a detainer against someone who has served a criminal sentence or someone arrested on local criminal charges. The detainer asks a law enforcement agency to notify ICE about a person’s release date and to hold that person for up to 48 hours (excluding holidays and weekends) to give ICE time to take that person into custody and place them in deportation proceedings. If the 48 hours lapse, the law enforcement agency generally no longer has authority to hold that person. An immigration detainer is not an arrest warrant, and law enforcement agencies are not legally required to comply with the requests. On President Joe Biden’s first day in office, the acting secretary of homeland security ordered a review of immigration enforcement practices and said that in the interim, the department would prioritize the deportation of people presumed to be a threat to national security, border security and public safety.  ICE’s acting director in February issued interim guidance reiterating that arrest and deportation priorities include people who were engaged in or suspected of engaging in terrorism; people who had been convicted of an aggravated felony (such as murder) and who were believed to currently pose a threat; and those who unlawfully entered the country on or after Nov. 1, 2020.  Under the Trump administration, everyone in the country illegally was a removal priority. The new guidance applied to decisions on whether to issue a detainer or whether to take custody of someone for whom a detainer was previously issued. Immigration authorities are not prohibited from arresting, detaining or removing people not on the priority list. Those actions, though, are ""subject to advance review,"" the guidance said. Moody’s office directed PolitiFact to exhibits accompanying the lawsuit, which include an affidavit from an employee of the Florida Department of Corrections, email exchanges between the state employee and ICE deportation officers, and information on inmates in Florida corrections facilities. One of the email exchanges shows the state employee asking an ICE deportation officer ""if ICE has interest in placing a detainer"" on a certain inmate. The officer replied that ""per new administration guidelines, ICE will not take any action"" regarding that inmate, whose criminal record included offenses of burglary (of an unoccupied building, unarmed), larceny, property damage and cocaine possession. ICE also told the state it would not place a detainer on a person who had been found guilty of possession of a firearm or ammunition by a convicted felon and possession of more than 20 grams of cannabis. The emails show ICE was lifting detainer requests on other inmates. ""Subject currently does not meet our removal criteria due to Executive Order, ICE has no more interest in this subject,"" one email said. That inmate had been charged with possession of ammunition by a convicted felon and also had arrest warrants for the sale of heroin. So Moody is correct about ICE ""canceling"" some detainer requests for Florida inmates. ICE also has dropped at least 26 detainer requests in Texas, the AP reported Feb. 13. Most of the 26 people were convicted of drug charges or drunken-driving offenses, but some still fell under enforcement priorities, according to the AP. Two were convicted of sexually assaulting a teenager and another was convicted of indecency with a child, AP said. In the end, two were transferred to immigration custody, and the third had his parole approval rescinded after ICE dropped the detainer and is now set to remain in prison for at least another year, the AP reported. ICE told PolitiFact that data was not readily available on detainers issued or lifted during the Biden administration. ICE has issued approximately 46,000 immigration detainers in fiscal year 2021, an agency spokesperson said. The fiscal year started Oct. 1, 2020, during the Trump administration, which supported the use of detainers. Immigration enforcement priorities are much narrower under the Biden administration than under the Trump administration, so it’s likely fewer detainers are now being issued, said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst at Migration Policy Institute. Moody said the Biden administration is canceling immigration detainers and ""requiring our law enforcement leaders to release"" serious criminal offenders. ICE canceled some detainer requests in Florida saying the people in custody no longer met the interim enforcement priorities outlined by the Biden administration. An AP news report said that in Texas, ICE canceled detainers on some people convicted of sex offenses and who did fit the administration’s enforcement priorities. But those inmates ended up back in custody. The canceling of an ICE detainer does not by itself trigger a person’s release from local or state custody. The detainers are placed on people who are already scheduled to be released. ICE said it’s still issuing detainers. Moody’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out some context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2021/mar/12/ashley-moody/fact-checking-florida-attorney-general-bidens-immi/

On Twitter the day before: ""Since more than 90% of this ‘COVID relief’ bill is not even related to COVID, I think we need a full reading of the bill. Yes, it could take 10 hours but the American people deserve to know what's in it."" (That description is exaggerated, by the way. About 85% is related to the pandemic, one nonpartisan group says.) In a WIBA radio interview: ""We need to keep this process going so we can highlight the abuse, how this is not COVID relief, how this is a boondog(gle) for Democrats."" And Johnson told USA Today it was ""important"" to delay the process and read the bill aloud because ""so often we rush these massive bills"" which few lawmakers have time to read.  Taken together, we see Johnson’s central complaints are about how the money is spent and the speed with which the bill came together. Johnson tweeted that he ""finally got a hard copy of the bill"" about an hour into the reading. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, was among those who raised an eyebrow at Johnson’s actions, suggesting they didn’t align with how Johnson approached a similar situation when Republicans held the congressional reins. And this is hardly the first high-priced bill to move through Congress relatively quickly.  So we’re breaking out our Flip-O-Meter and digging into the archives to see if Johnson’s actions line up with his past approach to such legislation. Our requisite reminder: We’re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We’re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views. This is the third federal stimulus bill of the COVID-19 pandemic, following bills — passed under President Donald Trump — that spent $1.7 trillion in March 2020 and $915 billion in December 2020. But the most apt comparison given the size and timing of the bill may be the 2017 tax cut package passed by a Republican-run Congress early in Trump’s term. The 2017 bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives on Nov. 2, 2017, and passed the Senate on Dec. 20 — a span of 48 days. Biden’s rescue plan was introduced in the House Feb. 24, 2021 and passed by the Senate on March 6, a span of just 10 days. But you could also count the lifespan as beginning when Biden proposed the bill, there were 51 days before the Senate passage. (The House ultimately adopted Senate changes and passed the rescue plan March 10, sending it to Biden for a signature.) Regardless, the key point of comparison here is not how long the bill was discussed, but how late changes were made — since that’s the point Johnson made while demanding a reading. Johnson and other Republicans objected they didn’t have enough time to read the bill before considering it. U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters he supported forcing a reading, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said he was ""absolutely supportive"" of the move because few senators had read the whole text. Those complaints are echoes of 2017, but with a party reversal. Here’s the CBS News account of the Dec. 1, 2017, runup to that vote, when senators received a late copy of the bill that included hand-scribbled amendments in the margins: Senate Democrats were outraged Friday night after Republicans unveiled the 479-page text of their tax overhaul shortly before the bill went to the Senate floor for a vote. The short timeframe, Democrats complained, left them no time to read all the provisions in the hefty legislation. Those hundreds of pages included new amendments and some handwritten notes that were nearly illegible. Republicans want to move the bill through swiftly, after Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Friday announced the chamber had the votes to pass the legislation. ""Not a single member of this chamber has read the bill,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on the Senate floor. ""It would be impossible."" The Los Angeles Times noted the bill, a sweeping tax reform package with repercussions for nearly all Americans, was passed without any Democrats in the chamber. The paper contrasted the high-speed process to the tax reform bill under President Ronald Reagan, which was crafted ""on a bipartisan basis over more than 18 months."" Johnson voiced no objections to the speed of the 2017 bill, which he voted for. ""I’ll be voting yes on tax reform. Appreciate Senate leadership and @POTUS willingness to work to close the gap between pass-throughs & C corps,"" Johnson tweeted on Dec. 1, 2017. The only news release he issued at the time simply praised ""improved treatment for pass-through entities,"" a setup through which business owners pay individual income tax on business earnings rather than a business paying corporate income tax directly. Johnson also voted in favor of the two prior stimulus packages under Trump, without requiring a reading or objecting to the pace of passage. Facing a lengthy Democrat-backed bill that was finalized shortly before a Senate vote, Johnson lodged an objection that forced the 628-page bill to be read aloud in its entirety.  In various statements he said he objected to how money was being spent and senators not having enough time to read the bill. But Johnson had no issue supporting a bill that was similarly finalized at the last minute in 2017. That time it was Democrats objecting to the speed at which Republicans were pushing through legislation. That’s a complete change in position, or as we call it, a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2021/mar/11/ron-johnson/johnson-flips-position-last-minute-bills-now-dems-/

No, Nevada’s attorney general didn’t admit to changing signature verifications during the election
","The 2020 presidential election is now four months behind us, but misinformation about voter fraud persists on social media.  One recent Facebook post claims that Nevada’s attorney general admitted to ""changing signature verifications manually for over 200,000 votes."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokesperson for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford told PolitiFact that ""there is no truth to this claim"" and provided a statement from the attorney general in which he reiterated that there has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Nevada. ""Our elections were fair and secure,"" Ford said in the statement. ""This has been demonstrated time and time again and across numerous courts."" In Nevada, election officials verify voter signatures on every ballot they receive, according to the secretary of state’s website. If the signature is missing or the signature on the ballot return envelope doesn’t match the signature on file for the voter, the ballot isn’t counted until the voter verifies their signature. The state has procedures in place for voters to fix their ballots if the signature is missing or doesn’t match. But searching online, we couldn’t find any evidence that Ford said he manually changed the signature verifications for hundreds of thousand of ballots, as the Facebook post claims. USA Today, which also looked into this claim, consulted with two political reporters in Nevada who said they hadn’t heard of that Ford quote.  ""I don’t even know what to say about this because it’s so insane,"" the newspaper quotes Nevada Independent reporter Jon Ralston as saying. ""Ford would not have the ability to do this, nor has he ever said he did so."" In November, Adam Laxalt, a former Nevada attorney general who co-chaired Trump’s campaign in the state, said on Fox News that 200,000 votes were ""verified by a machine only"" after election officials lowered its settings so that ballots could be counted even if the signatures weren’t a match. ""No human being went back and checked these, those ended up just counting,"" he said.  This may have spawned the claim that appears in the Facebook post. A blog called Fellow American Daily published a post about Laxalt’s Fox News appearance with a misleading headline: ""Nevada AG admits that they changed signature verification manually for over 200,000 votes.""

Border apprehensions then and now: Fact-checking McEnany’s comparison to 2014
","Fox News on-air commentator and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany slammed President Joe Biden for the influx of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, likening the situation to a surge Biden and other top Democrats described in dire terms years ago. ""The Biden administration has created an immigration crisis on our border,"" McEnany wrote March 8 on Facebook and Twitter. ""They refuse to call it a crisis, though apprehension numbers are worse than the ‘crisis’ Biden/Obama/Pelosi acknowledged in 2014!""  Later that day, McEnany made the same point on Fox News. ""In 2014, when the numbers were not as bad as they are now in terms of apprehensions, Biden called it a crisis then,"" she told anchor Martha MacCallum. ""So did Obama. So did Pelosi."" McEnany’s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In this case, the former White House press secretary’s claim is largely accurate.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that the pressure at the border is elevated compared to what border officials saw in 2014, with some caveats.  McEnany referred to apprehensions, which CBP defines as ""the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest."" But her comparison across years is a little tricky, because during the coronavirus pandemic, not all encounters between Border Patrol and migrants have been recorded as apprehensions.  ""Back in 2014, apprehensions meant anyone who was taken into custody by Border Patrol when they tried to cross the border illegally between ports of entry,"" said Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. ""Today, it’s a little bit more complex."" In March 2020, President Donald Trump invoked Title 42, a section of federal law, to allow border officials to quickly expel migrants seeking admission into the U.S. on the grounds that their entry into the country and immigration system could contribute to the spread of COVID-19. As a result of the order, migrants caught crossing the border illegally can now face one of two fates, Bolter said. They can be apprehended and put into immigration removal proceedings, or they can be immediately expelled, in which case they wouldn’t begin immigration proceedings. The Border Patrol in January 2021 recorded 75,312 encounters at the southern border between ports of entry. In February, it recorded 96,974 such encounters, according to the most recent CBP data available.  By comparison, CBP recorded 60,683 total apprehensions in May of 2014, that year’s peak.  A migrant from Honduras seeking asylum in the U.S. stands in front of tents at the border crossing on March 1, 2021, in Tijuana, Mexico. (AP) We should note that only 12,781 of the encounters in January 2021 and 26,791 of the encounters in February 2021 were apprehensions made under CBP’s immigration authority. The rest were Title 42 expulsions. That means, generally, that Border Patrol processed unauthorized border crossings at a much faster pace in 2021 than they could have in 2014. It also means that not all the migrants caught trying to unlawfully cross the border now are being held in the country as they move through the immigration system. Regardless, experts PolitiFact spoke to said it was fair to lump apprehensions and Title 42 together for the sake of comparison, as McEnany did in her post. ""When you look at them together, that’s the total number of times someone was caught trying to cross the border illegally between ports of entry,"" Bolter said, noting that what is logged today as a Title 42 expulsion would have registered as an apprehension in 2014. ""Border security metrics can be complex and terminology is not always used in the same way we would officially use it,"" added Matthew Dyman, a CBP spokesperson. A Fox News spokesperson pointed to CBP data and examples showing Biden, President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi using the word ""crisis"" in 2014. That year, the border saw an influx of unaccompanied children and families that was broadly acknowledged as a crisis, Bolter said. ""That was kind of the first time that the U.S. government had to deal with these mass arrivals of families and children, and they had to deal with that with an infrastructure that was really set up to carry out enforcement against single adults,"" Bolter said. ""They were pretty unprepared."" Speaking in Guatemala in June of 2014 about migrants apprehended at the U.S. border who were claiming credible fear, Biden said the U.S. was working quickly to process their cases ""in light of the humanitarian crisis caused by the number of crossings.""  Then-Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a news conference in Guatemala City on June 20, 2014. (AP) The Biden administration has not characterized things that way this time. Biden’s Homeland Security secretary said the border situation amounted to a ""challenge,"" not a ""crisis.""  Border Patrol recorded roughly 9,300 apprehensions (and four Title 42 expulsions) involving unaccompanied minors in February 2021, and about 18,900 apprehensions and expulsions involving members of family units. Together, those two groups made up roughly 30% of such encounters that month. That compares to roughly 10,600 unaccompanied minor apprehensions and 16,300 family unit apprehensions in June of 2014, which accounted for about 47% of all apprehensions made in what was the peak month that year for those two statistics. The Trump administration’s order authorizing Title 42 expulsions encouraged some migrants — particularly single adults — to try crossing the border again after being sent away, since migrants expelled from the U.S. don’t face consequences via the criminal or immigration system, Bolter said. The increased recidivism rate could inflate CBP’s numbers slightly, Bolter said, although she noted that news reports do show more migrants are arriving at the border, regardless.  Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, said the current situation is more worrisome. ""It's worse (than 2014) because there are more people attempting to enter illegally, and it's worse because it is happening during a pandemic,"" Vaughan said. McEnany said that ""apprehension numbers are worse than the ‘crisis’ Biden/Obama/Pelosi acknowledged in 2014!"" The word ""apprehension"" can be confusing. If you count expulsions from the country under the Title 42 authority Trump invoked at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, then McEnany is right.  Border officials recorded more cases in which someone was caught trying to cross the border illegally this January and February than they did during the peak months in 2014.

""It matters who’s leading the country, and it matters if they care,"" said Maloney, whose Hudson Valley congressional district includes all of Putnam and Orange counties, part of northern Westchester County and the southwest section of Dutchess County. ""America, we have a choice.

At the time Trump was rumored to be considering a run for president. ""I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman,"" Trump said during the interview. He said he would favor a domestic partnership law that afforded same-sex couples the same benefits as married couples. Fast-forward to 2011 when Trump was again considering a run for the White House.

And, last year Trump said in an interview on CNN that he supported ‘traditional marriage.’ ‘He wants to go back’ Maloney’s claim was made in the context of the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision on same-sex marriage. Trump does not agree with the decision. He has said efforts to overrule the court through an amendment to the U.S Constitution are not realistic. He has said in interviews that he would have preferred the court leave the decision on same-sex marriage at the state level. Trump also suggested in at least one interview that he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices who would support reversing the ruling. Our ruling Speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Maloney said Trump is ""against marriage equality"" and ""wants to go back"" on the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision.

Paul Manafort says Clinton's tax returns show income from foundation donors
","Hillary Clinton’s release of her 2015 tax returns last week renewed calls for Donald Trump to do the same, but it also provided the Trump campaign fodder for attack. CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper asked Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, especially since his lawyers have said Trump’s 2008 returns were no longer under audit, unlike more recent years. Manafort deflected by turning the tables on Clinton. ""Mr. Trump’s position has been clear from the beginning: He’s under audit. When the audit is completed, he’ll release his returns,"" Manafort said. ""By the way, in Mrs. Clinton’s returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well. I haven’t seen any stories on that yet."" Does the former secretary of state’s tax return really show pay-the-Clintons-to-play politics? Not exactly. About 15 percent of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s 2015 income came from two educational businesses with ties to the Clinton Foundation. It is a lot of money in raw dollars, but not a lot compared to the couple’s other sources of income. What’s more, we found no evidence that the firms paying Bill Clinton for his consulting work profited from the State Department, as Manafort said. According to their returns, the Clintons made about $10.5 million in 2015, the bulk from their speaking fees ($5.5 million) and book royalties ($3.1 million). Here’s a breakdown:  Though the forms do not specify who paid the couple to speak in 2015, they do show that Bill Clinton also made about $1.6 million after expenses for consulting services. His clients were Laureate Education and GEMS Education, two international education firms that donated between $1 million and $5 million each to the Clinton Foundation. Laureate Education, a network of more than 80 institutions based in Baltimore, has also partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative ""on a number of initiatives since 2008,"" according to its website. It named Bill Clinton an honorary chancellor between 2010 and 2014 (his tax returns do not show income earned from that role). The Laureate network is controversial partly for the stigma of for-profit education (which has been criticized by Hillary Clinton) and partly for racking up debt while marketing and expanding aggressively. Similarly, GEMS Education, one of the world’s largest private-school operators based in Dubai, is a Clinton Global Initiative strategic partner and, along with UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), is helping train principals in Kenya, Ghana and India. The company enrolls 150,000 students in 90 K-12 schools worldwide. Older tax returns show the Clintons received more money from the groups in other years. Bill Clinton was paid $16 million by Laureate and $5.6 million by GEMS between 2010 and 2014 for his consulting services. Politico has additionally reported that a former Clinton fundraiser who was given a special State Department post also had business ties to both firms. But while all of this demonstrates a strong link between Laureate and GEMS and the Clintons, it doesn’t prove corruption, as Manafort implies. His suggestion that they ""benefited from (Clinton’s) State Department tenure"" is not backed by the record. We searched www.usaspending.gov, a comprehensive database that tracks government grants and contracts, to see if either firm received not just State Department but any federal funding. Our search turned up nothing for Laureate or GEMS. (The Clinton campaign referred us to our previous reporting debunking the link between Laureate and the State Department.) The Clintons did disclose who paid for their speeches in 2013. Hillary Clinton received between $225,000 and $400,000 per speech from Wall Street clients such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, while Bill Clinton’s highest fee was $750,000 from a Swedish bank. Many of the firms have government interests, according to the Associated Press. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment to back up Manafort’s claim. Our ruling Manafort said, ""In Mrs. Clinton’s returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well."" The returns for 2015 do show that two educational firms that have donated millions to the Clinton Foundation also paid about $1.6 million to Bill Clinton for consulting services. That’s just 15 percent of the Clintons’ total income in 2015, but ""a lot"" of money to most people. But we found no evidence that either of those businesses profited from Hillary Clinton’s actions at the State Department. The Trump campaign did not respond to our query with examples of other businesses donating to the foundation and then profiting from the department, and we did not find any in our search.

Sid Miller incorrectly says law he authored touched off 130 helicopter hog hunting businesses
","Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller keeps a toothsome mounted boar’s head on a wall outside his office. A toy helicopter looks like it's floating above. As a Texas House member, the Stephenville Republican carried into law a 2011 measure enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs or coyotes from helicopters, provided the landowner or his agent has given permission. ""It became law,"" Miller told Austin American-Statesman columnist Ken Herman during an office tour in June 2016, ""and we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts. Took a liability and turned it into an asset. It’s been great. It’s been eradicating hogs ever since."" ""Eradicating"" means killing, which is how hunters including trappers and ranchers attack some of the estimated 1.5 million-plus feral hogs in Texas whose sows typically produce an annual litter of four to six offspring, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says. ""There seem to be very few inhibiting factors to curtail this population growth,"" the agency says on a feral hogs web page that lists various ways people can try to reduce the population. Among the options: ""In some areas of Texas, aerial gunning from a helicopter is an efficient technique."" But are there really 130 new businesses devoted to helicopter hog hunts? A couple of providers of the in-the-sky Texas hunts each told us that seems unlikely; more on that ahead. When we asked about Miller’s figure, an agriculture department spokesman, Mark Loeffler, advised by email that the commissioner’s ""130,"" offered in passing, Loeffler stressed, was based on his recollection of a TPWD statistic ""for the number of companies permitted to do these aerial takes."" At the parks department, spokesman Tom Harvey told us there’s no way for the agency to pin down from the paperwork how many hog-hunting operations sprung up after the law came to be. But 140 Aerial Wildlife Management Permits were active/valid when we inquired in July 2016, including, Harvey said by email, 104 permits whose recipients had indicated a commercial purpose--which we took to include businesses offering helicopter hog hunts. Compared with 2010, the year before Miller won approval of his change in law, the count of 104 permit-holders indicating a commercial purpose was up from 86 applicants indicating a commercial purpose, according to the parks department. Generally, Harvey said, aerial hog hunts have helped control feral hogs, which he called a ""rampant nuisance species."" According to information provided by hunters, Harvey said, about 17,000 feral hogs were taken from the air in 2010. In contrast, 22,533 were removed in 2011 with more than that taken each year through 2015--on average 27,500 a year. Harvey added that hogs shot from the air account for a fairly small percentage of the estimated 750,000-plus feral hogs annually harvested statewide; the latter figure is a state estimate of the number of feral hogs harvested in 2010. The state application for the ""permit to manage wildlife or exotic animals by aircraft"" asks for the names of each applicant and the names of pilots plus Federal Aviation Administration license numbers and the make, model and color of aircraft. Harvey said permits may be issued for individuals, including rancher-landowners, to count or capture or kill native wildlife and exotic animals by aircraft. He said the permit is ""often used for wildlife surveying (particularly white-tailed deer and feral hog counts), and even alligator nest counts."" We asked the agency for its latest list of permit holders. From the 104 indicating commercial purposes, we identified less than 10 businesses clearly offering hunters a chance to shoot hogs from the air. We reached one of seven permit-holders whose applications didn’t show commercial or noncommercial intentions. Kenneth Kemp of Victoria told us he’s flown a helicopter to take out hogs for landowners for more than 30 years, killing more than 9,000 hogs from the air in 2015. Kemp said the Miller-authored law didn’t lead him to offer hog hunts to people looking for such adventure. Meantime, our web search for hog hunting services led us to Jay Decker, CEO of Texas-based Gunn&Hook, which was offering helicopter hog hunts starting at $775 as of mid-July 2016. To our  inquiry, Decker sent an email listing 14 Texas firms, including Last Shadow, HeliBacon, Pork Choppers and Heli Gunner, that he said provide hog hunts by helicopter. After we shared the state’s 2016 list of permit holders with Decker, he marked seven as businesses that vend helicopter hunts, commenting: ""I’m very confident in my number of 10-20 outfitters that fly part of or all of the year and take customers flying and shooting."" Separately, John Dumont, the managing partner and chief pilot for Helibacon, which vends helicopter hog hunts using automatic machine guns, said by phone that it competes with five to 10 similar Texas businesses. In the end, we circled back to Loeffler with what we’d gleaned. By email, he specified that Miller was speaking to the number of AWM permits issued in 2012, the first full year of the law’s implementation. State data shows 126 permits were issued that year. ""To be fair, the number was a four-year-old statistic made in passing while giving a tour of his office,"" Loeffler wrote, ""and not in an official statement or press release. Good Lord, I don’t expect anyone reading this would want to held to a high standard for every half-remembered number used in casual conversation!"" Our ruling Miller said that thanks to the law he authored authorizing hunters to shoot feral hogs from helicopters, ""we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts."" That figure reflects about the number of state permits issued one recent year allowing Texans to observe or hunt animals from the air. Best we can tell, though, around 20 new helicopter hog hunting ventures took flight after Miller’s proposal became law. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.",/factchecks/2016/aug/12/sid-miller/sid-miller-incorrectly-says-law-he-authored-touche/

And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment."" Collins said during the interview. ""That was absolutely hypocritical."" Collins based his claims on a few of Clinton’s positions. She has criticized the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that deemed spending money to influence elections ""free speech"" that may not be limited. She supports gun control. Collins said he also believes Clinton will continue to issue executive orders similar to those by President Obama. His office says that practice violates the 10th Amendment. Is Collins right about Clinton’s positions on the First, Second, and 10th Amendments? The First Amendment Hillary Clinton does not agree with the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission. The Supreme Court held in the case that restrictions could not be placed on how corporations spend money to influence an election. In the opinion of the court, since corporations have the same rights as individuals, they are also guaranteed free speech under the First Amendment. That does not mean Clinton does not believe in the First Amendment. It means she, like many others, does not agree with the court’s interpretation of the First Amendment in this case. The Second Amendment The Supreme Court has ruled the Second Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to bear arms. Clinton supports gun control policies that gun-rights advocates call contrary to its interpretation. Clinton said in her speech to the Democratic National Convention that she was ""not here to repeal the Second Amendment."" In an interview on ABC's 'This Week,' Clinton said, ""I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment."" PolitiFact earlier this year rated as False Trump’s claim that Clinton ""wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment. The 10th Amendment Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama’s use of executive orders to address issues Congress has not acted on. Clinton’s campaign has said in the past she would consider using that power, too,  if she cannot reach agreements with Congress. Collins calls that a slippery slope to violating the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reinforces the idea of federalism. Some laws are decided at the state level while others are under federal control. We spoke to constitutional law experts Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School and Matthew Steilen from the University at Buffalo about Collins' claim. In this case, they said executive actions and orders typically do not directly contradict the 10th Amendment. The argument stems partly from Obama’s actions on gun control earlier this year and immigration in 2014.  Executive actions are not new. George Washington even issued them. Obama has issued more than many presidents, but fewer than others. Ronald Reagan issued 381, while Obama issued 244 through July. Our ruling In an interview on MSNBC, Collins said Clinton is ""going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment."" Clinton holds positions that contradict certain interpretations of those amendments, but Collins’ claim is too broad. We rate this claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1deaafad-be38-4aca-a4c8-14ef0101ef7e",/factchecks/2016/aug/12/chris-collins/clintons-views-do-not-go-against-constitution/

In economic speech, Hillary Clinton offers cherry-picked summary of her trade votes
","During a high-profile speech on the economy in Warren, Mich., Hillary Clinton said that she would stand up for workers hurt by trade agreements -- an issue that her opponent, Donald Trump, has been hitting hard on the campaign trail. ""My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" she said. ""I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president. As a senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel-makers from unfair Chinese trading practices. And I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there, because it didn't meet my high bar."" We have already given Clinton a Full Flop for switching her view on the Trans-Pacific Partnership from supportive to opposed. Here, we’ll look at whether Clinton is correct to say that she ""opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there."" The statement glosses over the different types of trade agreements that exist and Clinton's past support for them.  Clinton’s trade record As we have previously noted, Clinton’s views on trade have zigzagged somewhat over the years. ""Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She’s case-by-case on trade,"" said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, to the Washington Post in 2015. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, signed by President Bill Clinton. ""Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal,"" she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History. As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She voted no on the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and a deal with Andean countries. However -- and this was not reflected in Clinton’s speech -- Clinton actively voted for five bilateral trade deals during her tenure, namely Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, and Oman. She also chose not to object to a unanimous consent vote on a sixth bilateral pact (Bahrain) and she said she supported two others that she never officially cast a vote on (Peru and Jordan) because they came up during her first presidential bid. Here’s a summary of the 10 significant votes taken on trade deals during Clinton’s tenure in the Senate, which is the time frame she referenced in the speech: Year Legislation Clinton’s vote 2002 Trade Act of 2002 (includes Andean countries)* Voted against** 2003 Chile-United States Voted for 2003 Singapore-United States Voted for 2004 Australia-United States Voted for 2004 Morocco-United States Voted for 2005 Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) Voted against 2005 Bahrain-United States Voted for*** 2006 Oman-United States Voted for 2007 Peru-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2007 2007 Jordan-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2005 * This deal is not included in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of free trade agreements, but contains many free trade provisions. ** This is a vote for ""fast track authority"" — allowing trade agreement to move through Congress without amendments or filibusters. *** The free trade agreement with Bahrain passed by unanimous consent, not a recorded roll call vote. So, to sum up, Clinton did indeed vote against one multilateral trade bill that came up while she was in the Senate -- CAFTA -- and voted against another bill that could be characterized as a multilateral trade deal, which was the Trade Act of 2002. Seen through this lens, these votes provide support for what she said in her speech. But just outside that lens, the picture gets murkier. Clinton has tailored her claim so narrowly that it obscures the bigger picture. Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: ""The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward."" While separate deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she ""supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations."" In the meantime, we’ll note that as a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA ""a mistake"" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. And as secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact that she has been clear in the past that she's supported some deals and opposed others based on whether they meet certain standards. The campaign also argued that multilateral deals have a broader impact, making those votes the most important. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there."" Clinton did oppose one multilateral deal (CAFTA) and opposed another that could be characterized as a multilateral deal (the Trade Act of 2002). However, focusing only on multilateral agreements, as Clinton does, obscures her overall voting record on trade pacts while serving in the Senate. When it came to bilateral agreements, Clinton cast votes to support five of them, and she supported -- but never cast a formal vote for -- an additional three. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/economic-speech-hillary-clinton-offers-cherry-pick/
"['Abortion', 'Ohio', 'Ohio Right to Life']","
Ohio Right to Life's faulty claims on Ted Strickland, abortion
","The anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life circulated a stinging release about Democratic senate candidate (and former Ohio governor) Ted Strickland recently. ""Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars,"" the Aug. 2 press release reads. Spokeswoman Katherine Franklin of Ohio Right to Life told PolitiFact Ohio that the 2016 Democratic platform inspired their media message. On reproductive rights, the platform reads, ""We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment."" Clinton’s chosen running mate, Tim Kaine, recently faced scrutiny on the subject of the Hyde amendment, which has barred federal funding for most abortions since being signed into law in 1976. In a weekend interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Kaine said that he is personally in favor of the Hyde restrictions, but would support Clinton and the party’s platform to repeal it, as vice president. Because Kaine was somewhat compromised on the issue, Franklin said, Ohio Right to Life wanted to tease out Strickland’s stance on the Hyde amendment. Ohio Right to Life has endorsed Strickland’s opponent, incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Strickland, on Hyde Congress passed the Hyde amendment three years after U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade, which upholds a woman’s right to abortion. Its sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, a Republican from Illinois, said during a congressional debate, ""I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody from having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the (Medicaid) bill."" By prohibiting federal funding of abortion, the Hyde restrictions primarily affect low-income women on Medicaid.    Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, it doesn’t have to be ""repealed"" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level. When asked his position on the Hyde amendment, Strickland’s spokeswoman Liz Margolis told the Columbus Dispatch, that he favors getting rid of the Hyde restrictions.  ""Ted stands with the people of Ohio who believe that women have the right to make their own healthcare decisions, and that includes all women regardless of income,"" Margolis said. As a congressman in 2003, NARAL Pro-Choice America rated his voting record as in line with ""pro-life"" legislators.   On his website, Strickland says he believes that ""a woman’s healthcare choices are between a woman and her doctor,"" which is an indication that he favors abortion rights. But does he agree with abortions ""up until the moment of birth?"" Due-date abortions? PolitiFact has heard this claim before, directed at Clinton. In a New Hampshire debate in February, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said that Clinton ""believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.""    We rated this claim False, because abortions at the nine-month mark just don’t happen. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact, ""If the mother’s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives."" Twenty-three states prohibit abortions after ""viability,"" the point at which the fetus can survive outside the womb, or at about 23 weeks.The reproductive health nonprofit Guttmacher Institute reports that just 5 percent of abortions occur after 16 weeks, and 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks. A 2015 documentary followed the practices of the four remaining doctors in the country who will perform a third-trimester abortion. On-demand? Seven states and the District of Columbia have not passed time-frame restrictions on abortions. Franklin, of Ohio Right to Life, uses these as examples of places where a woman could have an ""on-demand abortion."" But it rarely happens that way, in practice. Even prior to viability, on-demand abortions are impossible in most of the country. Twenty-eight states have legislated waiting periods for an abortion procedure, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion. New Hampshire, Oregon and Vermont have the fewest abortion restrictions. But ""on demand"" is still a stretch, even in these states. In New Hampshire and Oregon, almost 80 percent of counties have no abortion clinic. In Vermont, there is no abortion provider in 50 percent of the counties. Taxpayer-funded abortions? The Kaiser Family Foundation determined that 13 percent of women of reproductive age are on Medicaid, compared with the 65 percent that had private insurance, as of 2014. Most states have created laws similar to the Hyde amendment and do not fund abortions for low-income women on Medicaid, but fifteen states have mechanisms to use state funds to cover abortions for Medicaid recipients. By the Kaiser Family Foundation’s count, 2.7 million women live in a state where coverage of abortion services under Medicaid, ACA Marketplace plans and/or private policies is limited to cases of rape, incest, and where the mother’s life is in danger. Were the Hyde amendment to be nixed, the number of abortions among Medicaid-eligible women would be expected to increase by approximately 33,000, or an increase of 2.5 percent, according to the Guttmacher institute. Our ruling Ohio Right to Life’s press release said, ""Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars."" Strickland supports the Democratic party platform, so although ""lockstep"" sounds sinister, it simply means Clinton and Strickland hold similar positions when it comes to abortion rights. Those positions are not accurately described by Ohio Right to Life.  Abortions ""on demand, up until the moment of birth"" are a hypothetical non-event, according to health care professionals. As for abortions being paid for with tax dollars, this is a vast oversimplification of rules surrounding Medicaid, which provides health care for poor women.   We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c664b20-be6e-46f5-93f4-bb96a98299e7",/factchecks/2016/aug/12/ohio-right-life/ohio-right-lifes-faulty-claims-ted-strickland-abor/

Internet: Philly rigged the 2012 presidential election. Experts: Still no
","Update 5:34 p.m. Okay. So, we’re still talking about this. There’s a meme circulating on the internet that promotes allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. Our kinsfolk over at PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Florida have already reported on claims specific to their states. For Pennsylvania, the meme reads, ""In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes, with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility.)"" This kind of happened, and it’s not actually mathematically impossible. First, the 59 refers to the City of Philadelphia, not the metropolitan area or region. An absolutely crucial fact: The 59 zones that saw no votes for Romney were not districts, but divisions. There are nearly 1,700 divisions in Philadelphia. Each of the city’s 66 wards claims between 10 and 50 of them. To provide a sense of how small divisions are, currently, the average number of registered voters per division is 616. The division out of the 59 with the lowest turnout counted 139 votes in 2012; the highest was 612. As Billy Penn reported, after Sean Hannity reiterated that 59 divisions with all-Obama votes showed signs of election rigging, a West Philadelphia elections inspector took to Twitter to debunk it. The key nugget in his explanation was this: Votes cannot be subtracted from Philadelphia voting machines. Republican City Commissioner Al Schmidt confirmed that was indeed the case. So, if anyone had voted Romney, there’s no way that vote could’ve been removed from the tally, which means if fraud had occurred, it would’ve had to have happened before the vote button was pushed. Some of the 59 divisions had fewer than 10 registered Republicans, according to records from April 2012. The average number of registered Republicans in these divisions was 17. The Philadelphia Inquirer sought out many of these voters after the election, and found that the rolls could use some updating. Some, neighbors said, had moved, others straight-up told the Inquirer they didn’t know the city had them down as GOPers. One man told the paper while he was a Republican, he had never actually voted that way. Experts say these divisions reflect a trend of heavily Democratic inner-city neighborhoods. Considering how few Republicans live in these micro-neighborhoods, it’s not shocking that Romney would have a tough go of it against the nation’s first black president, in 59 subzones that only represented a mere 3.5 percent of the city’s vote in aggregate. Commissioner Al Schmidt told Billy Penn last week that in order for there to have been voter fraud, by adding votes in these divisions would have required ""hundreds of people engaging in a conspiracy, and no one finding out about it.""   Our ruling A viral image has called 59 Philadelphia voter ""districts"" counting zero Romney votes in the 2012 general election ""(a) mathematical and statistical impossibility."" Only, these divisions were not the size of districts. They were much smaller, encompassing hundreds rather than thousands, and in predominately African-American areas of the city. Looking at the voter records from six months prior, Democrats in these areas outnumbered Republicans more than 20 to one. That’s before considering what the Inquirer’s reporting suggests: That out of the small minority of GOPers in these sections, many don’t align with the party, or don’t appear to live there anymore. Were the 59 divisions worthy of investigation? Yes. And that happened in 2012, and has happened numerous times since. We rule this claim a Pants on Fire.   An earlier version of this story incorrectly cited PolitiFact Ohio.

Can employers actually pay disabled Americans below the minimum wage?
","Many speakers at this year’s Democratic National Convention focused on Hillary Clinton’s desire to help all people, including women, the gay and lesbian community, and racial minorities. Former Sen. Tom Harkin used his speech to focus on Americans with disabilities. ""Twenty-six years ago today, our nation won a hard-fought battle to end discrimination for over 50 million people when we signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA,"" Harkin stated. However, he continued, ""when, 26 years later, employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage, it is time to change that law. Hillary Clinton will fight to eliminate the subminimum wage, and ensure that a fair day’s work earns a fair day’s pay."" Are employers actually able to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage? We took a look. The Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, of 1990 is the most comprehensive piece of legislation that safeguards the rights and interests of disabled Americans. Title I of the ADA protects qualified individuals from employment discrimination. It applies to private-sector employers employing more than 15 individuals, as well as to employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor/management committees. Employers are also required to make reasonable accommodation, which means making any change or adjustment that allows disabled people to partake in all functions of the job process. The ADA also protects disabled individuals from discrimination in pay. Employers cannot make up the cost of reasonable accommodation by reducing a disabled individual’s pay lower than the pay of others in the same position. Subminimum wage provisions While the ADA does protect individuals from pay discrimination, the protection is qualified. Under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employers are able to pay a wage below the federal minimum wage to workers whose work is affected by a mental or physical deficiency. (The ADA does not change this provision.) The reduction in wage corresponds to the reduction in productivity as compared with a worker without a disability. This means that some disabled workers can make significantly less than the minimum wage, in some cases even less than a dollar per hour. Employers must obtain a certificate from the Wage and Hour Division to set a wage below the federal minimum. According to the U.S. Labor Department, the certificate program has been implemented in the employment of over 420,000 disabled Americans. This reduced wage, known as the subminimum wage, has been in effect since the 1930s, with several changes over the years. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933-1935 set the first productivity-based subminimum wage, which was adopted again with the passing of the FLSA in 1938. The subminimum wage had a wage floor until 1986. Since then, the subminimum wage has been commensurate with productivity. Executive Order 13658 In 2014, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13658, which established a minimum wage for workers working on or under a contract with the federal government. The order specifically included disabled workers under purview of section 14(c) of the FLSA. While the executive order requires that all workers working on or under contracts of the federal government be paid a minimum of $10.15 per hour, the order did not inhibit the use of commensurate wages. Employers are still able to pay disabled individuals less than other workers as long as the wage remains at or above the $10.15 minimum. Furthermore, the executive order only applies to work in association with the federal government. The order’s limited scope and qualification of commensurate pay has made many disability advocates call for more far-reaching reform. Calls for more reform Many disability advocates claim that the subminimum wage is antiquated and fosters systemic inequities. In an article for the Huffington Post in 2015, Curtis Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, wrote that the subminimum wage was an incentive for businesses to hire physically disabled individuals in the competitive manufacturing industries of the time. However, the provision is exploited today because ""unscrupulous employers eager to profit off the cheap labor … portray their business as a ‘job training’ program."" Disabled Americans enter these programs under the assumption that they will gain valuable skills that will lead to real-world jobs and financial independence. However, Decker said this rarely happens because ""as soon as the worker becomes proficient in one area and ready to graduate, they change that person’s task."" Many never graduate from the program and are stuck making subminimum wages while employers benefit from the cheap labor. We reached out to the Clinton and Trump campaigns for insight on their respective plans regarding disability policy. The Clinton campaign directed us to a March 25, 2016, speech in which she discussed the subminimum wage. ""I want us to take a hard look at raising the minimum wage and ending the tiered minimum wages, whether it's for people with disabilities or the tipped wage,"" Clinton said. (Another group of people who can be paid below the minimum wage are those, such as restaurant servers, whose income comes to a significant degree from customer tips.) The Trump campaign did not respond to our inquiries, and there is no disability policy agenda detailed on the official campaign website. While there has been limited action at the federal level, three states -- Vermont, New Hampshire and Maryland -- have passed legislation that phase out use of the subminimum wage in their respective states. Our ruling Harkin said, ""Employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage."" He’s right that employers have been able to pay a subminimum wage to disabled workers since the 1930s. There’s one significant exception today, created by Obama’s executive order: Federal contractors must pay all workers a $10.15 minimum wage. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf683287-e597-4fcc-9926-102ddec70249",/factchecks/2016/aug/12/tom-harkin/can-employers-actually-pay-disabled-americans-belo/

FBI director admitted 'we cannot properly vet' Middle Easterners, Carlos Beruff says
","Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff wants voters to know that he plans to be tough on national security and immigration, because right now the FBI has no way to guarantee America’s safety as refugees flood the United States. ""Thousands of Syrian refugees are pouring into our country, thanks to President Obama,"" Beruff said in an Aug. 8 Facebook post. ""This is an open invitation to acts of terror. Even the director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East."" Immigration has been a major focus of this election cycle, with Republicans routinely calling for more restrictions to ensure security in the United States. But did James Comey actually say the FBI ""cannot properly vet"" people coming from the Middle East? No, he didn’t. Beruff is distorting a point Comey was making about a flaw in the vetting process, but he was reiterating the system in place was actually much better than it had been in years past. No guarantees When we asked Beruff’s campaign what Comey said and when, his spokesman sent us a YouTube clip of Comey speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015. A topic at the meeting was the thoroughness of background checks for refugees — specifically some 10,000 Syrian refugees slated to come to the United States. The Syrian refugee focus was much more specific than ""people coming from the Middle East,"" as Beruff said. Let’s be clear: The United States can vet refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Because of the overt concern about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. At the committee meeting, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey if there was concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases may not contain complete information on every refugee. Comey agreed, saying the procedure isn’t perfect, because it relies on checking for criminal records or other nefarious activity. ""We can only query against that which we have collected,"" Comey said. ""If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to — there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person."" So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldn’t guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. That’s just the way it is. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. As Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past that’s unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years. ""The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago,"" Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. ""The bad news is, there is no risk-free process."" Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. ""There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that,"" he told the Senate committee. ""From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. … I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps."" He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. ""We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news,"" Comey said. ""The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria."" Our ruling Beruff said, ""The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East."" Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the government’s process ""cannot properly vet people.""

"['National', 'Nuclear', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Has Donald Trump talked about using nukes against America's Western European allies?
","Donald Trump is ""too dangerous"" to have access to the nuclear codes, Hillary Clinton emphasizes in a new ad. The ad features soundbites from pundits voicing concern about whether Trump is ready for the responsibilities of the presidency. Speakers include Michael Hayden, former CIA director under George W. Bush; Max Boot, a conservative foreign policy analyst; and Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist. (All have criticized Trump on some occasions.) One clip features Gillian Turner, who worked at the White House National Security Council under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, talking on Fox News. Trump ""has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies,"" the ad shows Turner saying. We wanted to fact-check whether the Clinton campaign accurately portrayed Trump’s comments about nuclear weapons and western Europe. In our view, even though Turner made the statement, it was the Clinton campaign’s decision to pull the clip and advance its ""unfit"" argument. Is Clinton’s campaign correct in saying Trump has considered using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies? Not exactly. What Trump has said The comment in question stems from an MSNBC town hall interview in March. Trump was asked by host Chris Matthews if he might use nuclear weapons. Trump: ""I’d be the last one to use the nuclear weapons, because that’s sort of like the end of the ballgame."" Matthews: ""So, can you take it off the table now? Can you tell the Middle East we are not using the nuclear weapon on anybody?"" Trump: ""I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table."" Matthews: ""How about Europe? We won’t use it in Europe."" Trump: ""I’m not going to take it off the table for anybody."" Matthews: ""You might use it in Europe?"" Trump: ""No. I don’t think so, but — I am not taking cards off the table. I’m not going to use nukes, but I’m not taking cards off the table."" In the same breath, Trump said he would not use nuclear weapons, but he went on to say he wouldn't take it off the table for ""anybody,"" include Europe. He stuck by this phrasing in another interview on The O’Reilly Factor when Eric Bolling asked the same question. ""Europe’s a big place,"" he said. ""I’m not going to take cards off the the table. We have nuclear capability. Now, our capability is going down rapidly because of what we're doing. It's in bad shape. The equipment is not properly maintained. There are all lot of talk about that. And that's a bad thing, not a good thing.The last person to use nuclear would be Donald Trump. That’s the way I feel. I think it’s a horrible thing. The thought of it is horrible, but I don’t want to take anything off the table."" In these two interviews, each held within a day of one another, Trump’s position on nuclear weapons overall and in Europe is convoluted. Yes, he hates the idea, but he doesn’t want to take the option off the table. Experts weigh in Experts we spoke to said Trump’s comments were a departure from previous rhetoric because they’re imprecise, but they noted his refusal to ""take options off the table"" is vaguely in line with U.S. policy. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referred to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report, which focuses on preventing nuclear proliferation, ""Indeed, as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States will sustain safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces,"" reads the report. ""These nuclear forces will continue to play an essential role in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring allies and partners around the world."" Point being, there are some instances where the United States does not rule out using nuclear weapons, he said, which is why Trump’s ""cards on the table"" policy is somewhat in line with U.S. policy. Jim Walsh, an international security and research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he’s ""seen nothing"" suggesting Trump would use nuclear weapons against America’s European allies. ""What Trump may be trying to say is actually consistent with traditional U.S. doctrine, that is, we are prepared to use (nuclear weapons) to counter a Russian/Soviet invasion of Western Europe with conventional forces,"" Walsh, who is not a fan of Trump, said. ""That's a NATO commitment."" The usual rhetoric -- that America would use nuclear weapons against Soviets to protect our allies -- is in line with what previous presidents have said, said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. It should be noted that Nephew said he is ""repelled by Trump and his rhetoric, including around nuclear weapons."" ""Previous presidents have spoken about the use of nuclear weapons to threaten the Soviets and others that might attack our allies,"" Nephew said. ""They have talked about battlefield uses only in an extreme crisis and rarely spoken about tactical nuclear weapons at all (which would be what a normal president would be referring to: using nuclear weapons to attack enemy forces invading our Allies)."" After speaking to experts, we can conclude that Trump’s comments are vague, but do not translate directly into using weapons against our European allies. We reached out to Gillian Turner to hear how she feels about being used in the ad, but we didn’t hear back from her. Our ruling A Clinton campaign ad claims Trump has talked about the option of using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies. Experts said his comments on nuclear weapons are imprecise, but they interpreted his comments as vaguely aligned with U.S. policy, at least in the sense that America does not rule out using weapons to protect allies. Trump never explicitly talked about using nuclear weapons against America’s allies in Europe -- but that he he is just leaving the option open. The claim has an element of truth but is misleading, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6046bf15-c408-418b-a780-1b5220f04bca",/factchecks/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/has-donald-trump-talked-about-using-nukes-against-/

No climate warming in quite a few years, Sen. Ron Johnson says -- but records were set in 2014, 2015
","On a Wisconsin radio talk show on Aug. 1, 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked about global warming. ""Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it,"" Johnson replied. ""We all want a clean environment. It's a goal we all share. I understand that."" Then the Republican incumbent, who faces Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 2016 election, made a statement we want to check, saying: ""First of all, the climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."" Johnson’s comments on WRJN-AM in Racine prompted stories in the national media, including Talking Points Memo, Slate and the Huffington Post, each of which referred to 2015 being the hottest year on record. The rate of global warming has slowed in recent years, particularly since 1998, but Johnson’s declaration is, well, overheated. Johnson’s evidence To back Johnson’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a global ""temperature anomaly"" chart from NASA. A temperature anomaly means a change, up or down, from a long-term average.  Source: NASA 
Johnson’s campaign argued that the chart shows the anomalies rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off. The trend on the chart, however, is steadily upward since the 1960s. And there was a ""positive anomaly"" in each of the past four years. Past fact checks Previous fact checks have found global temperatures hitting record highs in recent years. In 2013, when President Barack Obama said that ""the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years,"" PolitiFact National’s rating was True. And in 2014 and 2015, our colleagues rated Mostly False two claims that there had been no global warming in the past 17 years. Global surface temperatures remained relatively flat during that period, since the last powerful El Niño, in 1998. But the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been relatively stable -- has been the warmest on record. NASA/NOAA In January 2016, NASA reported that separate, independent analyses by its own scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. The globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 ""shattered the previous mark set in 2014,"" NASA said.

The 2015 temperatures, NASA added, ""continue a long-term warming trend"" -- most of the warming has occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001 (as is shown in the chart below).  Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration So, the warmest year on record was 2015, followed by 2014. Moreover, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that temperatures in the first six months of 2016 are even higher. Our rating Johnson said: ""The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."" He argues that temperatures rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off, but it’s wrong to say there hasn’t been warming in many years. In fact, 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, with the two highest years being 2014 and 2015.

"['Death Penalty', 'Elections', 'California', ""Yes On 62 campaign to abolish California's death penalty""]","
Truth be told: California has ‘largest death row in Western Hemisphere’
","Californians will decide in November whether to abolish — or possibly speed up — the state’s death penalty. Proposition 62 would eliminate capital punishment, replacing it with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as the state’s maximum punishment for those found guilty of murder. It would apply retroactively to the nearly 750 inmates on California's death row. Proposition 66, meanwhile, would keep the death penalty but proposes a faster appeals process. Campaigns for the competing ballot measures are making numerous claims as they seek to persuade voters. A provocative statement by the Yes On 62 campaign on its twitter page caught our attention:

""California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere.""  The Yes On 62 campaign to abolish California's death penalty made the claim at the center of this fact check on its twitter page above. Home to nearly 40 million people, California leads the way in many numerical categories. We wondered, however, whether that includes this somber grouping. Our research The largest death row populations in the Western Hemisphere belong to states within the United States, not separate countries, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. The  Washington D.C.-based nonprofit is considered an authority on death penalty topics, and opposes capital punishment. As of August 5, the California Department of Corrections lists 746 prisoners on the state’s death row. That’s nearly double the next largest total — Florida’s 388 — according to figures from that state’s department of corrections. Texas’ total is nearly 250, the third highest. Beyond Florida and Texas, there aren’t any states in the United States that are even close, Dunham said.    Nor are other countries in the hemisphere anywhere close. ""Most of the Western Hemisphere has abolished the death penalty. Apart from the United States, the retentionist countries are Cuba, Guatemala and Guyana and then a couple of countries in the Caribbean. None of them have death rows that are remotely the size of California’s or even Florida’s,"" Dunham added. Canada did away with the death penalty in 1976; Mexico eliminated it in 2005. The Cornell Law School’s Death Penalty Worldwide database shows it’s been several years since Cuba, Guatemala or Guyana executed anyone. There are 19 states in the United States with no death penalty. Several have abolished capital punishment in recent years, including Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and Maryland. There are two federal death rows, including one in the military, both of which are much smaller than California’s. Explaining the backlog Reasons cited for California’s massive death row vary. Dunham says death penalty appeals backlog in the courts because the state fails to provide prisoners with enough legal help. Bill Bradley, spokesman for the No On 62 campaign, said delays result from a system that allows inmates and their attorneys to ""file appeal after frivolous appeal to delay justice."" Another cause: Executions have been on hold in California since 2006 following a legal challenge to the state’s three-chemical lethal injection method. The state has executed just 13 people since it reinstated the death penalty in 1978. Experts say execution is the third leading cause of death on California’s death row, behind natural causes and suicide. When asked, a Yes on 62 campaign spokesman pointed to research by the Death Penalty Information Center and the Cornell Law School database to back up its ""largest death row"" statement. Bradley of the No on Prop 62 campaign described the claim about California’s large death row as ""technically true"" but dismissed its significance saying ""California has the largest of everything.""  A guard stands watch over condemned inmates on death row at San Quentin State Prison. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) Confusing claim? While California clearly has a large death row, there’s an aspect of the Yes On 62 claim that could be considered confusing. California has fewer people on death row than are condemned to die across the United States. So, how could it have ""the largest death row population"" in the Western Hemisphere? Experts explain it this way: In the United States, death sentences are primarily the product of state courts. The federal government plays less of a role compared to central governments in other countries. As a result, the size of death rows have long been tracked by state and not necessarily as a national, comprehensive total. ""It may be a dramatic way of making the point,"" Dunham said of the Yes On 62 claim. ""But the point is still accurate."" We used a similar interpretation of the claim as we examined its accuracy. Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, agreed California has the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere. He estimated it ranks behind only a handful of countries on the planet, including China and Iran. Our ruling The Yes On 62 campaign to abolish the death penalty said ""California is home to the largest death row population in the Western Hemisphere."" Death penalty experts and public data show California has nearly 750 people condemned to die. That’s nearly twice as many as the next closest state or country, Florida at 388, in the Western Hemisphere. The claim could be confusing to some because California’s death row is smaller than the total number of people with death sentences across the United States. But experts say death rows in the U.S. are ranked individually, making California’s stand far out from the rest. We also found that few countries in this hemisphere still have the death penalty, which is helpful to note but does not take away from the accuracy of the statement. We rate the claim True.

NRA ad falsely says Clinton 'doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense'
","In a new multi-million-dollar ad buy, the NRA attacks Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s stance on guns. Clinton, the ad says, doesn’t want gun owners to be able to protect themselves. The National Rifle Association said it’s spending $3 million on the ad in North Carolina plus other ""key battleground states"" of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada. ""She’s one of the wealthiest women in politics,"" the ad begins. ""Combined income: $30 million. Tours the world on private jets. Protected by armed guards for 30 years. But she doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."" Not even counting its TV exposure, the ad had been watched more than 100,000 times online within a day of being uploaded. We’re interested in the crux of the ad, which claims Clinton ""doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."" Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has made similar claims before. He got a False for saying Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment in May and again in July. PolitiFact has also given a Pants on Fire ruling to a viral image that spread online during the primary, saying Clinton said she wants to shut down the NRA and ban handguns. Now the NRA has also entered the fray, launching its ad campaign the day after Trump said that ""Second Amendment people"" might be able to somehow stop Clinton. Clinton’s communications manager for North Carolina, Andrew Bates, said the ad contains ""lies"" about Clinton because she supports gun control measures the NRA doesn’t like. Clinton’s past statements Clinton has had a fairly consistent view on gun rights: She says she respects the Second Amendment but thinks more regulations are OK to try to curb gun violence. Her website has details of her specific proposals, and she has also made a number of public statements. In August 2015, after a news crew in Virginia was murdered on-camera, Clinton said, ""We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures."" When Clinton was running for president in 2008, she said virtually the same thing in a debate and argued for reinstating a ban on assault weapons that expired under George W. Bush. Her husband, Bill Clinton, signed the ban into law with support from former presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. ""You know, I believe in the Second Amendment,"" Clinton said in the debate. ""People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this."" Clinton has also made gun rights supporters nervous at times. She once suggested a voluntary gun buyback program, although she compared it to one in Australia – not realizing the Australian program was a mandatory confiscation, not a buyback. And in an interview with ABC News anchor (and former Bill Clinton advisor) George Stephanopoulos, she declined to say for certain that she agrees the right to bear arms applies to individuals, which the Supreme Court decided in the landmark 2008 Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller. ""If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation,"" she said. Criticisms Jennifer Baker, the public affairs director for the NRA’s lobbying arm, said the ad is accurate because of Clinton’s stance on the Heller case. If Clinton becomes president, Baker said, she will be tasked with picking a judge to replace the late Antonin Scalia, who sided with the 5-4 majority on Heller. Baker said the NRA doesn't want the court to take another shot at the Second Amendment and reverse its decision on gun rights. ""If she were elected one of the first things she would be able to do is appoint a Scalia replacement who could overturn Heller,"" Baker said. That’s possible. Of course, there’s no guarantee the currently Republican-led Senate would agree to nominate someone with real or perceived anti-gun views. Nor is there a guarantee another similar case will come up anytime soon. Heller was the first time the Supreme Court had interpreted the Second Amendment since 1939, according to the Library of Congress. So what other proof does the NRA have? The backbone of its argument is a secretly taken audio recording from a private meeting last year in which Clinton criticized the Heller decision. The court ruled that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own weapons for self-defense, even though no such language appears in the Second Amendment. However, the case was not only about that single issue — more on that in a second — and in the audio Clinton never mentions anything about self-defense or individual rights. Instead, she is criticizing another aspect of the ruling, regarding the government’s ability to regulate guns. ""The idea that you could have an open carry permit with an AK-47 over your shoulder walking up and down the aisles of a supermarket is just despicable,"" Clinton is heard saying. ""So I’m going to speak out. … The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment, and I am going to make my case on that every chance I get."" Similarities to George W. Bush Clinton’s invocation of a machine gun and public carry might have sounded oddly familiar to George W. Bush. Those were two issues his administration was also concerned about during the Heller case. Conservatives and liberals alike might not like to hear this, but it’s true: Clinton’s stance is similar to Bush’s. They would likely disagree on specifics. Yet both have argued that the right to bear arms needs to be upheld, but that it’s not an absolute right and can be regulated, just like the right to free speech. Bush’s solicitor general, Paul Clement, wrote a brief on behalf of the government. He said the decision by the appeals court was too broad and asked the Supreme Court not to uphold it (the court ultimately did, leading to Clinton’s criticisms years later). The Bush administration wasn’t arguing that people have no individual right to own guns for self-defense. Instead, it was worried a favorable ruling could weaken the government’s ability in to restrict public access to machine guns or the carrying of weapons in public. Clement argued the decision ""could cast doubt on the constitutionality of existing federal legislation prohibiting the possession of certain firearms, including machineguns,"" and that the Second Amendment ""is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons."" We doubt many people will accuse Clement — who represented the NRA at the Supreme Court a couple years after leaving the White House — or Bush of being anti-gun. And their concerns over machine guns and unrestricted carry were the same that Clinton was recorded talking about, which the NRA cited for its ad. Our ruling The NRA said Clinton ""doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."" Clinton has never said that, nor could she do anything about it on her own even if she wanted to. She would need to rely on a new Supreme Court justice, who would first have to be approved by the currently Republican-led Senate. Clinton did say she disagreed with the Heller ruling, as the NRA points out. But she was talking about specifics and cited the same worries raised by the Bush administration, about looser restrictions on automatic weapons or carrying in public. We rate this claim False.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6645d7e7-d467-4db6-8d8f-35b88b37dd55",/factchecks/2016/aug/11/national-rifle-association/nra-ad-falsely-says-clinton-doesnt-believe-your-ri/

The surprising stats on car crashes and overdoses in Pennsylvania
","Pennsylvania’s heroin and prescription drug abuse crisis is one of the most acute problems facing the state, and the number of overdose deaths has skyrocketed in recent years. Sitting politicians and candidates for office are racing to propose solutions. Among them is Democrat Josh Shapiro, a Montgomery County commissioner and a candidate for attorney general who dedicated a page on his campaign website to fighting the opioid epidemic. But it was the stat he used at the beginning of his platform that caught our eye. ""Overdosing,"" his campaign wrote, ""is now the number one accidental killer in our Commonwealth."" At first glance, it’s a stunning statistic. But this one checks out to be true, as drug overdose deaths have increased over the years while car crash deaths have been on the decline for decades. We took a look at the numbers to compare the leading causes of death in Pennsylvania and compare those to the number of deaths related to drugs. Drug overdose deaths have sharply risen in recent years. The most recent data shows that upwards of 3,500 people died of a drug overdose in Pennsylvania last year, representing a significant increase from 2014, according to a recent report released by the Pennsylvania State Coroners Association. Nearly 2,500 people died in Pennsylvania of a drug overdose in 2014, and Pennsylvania leads the nation in the number of drug overdose deaths among young men. A report released last summer by the Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation put these figures into context: The number of deaths by drug overdose first surpassed car accidents in 2011, and the difference has only become more stark since then. Drug overdose deaths now surpass car accident deaths in 36 states. According to PennDOT, 1,195 were killed as a result of a motor vehicle crash in Pennsylvania in 2014, and the 2014 total of reportable traffic crashes is the fourth lowest total since 1950. (PennDOT defines a crash as one in which an injury or a fatality occurs or at least one of the vehicles involved requires towing from the scene.) That means that in 2014, drug overdoses represented double the number of deaths compared to motor vehicle crashes in Pennsylvania and is by far the leading accidental cause of death in the state. Though drug overdose data is available for 2015 and 2014, the most comprehensive data with regard to the reason for all deaths in the state is from 2013. The Pennsylvania Department of Health reported that in 2013, 4,891 people died of an ""accident"" -- a category that includes drug overdoses. Of those, the Center for Disease Control reports 2,426 were drug overdoses. In 2013, 1,965 people died from an accident that wasn’t a drug overdose or in a vehicle while 1,313 people were killed as a result of a car accident. But it’s important to note: Drug overdoses are the No. 1 form of accidental death in Pennsylvania, not the No. 1 overall reason for death. That’s heart disease, followed by cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease. In addition to illnesses and accidents, there were 630 homicides in Pennsylvania in 2013. Here’s a look at the top five causes of death in the commonwealth in 2013: Heart disease - 31,537 Cancer - 28,418 Chronic lower respiratory disease - 6,702 Cardiovascular disease - 6,575 Total accident deaths (including drug overdoses) - 4,891 The opioid addiction and drug overdose problem is increasing the most in 1. Rural areas of Pennsylvania ravaged by addiction to prescription drugs and 2. In Philadelphia, which had the highest drug-related death rate per 100,000 people in 2014. That year, 655 people died of a drug overdose in Philadelphia and heroin was present in 349 of those deaths. According to a report by the Drug Enforcement Agency, the increasing abuse of heroin and cocaine as well as opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone caused the spike in drug overdoses in the city over the last decade. There was a 33 percent increase in drug-related deaths in Philadelphia between 2013 and 2014 alone. Susquehanna, Cambria, Fayette and Wayne counties round out the top five counties in the state where drug overdose deaths have increased most rapidly. Our ruling Attorney General candidate Josh Shapiro wrote in his campaign platform for fighting the opioid epidemic in Pennsylvania that ""Overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in our Commonwealth."" Data from The Department of Health, the Center for Disease Control and the several other independent reports shows that overdosing has surpassed car crashes and other accidental causes as the leading accidental cause of death in Pennsylvania.

","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement and pointed out that it was signed by President Bill Clinton, husband of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. NowThis, which spreads stories on social media, has accused Trump of getting it wrong — repeatedly. On Aug. 10, 2016, NowThis posted a video on Facebook headlined ""Fact Check: Everything Donald J. Trump says about NAFTA is wrong,"" and on YouTube titled ""Donald Trump Can't Get The Facts Right About NAFTA."". It shows five clips of Trump saying that Bill Clinton signed the treaty and follows four of them with these superimposed comments (in order): ""False,"" ""Nope,"" ""Donald Trump Keeps Lying About the North American Free Trade Agreement,"" and ""False: Bill Clinton Didn't Sign NAFTA.""  Others, such as the liberal site Anti-Republican Crusaders, shared the video as well. As of Thursday afternoon it had been viewed over 1.1 million times. We wondered how we could have repeatedly missed Trump being so wrong so often when it comes to the treaty. It turns out that Trump isn't wrong. Clinton signed the deal on Dec. 8, 1993. His speech that day is available in print form and on YouTube. However, it should be noted that Clinton isn't the only one responsible for the deal. It was inaugurated by his Republican predecessor, George H.W. Bush, who signed the initial version of the treaty in December 1992, before it was submitted to Congress for ratification and after he had lost to Clinton. But Clinton had campaigned for changes to the deal and sought side agreements requiring Mexico to enforce labor standards, improve working conditions and create better environmental safeguards. Negotiations were begun and those side deals were signed by Clinton in August 1993. After a tough political battle in which Clinton campaigned hard for the pact, the agreement was ratified by the House 234-200 and the Senate by 61-38. Republicans provided the margin of victory in both chambers, leading to Clinton's signature on the final version. When we contacted NowThis, editor Sarah Frank focused on the original signing by Bush. acknowledging that ""Clinton signed the legislation into law after it was passed by Congress."" ""Trump is saying 'Clinton signed NAFTA' as though it was his deal. It was Bush's deal,"" Frank said in a followup email. Our ruling NowThis repeatedly says in its video that Trump's statements accusing Clinton of signing NAFTA are ""False: Bill Clinton didn't sign NAFTA."" It's true that the George H.W.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Barack Obama 'founded' ISIS, Hillary Clinton was 'cofounder'
","Donald Trump has found a ferocious way to describe President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: as the founder and cofounder of ISIS, the terrorist group behind beheadings of Americans and lethal attacks around the world. Speaking to thousands of supporters at a Broward County arena Aug. 10, Trump vowed to ""knock the hell out of ISIS"" before pointing the finger at the Democrats. ""ISIS is honoring President Obama,"" he said. ""He is the founder of ISIS. He is the founder of ISIS, okay? He is the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton."" Trump has been making similar comments for several months, and he repeated his latest talking point in an interview with Republican radio host Hugh Hewitt the day after his Broward speech. In fact, when Hewitt proposed a more cautious interpretation of his assertion — that Obama and Clinton ""created the vacuum"" in the region and thus ""lost the peace"" to ISIS — Trump rejected that formulation, sticking with the most literal version of ""founder"" and ""co-founder."" ""No, I meant he’s the founder of ISIS,"" Trump told Hewitt. ""I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton."" Hewitt pushed back, saying, ""But he’s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He’s trying to kill them."" Trump dismissed that again, saying, ""I don’t care. He was the founder. The way he got out of Iraq was, that, that was the founding of ISIS, okay?"" And hours after the Hewitt interview aired, Trump tripled down on the attack in a speech to the National Association of Homebuilders in Miami Beach once again accusing them of being the founder and cofounder of ISIS. Trump was already incorrect when he said Clinton ""invented"" ISIS with her ""stupid policies,"" as he did a few weeks ago. Now he’s taking it a step further with the ""co-founded"" attack. Let us be clear: It is wildly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton ""co-founded"" ISIS. The creation of ISIS Experts have repeatedly told us that the sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected. But Trump’s provocative comment glosses over all of that nuance. For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state. ISIS has used several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014. The most prominent leader of the group we now call ISIS has been Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who became the leader in 2010. Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But you could also argue Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots and regroup. The Trump campaign sent us links to articles about how the Obama administration handled the situation in the Middle East that influenced the rise of ISIS. As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign has previously pointed to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. While Clinton does bear some responsibility for the Iraq war that gave ISIS an opening, she isn’t solely responsible: The vast majority of senators — from both parties — joined her in supporting the intervention advocated by Bush. ""So yes, Hillary's vote for President Bush's misguided policy to build democracy in Iraq directly assisted the Republican decision that opened the door to the radicalization of Iraq and destabilization of the Levant,"" said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told us in July when Trump attacked Clinton. ""Bush's destruction of the Iraq Army and state is the single-most important decision that led to the expansion of al-Qaida into the region and later emergence of ISIS."" Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and that did not include an agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign has also pointed to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya as evidence for allowing ISIS to grow. As secretary of state in 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria and said Assad needed to ""get out of the way."" ""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion."" In recent years, the United States has targeted ISIS militarily, with some signs of progress and some setbacks. After an ISIS terrorist attack in Brussels, Obama said that destroying the group is his ""top priority."" (For what it’s worth, Clinton herself was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels but was overruled by Obama. She also advocated for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011.) As Hewitt suggested in the interview, it’s possible to argue that the administration’s withdrawing from Iraq, its lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and its decision to intervene in Libya contributed to the power of ISIS. These concerns track those we’ve heard from foreign-policy experts. However, this more limited and defensible critique of Clinton’s record is what Hewitt offered Trump on his radio show, and the candidate forcefully rejected it out of hand — twice. Our ruling Trump said Obama ""founded ISIS. I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton."" There’s a credible critique that Obama’s and Clinton’s foreign-policy and military decisions helped create a space in which ISIS could operate and expand. But Trump explicitly rejected this formulation, saying he literally means Obama is ""the founder of ISIS"" and Clinton is the ""cofounder."" In reality, the founder of ISIS was a terrorist. It is run by terrorists. Obama has said destroying ISIS is his ""top priority."" All this makes Trump’s statement a ridiculous characterization. He’s doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on it in various venues and has reinforced that he meant his words to be taken literally.

Carlos Beruff supported Charlie Crist after party switch, PAC says
","Florida’s GOP primary for U.S. Senate has turned into mutual finger-pointing over which candidate is possibly more like former Republican Charlie Crist. A super PAC called the Florida First Project released an ad July 14 calling Sen. Marco Rubio’s primary opponent Carlos Beruff a ""Charlie Crist Republican,"" a major insult among the Florida GOP faithful. The PAC supports Rubio’s re-election bid and is managed by several staffers from Conservative Solutions PAC, which backed Rubio’s presidential run. ""Beruff supported Crist even after he switched parties, and stabbed Republicans in the back,"" the ad says. The line refers specifically to the Bradenton developer’s support for Crist’s 2010 Senate campaign against Rubio. Former Gov. Crist switched from Republican to having no party affiliation as Rubio’s campaign gained steam. After losing that race, Crist lost a 2014 re-election bid for governor as a Democrat, and currently is running as a Democrat for a U.S. House seat held by Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores. Beruff has released his own ad counterattacking Rubio, accusing him of being a ""political opportunist"" like Crist. We wondered whether Rubio’s challenge of Beruff’s Republican bona fides was correct. Did Beruff still support Crist after Crist became an independent candidate? His actions at the time don't indicate Beruff shunned Crist entirely, despite what he says now. Grist about Crist Beruff likes to claim that he is a political outsider, but he has long been involved in Florida politics. Crist as governor appointed Beruff to three political boards: the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Authority, the State College of Florida Board of Trustees, and the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Beruff also has donated thousands to Republican candidates over the years, including to Crist’s Senate campaign. Crist announced his Senate candidacy in May 2009. Federal Election Commission reports from June 2009 showed Beruff gave Crist the maximum allowed for individuals — $2,400 for the primary and $2,400 for the general elections. (Beruff’s companies also had donated to Crist when he ran for governor in 2006.) As Rubio gained traction, Crist toyed with the idea of switching his registration. An April 2010 story in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune listed Beruff as a donor who would continue to support Crist if he made such a move.   The story also listed other Republicans as faithful to Crist, including former Sarasota Republican Party chairmen Bob Waechter and Eric Robinson, and prominent chiropractor Gary Kompothecras. By the end of April 2010, down 20 points to Rubio in the polls, Crist announced he would cede the Republican nomination for Senate by switching to no party affiliation.     Several weeks later, in June 2010, Beruff attended a fundraiser for Crist (with several Democrats) at Kompothecras’ Siesta Key home. It seems peculiar that Beruff would have gone to any Crist event during the politically charged atmosphere of the 2010 Senate race had he disagreed with Crist’s decision. At the time, Republicans faced a bitter rift in their party over Crist's defection, and choosing sides was a very public issue. To give you an idea of how contentious Crist's decision was, state Rep. David Rivera of Miami called it ""one of the biggest betrayals in American history since Benedict Arnold."" Beruff’s political opponents have made hay of his attendance at the fundraiser, repeatedly. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who faced Beruff in the primary before dropping out, made the same accusation back in February, starting a website called CharlieCristRepublican.com. Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera dropped out of the Senate race and also lobbed the attack at Beruff earlier this summer. But Beruff has recently denied supporting Crist, despite going to the fundraiser, and said he gave up on Crist after he ""got stupid"" and left the Republican Party. A Crist spokesman declined to say whether Beruff threw support to Crist at the fundraiser. We couldn’t find any other reports from six years ago listing Beruff as a vocal Crist advocate when he turned NPA. We also didn't find an instance of Beruff speaking out against Crist. Through campaign spokesman Chris Hartline, Beruff told PolitiFact Florida he voted for Rubio over Crist, but was ""disappointed"" in Rubio’s performance. The Washington Free Beacon asked Beruff about the 2010 fundraiser after Lopez-Cantera’s comments. Beruff admitted he was there, but said he was no longer supporting Crist at the time. There’s no record of Beruff donating to Rubio. ""If Dr. Gary (Kompothecras) invites me to something at his house, I go, unless I am out of town,"" Beruff told the Free Beacon. ""He’s a good friend, even though we don’t share political roadways all the time."" Beruff also said he had not donated to Crist after the party affiliation switch, saying ""follow the money."" Hartline echoed the sentiment when we asked him about it. ""It's a lie, and Marco Rubio knows it,"" Hartline told us in a statement. ""Carlos never supported Charlie Crist after he left the Republican Party. His last donation to Crist was June 1, 2009, almost 11 months before he became an independent."" Of course, there’s good reason why Beruff didn’t donate any more money, even if he wanted to. He had reached the $4,800 legal limit and was prohibited from giving further. ""Beruff could not have given more in the 2010 cycle, but he gave at a time when Crist was running for the Republican nomination,"" Douglas Weber, senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, told PolitiFact Florida via email. There is no evidence of Beruff giving Crist money since. Furthermore, news reports at the time said some donors demanded refunds after Crist’s party switch. Beruff did not. Hartline said it was because Beruff ""turned his focus to helping Rick Scott in his run for governor."" Our ruling Florida First Project said Beruff ""supported Crist even after he switched parties."" Beruff had supported Crist’s 2010 Senate run when Crist ran as a Republican, giving the maximum legal amount in donations. After Crist switched to an independent run, Beruff also attended a Crist fundraiser, although he denied supporting Crist in any way at that event. The Bradenton developer was listed as dependable Crist supporter in a news report prior to the switch, and didn’t ask for a refund of his donations. We found nary a mention of Beruff beyond that. But the bottom line is, even if Beruff denies it now, there's evidence that he didn't give Crist the same cold shoulder other Republicans immediately did.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/11/florida-first-project/carlos-beruff-supported-charlie-crist-after-party-/
