Mike Pence's inaccurate claim about Clinton's Benghazi role and response
","Indiana Gov. Mike Pence officially accepted the GOP’s nomination for vice president July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, and didn’t miss a beat when it came to assailing Hillary Clinton. ""It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' "" Pence said, eliciting loud boos from the audience. We’ve heard a version of this attack several times at the Republican National Convention, with some versions more accurate than others. Both parts of this particular claim are inaccurate. There is no evidence showing Clinton personally ""left Americans in harm’s way in Benghazi."" And while he’s using Clinton words, he’s misattributing their meaning. Leaving Americans ‘in harm’s way’ We reached out to the Trump campaign to clarify what Pence meant by Clinton leaving ""Americans in harm’s way"" but didn’t hear back immediately. It could refer to her alleged inaction after the attacks in sending troops to the scene. Or, to her allegedly brushing off requests for more security at the Benghazi compound. Or, her ""sleeping through"" the attacks. No matter, all of these claims are inaccurate -- some more so than others. Let’s take a look one by one. Before he officially got the job, Pence knocked Clinton for taking ""13 hours to send help to Americans under fire."" We rated that False. Clinton was not responsible for sending help to Benghazi; that fell to military officials. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Others have accused Clinton of ignoring requests for more security for the Benghazi consulate. It’s undeniable that officials in Libya repeatedly asked for better security, but there’s no evidence that Clinton herself was aware or that she willfully denied them. And finally, Pence may have been making his running mate’s point that the Benghazi victims were ""left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed."" That’s also False. Clinton was not literally sleeping when the attacks unfolded, as it was mid afternoon in Washington. Emails show she worked late into the night. Taking Trump’s and Pence’s claim more broadly, was Clinton inattentive as the attacks unfolded? In its recently released report, the House select committee on Benghazi did conclude that there were State Department and overall administrative failings, but Pence and Trump blamed Clinton specifically. And neither that probe nor the seven congressional investigations before it have suggested Clinton was personally responsible or could have prevented the attack. Clinton, for her part, has accepted responsibility for the attack as the head of the State Department at the time. ‘What difference at this point does it make?’ Pence’s claim that she made this oft-repeated comment in response ""after four Americans fell"" is also inaccurate. Clinton’s comments, said during a hearing months after the attack, was not an expression of apathy over the deaths.It was an exasperated response to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressing Clinton on why State Department officials in Washington didn’t call their counterparts in Libya to determine the cause of the attack (protests over a video mocking Islam or a planned terrorist attack). Clinton told Johnson her priority was figuring out how to rescue them, not pressing them for information, and it wasn’t appropriate to talk to the them before FBI interviews. When Johnson continued to press her for a more straightforward answer, Clinton gave her exasperated answer. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?"" she said. (You can read the full six-minute transcript here, courtesy of PolitiFact Wisconsin.) Our ruling Pence said, ""It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' "" It’s reasonable to argue that Clinton, as head of the State Department, should shoulder some responsibility for the bureaucratic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy. But there’s no evidence that suggests, as Pence does, that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the deaths of the four Benghazi victims. As for Clinton’s comment, it did not come ""after four Americans fell,"" but in a subsequent congressional hearing. She was responding to a senator’s repeated questioning over why she didn’t call department workers in Benghazi to figure out the cause of the attack, not to the fact that four Americans had died. We rate Pence’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pences-false-claim-about-clintons-role-and-re/

Newt Gingrich says Hillary Clinton wants to increase number of Syrian refugees by 500 percent
","On the third night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich scoffed at Hillary Clinton’s willingness to accept a substantial amount of refugees from war-torn Syria into the United States. ""We know that Hillary Clinton and President Obama lie to the American people when they say they can safely screen the Syrian refugees. They cannot,"" Gingrich said. ""And yet Hillary wants to increase the number by 500 percent. Clinton has been called out on this before — by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The basis for the claim stems from a Sept. 20, 2015, interview with Clinton on CBS' Face the Nation. Host John Dickerson asked Clinton if President Barack Obama’s plan to increase the number of Syrians allowed in the country to 10,000 was enough. (The United States had accepted about 2,000 by 2015.) Clinton said she would like to see even more refugees allowed into the country — suggesting as much as a 550 percent increase. ""Look, we’re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more,"" Clinton said, ""and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in."" In a speech in December 2015, Clinton said, ""It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones."" She also said there had to be vigilant screening and vetting of refugees from Syria and that such process historically takes up to two years. The estimated wait checks out. Gingrich says the government cannot adequately screen Syrian refugees. The refugees admissions process actually involves the FBI as well as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. FBI director James Comey has said there are challenges and could be gaps in any admissions process of refugees from a conflict zone. However, Gingrich failed to acknowledge the lengthy process before any refugee is admitted into the United States that includes in-person interviews, health screenings and referrals by nongovernmental agencies. (Read more about Syrian refugees in our PolitiFact Sheet.) Our ruling Gingrich said Clinton ""wants to increase the number (of Syrian refugees) by 500 percent."" Clinton has said she’d like the country to move from 10,000 Syrian refugees under Obama’s plan to 65,000, an increase that could be as high as 550 percent. Gingrich said the United States cannot screen the additional refugees, but that ignores the average screening process of one to two years and involving in-person interviews and NGO referrals. With that caveat, we rate Gingrich’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea5b1b52-e987-468b-9364-7878b1087b5b",/factchecks/2016/jul/21/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-clinton-wants-increase-number-syrian/

Mike Pence says there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before
","In his first major speech as the 2016 Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence repeated a talking point about his economic record back home. ""There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before,"" Pence said. That’s similar to a comment Pence had made just over a week earlier, shortly before Trump chose him as his running mate. The statistic isn’t as meaningful as it sounds. Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online:  However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. Economists agree that the most accurate way to analyze a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number. Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim. As a general rule, ""focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading,"" Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed, told us when we looked at Pence’s earlier comment. Let’s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working. According to the Census Bureau’s 2015 population estimate — the most recent one available — Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year. By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- May 2000 -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent. In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana’s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence’s assertion. These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years. Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In 2000, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak. Then there’s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists. Indiana’s current unemployment rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it’s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana’s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here’s a chart going back to 1976:  Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state’s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400. That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend. Our ruling Pence said, ""There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before."" Literally, more Indiana residents are employed now than at any time in the past. But it’s a data point with very little meaning, since, as any statistician will tell you, it doesn’t take into account the size of the state’s population. Looking instead at the percentage of Hoosiers working shows that the percentage was higher during the previous employment peak in 2000. And the widely used unemployment rate — which is even more precise because it is based on the number of residents who are actively looking for a job — has been lower than its current rate over long stretches of recent history. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2078352d-5a91-4bdf-9872-462839fd76b5",/factchecks/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-there-are-more-hoosiers-going-work/

Hugh Hewitt: A million Ohio Democrats voted Republican because of Donald Trump
","Republican radio host and pundit Hugh Hewitt slammed the Democratic party on a July 20 MSNBC panel, charging that the party failed the Rust Belt economically and prompted liberal voters to jump ship. Hewitt was part of a panel that included former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and a former party chairman. ""A million Democrats deserted Howard’s party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year,"" Hewitt said. The 2016 Republican primary was remarkable, given the 17-candidate field. Is Hewitt’s ""million"" figure right? And is Trump the reason behind a massive party switch in the Buckeye State? In Ohio, party affiliation is determined by what ballot a voter requests in a primary election. The voter will continue to be affiliated with that party, unless he or she requests a different party’s ballot in another primary election. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that 5 percent of voters in Ohio who cast ballots in the March 2016 primary switched from the party they were affiliated with in 2012. But many more former Democrats requested Republican ballots than vice-versa. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted released the stats that showed that in total, 1.8 million Ohio voters joined or changed parties by voting last March. The GOP picked up almost a million new voters to its rolls in that primary, but 910,131 of those were previously unaffiliated. According to Husted’s data, 115,762 former Democratic voters swapped for Republican ballots. That’s not a million. We asked some political scientists for their opinions. ""There's an old saying in the social sciences: don't mistake correlation with causality,"" said L. Marvin Overby, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. ""I would be very surprised if the voter changes were motivated by a desire among Democrats to vote for Trump.  It seems more plausible that they opted to identify as Republicans to vote in the GOP primary for (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich and against Trump, especially given that the Democratic presidential primary wasn't very competitive."" Ohio’s donkeys-turned-elephants might have been reacting to Trump’s candidacy, agreed Michael C. Munger of Duke University, but it’s impossible to know for certain. ""Trump did not even win Ohio. Kasich hammered him by 10 percentage points. It would be odd to think of them as Trump voters, then,"" Munger said. He concurred that it makes more sense that former Democrats crossed the aisle to cast votes against Trump. In that case, the phenomenon was due to Trump -- but not to his advantage. We reached out to Hewitt but did not receive a response by the time of this publication.  Our ruling As part of an MSNBC panel, Hewitt said, ""A million Democrats deserted (Howard Dean’s) party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year."" Without polling the Dems-turned-GOP, it’s not possible to know exactly why they switched parties. But data from the secretary of state showed that 115,762 Republican ballots were cast by former Democrats. An impressive number -- but not a million.

Gingrich: Pakistan offers rich ISIS recruiting base
","Newt Gingrich wanted to make clear in his speech at the Republican National Convention that the majority of Muslims are peaceful. But, he said, it only takes a few bad apples ... If even a small percentage of the world’s billion Muslims support violence, ""that is still a giant recruiting base,"" Gingrich said. ""Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably,"" Gingrich said. ""Unfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that’s just one country."" Gingrich has done his math well. A 2015 Pew report found that views of ISIS were ""overwhelmingly negative"" in a survey that included 10 Muslim majority nations. But Pakistan was an outlier. ""One exception was Pakistan, where a majority offered no definite opinion of ISIS,"" the report said. ""Only 28 percent in Pakistan had an unfavorable view of ISIS, and a majority of Pakistanis (62%) had no opinion on the extremist group."" As this chart in the report showed, 9 percent of Pakistanis said they had a favorable view of ISIS. (The question was ""Do you have a ____ opinion of the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS?)    The population of Pakistan was about 199 million in 2015, according to the CIA. The country is 98 percent Muslim. Take 9 percent of the total and you get nearly 18 million people. One could say that just because they have a favorable view of ISIS, that doesn’t mean they would fight for ISIS. Their answers might have been different if they had been asked if they support ISIS, rather than think favorably of them. But Gingrich used the stat to show that the terrorist group enjoyed a large recruiting base. Even if a small fraction of the 9 percent were willing to take up arms or commit acts of terror, that would be a large number. Our ruling Gingrich said that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably and that amounts to 16 million people. There are a some small issues with his statement. He got the numbers right but we don’t know how that might translate into a readiness to commit violence in the name of ISIS. Also, the survey was of all Pakistanis, not just Muslims. However, none of those details undermine Gingrich’s point. The data suggest there is large number of people who are inclined to respond to ISIS’ message. We rate this claim Mostly True. 
Correction, Sept. 12, 2016: This report has been changed to accurately reflect Gingrich’s quote. He said, ""Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably,"" not  ""Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan support ISIS.""

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Phil Ruffin']","
Businessman friend of Donald Trump says he 'always pays his bills promptly'
","Phil Ruffin, a Las Vegas casino magnate, took to the podium at the Republican National Convention on July 20 on behalf of his friend and business associate Donald Trump. At one point in his address, Ruffin said of Trump, ""He always pays his bills promptly. You won't hear that. Promptly, no discounts."" However, that assertion clashes with an extensive investigation by USA Today, which ran a story in June headlined, ""Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills."" Here’s the crux of that USA Today story: ""(We) found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans … who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. ""At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA Today Network, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. ... ""The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether."" One example alleged by USA Today was that of Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr., who had a $400,000 contract with Trump to build several types of furniture for his casinos in Atlantic City in the 1980s. ""The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder,"" USA Today reported. ""Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. ‘That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company … which has been around since my grandfather,’ he said."" Trump and his daughter Ivanka spoke to USA Today for the story, saying that if someone wasn’t paid fully, it was because Trump or his executives were dissatisfied with the work. ""Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,"" Trump told USA Today. ""That’s what the country should be doing."" Trump also acknowledged to Reuters that he sometimes ""renegotiates"" with vendors. ""I'll do that with probably 10 or 15 percent of contractors,"" he told Reuters. USA Today noted that ""Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties."" However, the newspaper added that some cases are of recent vintage. ""Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event,"" the newspaper wrote. ""The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records."" Neither the Trump campaign nor a public relations firm for one of Ruffin’s properties, the Treasure Island casino in Las Vegas, replied to a request for comment for this article. We should note that Ruffin’s prepared remarks differ in a small but important way. According to prepared remarks distributed by the Trump campaign shortly before his speech, Ruffin was supposed to say, ""I believed in him, and for three tough years we worked together to keep (their joint project) afloat. Through it all, Donald always paid his bills promptly, with no discounts."" The italicized sentence from the prepared remarks refers specifically to Ruffin’s personal dealings with Trump on their project in Las Vegas -- a much narrower universe of business dealings than the sweeping statement Ruffin actually offered from the podium in Cleveland. In a case like this, PolitiFact considers the spoken words to be more important, since they are heard by millions of people on live television. And they are contradicted by the USA Today report. Our ruling Ruffin said that Donald Trump ""always pays his bills promptly."" But the USA Today investigation found a large number of lawsuits -- at least 60, plus hundreds of liens, judgments and other filings -- because people have accused Trump of failing to pay for services rendered or products delivered. The complaints even come from law firms that had formerly represented Trump in these types of lawsuits. ""Always"" is a strong word, so if even just a tiny fraction of the cases uncovered by USA Today are accurate, that would be enough to make Ruffin’s statement incorrect.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott is wrong about the U.S. economy not growing
","Republican Gov. Rick Scott likes to be known as the ""jobs governor"" in Florida. Opening the third night of the Republican National Convention, Scott said the United States is struggling on the economic front, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump knows how to make it strong again. ""Let me tell you why this is the time for Donald to be president,"" Scott said. ""A lot of politicians like to give speeches where they say ‘We are at a crossroads.’ That’s not really where we are today. Today America is in a terrible world, record-high debt. Our economy is not growing. Our jobs are going overseas. We’ve allowed our military to decay and we project weakness on the international stage."" Trump made a similar statement about the economy at a Miami debate in March. Trump said, ""GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters,"" which rated False. Our fact-check will focus on Scott’s statement that the economy is ""not growing."" We emailed Scott’s political consultant Wednesday night and did not get a reply by deadline. Economic growth A key way to measure economic growth is the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the sum total of a country’s economic activity. The Bureau of Economic Analysis within the U.S. Department of Commerce posts quarterly and annual GDP data for the United States. According to the data, GDP has grown every year since 2010, between 1.5 and 2.5 percent a year. The last time GDP was negative was in 2009 -- negative 2.8 percent -- amid the recession. So for the past few years, the economy has been growing — maybe just not by as much as Scott would like. To be fair, Scott isn’t alone in wishing growth were higher. As we have previously reported, there’s a common belief among economists that the United States is unlikely to see the rapid growth it experienced during the first few decades after World War II, when the country had fewer international competitors. Former 2016 Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faced skepticism when he laid out a goal for 4 percent growth. Quite a few Republican presidents have served during times of slow growth as well. According to a July 2014 paper by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, GDP growth hovered around 2 percent during the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower; the combined second term of President Richard Nixon and the tenure of his successor President Gerald Ford; and the single term of President George H.W. Bush. And the growth rate for the second term of President George W. Bush was well below 1 percent. We interviewed three experts on the economy who disputed Scott’s claim. In addition to the growing GDP, they mentioned other positive economic signs, such as growing private sector jobs and the decline of the unemployment rate since the end of the recession. ""Certainly the recovery since 2009 has not been as swift as would be ideal, but ‘not growing’ does not seem adequately supported to me,"" said University of California Davis history professor Eric Rauchway. The American economy has been growing since the recovery started in June 2009, said Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard University professor of capital formation and growth who served as a Council of Economic Advisers member in the Bill Clinton administration. ""Growth in GDP since then, while not as strong as we would like, has been steady,"" Frankel said. ""And it has been clearly greater than growth in Europe or Japan."" Our ruling Scott said, ""Our economy is not growing."" The GDP has grown between 1.5 and 2.5 percent each year since 2010. That’s perhaps not the level of growth Scott wants, but it’s misleading to say that the economy isn’t growing.

Donald Trump wrongly blames Hillary Clinton for creation of ISIS
","Donald Trump and his vice presidential candidate Mike Pence gave their first joint interview to 60 Minutes and used the show to point the finger at Hillary Clinton for ISIS. Trump told CBS’s Lesley Stahl that the United States will have to declare war against ISIS -- and he vowed to do it with very few troops on the ground to wipe out ISIS. ""Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies,"" Trump said in an interview that aired July 17. ""She is responsible for ISIS."" Trump has made this claim repeatedly. It’s wrong, and we’ll explain why. The roots of ISIS Trump was referring to Clinton’s actions related to Iraq, Libya and Syria, said Trump spokesman Stephen Miller, who referred us to a previous Trump speech on the topic. The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense. ""She may ‘share some of the blame’ but there is more than enough share to go around. She was in no sense the singular author of the thing,"" Pike said. For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state. It has gone by several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014. Given the timing, Democrats blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots there, said Michael O’Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group. (O’Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.) You could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup. As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign points to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign also points to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya. In 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria in 2011. ""The transition to democracy in Syria has begun, and it's time for Assad to get out of the way,"" she said while secretary of state in August 2011. Regime change in Libya also gave ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" he said. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion."" It’s possible to argue that these factors -- withdrawing from Iraq, the administration’s lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and the decision to intervene in Libya -- contributed to the power of ISIS, said Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor. ""Then Sen. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war could also be seen as contributing the preconditions for the emergence of al-Qaida in Iraq,"" Long said. ""So Trump's argument cannot simply be dismissed out of hand."" However, Clinton was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels and was overruled by Obama and advocated strongly for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011. ""So on both of those points, I don't think it was Clinton leading Obama -- rather, it was the reverse,"" Long said. ""The Libya intervention and the vote for the Iraq war are thus the only points in the argument that actually stand up to scrutiny."" On her vote related to the Iraq war, Clinton was many of many in both parties who supported the intervention advocated by Bush. ""On Libya while this clearly appears to have been a mistake in hindsight it was a fairly minor contribution to the emergence of ISIS, which grew out of the Iraq and Syrian conflict,"" Long said. Our ruling Trump said ""Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies. She is responsible for ISIS."" There were several factors that contributed to the growing power of ISIS, but it’s misleading to pin the responsibility solely on Clinton. For starters, the roots of ISIS trace back to 2004, when Bush was president and before Clinton was Obama’s secretary of state. She did vote to authorize force in Iraq in 2002 while a senator, but that was advocated by the Bush administration and the vast majority of senators.

Darryl Glenn: 'Neighborhoods have become more violent' under Obama's watch
","U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn, a Colorado Republican, chided President Barack Obama that violent crime had escalated under his presidency during Glenn’s Monday night speech at the Republican National Convention.   ""Here's some more facts, Mr. President. Neighborhoods have become more violent under your watch,"" Glenn said. But is that true? Has violent crime worsened in neighborhoods during Obama’s tenure? Law enforcement experts warn against politicians distorting crime trends in an effort to grab voters' attention. Anticipating that speakers would focus on the convention’s first day theme -- ""Make America Safe Again"" -- the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University predicted, ""Their narrative will likely parallel recent statements from presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has said, 'Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse.'""  ""The claim is not supported by data. Nationally, crime has dropped 23 percent since 2006,"" the Brennan Center said, citing an analysis it released last month. The Brennan Center advocates for what are generally considered liberal policies, including reforms to reduce the prison population and increase rights for voters. Glenn and other speakers, including former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (""It’s time to make America safe again""), pounded the national security theme. But experts countered with a dose of a reality, saying crime rates remain at a historic low. Let’s take at a closer look at Glenn's claim. Violent crime -- which includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available.  We also looked at the other widely used data set -- the National Crime Victimization Survey, collected by the Justice Department. Here, the trend looks quite similar:  But there was a spike in violent crime rates in the first six months of 2015 that drew news coverage. In January 2016, the FBI released a Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report that showed overall increases in the number of violent crimes reported for the first six months of 2015 when compared with figures for the same period of 2014. The number of rapes increased 9.6 percent, murders increased 6.2 percent and aggravated assaults increased 2.3 percent. Property crimes were down. The New York Times reported in August 2015 that at least 35 cities were reporting increases in murders, violent crime or both. But the Times later issued a clarifying editorial titled ""False Alarms About a National Crime Wave."" It pointed to ""unmistakable longer-term trends: The rate of violent crime, including murder, has been going down for a quarter-century, and is at its lowest in decades. On average, it is half of what it was in 1990, and in some places even lower."" In April, the Brennan Center issued a final analysis on 2015 trends, saying that overall crime rates in America's 30 largest cities were nearly identical from 2014 to 2015. Crime declined over that time period by 0.1 percent. ""The data show that crime rates remain at historic lows nationally, despite recent upticks in a handful of cities,"" the report said. Violent crime rose ""slightly,"" by 3.1 percent, the report said, pointing out that aggravated assaults in Los Angeles accounted for more than half of the national rise in violent crime. Yet the report noted: ""The 2015 murder rate rose by 13.2 percent in the 30 largest cities, with 19 cities seeing increases and 6 decreases."" The murder rate continues to rise in some some cities. Chicago, a city plagued by gang violence, had 332 murders through July 10 -- a 43 percent jump over the same period last year, according to the Chicago Police Department. One expert cautioned against the pitfalls of reading too much into a snapshot of crime figures. ""You need to take six months of crime data, not just with a grain of salt but the entire shaker,"" said James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. ""I can point to situations where crime patterns seen for the first six months are reversed once the year is over. Because six months is a fairly narrow window of time."" Fox also questioned Glenn’s claim. ""If (Glenn) is pointing at the first six months of 2015 as evidence of what happened during Obama's watch, then clearly you don't judge eight years (of his presidency) on half a year,"" Fox said. ""We are at relatively low crime levels, and it would be incorrect to say that street violence has gotten worse under Obama's watch."" Fox suspects the idea of rising crime is steeped more in anecdotal news reports than hard statistical trends. We asked Glenn about PolitiFact’s findings that violent crime has steadily declined in recent decades. ""Well, when you're saying the crime rate ... we're in a position right now where I think people would argue whether or not the crime rate has gone down,"" Glenn said in an interview after his speech. He did not cite any specifics about national or neighborhood crime statistics. We'll also note that by citing Obama’s ""watch,"" Glenn seems to suggest that he bears some blame for rising crime. However, while some presidential policies may contribute to increases or declines in crime, they are only one of many factors that shape how much crime there is in the nation, including demographics, gang warfare, and broader economic trends. Our ruling Glenn said, ""Neighborhoods have become more violent under your watch,"" referring to President Obama. Overall, violent crime trends have been falling almost continuously for roughly a quarter-century. Glenn has a point that violent crime has increased in some neighborhoods. The 2015 murder rate rose by 13.2 percent in the nation's 30 largest cities -- with three cities accounting for more than half of the national increase in murders.  One expert said it was ""inaccurate"" for Glenn to claim violent neighborhood crime has increased during Obama's ""watch,"" because violent crime overall has declined during his eight years as president. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/719b61b9-f913-4163-b3dc-c29d123ef4cb",/factchecks/2016/jul/20/darryl-glenn/darryl-glenn-says-neighborhoods-have-become-more-v/

PA Congressman’s misleading claim: Hillary Clinton trusted by ‘virtually’ no one
","Hillary Clinton has long had trust issues -- as in, voters tell pollsters her perceived lack of honesty is one of the reasons they’d avoid casting a vote for her. Her general election opponent Donald Trump has taken advantage of it and branded her ""Crooked Hillary,"" whether it’s true or not. But how severe are Clinton’s trust issues? For Congressman Tom Marino, one of Trump’s biggest backers in Pennsylvania, it’s apparently an all or nothing proposition -- almost no one trusts her, if what he said Monday during a Pennsylvania GOP breakfast at the Republican National Convention is any indication. ""Secretary Clinton has so much baggage that the luggage industry could name a line of suitcases after her,"" Marino, R-10th District, said during the breakfast, according to PennLive. ""She's not trusted -- virtually at all."" Clinton has admitted that she has concerns that voters don’t think she’s honest. But the idea that she’s not trusted ""virtually at all"" seemed a little off. How do you measure trust? And is that number at or close to zero? Here’s what we could find. Believe it or not, lots of national and state polls ask voters about whether or not they perceive candidates to be honest or trustworthy, largely because it’s one of the character traits voters consider most. A Quinnipiac poll from late June showed 28 percent of voters said honesty and trustworthiness was the most important character trait, the highest rate of any trait including integrity and leadership. And though more voters roundly trust Clinton over Trump in areas like foreign policy and leadership experience, they don’t trust her as a person as much as they do him. A poll commissioned by the Washington Post and ABC in March found only 37 percent of voters found Clinton to be honest and trustworthy. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll from June showed 69 percent of voters were concerned Clinton had a reputation of dishonesty. And a CBS poll from around the same time 63 percent of voters found Clinton to be dishonest. These ratings are just a few points higher than Trump’s. And yes, Trump leads Clinton in the forthcoming category. Only a third of voters think Clinton says what she means while more than half of voters think Trump does. If, during his GOP breakfast speech, Marino was talking about Republicans trusting Clinton, he’s in luck: That Quinnipiac poll from late June shows just 6 percent of Republicans polled think Clinton is trustworthy. But Marino’s camp didn’t respond to a request for comment. Voter perception of Clinton’s trustworthiness started dwindling even during her days as First Lady following the Whitewater scandal, a fraud investigation into the real estate investments the Clintons made while Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. Neither Clinton ever faced charges over it, but their close associates did. Today, the controversy over the email server she used while Secretary of State appears to be what’s contributing to voters’ lack of trust. That’s been compounded since FBI Director James Comey directly contradicted statements Clinton made about what was sent on the server during a press conference announcing that charges wouldn’t be filed against the presidential candidate. Michael Hagen, an associate professor at Temple University and a former director of the Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said the email situation has had a substantial impact on the percentage of the electorate that regards her as dishonest and untrustworthy, driving those numbers up to about three in five voters. ""There are even a number of Democrats who have reservations about her trustworthiness,"" Hagen said, noting that trustworthiness is ""important to lots of folks, but it’s not the only thing that people are talking about or concerned about."" Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. But she knows this is hurting her. She’s admitted that she has work to do to bring back voters in the ""honesty"" arena, but has also blamed decades of facing criticism from the right. ""I take this seriously, as someone who is asking for your votes, and I personally know I have work to do on this point,"" she said during a talk in June, according to The Washington Post. ""A lot of people tell pollsters they don't trust me. I don't like hearing that, and I've thought a lot about what's behind it… You know you hear 25 years worth of wild accusations, anyone could start to wonder."" Whether they’re wild accusations or not, the big news that turns into scandals that revolve around Clinton seem to have a different effect on voters perception of trustworthiness compared to a steady drumbeat of criticism over statements made by Trump. While most of Clinton’s statements rated by PolitiFact have been True or Mostly True, the majority of Trump’s have been False or Pants on Fire. Hagen said scandal sticks in the minds of voters more than those daily stories criticizing Trump’s dishonesty. ""Fact-checking stories appear inside newspapers,"" he said, ""but scandals make front-page headlines."" Our Ruling Marino said with regard to Clinton: ""She's not trusted -- virtually at all."" This is clearly hyperbole when it comes to all voters, but not far from the truth when looking at the polling of Republican voters. Clinton's admitted herself that she's struggled when it comes to voters trusting her, so the sentiment of this claim makes sense. Still, to say she’s not trusted ""virtually at all"" isn’t accurate. We rate the claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2016/jul/20/tom-marino/pa-congressmans-claim-hillary-clinton-trusted-virt/

Walker: 'For decades, the state’s gas tax has been among the highest in the nation'
","Gov. Scott Walker has been adamant that he does not want to increase taxes to fund highway projects, unless cuts are made elsewhere in the state budget. Revenue from the tax has been stagnant in recent years and many road projects have been delayed due to financial woes.That led the state in November 2015 to approve $350 million in borrowing over two years. In a June 27, 2016, letter to Department of Transportation officials, Walker opposed raising gas taxes to fund infrastructure upgrades. Part of his reasoning was that Wisconsin residents already pay too much in taxes. ""For decades, the state’s gas tax has been among the highest in the nation,"" Walker wrote. Let’s see if Walker is right. About gas taxes Gas taxes in the state help fund highway and roadway projects. Many frame the tax as a pay-for-use fee, meaning those who use the roads are shouldering the bulk of the cost of maintaining them. It’s an excise tax, which means the tax is paid when the purchase is made. The gas tax is included in the posted price at fuel stations. A gas tax was introduced in Wisconsin in 1925. At the time, the highway system was funded through license registrations and property taxes. The initial tax was two-cents per gallon and in 1931 increased to four cents. Beginning in 1985, legislators changed the system so the gas tax would be adjusted annually, based on the Consumer Price Index. The idea was for it to match inflation. At the time, the tax was 16.5 cents per gallon. In 2005, the legislature stopped the annual adjustment and the last increase to the tax was made in 2006. Now, the state taxes 30.9 cents on each gallon of gas. Among the highest in nation? As of the most recent report from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Wisconsin drivers are taxed 51.3 cents per gallon for all gas purchased. Of that, 30.9 cents per gallon goes toward the state and the rest goes to the federal government. In comparison, the national average for state taxes on gasoline sales is 21.9 cents per gallon -- about 9 cents lower than in Wisconsin. That places the state in seventh for highest gas taxes. The state with the highest gas taxes -- California -- tacks on 39.5 cents per gallon to gas prices. So, for the most recent year, Walker’s claim is on target. The state’s gas taxes are ""among the highest in the nation."" How about ""for decades""?   Walker’s team pointed us to gas tax numbers from the Federal Highway Administration.The government agency, part of the Transportation Department, compiles and shares information on state gas taxes. They cited six years in particular -- 1980, 1981, 1986, 1999, 2000, 2014.   Year Tax rate (cents per gallon) Rank 1980 9 16 1981 13 8 1986 17.5 3 1999 25.4 5 2000 25.8 5 2014 30.9 7 For five of the years, Wisconsin was in the top eight. For three years, it broke into the top five. But we wondered if Walker’s team cherry picked those years, so we checked gas tax rates for all 50 states from 1980 to the present. After ranking 16th in 1980, Wisconsin gas tax rate has consistently been among the top 10 highest in the nation for more than 30 years. The state topped the ranking in 1988. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the state’s taxes ranked among the top five highest, ranking second in 2003 and 2004. Our rating In a letter to transportation officials, Walker wrote ""For decades, the state’s gas tax has been among the highest in the nation."" He backed up his claims with federal data showing Wisconsin has been among the top 10 states for the highest gas taxes in the nation for more than 30 years, even topping the chart in 1988. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/20/scott-walker/walker-decades-states-gas-tax-has-been-among-highe/

Congressman repeats Mostly True claim: Donald Trump ‘rooted for the housing crisis’
"," During Donald Trump’s recent fundraising trip to San Diego, Democratic Congressman Scott Peters had some harsh words for the GOP nominee. ""His economic policies are dangerous,"" Peters, who represents much of 'America's Finest City,' told reporters on a conference call. ""He will say or do anything that benefits him."" We can’t fact check that statement because it’s the congressman’s opinion. But Peters repeated one critique that’s open to examination: ""This is a guy,"" he said of Trump, ""who rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it.""  Congressman Scott Peters, D-San Diego, campaigns at a town hall in October 2014. AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi Hillary Clinton lodged the same attack in a May campaign video. ""In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash,"" the ad says, showing a picture of Trump giving two thumbs up. The ad goes on to list consequences from the Great Recession, which peaked in 2008. It lists 9 million jobs lost and 5 million families who lost their homes.  This campaign ad from Hillary For America includes 2006 audio from Donald Trump about the housing market. That's followed by audio, identified as being from 2006, of Trump saying, ""I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy ... If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money."" ""And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen,"" the ad contends. Peters’ statement that Trump ""rooted for the housing crisis,"" clearly draws on the Clinton ad. His office referred us to the Democratic National Committee, which supplied the Clinton ad with Trump’s ""I sort of hope that happens"" audio. Our national PolitiFact team checked the original claim made in May by the Clinton ad and rated it Mostly True. Here’s why: ""I sort of hope that happens"" Trump’s statement comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former ""students"" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a ""bubble"" that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, ""There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?"" ""Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy,"" he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. ""If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money."" Whether the ""bubble burst"" that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a ""crash,"" especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate. Trump, in the audiobook, adds: ""At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit."" Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong. A year later, in 2007, Trump was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. ""People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,"" he told the paper. ""I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets."" The Trump campaign didn't respond to PolitiFact's emails. Our ruling Rep. Scott Peters, D-CA, said Donald Trump ""rooted for the housing crisis, because he knew he could make money off of it."" His statement parallels a claim in Hillary Clinton’s May campaign ad: ""In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash."" Trump said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later. What's far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad, or a ""housing crisis,"" as suggested by Peters. In fact, Trump’s comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show he didn't envision the financial meltdown that followed.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Did Hillary Clinton flip-flop on Iran nuclear enrichment?
","On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Hillary Clinton of bending with the political wind on key issues. ""Hillary has changed her positions so many times it’s impossible to tell where conviction ends and ambition begins,"" McConnell said. ""In 2010, she said Iran could enrich uranium. In 2014 she said she’s always argued against it."" We wanted to verify that Clinton indeed held one view in 2010 and another in 2014. The context for McConnell’s statement is the decade-long push to get Iran off the path of building nuclear warheads. The United Nations Security Council had been trying since the mid 2000s to strike a deal with Iran. The council’s first demand was that Iran freeze the enrichment of uranium. Iran ignored that. It was only after stiff sanctions began to hit Iran hard in 2011 that negotiations moved forward. But sanctions alone didn’t break the logjam. In 2012, the United States, with Clinton as secretary of state, opened the door to allowing Iran to continue to enrich uranium on a much more limited scale than it had before. That ultimately became part of the deal. Now for what Clinton has said about Iran and enrichment. Clinton and her positions McConnell’s Senate campaign focused on two news reports. On the surface, the news reports appear to prove McConnell’s case. But a closer read reveals flaws in contrasting the two statements, an expert told us. One, from the BBC in December 2010, paraphrased Clinton as saying that under the right conditions, in the future, Iran might be allowed to enrich uranium. ""We told them that they are entitled to the peaceful use of civil nuclear energy,"" Clinton is quoted as saying in the article. ""Peaceful use"" could mean either enriching uranium domestically or importing nuclear fuel produced somewhere else. The McConnell campaign contrasts that comment with a 2014 interview in The Atlantic — before any deal was struck with Iran — where Clinton seemed to take a tougher line. ""I've always been in the camp that held that they (Iran) did not have a right to enrichment,"" she told The Atlantic. ""Contrary to their claim, there is no such thing as a right to enrich. This is absolutely unfounded."" The key here is that Clinton is talking about whether Iran had a legal right to enrich its own nuclear fuel. But Clinton continued, ""I think it's important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there cannot be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran. The preference would be no enrichment. The potential fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out. So, little or no enrichment has always been my position."" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told us Clinton was talking about two different things. (Kimball’s group favors the deal with Iran.) ""The first time (in 2010), she is saying that it is conceivable that Iran might be allowed to enrich fuel for the peaceful use of nuclear energy,"" Kimball said. ""In the second, she’s addressing whether there is a legal right to enrich. And there is no legal right to enrichment."" McConnell’s point rests on the idea that Clinton was saying something different in 2014 than she said in 2010. But we found examples that suggest he was mixing a shift in tone with a shift in policy. In March 2011 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton was asked specifically if Iran had a right to enrich uranium. ""It has been our position that, under very strict conditions, Iran would sometime in the future, having responded to the international community’s concerns and irreversibly shut down its nuclear weapons program, have such a right under IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspection."" So in her 2011 testimony, Clinton spoke of allowing enrichment ""under very strict conditions."" In 2014, Clinton called for a ""clear set of restrictions on Iran"" and with those, the ""fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out."" (""Break out"" here means a surprise restart of a nuclear weapons program in Iran.) The words are not identical, but there is little difference in meaning. There is some ambiguity in how she talks about Iran’s rights. Kimball put that into the context of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It allows countries to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes. It doesn’t specifically give them the right to enrich their own uranium. Nor does it forbid it. In 2014, Clinton said definitively that Iran had no legal right to enrichment. In her 2011 testimony, she described a conditional right, and the conditions would be no nuclear weapons program and international inspections. Our ruling McConnell said that Clinton changed her views on allowing Iran to enrich uranium. He claimed that she was open to allowing enrichment in 2010, and then in 2014, denied that she was ever open to the idea. A full reading shows that in 2014, Clinton was talking about whether Iran enjoyed a legal right to enrichment, and she said it did not. An arms control expert we reached agreed that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that Iran signed does not grant that right. In addition, in that 2014 interview, Clinton did not reject the idea that through negotiations, Iran might be allowed to enrich uranium. The conditions she described in 2014 are similar to the ones in a 2010 interview with the BBC and even more like her House testimony just a few months later in 2011. In 2011, she called for enrichment ""under very strict conditions."" In 2014, she said allowing enrichment would be a fallback position under ""a clear set of restrictions."" The words are not identical, but there’s not enough here to say she changed her position.

Video does not provide evidence of election fraud in Detroit
","An article from the conservative news website The Gateway Pundit claims that a video  from the TCF Center where Detroit election workers counted absentee ballots cast by the city’s voters ""shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline."" The article claims that the video is ""proof of fraud in Detroit."" The video appears to show a white van at the TCF Center early in the morning on Nov. 4 containing ballots that were unloaded and brought into the counting room at the TCF Center. There is no evidence of anything nefarious. In Michigan, voters had until 8 p.m. on Election Day to return absentee ballots. The deadline was for casting ballots, not delivering or counting them. A sworn affidavit written by Christopher Thomas, the former Michigan Director of Elections who worked at the TCF Center, in response to a lawsuit against the city says that no late-arriving ballots were ever counted. ""No absentee ballots received after the deadline of 8 p.m. on November 3, 2020, were received by or processed at the TCF Center. Only ballots received by the deadline were processed,"" Thomas wrote. Many Republican challengers present at the TCF Center have said that they observed ballots being dropped off at the TCF Center in the middle of the night. Thomas wrote that their accounts do not support the claim that thousands of ballots cast after the 8 p.m. deadline were counted. Detroit voters could return absentee ballots by mail to the clerk’s office, in-person or utilize one of the city’s many ballot drop boxes until that deadline. Ballots were collected until 8 p.m. on election night after which point all ballots were returned and processed by the clerk’s staff. The staff then verified signatures at the Department of Elections. Only after ballots were validated were they delivered to the TCF Center for election workers to process and tabulate them. Shane Trejo, a writer for the right-wing website Big League Politics, told the Gateway Pundit that he was at the TCF Center where he said he witnessed thousands of ballots being unloaded early Wednesday morning. ""There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 a.m., well after the 8:00 p.m. deadline for ballots to show up."" The 8 p.m. deadline was for voters to return ballots, not for ballots to be delivered to the TCF Center. Trejo has previously made false claims of election fraud in Detroit, prompting Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to ask Trejo to take down misleading videos he posted. In his affidavit, Thomas explained that early in the morning on Wednesday, approximately 16,000 ballots in 45 trays containing approximately 350 ballots each were delivered in a white van used by the city. ""The ballots delivered to the TCF Center had been verified by the City Clerk’s staff prior to delivery in a process prescribed by Michigan law. … It would have been impossible for any election worker at the TCF Center to count or process a ballot for someone who was not an eligible voter or whose ballot was not received by the 8:00 p.m. deadline on November 3, 2020,"" Thomas wrote. In his opinion in the lawsuit against the city denying the request to delay the certification of the election, Wayne County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Kenny determined that the lawsuit’s account of fraud and misconduct — including its assertion that late-arriving ballots were illegally counted — was ""incorrect and not credible."" An article by the Gateway Pundit claims that a ""newly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline."" Detroit election officials have confirmed that ballots were delivered to the TCF Center early Wednesday morning but that those ballots met the 8 p.m. deadline for voters to return them and had been verified by the city clerk’s office as legally cast.

No evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations caused deaths of senior citizens
","Suggesting that coronavirus vaccinations killed 86-year-old Hank Aaron and elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, an article widely shared on Facebook claims that ""seniors"" around the world died soon after getting vaccinated, and that their cause of death was listed as natural. ""Seniors dying after COVID vaccine labeled as natural causes,"" reads the headline of the article by Dr. Joseph Mercola, a major funder of anti-vaccine efforts. Mercola’s work has come under criticism before from federal agencies and others within the medical community.  The full article, which requires a registration to view, begins: ""Around the world, reports are pouring in of people dying shortly after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. … Ironically, when seniors die before vaccination, it’s due to COVID-19 and something must be done to prevent it, but when they die after vaccination, they die of natural causes and no preventive action is necessary."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article relies on evidentiary assertions that have been widely discredited before. Let’s look.  The article says the death Jan. 22 of Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, is notable because he died 17 days after he chose to be vaccinated publicly in hope that other Black people would get the shot.  But the Fulton County (Ga.) Medical Examiner’s office said Aaron’s cause of death was natural and not linked to the vaccine. We rated as False a claim that said otherwise.

But vaccinations began Jan. 9 and by Jan. 17, the article claimed, ""the total death toll had suddenly skyrocketed to 45,"" with most of the people who died during that period being in their 80s or 90s.  A Reuters fact-check said a claim that coronavirus deaths in Gibraltar have been caused by the vaccine and not the virus is false, saying there is no evidence linking the deaths to the vaccine. Full Fact reached the same conclusion. The government said in a statement Jan. 27 that 11,073 people had received a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and none had died as a result of receiving it. Six people between the ages of 70 and 100 who died after receiving the vaccine apparently contracted COVID-19 before being vaccinated, but testing did not detect it, according to the statement. In a Feb. 1 announcement, the government encouraged people over age 60 to be vaccinated, noting that ""we have offered the vaccine to almost everyone over the age of 60.""

All occurred among nursing home residents over age 70 within 12 days of vaccination.  ""Many of these reports state that no link to vaccination is suspected. The fact that some nursing home residents die soon after being vaccinated does not mean that there is a causal relationship,"" the report said.  ""Every day, an average of 45 people die in Norwegian nursing homes or other similar institutions. It is therefore to be expected that deaths will occur soon after vaccination, without there necessarily being any causal link to the vaccine.""  The agency also said in the report: ""The benefits of administering the vaccine are considered to outweigh any possible risks."" A COVID-19 subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, an advisory body to the World Health Organization, reviewed information on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals in Europe who had received the Pfizer vaccine.  In a statement Jan. 22, the subcommittee said, ""The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events."" An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that seniors died soon after getting a COVID-19 vaccination and their cause of death was improperly listed as natural. The article cited the deaths of 86-year-old Hank Aaron and several dozen elderly people in Gibraltar and Norway, all of whom died within a couple of weeks of receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.  There is no evidence that the vaccines caused any of the deaths. Aaron’s death was ruled natural, and authorities in Gibraltar and Norway said none of the deaths of elderly people they investigated were caused by the vaccines.

Democratic ad goes too far in tying Penn. Congressman to Trump and QAnon
","House Democrats are trying to hang the QAnon label around the necks of as many Republicans as possible. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene gave Democrats their moment. The Georgia Republican has praised QAnon and its baseless premise that former President Donald Trump was secretly battling a global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles. As House Republicans tangled over how to deal with Greene, Democratic leaders kept QAnon front and center. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a press release as ""Q-Calif.,"" in place of the conventional ""R-Calif."" When Republicans declined to strip Greene of her committee assignments, Democrats (along with 11 Republicans) broke with precedent and voted to remove her themselves. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee unveiled what it called the first ads in the 2022 midterm elections. It targeted seven Republicans, along with McCarthy, as ""too weak to stand up to President Trump and the QAnon mob."" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., was on the DCCC’s list. The ad featured shots of the mob, many under the QAnon banner, attacking the Capitol. ""Republicans like Brian Fitzpatrick voted to protect Trump letting the QAnon mob win,"" the Feb. 2 ad said. ""Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick should have stood with us, but he was a coward. He stood with Trump and the lies. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. He stood with Q, not you."" Fitzpatrick won reelection easily in a largely suburban district outside Philadelphia. But Joe Biden carried it with 53% of the vote, a possible reason for Democrats to target the seat. The ad’s core accuracy problem is that while Fitzpatrick in January voted against impeaching Trump, he introduced a resolution to censure the then-president. Months prior, he condemned the QAnon theory in a resolution that won bipartisan support. In September 2020, Fitzpatrick joined two Democrats and two Republicans to cosponsor a House resolution that rejected QAnon and all it stood for. It condemned QAnon for spreading its unfounded belief in a pedophilia ring, and for how it ""expanded to embrace virtually every popular conspiracy theory of the last several decades, from questioning the truth about the September 11th terrorist attacks, to believing in alien landings, to denying the safety of vaccines."" The resolution noted that the FBI had determined that QAnon likely motivated domestic terrorists. It said QAnon beliefs ""undermine trust in America’s democratic institutions, encourage rejection of objective reality, and deepen our Nation’s political polarization."" The measure passed Oct. 2 on a 371-18 vote. Fitzpatrick did not support impeaching Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol. He said impeachment would throttle any hope of unity to help the nation deal with its problem. But he did press for a resolution that would put Congress on record as condemning ""his reprehensible conduct which led to the riots at our nation’s Capitol."" The resolution blamed Trump for his false claim that ‘‘we won this election, and we won it by a landslide."" It said Trump’s words ""encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol."" It said Trump had betrayed his trust as president, and ""threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government."" Fitzpatrick offered the resolution along with six other Republican members, but the measure went no further. Fitzpatrick voted against impeachment. Whatever his reason, the vote strengthened Trump’s hand. For the DCCC, this vote was telling. ""Congressman Fitzpatrick had an opportunity to join 10 of his Republican colleagues and vote for the bipartisan articles of impeachment that held President Trump accountable,"" said DCCC communications director Cole Leitner. ""Instead he caved to his president, and now he owns that vote."" Leiter argued that Fitzpatrick’s actions calling for opposition to QAnon and censure of Trump don’t carry the same weight as impeachment. The condemnation of QAnon was non-binding, and the censure of Trump was stillborn, he said. By contrast, the impeachment vote was a binding resolution of constitutional importance. We reached out to Fitzpatrick’s office and did not hear back. A Democratic ad said Fitzpatrick ""stood with Trump and the lies… He stood with QAnon, not you.""  Fitzpatrick’s vote against impeachment carried the most legal heft of any of his actions. Regardless of whether Fitzpatrick saw it as supporting Trump, his vote fell on the plus side of the ledger for Trump.  But Fitzpatrick publicly criticized Trump. He spoke against the lies of election fraud. He also publicly condemned QAnon. The claim has an element of truth, but mistates other facts.

Sen. Rick Scott misrepresents COVID-19’s toll on state finances
","A fundamental disagreement over the latest COVID-19 relief plan centers on aid to states, cities and counties. Democrats plan to include about $350 billion in aid, and Republicans argue that not only is the money unnecessary, it’s just a way to reward to liberal states. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said Democrats are lying about the need. ""States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections,"" Scott said in a Feb. 1 statement. ""Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12% compared to 2019, and 21 of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois."" Is the revenue picture as rosy as Scott makes it out to be? One study partially backs up Scott’s numbers, but he made some errors. Other compilations of state financial reports show the situation is worse than he presents. And if it weren’t for one state — California — the numbers would look even more dire. Scott’s own state, Florida, was among the biggest revenue losers. Scott’s staff pointed to a J.P. Morgan weekly market report. The investment bank’s analysts aimed to give bond investors a sense of the ability of states to repay bonds. Scott drew on that work virtually word for word.  He accurately reflected the findings that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019, and 21 of 47 states show positive year-over-year growth in tax receipts. (The study had a full-year of data on 37 states, and 11 months for another 10.) But Scott proceeded to muddle the numbers. After noting that revenues rose in 21 states, he then said ""over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York and Illinois."" Clearly, 21 is fewer than half of the 50 states. The first statistic he cited in his claim — 21 — relates to total tax revenues. The second — half of states — relates to personal income taxes alone. Scott failed to note the difference. The J.P. Morgan report said personal income tax revenues rose in over half of the states where it had data, including the three states Scott named. But in terms of total revenues, only California saw its numbers go up. New York was down 1.5% and Illinois was down 0.9%.  Half a dozen states suffered far deeper revenue drops. The worst hit include Nevada (-13%), North Dakota (-9.7%), Florida (-7.9%), Texas (-6.8%), West Virginia (-6.8%) and Oklahoma (-6.7%).  The J.P. Morgan report’s time frame bears a mention. It includes two full months in 2020 before the coronavirus cratered the economy. Other research gives a window into the virus’ fiscal impact in the pandemic months between March and December. Based on budget reports from 46 states, researcher Lucy Dadayan at the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, D.C., told us that from March through December, revenues from personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes fell by 1.6% from the same period a year earlier. That decline might seem small, but it is more than 10 times larger than the 0.12% Scott referred to. In raw dollars, it represents $12.6 billion in lost revenue. Aggregate numbers conceal as much as they reveal, and California was an outlier with a hefty effect on the overall numbers. Thanks to a variety of factors, including large year-end bonuses and massive tax withholding tied to initial stock offerings of companies like Airbnb, California’s revenues shot up 26.5% in December alone. That was enough to make the national picture look considerably better. When Dadayan pulled the Golden State out of the equation, total revenues across the remaining states were down 2%. That’s 25% worse than when California was included. There are other ways to measure the fiscal impact of COVID-19. The National Association of State Budget Officers gets information from all 50 states, but those numbers are for fiscal, not calendar, years. In most cases, that runs from July through June. The time frame is different, but the numbers are similar to Dadayan’s figures. In their fiscal years that ended in 2020, states collected $14 billion less than the year before. And in their budgets for fiscal year 2021, states factored in an additional decline of $39 billion, for a total reduction of $53 billion over the two years. Dadayan said that before the coronavirus, accounting for population and economic growth, states had planned on a rise of about 5% in revenues each year. The National Association of State Budget Officers said that compared with those pre-COVID-19 budget forecasts, revenues will be down by $135 billion. To help close part of the gap, states drew down their emergency funds by $12.2 billion. Scott’s focus on how much money states are collecting leaves out half the fiscal picture — the spending side. In the face of falling revenues, states cut spending on schools, roads and many other areas. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported that education spending fell by $7.4 billion. Another $5.6 billion came from a range of programs, including public safety, the judiciary, environmental protection and aid to local governments. Modest declines in state revenue can have more pronounced effects on county and city budgets that rely on state aid. The Democratic plan that Scott criticized would also send aid to cities and counties.  A survey of county officials during the summer found most counties were seeing budget shortfalls, and nearly three-quarters of them were holding back on capital spending and county services. The National League of Cities reported that overall city revenues have fallen 21% since the start of the pandemic, while expenses have risen 17%. Chicago alone reported a nearly $800 million general fund deficit at the end of August. Dadayan said the focus on state revenues ""misses the fiscal stress on local governments, which is a lot bigger compared to state revenue shortfalls."" She added that cities are looking at budget gaps estimated at more than $90 billion. Scott said states across the country are seeing increases in revenue with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019. He also said that over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois. Scott faithfully reflects a report from J.P. Morgan in terms of the 0.12% overall decline, but he went astray when talking about states with higher revenues, particularly the three states he named. The J.P. Morgan report said revenues grew only in California. They fell in New York and Illinois. Scott’s numbers included two months before the pandemic began. Focusing on the pandemic months of March through December, revenues fell about 10 times more than Scott said. He also limited his view of fiscal health to state revenues. Factoring in spending cuts, and impacts on city and county finances, the picture is much worse. Scott used a report that gave a limited view of a broader fiscal landscape, and misread an element in the report itself. The information he left out would leave a reader with a different impression. That matches our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/feb/05/rick-scott/sen-rick-scott-misrepresents-covid-19s-toll-state-/

Experts credit COVID-19 response for sharp decline in flu
","This headline on an article widely shared on Facebook seemed to drip with sarcasm: ""A Miracle! Only 23 Americans Tested Positive for Flu Last Week Compared to 14,657 Cases Reported Last Year at Same Time."" The Jan. 31 article from Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, started by asking: ""Do you ever get the feeling you’re being lied to?"" Then it claimed that the number of COVID-19 deaths has been ""over-inflated,"" and it questioned whether the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using ""statistical tricks"" in reporting flu cases. A post sharing the article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve examined and debunked several claims suggesting there have been intentional overcounts of  COVID-19 cases, and we thought this claim about flu cases deserved a closer look. Public health experts see a connection between the COVID-19 and flu case numbers, but not the one the article implies. First the numbers, according to a CDC report on Jan. 16, 2021: For the week ended Jan. 16, of the 21,244 flu tests tracked by the CDC, 23 specimens, or 0.1%, tested positive. For the season to that point — 40 weeks, dating back to Sept. 27 — there were 1,159 positive specimens, or 0.2% of the total tested.  ""Flu activity is unusually low at this time but may increase in the coming months,"" the CDC said in the report. More Week 2 results were released Feb. 5. The new totals show 62 of 38,572 specimens, or 0.16%, tested positive for flu. The headline we’re checking appears to take its second number from a different source: an article on Weather.com. That article compared the 23 cases to 14,657 positive flu tests — a rate of 29.6% — in Week 7 of the 2019-20 flu season. That isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison; it compares a week in 2020-21 with a different week in the 2019-20 season.  But a direct comparison shows flu cases are down dramatically. During Week 2 of the 2019-20 flu season, 9,277 of the 40,451 specimens were positive for influenza, or 22.9%, according to the CDC.  ""We are seeing a lot less influenza activity compared to previous seasons. This does also extend to other respiratory viruses that are usually up during this time of the year,"" said Dr. Werner Bischoff, medical director of Infection Prevention and Health System Epidemiology at the Wake Forest School of Medicine.  There’s no definitive data yet to explain the drop, but Bischoff and other experts say they suspect that precautions related to the coronavirus, along with high rates of flu vaccination, are helping to limit the spread of the flu. ""My take, and this is not based on any evidence yet, is that the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions with masking, social distancing and frequent hand hygiene really cut down on transmission of these viruses,"" Bischoff said. ""Influenza and most other respiratory viruses are spread by droplets. This combined with the seasonal influenza vaccine may have reduced the spread in the community to such a degree that the viruses have not been able to establish themselves to reach the usual numbers."" A similar take was relayed in the Weather.com article that Gateway Pundit cited.  Weather.com included an excerpt from a Washington Post news story that said the rates of influenza A and influenza B, as well as other viruses, are at record lows, with experts theorizing that is largely due to the global shutdowns, mask wearing and other health protocols aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. ""It is likely that"" COVID-19 mitigation measures have had an impact on influenza,"" said CDC spokesperson RED Denty. ""Measures, including extensive reductions in global travel, teleworking, school closures, social distancing and face mask use may have played a role."" Other experts have also cited COVID-19 social distancing efforts, including children staying home from school, as well as high rates of influenza vaccinations. A headline from an article widely shared on Facebook claimed: ""A Miracle! Only 23 Americans Tested Positive for Flu Last Week Compared to 14,657 Cases Reported Last Year at Same Time."" The article cites this drop to suggest that health officials have improperly inflated the number of COVID-19 cases. Flu cases are down dramatically. The CDC reported that only 62 of 38,572 specimens tested positive for influenza for the week ended Jan. 16, 2021. A year earlier, the figure was 9,277.  Public health experts say they believe the drop is due not to a miracle or statistical tricks, but largely to social distancing and other precautions being used in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

No, Harvey didn't drop more water on Houston than flows over Niagara Falls in a year
","John Kerry, President Joe Biden's new special envoy on climate, appeared on CNN Jan. 31 to lay out the Biden administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing climate change.   The cost of taking no action on climate change will far outweigh the price of preventing its worst-case scenario, Kerry argued, pointing to three recent storms — hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma — whose damages cost the U.S. a combined $265 billion.   And then Kerry threw out a striking detail: ""Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,"" he said.  It’s true that Hurricane Harvey produced rainfall levels that have never been experienced in the U.S. in recorded history. According to Texas State Climatologist John Nielson-Gammon, the amount of rainfall that fell during a five-day period across 10,000 square miles of Texas and Louisiana exceeded the previous record set in 1899 by 62%.  In Harris County alone, which contains the bulk of the city of Houston, the storm dropped an average 33.7 inches of rainfall across the county’s 1,777 square mile area. But is that amount of rainfall more than the volume of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a full year?  A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State said that Kerry’s remark was based on a 2017 Washington Post article reporting that Harvey had dumped 24.5 trillion gallons of water on Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.  The article also mentions, for comparison sake, that 1 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls every 15 days, and Kerry’s office used that number to extrapolate the amount of water that flows over the falls in a year.  ""A trillion gallons falls over Niagara Falls every 15 days. So, in the course of 365 days, that is about 24.3 trillion gallons of water,"" said state department spokesperson James Dewey. That back-of-the-envelope calculation is correct, and it closely lines up with official estimates. Niagara Falls State Park estimates that 757,500 gallons flow over the falls each second, which is equivalent to 65.4 billion gallons per day, or 23.8 trillion gallons per year.   In either case — be it Kerry’s estimate of 24.3 trillion gallons flowing over Niagara per year or the state park’s 23.8 billion estimate — both figures are less than the 24.5 trillion gallons of water Harvey unleashed.  However, there’s a key detail that Kerry gets wrong.  While it might be true that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water within a week than flows over Niagara Falls in a year, not all of that Harvey water fell on Houston or Harris County alone.   Harvey made landfall near Rockport on Aug. 25, 2017, then drifted eastward over the next several days, dropping torrential rain on the Houston metro area. Three days later, the storm’s center moved back offshore and restrengthened over Matagorda Bay where it gained its peak intensity. Then on Aug. 30, the storm made landfall again in southwestern Louisiana moving northeastward over the southern United States while continuing to produce heavy rainfall.  The majority of the storm’s total rainfall fell over Southeast Texas, where 60 counties were under a disaster declaration, and southern Louisiana, where 13 counties were under a disaster declaration. The storm grew weaker as it moved over Tennessee and Kentucky, where it finally dissipated. Counties in both states issued flash flood warnings as areas received up to 7 inches of rain. All told, the storm had unleashed a grand total of 33 trillion gallons of water.   Kerry’s statement would have been accurate if he had said Harvey dropped more water on Texas and Louisiana, or the southern U.S., over five days — instead of just Houston — than the amount that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.  A 2018 report by the Harris County Flood Control District also made a comparison between the amount of Harvey rainfall and the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls.   ""A total of 1 trillion gallons of water fell across Harris County over the 4 day period which would fill NRG Stadium 1,472 times and cover Harris County’s 1,777 sq. miles with an average of 33.7 inches of water. This volume of water would also run Niagara Falls for 15 days,"" the report said.  After PolitiFact reached out to Kerry’s office about the misstatement, a spokesperson said that the issue has been brought up to staff and that Kerry would be more careful with that statistic.  ""In a recent interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, Secretary Kerry said Hurricane Harvey 'dropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year,'"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The statistic Secretary Kerry referenced is for water Hurricane Harvey dropped not just on Houston, but on southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.""    Kerry said on CNN that Hurricane Harvey dropped more water on Houston in five days than the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in a year.   By the time Harvey dissipated it had dropped around 33 trillion gallons of water primarily on Texas, Louisiana and, to a lesser extent, Tennessee and Kentucky. By comparison, about 23.8 trillion gallons of water flows over Niagara Falls per year.   Kerry’s comment errs in narrowing Harvey rainfall to Houston, and his office acknowledged the misstatement. In fact, 1 trillion gallons were dumped on Harris County, which would be equivalent to the volume of water that spills over Niagara Falls in 15 days.   We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/feb/05/john-kerry/no-harvey-didnt-drop-more-water-houston-flows-over/

Social media post misrepresents analysis of Trump tax law
","A post circulating in liberal corners of social media pushes back against Republicans’ portrayal of President Joe Biden as someone who is going to impose big tax hikes. ""Wait, so Trump passed a bill in 2017 where people who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027 … while the rich get richer … and y’all crying about Biden raising taxes for people who make over 400k. What am I missing....,"" the post said.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The assertion about impending tax increases under the 2017 law got a boost on Feb. 1, when the liberal group Occupy Democrats posted it on its Facebook page. There, it got at least 25,000 reactions over the next three days. When we looked into it, we found that the notion of a continuing series of tax increases buried in the GOP-backed law is misleading. (We inquired with Occupy Democrats, but we did not hear back.) Generally speaking, analyses of the 2017 law by independent groups have found the opposite of what the post says — that, at least until 2027, when a lot of the tax cuts will have expired, all income groups will see a reduction in taxes (or an increase in after-tax income).  In their ""distributional tables"" — the analytical charts that show how much a typical taxpayer in a given income group will see their after-tax income rise or fall under the law — both the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation concluded that until 2027, taxpayers across the income spectrum will fare better under the 2017 law than they would have otherwise. Some income groups will save more money than others do, and results for individual taxpayers will vary depending on the nature of their income; these tables are based on averages. However, there’s one analysis, from Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, that doesn’t show this pattern, and it’s the one that the post relies on. The discrepancy stems from a difference in the assumptions that went into each analysis. Unlike other analyses, the Joint Committee’s factored in the law’s provision eliminating the tax penalty for not having health insurance, and it did so in a counterintuitive way. Under the committee’s longstanding principles, it treats the elimination of this penalty as a net tax increase — not a net decrease. Why? The logic is that in the absence of a mandate to have health insurance, more people would forgo buying it on the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act. As a result, fewer people would get the tax subsidies that come with buying insurance on the marketplaces. These subsidies are meant to help people afford their insurance premiums. The practical effect of this analytical approach is that, in the distributional tables, some lower- and moderate-income groups see their income gains from the 2017 tax law disappear — a sharp contrast from what the Tax Policy Center and Tax Foundation concluded. As an example, here’s the Joint Committee on Taxation’s table that compares the tax burdens in 2023, both before and after the law’s passage:  The chart shows that while most income groups will see a tax cut in 2023 as a result of the law, both the collective tax burden and the average tax rate for households earning up to $30,000 are set to rise.  The same pattern holds in 2025, extending that year to taxpayers earning up to $40,000. And in 2027, after a host of tax cuts in the bill expire, the range of taxpayers expands to those earning as much as $75,000.  Tax experts say that the approach of the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation — which doesn’t factor in the change in the health insurance penalty — is a more accurate reading of the tax rates set down in the 2017 law.  The decision process that leads to fewer tax subsidies does not amount to having ""their taxes raised,"" as the Facebook post said. ""While it is important to consider the impact of the (tax law) on premium tax credits and health insurance take-up, it is misleading to call this effect a ‘stealth tax increase,’"" wrote Garrett Watson in a post for the Tax Foundation, where he is a senior tax policy analyst. ""The decline in premium tax credits has nothing to do with a change in tax rates or the generosity of the credits as established under the (Affordable Care Act), but rather due to voluntary decisions individuals make about whether to purchase qualified health insurance."" The post said, ""Trump passed a bill in 2017 where people who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027."" Tables produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation do suggest that after-tax incomes for some income groups will decline, but it’s misleading to say that this amounts to having ""their taxes raised."" These tax increases show up in the tables because the committee concluded that eliminating the individual health insurance mandate would lead people to forgo buying insurance, and would in turn reduce the tax subsidies they would’ve received to help them pay their premiums. By contrast, at least two other independent groups ignored the impact of this provision in their analyses and concluded that every income group will benefit from the tax law to some degree each year until 2027.

Is Erie County’s health commissioner paid roughly the same as Anthony Fauci?
","How well-paid is Dr. Gale Burstein, the health commissioner of Erie County, N.Y.? According to Erie County Comptroller Stefan Mychajliw, Burstein rivals Dr. Anthony Fauci, the long-tenured federal official who is playing a key role combating the coronavirus. In 2020, Burstein’s compensation, when factoring in fringe benefits, reached $532,418, based on a new report produced by Mychajliw’s office. ""I think a lot of people are going to be very angry that the health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci,"" Mychajliw said, according to the Buffalo News. Could a county-wide official really be out-earning such lofty officials? We took a closer look. Government administrators generally do not receive overtime pay. In a normal, pandemic-free year, Burstein would have made $202,312 in base salary, and a total of $304,985 when benefits are included. However, starting in 2020, Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz allowed all non-union, managerial, confidential employees to accept overtime pay for their work related to the coronavirus, the Buffalo News reported. The report found that during 2020, Burstein collected $183,414 for 1,266 hours of overtime work and $44,019 in fringe benefits on this overtime, not including health insurance. This made her the largest single recipient of taxpayer-funded overtime in Erie County, which includes Buffalo. In a statement, Erie County executive Mark C. Poloncarz verified Burstein’s earnings and added that Burstein is ""performing two full-time jobs."" Mychajliw said that including Burstein’s overtime pay, her 2020 salary places her among the highest paid officials not just in the state but the federal government as well. Jessica O’Neil, Mychajliw’s associate deputy comptroller and chief of staff, directed PolitiFact reporters to the Erie County budget and several articles showing the salary of top government officials. For the governor of New York, O’Neil cited an article in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle that said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's annual salary is set to rise to $250,000 in 2021. However, Cuomo chose to defer his scheduled $25,000 pay raise and asked other statewide officials to do the same, citing economic hardships. Cuomo had been set to see his annual salary increase from $225,000 to $250,000 on Jan. 1 as part of a three-year pay schedule approved by state lawmakers in 2019. This deferral will ultimately mean Cuomo will make the same salary —  $225,000 — in 2021 as he did in 2020. Former Vice President Mike Pence earned $230,700 in 2019, and that was set to increase to $235,100 in 2020 as a result of the expiration of a pay freeze. Finally, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to the president, made $417,608 in wages 2019, which is the latest year in which federal salaries were available via the Freedom of Information Act. So Burstein’s total salary plus overtime in 2020 was $385,726, which easily beats the number for Cuomo and Pence. Once benefits are added in, her total compensation package of $532,418 beats Fauci as well. The caveat is that Pence and Cuomo, and possibly Fauci, receive perks that are difficult to value, and which may leave Burstein’s compensation in the dust. The vice president lived rent-free in a 9,150-square-foot Victorian mansion at Number One Observatory Circle, plus access to Air Force Two, a large security detail, and free food prepared by the executive chef and executive pastry chef at the White House, among several other benefits. Meanwhile, Cuomo gets the benefit of living arrangements at the New York State Executive Mansion and transportation via taxpayer funded planes and helicopters. Finally, it’s worth noting that Burstein’s income will decrease when and if the special pandemic compensation rules are rolled back. Mychajliw said, ""I think a lot of people are going to be very angry that the health commissioner makes more than the governor, the vice president of the United States, and has a salary that is comparable to Dr. Anthony Fauci."" Burstein is benefitting from a rule that allows her to collect overtime, and she’s working more hours because of the pandemic. So Burstein’s salary and overtime alone exceeded the easily classifiable compensation for Cuomo and Pence, and when benefits are added in, she beats Fauci as well. However, Cuomo and Pence receive housing, transportation, and security benefits that are large but hard to quantify, and if these benefits are added into the calculation, they likely exceed what Burstein received.

Elaine Luria flips on pledge to refuse corporate PAC money
","During the final weeks of 2020, U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria accepted $34,000 in corporate PAC contributions to pay down debt from her recently successful reelection campaign. Her actions disappointed End Citizens United, a Washington-based public interest group seeking to reform campaign finance laws. It accused her of breaking a pledge not to accept corporate donations. So, we measured on the Flip-O-Meter whether Luria - a Democrat from the 2nd Congressional District anchored in Virginia Beach - has changed her stance on taking corporate contributions. Luria then  In 2018, Luria won a Democratic primary for Congress and then narrowly unseated Republican incumbent Scott Taylor in the general election. On April 13, 2018, Luria issued a press release announcing she had been endorsed by End Citizens United. She wrote, ""Our campaign finance system is broken and as a result politicians are listening to corporations and mega-donors instead of the people they were elected to serve. As a naval officer, I took a pledge to put people first and that’s why I am rejecting corporate PAC donations so coastal Virginians will know that I represent them and no one else."" On April 25, 2018, Luria reacted on Facebook to a New York Times article in which a former congressman said he didn’t talk to lobbyists who hadn’t contributed to his campaign. Luria wrote, ""This kind of pay-to-play governance is unacceptable, that's why I've pledged to reject corporate PAC donations."" On July 16, 2018, Luria’s campaign put out a news release amplifying that she had raised more money than Taylor, even though Taylor was accepting corporate contributions. ""Elaine pledged to reject corporate PAC contributions and is committed to living her value of reforming campaign finance laws,"" the release said.   Luria said during a debate on Oct. 23, 2018, ""I can tell you that a key tenet in my campaign is that I am not accepting any corporate PAC contributions: Not from prescription drug companies, not from oil companies, not from health care companies, not from private prisons, not from anyone who can influence my vote when I go to Washington."" Luria now Luria defeated Taylor again in a 2020 rematch. We found no record of her mentioning corporate PAC money during the campaign. She did not fill out a questionnaire from End Citizens United and did not, this time, receive the organization’s endorsement. Luria didn’t list any corporate contributions on campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission covering from Jan. 1, 2019 through Nov. 23, 2020 - 20 days after the election. She reported her campaign ended the election $107,161 in debt. Her latest report covers from Nov. 24, 2020 to the end of the year, and was filed with the FEC on Jan. 31, 2021. It shows she accepted during that period $34,000 from 14 corporate PACs to pay down her campaign debt. The donations - ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, came from PACs connected to Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Rolls Royce, Altria, Google, Aflac, BAE Systems, BWX Technologies, McGuireWoods, Ernst & Young, Comcast, iHeartMedia, and Serco. We asked Kate Fegley, Luria’s campaign manager, why the congresswoman changed her stance on corporate PAC contributions. She said Luria’s 2018 pledge not to accept such money was good only for that year’s campaign - not future races. ""Congresswoman Luria took the (End Citizens United) pledge in 2018 and fulfilled that pledge,"" Fegley emailed. ""She did not take the pledge in 2020."" Fegley wrote that corporate PACs ""are an effective and transparent means for employees to show support for issues important to them and their lines of work through small dollar donations."" Corporations are forbidden to use operating funds for direct contributions to candidates. Their PACs raise money through employees’ donations. Corporations can, however, pay PAC expenses and executives can sit on boards that direct the PAC’s political donations.  Fegley wrote that Luria is still committed to abolishing Super PACs that can raise unlimited and undisclosed contributions from individuals and companies and spend them to advocate for or against candidates. Super PACs are banned from donating directly to a candidate or coordinating their activities with political campaigns.  Luria ""is committed to doing the work to root out dark money in our political system and is not beholden to any entity but her constituents,"" Fegley wrote. Our ruling Luria repeatedly vowed in her 2018 congressional campaign she would not accept corporate PAC donations. Then, in the weeks following her 2020 reelection, she took in a total $34,000 from 14 corporate PACs to pay down campaign debt.  Her campaign manager’s insistence that Luria’s pledges were only good for her 2018 race is irrelevant. Luria has clearly changed her position on accepting corporate PAC money and we rate it a Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2021/feb/05/elaine-luria/elaine-luria-reverses-pledge-refuse-corporate-pac-/

Iowa school choice law may give tax dollars to corporations
","Iowa Republicans have forged ahead with efforts to dramatically change education policy in the state, while Democrats and some education leaders and teachers argue a school choice proposal from Gov. Kim Reynolds would divert money from public school systems that need it now more than ever. The push comes after Reynolds highlighted school choice in January during her Condition of the State Address. She argued that parents need flexibility when deciding where their children go to school, especially during a pandemic, but also because available services might vary dramatically from one public school district to another. ""School choice shouldn’t be limited to those who have the financial means or are lucky to live in a district that’s confident enough to allow open enrollment,"" Reynolds said during her Jan. 12 address. Republicans quickly announced their support and the Iowa Senate passed SF 159 on Thursday, Jan. 28. The Iowa State Education Association, a prominent Iowa teachers’ union, launched a campaignagainst the bill and the Iowa-Nebraska NAACP argued that it disproportionately would disadvantage low-income families of color while hampering desegregation efforts. Another opponent was Christina Blackcloud, a Democratic activist from Tama, Iowa, who lost a bid last fall to unseat state Rep. Dean Fisher (R-Montour). Blackcloud tweeted on Jan. 23: ""Can I be blunt? The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education…"" The tweet had been retweeted 190 times and liked by more than 700 people as February started, but would tax dollars usually sent to public schools be sent to corporations? To answer that, we followed the money. The Iowa bill would give financial aid for private school tuition and other education costs to a student who otherwise would attend a public school determined by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act as needing ""comprehensive support and improvement."" The private school also would have to accept the student for enrollment. The financial aid would come from a Student First Scholarship Program that the bill would establish. That program would be funded by depositing into an account created for a student opting to attend a private school a portion of the per-pupil state funding that youth’s school district would have received to educate the student.  A report from the state’s Legislative Services Agency estimates that Iowa’s public school districts would lose $2.1 million that is diverted to private schools in 2023 if the governor’s plan passes.  The state money is raised through a combination of sources, including property taxes. The bill limits spending that money to ""qualified educational expenses,"" which include tuition but also fees for tests such as advanced placement exams. Students opting out of their local public school could use state money to attend either private schools or charter schools. But those schools may or may not be considered corporations.  Technically, corporations are a group of individuals legally allowed to act as a single entity, and both public school districts and public charter schools are referred to as corporations in Iowa law. But that’s not the common understanding of what a corporation represents.  In an email exchange with PolitiFact, Blackcloud expressed concern that for-profit education service providers would be allowed to manage charter schools under Reynolds’ plan. She declined to clarify what she meant when describing private and charter schools as ""corporations."" Charter schools are privately run, publicly funded schools. Many are managed by outside organizations, which the Iowa bill calls ""education service providers,"" that can be both for-profit and not-for-profit. SF 159 mandates that charter schools form as not-for-profit education organizations but says nothing about whether the education service providers the schools contract with must be for-profit or not-for-profit. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported in 2019 that 12 percent of U.S. charter schools are managed by for-profit companies and 23 percent are managed by not-for-profit companies. The other 65 percent are independently managed.  In general, though, there’s no indication of how many charter schools in Iowa would be run by for-profit companies if Reynolds’ plan passes, especially as the plan would make forming charter schools much easier. That holds true for private schools as well.  Blackcloud said, ""The school voucher bill that Republicans are trying to ram through the Iowa Legislature would give your education tax dollars to corporations in the hopes they will magically fix education."" In its current form, SF 159 reallocates money that normally would be spent in public school systems, instead supporting students attending nonpublic schools. That money would be handed over to schools that, under Iowa law, are considered corporations. But, other not-for-profit options will exist, too, for nonpublic schooling.

But in a press briefing Feb. 3, McCarthy professed ignorance about QAnon, and mispronounced its name.  Defending Greene, he said: ""I think it would be helpful if you could hear exactly what she told all of us — denouncing ‘Q-on.’ I don’t know if I say it right.

No, Evers cannot unilaterally OK a new unemployment system
","Wisconsin’s beleaguered unemployment system is the latest battleground in the ongoing showdown between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-run Legislature. The system continues to stagger beneath the weight of pandemic-driven job losses, with thousands of Wisconsinites forced to wait months for benefits to be processed. Evers and his administration have drawn widespread criticism for the system, which also spurred the governor to effectively fire the head of the state’s workforce development agency. Evers has also leveled blame at Republicans, noting no substantive action was taken to upgrade a system long known to be insufficient during the eight-year stretch where the GOP controlled both the Legislature and governor’s mansion. The governor tried to push the issue forward with a special session on unemployment Jan. 19, but the Legislature convened and adjourned the session within seconds — as they have many other sessions Evers has called in an attempt to initiate action in one of the least active Legislatures in the country. Republicans have said such a step isn’t needed. ""It took us all of five minutes to understand that (Evers) has the authority and the revenue necessary to complete this task now,"" Assembly Majority Leaders Jim Steineke said in a Jan. 17, 2021, appearance on WKOW TV’s Capitol City Sunday program. ""He doesn’t need legislative approval. So if he’s just looking for us to put a stamp of approval on, hey governor, you got it, go ahead. The Legislature agrees with you, move forward. You don’t have to wait for us to pass it."" Steineke later said Evers ""has all the flexibility to find the money necessary to complete what he wants to complete on this."" Are Steineke and Republicans right that Evers has both the authority and revenue to address the unemployment system on his own? Let’s take a closer look. The task being debated here isn’t a small one. Evers’ office has estimated an overhaul of the state’s unemployment system would take 10 years to complete and cost $90 million. A Jan. 13, 2021, memo from the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the cost at between $48 million and $70 million. This comes as the unemployment system continues to see claims far above historical norms, fueling continued delays in processing payments. This will be the second attempt at such an upgrade, after an effort under Gov. Jim Doyle failed at great taxpayer expense. That unemployment system update was abandoned in 2007 after racking up a tab of $24 million. The Doyle project was funded by technology fees and one-time federal funds, but neither of those is available now. So Evers has said he plans to fund this upgrade through the state’s master lease program. The program, which dates back to 1991, is a way for agencies to finance the cost of IT projects over a number of years when projects are too large to allow lump-sum payment. From 2014 to 2020, $142 million was approved through this program for 28 different IT projects across state government, according to a September 2020 report on the master lease program from the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau. State agencies can apply for this funding through the state Department of Administration, which decides whether to approve the applications and then obtains the necessary loans. The Legislature is not involved in the approval process, but it is involved in setting aside money that is used to make those lease payments. More on that in a bit. Steineke spokeswoman Alesha Emmert said Evers has the authority to begin the upgrade process by issuing a request for proposal, as his administration has done with many other upgrades without legislative approval. Britt Cudaback, a spokeswoman for Evers, acknowledged the governor has the authority to start the process, but she argued it’s irrelevant without ongoing funding. ""Funding a (request for proposal) … is meaningless if there’s no commitment from the Legislature to fund the rest of the project,"" Cudaback said in an email. ""Given the substantial cost for the overall project of $90 million, (Evers’) goal is to ensure funds will be there for the master lease payments in future biennia."" Addressing the revenue question, the only specific funding source Emmert identified is a procurement appropriations fund overseen by the Department of Administration that had a $4 million balance at the end of the 2020 fiscal year. But that is far from sufficient in the context of a project that could cost $90 million. And even that fund isn’t accessible, as Emmert asserts. The funds are allocated to the Department of Administration to fund its role procuring items for agencies, not for transferring to other agencies to directly fund purchases, Cudaback said. In addition, the balance is projected to be only $2 million by the end of the 2021 fiscal year. Most notably, that fund was not listed among the potential funding sources in a list compiled by the fiscal bureau. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, asked the agency to identify potential ways to pay for the unemployment upgrades. The resulting memo identified nine funding sources that could be allowable under statute. Seven of those had a balance of $25,000 or less, one had a liability of $85 million and one had a balance around $15 million. That fund, per statute, is to be used for the ""payment of costs associated with program integrity activities,"" and is currently used for fraud investigation, worker classification enforcement, identify verification and criminal prosecutions, among other things. Even if the entirety of that investigation fund were co-opted from its current use, it would fund just a fraction of expected cost. Whatever the mechanism, it’s clear funds will need to be set aside across multiple years. And the way to approve such ongoing funding is through the budget — which must pass the Legislature. The fiscal bureau memo pointed out the need for legislative involvement in the project. In response to a question about whether the Joint Finance Committee could move appropriations from another agency to fund the first payments toward the upgrade (it can), the memo noted this: ""If the Committee (did the transfer), it would be incumbent on the Legislature during the budget process to approve monies in subsequent biennia sufficient to fulfill the annual master lease costs over its term."" That Legislative role was echoed in the 2020 audit. It suggested the Legislature consider getting involved in the master lease approval process since it is responsible for appropriating the needed money. ""Master lease payments must be made from funds that have been appropriated to state agencies,"" the audit said. ""Therefore, the Legislature could consider modifying statutes to require (the Department of Administration) to obtain its approval before approving applications for master lease funding above a specified amount or for specified projects, such as large, high-risk IT projects."" Steineke’s claim about Evers’ power is particularly unusual since it contradicts his party’s usual view on financial oversight.  Republicans argued explicitly against the idea of Evers allocating funding unilaterally in recent days. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos addressed the matter while defending a COVID-19 bill that would give the Republican-controlled finance committee oversight of how federal aid is spent in Wisconsin. ""It’s not something that’s all that abnormal,"" Vos, R-Rochester, said on PBS Wisconsin’s Here & Now program Jan. 29, 2021. ""It should mean the Legislature, the ones that are supposed to appropriate money, have the ability to oversee it just like we do with every other dollar that comes into the state treasury."" Steineke said Evers ""has the authority and revenue necessary"" to upgrade the state unemployment system without the Legislature. Evers has the authority and funding to begin the process by seeking out proposals, yes. But it’s an empty authority when  no sources under Evers’ control that come close to funding the full project were known at the time of this claim. Steineke’s claim related to revenue simply isn’t true. Both sides acknowledge a master lease would be a logical way forward, and that requires ongoing funding over the course of multiple state budgets — which has to be approved by the Legislature. We define Mostly False as a statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.    Editor’s note: After Steineke made his statement, a new potential funding option emerged based on a long-unused section of state statute. A state law dating back to at least the 1940s — and unused anytime in recent history — would allow the state to impose a tax of up to 0.2% on all employer payrolls to collect funds needed to administer the state unemployment insurance program. This could be done without any legislative action and theoretically generate more than $60 million per year at its maximum level. However, the existence of this option was not publicly known when Steineke made his claim, and therefore was not part of his claim or the supporting evidence provided by his staff. The state Department of Workforce Development raised this as an option at a Jan. 21 meeting, four days after the statement being rated here. We rate claims based on what is known at the time (that’s one of the Principles of PolitiFact). As such, that does not affect the rating for this item. The story was also updated to clarify that the Wisconsin unemployment system did undergo some upgrades over the last decades, just nothing of substance to address the issues that came to a head amid the pandemic.",/factchecks/2021/feb/03/jim-steineke/no-evers-cannot-unilaterally-ok-new-unemployment-s/
