Carter's pay gap claim strays off track
","What about Jason? That was the question one of our Twitter followers had for us shortly after we rated former President Jimmy Carter’s claim that women make 23 percent less than men for doing the same work Mostly False. Hasn’t Carter’s grandson Jason, a state senator from DeKalb County and Democratic candidate for governor, been saying the same thing? ""What will @PolitiFactGA say about @carter4governor repeating the same falsehood as his grandpappy?"" asked the political website, Georgia Unfiltered. We decided to take a look. Many Democrats have complained about a gender pay gap in what some analysts say is an effort to increase support among women as the congressional elections take place this fall. On April 8, Jason Carter’s Twitter account had a message about the pay gap. ""Women are paid 77¢ for every $1 men get for the same work. (Retweet) if you agree women should get equal pay for equal work,"" it said. Carter posted a similar message on his Facebook campaign page the same day. ""Women are still paid 77 cents for every dollar that men make for doing the same work. That's not OK. Share if you agree we should have equal pay for equal work,"" it read. Some questioned Carter’s claim on his Twitter page, while others backed him up. So is candidate Carter correct? We believe, like his grandfather, part of his statements clouded the accuracy of his claim. The claims by Jason Carter and others stem from a U.S. Census Bureau survey released in 2011. The study found women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. The number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. And the gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. It shrinks to the low single digits. President Barack Obama, himself, made a verbal misstep on the campaign trail in 2012 when he said ""women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" Our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington rated that statement Mostly False for many of the same reasons we gave the same rating to the former president. Perhaps seeing the trouble with that statement, Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address that women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" That statement is more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study because the president did not say that women were doing the same work and being underpaid. PolitiFact found other research that showed a smaller pay gap. PolitiFact rated Obama’s revised statement Mostly True. Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for Carter, told us via email that the candidate ""believes it's wrong that women get paid less than men and is the candidate in this race who wants to do something to fix that problem."" To sum up, Jason Carter said women were being paid 77 cents for every $1 men received for the same work. The widely cited U.S. Census Bureau study, though, did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other federal data show smaller gaps when considering the specific occupation, time on the job and educational levels. Carter’s statements omit many of these factors. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9F2940>],/factchecks/2014/apr/21/jason-carter/carters-pay-gap-claim-strays-track/

Treasurer candidate Seth Magaziner says 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders has no bank account or uses high-cost financial services
","In the race to succeed Gina Raimondo as Rhode Island general treasurer, Democrat Seth Magaziner is saying he can help poorer residents get low-cost banking services. During an April 13 appearance on ""10 News Conference,"" he said he would try to emulate a program in San Francisco, where banks and credit unions have joined with the city to offer low-cost, low frills bank accounts with minimal fees ""that don't nickel and dime people."" The service is needed, he said, because, ""In Rhode Island today, 25 percent of our households either don't have a bank account at all, or they have a bank account and they're still relying on high-cost financial services like payday loans, pawn shop check cashing and so on."" That's ""the highest percentage in New England,"" Magaziner said. The issue resonates in Rhode Island because activists have been trying unsuccessfully for years to limit the interest rate charged by payday lenders. Currently, they charge annual rates as high as 280 percent for short-term loans of up to $500. Critics want to limit the rate to 36 percent. We were interested in knowing whether so many Rhode Islanders are using such costly financial services or have no bank account at all. When we contacted Magaziner, his spokesman quickly pointed us to a copy of the 2011 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, the latest version available. The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the independent agency of the U.S. government that insures deposits in banks and thrift institutions. The survey is based on responses from nearly 45,000 households. It breaks households into three groups. In the first, nobody has an account at an FDIC-insured institution, a group referred to as ""the unbanked."" The second is households in which people have a checking or savings bank account but also rely on what the FDIC calls ""alternative financial services,"" which includes non-bank money orders, checking cashing services, pawn shops, payday loans, rent-to-own services and loans granted to people anticipating a tax refund; they are referred to as the ""underbanked."" The remaining households, in which people do not use alternative services, are characterized as ""fully banked."" In 2011, according to the survey, 7.0 percent of the state's 423,000 households were unbanked and 17.8 percent were underbanked. Adding the two together gives you 24.8 percent, which rounds up to the 25 percent figure cited by Magaziner. The percentage could actually be a bit higher. The FDIC report says that in 3.4 percent of the households, it could not be determined if alternative services were used. The report found that the percentage of people who were unbanked or underbanked in Rhode Island had grown significantly from 2009, when it was 18.7 percent. Magaziner was also correct when he said the rate is the highest in New England. The next-highest rate is Maine with 22.7 percent. The lowest rate: New Hampshire at 14.4 percent. The national average was 28.3 percent. Seven states -- Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Georgia -- had rates higher than 38 percent. Looking at the people who did not have a bank account, about 33 percent said it was because they didn't have enough money, and another 20 percent or so said they didn't want or need an account. Among consumers who had once had an account, 7 percent said they gave it up because the fees or minimum balance requirements were too high. Our ruling Seth Magaziner said, ""In Rhode Island today, 25 percent of our households either don't have a bank account at all, or they have a bank account and they're still relying on high-cost financial services like payday loans, pawn shop check cashing and so on."" He is accurately reporting the results of the FDIC's 2011 survey, the most recent available. Because this is a claim you can take to the bank -- if you have one -- we rate it as True.

Robert Sarvis says U.S. population is growing at slowest rate since Great Depression
","Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian candidate for the U.S. Senate, wants to open the nation’s borders. ""Did you know US population growth is at its lowest since the Great Depression?"" he tweeted on April 1. ""RT if you support liberalizing our immigration laws."" ""RT,"" if you’re wondering, means retweet. That cleared up, we didn’t know that the nation’s population growth had reached an 80-year low. So we decided to look at data from Sarvis’ primary source: the U.S. Census Bureau. We found mid-year population estimates dating back to 1900. The lowest point was from mid 1917 to mid 1918, when the U.S. began sending troops to Europe for World War I and the nation’s population actually decreased by 60,000, or 0.06 percent. That’s the only time since the start of the last century when the number of people decreased. Save that year, population growth hovered between 1 and 2 percent until 1931 when, in the teeth of the Great Depression, it dropped to 0.78 percent. It bottomed at 0.59 percent during the 12-month period beginning in July 1933. U.S. Population growth did not climb above 0.8 percent until mid 1939. From there U.S. population growth increased gradually through the ‘40s, peaking at 2.05 percent in 1950, and staying above 1 percent until 1973. It generally hovered at slightly below 1 percent through 2009. In 2010, as the nation was slowly emerging from recession, the growth rate plummeted to 0.84 percent, followed by 0.72 in 2011, 0.74 in 2012 and 0.72 in 2013. Indeed, the last four years mark the four lowest points of population growth since the Great Depression. And the growth rates of 2011 and 2013 are at the bottom of the time span. William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institute, says U.S. population growth is closely tied to the economy. During bad times, couples delay having children. In 2012, only 12.6 percent of U.S. women aged 15-44 had children, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the lowest birth rate in records dating back to 1940. Women in that age group had 3.95 million babies in 2012, a drop of 368,000 births from five years earlier. Immigration has slowed since the start of this century, but has been rebounding in recent years. In 2001, there was a net increase of nearly 1.2 million immigrants in the U.S. and that dropped to 726,000 in 2009. Last year, there was a net increase of 843,000 foreigners. Our ruling Sarvis said the U.S. population growth is at its lowest level since the Great Depression. The figures back him up and we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9F55C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/21/robert-sarvis/robert-sarvis-says-us-population-growing-slowest-r/

Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce says typical minimum wage worker is teen living with middle class parents
","After Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke endorsed President Barack Obama’s call for a $10.10 minimum wage, Wisconsin’s largest business lobby got on her case. In an April 4, 2014 opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce called raising the wage a job-killing move that would economically devastate workers -- doing the most harm to young, lower-skilled employees. ""According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage,"" WMC chief lobbyist Scott Manley wrote in the piece. He added:  ""That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family."" That part of the statement caught our attention. Are typical minimum wage earners ""teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families""? Manley told us he relied on statistics published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and research by various think tanks on the living situations of young workers. We examined those and other information sources, and interviewed three economics researchers. The age question It’s clear that teenagers make up a significant chunk of those whose wage tops out at the current federal minimum wage of $7.25. Teens (defined as those 16 to 19) made up 31 percent of the 1.5 million workers who were right at that wage in 2013. Researchers often include in their calculations workers whose hourly wage is less than the minimum. Examples are tipped employees such as restaurant workers, and salespeople under certain circumstances. Under this approach, there are another 1.8 million minimum wage workers, bringing the total to 3.3 million, of which teenagers make up 24.1 percent. We heard pros and cons about both methods. The official scorekeeper, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, presents both numbers and the total of 3.3 million. Under the broader approach, teenagers are the second-largest category next to 20 to 24 year olds (26.2 percent). But in the narrower method, teenagers are the largest category of the 12 age groupings the federal government uses to report the data for 16 and up (there are 111,000 minimum-wage workers 65 and older). Manley says the plurality figure under the narrower approach backs up the group’s claim that teenagers are the ""typical"" minimum-wage worker. He even cited a definition (we found it in Dictionary.com) of ""typical"" that includes the phrase ""representative"" of a group. In other dictionaries we consulted, ""typical"" is defined as a characteristic that is ""normal and expected"" (YourDictionary.com) or captures ""the overall sense of a thing"" (AllWords.com). So, can ""typical"" be accurate if about 7 in 10 minimum-wage workers are not teenagers? Manley cited research by James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics who researches minimum wage issues for the conservative Heritage Foundation. But Sherk comes at it from a still different perspective -- a wider group of teenagers and young adults under 25. Sherk told us  it would be accurate if the WMC had said that  ""teenagers or college students"" are typical. The combination of teenagers and college students and other young adults under 25, Sherk notes in his  research, accounts for just over 50 percent of minimum wage workers. Many work part-time. Sherk defines minimum wage workers as those at or below the minimum. We also sought the view of Keith Hall, a former top White House economics adviser named by President George W. Bush as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Like Sherk, Hall has warned against an increase in the minimum wage. ""Typical to my mind means over half,"" said Hall, now a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. ""But that’s just me,"" he added, saying the term might strike others differently. Finally, we asked David Cooper, an economic analyst at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which is funded primarily by labor unions and foundations. Cooper said the ""typical"" teenage claim struck him as false because the median age of workers right at the minimum wage is 23, and the average age is 29.8, according to his review of census data. In the context of the current debate over $10.10, the average age of workers who would benefit from that increase is 35, according to research by Cooper. Only 12 percent who would benefit are teenagers, that study showed. Bottom line, there’s some room to argue that teenagers are ""typical"" minimum wage workers, in that the group is by one measure the most-common category in reports breaking down the age of these employees. But even researchers who are sympathetic with WMC’s overall argument thought ""typical"" overshot the mark. Life with the parents The WMC claim, of course, went further, saying that teenagers ""living with their parents in middle class families"" are the typical minimum wage earners. We don’t need research to know that there are teenage workers in such settings. But quantifying how many of those teens living with parents are in ""middle class families"" proved elusive. On this, WMC’s Manley pointed us to the research by the Heritage Foundation. Heritage reported that ""minimum-wage workers under 25 are typically not their family’s sole breadwinners. Rather, they tend to live in middle-class households that do not rely on their earnings."" Just over 50 percent are not their family’s sole earner, Sherk told us. As for the how many are in middle-class families, Sherk referred us to another organization’s research, but it focused on minimum-wage workers aged 33 to 50, so it seems off point. And, as noted, the Heritage analysis itself is broader than just teenagers. Other voices say many live in less financially secure settings. Cooper, at the Economic Policy Institute, did not have data on living arrangements, but said that 54 percent of all workers at the minimum wage live in households with total family incomes less than $40,000. ""It’s going to depend on how you want to define ""middle class"" families, but clearly the majority of these workers are in relatively low-income families,"" Cooper told us. We didn’t find data directly on point to ""living with parents."" But another research organization, the Employment Policies Institute, crunched census data in 2009 and found that 39 percent of workers helped by the move to $7.25 were living with parents or other relatives. How many were teenagers? ""Unfortunately, I don’t have great data on the how many of the ""living with parents/other family"" category are teenagers,"" Employment Policies Institute  research director Michael Saltsman told us. ""We know there’s considerable overlap..."" The institute, which has a website advocating against a wage increase, receives support from foundations, individuals and businesses including restaurants, Saltsman said. The New York Times reported that the nonprofit institute is run by a public relations firm that also represents the restaurant industry. Our rating Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce stated that ""the typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle class families."" By one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings. But teenagers are less than a third of minimum wage workers by any measure, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families. Three experts -- two sympathetic to stopping a wage increase -- thought the statistical reality fell short of making the teenage cohort ""typical"" of the minimum wage pool. We rate the WMC claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDCE03C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/20/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-commerce-says-typical-mini/

Providence City Council president Michael Solomon says pregnant workers who stand too long nearly double their risk of premature delivery
","On April 3, 2014, legislation intended to protect pregnant women from workplace discrimination and safeguard the health of both the mother and child was introduced before the Providence City Council. It called for accommodations such as extra break times and the right to transfer to lighter duty. Arguing in support of the legislation, Council President Michael Solomon, a co-sponsor, said in a news release, ""Pregnant women who stand for five or six hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term pregnancy by 80 percent."" Pre-term pregnancy means a woman gives birth before 37 weeks -- about eight and a half months -- of pregnancy; 37 to 42 weeks is considered normal. Currently about 1 in 8 babies are born pre-term in the United States and they account for about 35 percent of infant deaths. We knew that studies have shown that most physical activity does not pose a risk during pregnancy, but we were unaware that prolonged standing could hike the risk of prematurity by 80 percent -- which is almost double the normal risk. In his news release, Solomon attributed the information to the Women's Fund of Rhode Island. We are fact-checking his statement because, although he clearly cited the source of his information, public officials are still responsible for the statistics they repeat. Solomon released a statement defending the idea behind the proposal, saying, ""Providing reasonable accommodations and taking common sense steps to protect the health of pregnant women and their babies is the right thing to do."" He did not offer any evidence to support the 80 percent statistic. As it turns out, the issue has been studied for years and the findings have been all over the map, with some researchers discovering a risk comparable to 80 percent -- and sometimes greater -- but most finding a much smaller risk, if any risk at all. Also, the definition of ""prolonged standing"" can vary from study to study, which can make it hard to compare studies. ""The Face of Pregnancy at Work"" page on the Women's Fund website essentially has the same claim Solomon made: ""Women who stand for 5 to 6 hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term delivery by 80 percent."" It lists no source. A spokeswoman promised to get back to us with more information. Meanwhile, we called the 57,000-member American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which sent us some material that raised questions about the 80-percent claim. For example, the American College sent us a 1995 study that involved women who stood at work for longer periods -- in this case five hours per day. They were 20 percent more likely to have a premature delivery than pregnant workers who stood for two hours or less each day. That's significantly lower than 80 percent. An overview of such studies was published in 2000 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. It combined the results from 14 studies published between 1983 and 1998. Eight found no link between prolonged standing (defined as more than three hours a day, not five or six hours), two showed a clear link and three showed a barely significant increase. The studies from the mid-1990s onward tended to show no link. Overall, the researchers calculated, prolonged standing increased the risk by 26 percent. When the people at the Women's Fund got back to us, they directed us to the summaries of seven studies. Some were part of the Obstetrics and Gynecology analysis (which was included in their list). There were also some more-recent examinations of the question. One found no significant risk for premature delivery for women standing more than seven hours a day. A second found that the risk was 69 percent greater. A third, a 2004 report in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, found that a woman would have to stand for more than six hours a day to produce a significant risk. Doing so increased the chances of preterm birth by 26 percent. It was the same degree of risk seen among women who reported that the satisfaction of their job was low. However, in the countries where the infant mortality rate was low and women could take long prenatal leaves, standing for more than six hours did not increase the risk at all. When it comes to body posture, ""the worst position a pregnant woman can be in is standing and being motionless,"" said Dr. Raul Artal, chairman of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri. A woman who is on her feet but moving around doesn't face the same risk, he said. ""Actually, I would encourage women to walk around."" Instead of a risk that's 80 percent higher, an estimate in the 20-30 percent range ""is much more reasonable,"" said Atral, who edits the Clinical Updates in Women's Health Care for ACOG. In general, ""healthy pregnant women should be encouraged to continue to live a normal life,"" he said. We also note for the record that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a list and poster of things a woman can do to prevent a pre-term delivery. Avoiding prolonged standing is not listed as a big risk factor. Our ruling Providence City Council President Michael Solomon said, ""Pregnant women who stand for five or six hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term pregnancy by 80 percent,"" attributing the statistic to the Women's Fund of Rhode Island. That's a very specific claim. But the evidence is based on a few studies, cherry-picked from a larger body of research that suggests that the risk, if there is one, is significantly smaller. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

John Kerry says Jews in eastern Ukraine told to register
","Editor’s note: After receiving reader feedback on this rating, we expanded the ""our ruling"" section on April 21, 2014, to more fully explain our reasoning for the rating.  Secretary of State John Kerry spoke from Geneva on Thursday with appalling news about religious intolerance in the Ukrainian-Russian crisis. ""In the last couple of days, notices were sent to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews,"" Kerry said. ""In the year 2014, after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey of history, this is not just intolerable; it's grotesque."" On Facebook and Twitter, the public feared the history of the Holocaust was repeating itself. At PolitiFact, we’re used to finding inconsistencies in media coverage of Ukraine, so we wanted to take a closer look at the situation. We found that Ukrainian Jews are not being forced to register. The story seems to have originated in Donetsk, a region and a city in eastern Ukraine. On April 7, pro-Russian activists took control of Donetsk’s government building. Almost two weeks later, USA Today reported, ""Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine."" Citing an Israeli news article, USA Today reported that Jews emerging from a synagogue in Donetsk on April 14 were handed pamphlets asking them to ""register"" with pro-Russian militants. If Jewish adults refused to register and pay a $50 fee, they’d be forced out of the country. On the same day the story appeared, Kerry mentioned the notice in his speech. We reached out to Kerry's office for evidence, but they pointed us back to his remarks. Almost immediately, there were signs that the fliers weren’t really coming from any kind of authority. The separatist whose signature allegedly appears on the flier -- Donetsk People’s Republic Chairman Denis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian militants -- denied any connection to it. Reporters on the ground quickly found that no one was actually being registered. PolitiFact exchanged emails with Ari Shapiro, an NPR international correspondent reporting from Donetsk, who said there is a real flier, but it went ignored until the media caught on. Shapiro himself went after the story and shared his reporting with us. ""You walk down the street with a beard and kippah,"" said Yaguda Kellerman, deputy chief of the Donetsk Jewish Community Center, to Shapiro. ""And you never experience any problems here. I was born in Donetsk."" Donetsk chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski acknowledged the flier’s existence, but called it a provocation, Shapiro reported. U.S. media outlets like Vox and the New Republic have also questioned its validity. A New York Times report from Donetsk said that militants never intended to set up a registry, and the room designated for registering Jews sat empty Thursday. Both sides -- pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian -- have accused each other of anti-Semitism during this conflict. An April 15 United Nations report noted that the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine has said incidents are isolated and that Jewish people, generally speaking, don’t feel threatened by Ukrainian leaders. The pro-Russia rebels have since put out their own flier attacking the original anti-Semitism accusations, Shapiro reported. Our ruling Kerry said Ukrainian Jews are being asked to register. There was a flier, but it doesn’t seem to have been issued by any authority. No one knows yet who distributed them, but the separatist movement denies issuing the fliers. Jewish community leaders in the area have denounced the pamphlets’ legitimacy. Reporters on the ground in Donetsk say that the fliers aren’t being taken seriously, and no Jews are registering. Kerry’s comments included none of that context. It’s possible Kerry’s comments were drawn from what he considered to be legitimate news reports, but those earlier reports didn’t include the full picture of what was going on. Anyone listening to Kerry’s remarks would think that the requests were coming from some sort of authority on the ground that had the means to enforce its request, and that’s not the case. Kerry’s remarks did not accurately convey the situation on the ground in Ukraine. For these reasons, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDDF140>],/factchecks/2014/apr/18/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-jews-eastern-ukraine-told-register/

David Dewhurst's U.S. Senate campaign of 2012 owed more than $1 million to vendors at end of 2013
","Reacting to a TV ad poking at his personal bankruptcy in the 1980s, state Sen. Dan Patrick said Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst owes more than $1 million to creditors from his losing 2012 run for the U.S. Senate. Dewhurst and Patrick, both of Houston, are in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination after Patrick led the four-way March primary. In a document posted online after Dewhurst’s ad debuted April 16, 2014, Patrick’s campaign mentioned a one-time Dewhurst business debt. ""In addition to these debts,"" Patrick said, Dewhurst ""currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign."" Patrick’s camp provided web links to news stories as the basis of the claim. On Aug. 13, 2013, the Texas Tribune reported that through June 2013, Dewhurst’s campaign finance reports indicated that it still owed $909,875.90 to consultants and vendors involved in his Senate bid. In July 2012, Dewhurst lost a primary runoff to attorney Ted Cruz, who won the seat that November. ""The unpaid bills range from several six-figure debts to media experts to a few hundred dollars owed to a company that provided email services,"" the Tribune story said. ""Many of the vendors are upset about getting stiffed for thousands of dollars from the campaign of a multi-millionaire candidate like Dewhurst, who hasn’t hesitated to pour some of his vast wealth into his political endeavors."" Then-Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was still legally entangled in pursuing the recovery of up to $2 million allegedly stolen from his state and federal campaign kitties by a former campaign manager, Kenneth ""Buddy"" Barfield, the story said. Considine said lawsuits filed by Dewhurst’s campaign committees included an effort to recover funds ""that should have been used to pay any outstanding federal campaign obligations."" Debts from Dewhurst’s 2012 campaign subsequently increased, according to a news story in the Dallas Morning News posted online Feb. 7, 2013. Dewhurst, the story said, ""still owes businesses $1.4 million from his failed 2012 U.S. Senate campaign, a federal report filed this week shows. The 20 private creditors have been waiting 18 months for payment. The debt ranges from $170,628 to a Maryland-based media consultant to $464 for email services."" The story quoted Considine, on Dewhurst’s behalf, as blaming the Barfield morass. We turned to the Federal Election Commission website and perused the Dewhurst finance report that was cited in the News story. The report, filed by Dewhurst’s Senate committee in February 2014, indicates outstanding debts of $1,406,808 as of the end of 2013, not counting loans. We asked Dewhurst’s lieutenant governor campaign about Patrick’s claim. By email, spokeswoman Eliza Vielma pointed out the outstanding debts belong to Dewhurst’s campaign, not to Dewhurst personally. Also, she said, efforts continue to sell Barfield’s former home to raise money that would make up for the funds ""stolen by Barfield from"" Dewhurst’s state and federal campaign ""committees,"" she said. According to a Jan. 3, 2014, Houston Chronicle news story, Dewhurst in November 2013 reached a settlement agreement with Barfield agreeing to sign over his West Austin home to repay a portion of the campaign funds that Dewhurst has said Barfield stole. On April 18, 2014, a Zillow.com web page showed the home in the Old Enfield part of Austin for sale for $2.75 million. According to a Chronicle news story posted online Jan. 11, 2014, a Dewhurst Senate campaign attorney, Adam Schramek, said after Dewhurst’s settlement with Barfield came public: ""This matter is being handled by the Travis County District Attorney's office, but my clients are pursuing every avenue to achieve full restitution for Mr. Barfield's crimes."" Our ruling Patrick said Dewhurst ""currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign."" To be precise, it's Dewhurst's Senate campaign that had outstanding debts exceeding $1.4 million through 2013. Also, Dewhurst appears to be trying to recoup campaign dollars he has described as stolen; it’s not as if he’s simply a deadbeat. We rate this claim, which lacked this additional information, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

David Dewhurst lofts ridiculous unsupported claim about Dan Patrick legally changing his name to hide debts
","Dan Patrick of Houston walked away from hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and, according to his opponent in a May 27, 2014, Republican lieutenant governor primary runoff, ""changed his name from Danny Goeb to hide from the debts."" ""If he can’t run his own business honestly,"" a woman says in the ad launched Aprl 16, 2014, by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, ""how can we ever trust him to run the state honestly?"" Patrick’s past bankruptcy and name change have drawn news coverage before. We wanted to look into the charge that Patrick, a state senator since 2007, changed his name in connection with his financial difficulties, something we hadn't heard before. That may be because it's not factually supported. We asked for evidence to support the claim from the Dewhurst campaign and received none. To our inquiry, the Dallas Morning News emailed us excerpts from Patrick’s bankruptcy case. The provided 10 pages show Patrick’s bankruptcy filing was initiated Oct. 27, 1986, and was closed Oct. 22, 1992. Also, a document indicates, Patrick (whose legal name was then Goeb) was ""released from all dischargeable debts"" on May 4, 1987. News stories dating to Patrick’s first Senate campaign, in 2006, indicate he legally changed his name years after his bankruptcy filing and after he’d presented himself as Dan Patrick for decades in his careers as a TV broadcaster, businessman and conservative talk-radio host. An Oct. 22, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story said: ""Dan Patrick is the stage name the former Dannie Scott Goeb took when he went into broadcasting, even before he moved to Houston in 1979 to be an anchor with KHOU."" A March 1, 2006, Houston Chronicle news story said: ""Born Dannie Scott Goeb in Baltimore, he began using the more familiar name,"" Dan Patrick, ""in 1978 as a sportscaster in Scranton, Pa. He legally changed his name in the fall of 2003 while contemplating a political run, so he would be recognizable on the ballot,"" the story said. So, Patrick used his professional name long before the bankruptcy. He legally changed his name more than 15 years after filing for personal bankruptcy. Patrick describes his name change on a campaign web page, saying his birth name, with Goeb pronounced like globe, ""was not a pleasant sounding name or easy to spell if you didn’t see it. I have never used it on air. Beginning with my first radio job at age 18 back in 1968 I used my first and middle name only. I was Dan Scott on the radio and planned on keeping that as my on air name always. ""However, Elden Hale, the man who hired me for my first TV anchor job in 1977 told me I needed to change my air name before joining his station in Scranton, Pa. He asked me to pick a new name because there was an anchor with the last name of Scott on a competing station. He didn’t want any confusion. I was so excited to finally get my first anchor job in television whatever he wanted me to do in that regard was fine with me. ""My wife and I picked Dan Patrick. Her brother’s middle name was Patrick. I have been known as Dan Patrick for 36 years. My parents even became known as the Patricks. Even though our legal name was Goeb all those years my wife and children were known as the Patricks by most folks."" In the post, Patrick went on to say he legally changed his name to Dan Goeb Patrick so he could present himself as Dan Patrick in any possible bid for elected office. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick changed his name to hide from his debts. The lieutenant governor offered no backup for this claim, which shakes out as factually illogical. Patrick’s bankruptcy case ended in 1992; he has said he legally changed his name 11 years later. That gap in time alone leads us to see this claim as both incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Gary Peters says Koch brothers oppose Paycheck Fairness Act
","Criticizing the Koch brothers and hitting Republicans for opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act are two key tenets of the Democratic midterm playbook. So when we found the Democrat in Michigan’s open Senate race combining those attacks against his Republican opponent, effectively killing two birds with one stone — er, press release — we thought it deserved another look. Here’s the backstory: Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., is a co-sponsor to the House version of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that builds on the Equal Pay Act, in hopes of increasing pay transparency in the workplace. The Senate version of the bill failed to muster 60 votes needed to advance the legislation because it couldn’t garner support from Republicans. Peters’ Republican opponent in the Senate race, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, has come out publicly against the legislation for what it requires businesses to disclose.   Peters, in response, has twice issued press releases this week insinuating that opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act is part of the agenda of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers spending heavily on campaign ads (including in Michigan) to help Republicans win the Senate. ""Land has chosen yet again to stand with her out-of-state billionaire allies like the Koch brothers"" in opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Peters campaign wrote in a press release titled ""Land Doubles Down on Koch Agenda."" We’ve caught Democrats in other states assigning positions to the Kochs with little evidence. For the purpose of this fact-check, we’re focusing on whether opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act is part of the Koch brothers’ agenda. What is the Paycheck Fairness Act? First off, it’s already illegal to discriminate against a worker based on sex. Proponents of the Paycheck Fairness Act say this would add teeth to existing law by making it easier for women to learn whether they’re being discriminated against. That’s accomplished by prohibiting companies from retaliating against employees for discussing their pay. Women would be able to discuss their salary with other employees at the workplace without worrying about violating a company policy. In explaining Land’s opposition to the legislation, a spokeswoman said this provision would require businesses to disclose the pay of any employee to any worker who asks. But the bill specifically does not apply to an ""employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a part of such employee’s essential job functions."" The bill also makes clear that if an employer is citing a factor other than the employee's sex for a disparity in wages between workers, it must be related to education, training, experience or other job-related reasons. Another key, and controversial, component of the bill would require the federal government to collect pay information from employers by sex, race and national origin of the employees. This information would be used to identify pay disparities within industries and potential discrimination. Land’s staff said this information could be easily made public through a FOIA request or if the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission publishes it online, essentially creating a searchable database of salaries. However, that is an unlikely scenario, as the law instructs the commission to consider ""appropriate protections for maintaining data confidentiality."" It’s also worth noting that employers with more than 100 workers are already required annually to fill out a form called the EEO1 with information on the race and sex of their employees. While it is sometimes used in academic research, names of employees are not included and the company names are usually protected. Finally, in addition to education and awareness measures, the bill also allows employees who have been discriminated against to receive punitive or compensatory damages in a civil suit. The Koch connection We asked Peters’ campaign for evidence that the Kochs oppose the Paycheck Fairness Act. They pointed us to the Center for Effective Government, a nonpartisan watchdog of money in politics. In addition to tracking campaign finance, the organization also keeps tabs on who is lobbying the government. Companies, and firms hired to lobby on behalf of companies and groups, must disclose the issues they’re meeting with Congress about. In 2009, Flint Hills Resources, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, spent $960,000 lobbying Congress on a wide range of issues, from energy to taxes. Listed among the bills Flint Hills Resources lobbied are a previous incarnation of the Paycheck Fairness Act and what would become known as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which passed both chambers of Congress and was eventually signed by President Barack Obama into law. Similarly, in 2010, Koch Industries hired the firm of Siff and Lake for $50,000 to lobby Congress on a handful of bills. According to a lobbying report, one of the bills was ""S. 182, the Paycheck Fairness Act,"" a bill very similar to the current Senate bill. Specifically, Koch Industries wanted to discuss how the bill would change the way employers justify wage disparities. The reports don’t specify whether someone is for or against the legislation. A spokeswoman for Koch Industries did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But their past positions opposing government regulation makes us confident they were against the legislation. If they want to get back to us to dispute this, we’re all ears. Disclosure reports filed since have not indicated Koch Industries has lobbied on this issue, so 2010 was the company’s last public foray into the debate. Reports covering 2013 and the first three months of 2014 have not indicated Koch entities have focused on any of the Paycheck Fairness Act bills that have circulated Congress since last year (though they have until April 21 to finalize reports for Jan. 1 to March 31). Since the recently debated Senate bill was not introduced until April 1, it may take until July to learn if Koch Industries made a last-minute push against the legislation.  While opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act may have been part of their agenda during earlier debates on equal pay, we don't know (and neither does Peters) if they weighed in on the bill now before Congress. Peters’ staff also highlighted a post about the Koch brothers by Think Progress, a site affiliated with the Center for American Progress that provides liberal opinion and analysis. The piece notes how several conservative and libertarian leaning organizations with Koch financing are critical of congressional action on equal pay issues. Most of the donations are relatively small compared with the overall funding of the highlighted groups. And not all of the people quoted by Think Progress were speaking directly on the Paycheck Fairness Act, but rather the general notion of a wage gap. One group, though, Concerned Women for America, did receive a significant portion of their funding from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a group funded by the Koch brothers that primarily distributes checks. Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee received $8.15 million of the $8.7 million they raised in 2011 from the Koch-affiliated group, according to IRS filings. In 2010, the group raised less than a million dollars and just $2 million in 2012, the last records on file. In a fact-sheet opposing the bill, Concerned Women for America called the Paycheck Fairness Act a ""a one-size-fits-all policy"" that ""discourages flexible working arrangements"" and ""sidetracks businesses from their primary mission, which could lead to fewer job opportunities."" Americans for Prosperity, a group more directly tied to the Koch brothers that has aired ads in Michigan against Peters, has not weighed in on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a spokesman told PolitiFact. Disclosure reports released later this year may reveal more information. But that's not information Peters was privvy to when he made his claim. Our ruling Peters’ campaign claimed opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act was part of the Koch agenda. Federal disclosure forms show businesses owned by the Koch brothers lobbied on similar legislation in 2009 and 2010. And a Koch-connected group gave significant funding in 2011 to Concerned Women for America, a group that has opposed the current legislation. But it does not appear Koch Industries has lobbied on equal pay issues since 2010, including the most recent legislation. Their most vocal organization, Americans for Prosperity, hasn’t entered the debate, either. In making the claim, the Peters campaign was relying on evidence from several years ago. Even if disclosure reports filed in the near future reveal that Koch entities lobbied on the issue more recently, Peters linked the Koch brothers to the legislation without knowing their involvement.  Weighing all of that, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB895F80>],/factchecks/2014/apr/18/gary-peters/gary-peters-says-koch-brothers-oppose-paycheck-fai/

Nunn avoids slip up on gender pay claim
","Democrats and Republicans have yet again found an issue to disagree on -- the gender pay gap -- and one U.S. Senate candidate’s comments about it drew the attention of our Truth-O-Meter. ""On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make,"" the candidate, Michelle Nunn, a Democrat, has said in statements and on her Facebook page. Is this statistic true? Senate Democrats earlier this month failed to get the 60 votes required to break a Republican filibuster blocking the Paycheck Fairness Act, which among other things, would require the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect data about pay from employers. Nunn and other Democrats say the bill would help women earn the same wages as men. Republicans say the legislation is unnecessary and would result in more civil lawsuits. A few area Republicans saw Nunn’s comments about the gender pay gap and asked us to fact-check Nunn, who has sought centrist positions on many issues. Some political analysts see the gender pay gap battle as an election-year effort by Democrats to woo women to their side. Several Democrats have used the 77 cents claim in this ongoing debate, some with more accuracy than others. For example, we recently gave former President Jimmy Carter a Mostly False rating for his statement that ""in the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men."" The number Carter used comes from a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau study that looked at the total wages earned by male and female workers. The study found men’s total wages -- key words here, total wages -- were about 23 percentage points higher than the total amount of women's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. And this is a key point: The census study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. The Census Bureau number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. The gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. President Barack Obama made a somewhat similar statement to Carter’s on the campaign trail in 2012 when he said ""women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" Our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington rated that statement Mostly False for many of the same reasons we gave the same rating to Carter. Perhaps seeing the trouble with that statement, Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address that women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" That statement is more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study because the president did not say that women were doing the same work and being underpaid. PolitiFact found other research that showed a smaller pay gap. PolitiFact rated Obama’s revised statement Mostly True. There are two key points to Nunn’s statement. She began with the qualifier ""on average."" And she did not say there was a pay gap for women doing the same work as men. That puts Nunn’s statement more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study. Nunn made no attempt to equate equal work with equal pay -- a comparison that has landed some of her fellow politicians on shaky Truth-O-Meter terrain. Her statement could have used a little context, but she is mostly on target. We rate Nunn’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAA4B40>],/factchecks/2014/apr/18/michelle-nunn/nunn-avoids-slip-gender-pay-claim/

MSNBC guest says 'Democrats 'are in the pocket of the NRA'
","When billionaire Michael Bloomberg stepped down as mayor of New York City, the big question was what would he do next? This week, Bloomberg gave part of the answer. He unveiled a $50 million fund to advance the cause of gun control, an issue that has long been close to his heart. Even in a political ecosystem flooded with cash, this was more than enough to get peoples’ attention. On MSNBC, Washington Post reporter Nia-Malika Henderson figured that the money might have some impact if Bloomberg spent strategically in certain states and cities. As for change at the federal level, Henderson that gave long odds. ""I think the NRA (National Rifle Association) is a formidable force,"" Henderson said. ""It’s a formidable force because Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA and they didn’t want to vote against the NRA."" We are checking whether Democrats are ""in the pocket of the NRA."" We emailed and tweeted Henderson to learn what information led her to that conclusion. We did not hear back. In Henderson’s absence, we find two ways to assess her statement - quantitatively through the lens of campaign dollars, and qualitatively through the lens of Democrats’ actions. Jeffrey Berry is a political scientist at Tufts University who has studied the role of special interest groups in Washington. Berry called Henderson’s words ""a gross mischaracterization."" ""Most leaders of the Democratic Party do not support the goals of the NRA and are not ‘in the pocket’ of the organization,"" Berry said. ""Many Democratic leaders are avowed supporters of gun control, including the president of the United States. There's a reason why the NRA is so hostile toward the Democratic Party."" Campaign contribution numbers show the NRA’s clear preference for Republicans over Democrats. According the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly 90 percent of the NRA’s donations went to Republican candidates or parties in the 2012 elections. The NRA gave more than $1.1 million. Even Henderson’s own paper, the Washington Post, reported on some of these numbers. Here’s what that looks like:                    In the current election cycle, the trend is even more lopsided. So far, the NRA has given about 96 percent of its contributions to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But if we look at how the gun control issue has played out in Congress, especially in the Senate, we see some Democrats exercising great caution where the NRA is concerned. In last year’s vote on requiring background checks for all commercial gun sales, the proposal failed in part because four key Democrats opposed it. The list included Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All represented rural states where gun rights are popular. Baucus decided not to run for re-election and both Begich and Pryor face tough races. The Democratic control of the Senate likely hinges on how Democrats fare in close elections, and their appetite for taking on the NRA is limited.   Rutgers University political scientist Beth Leech said the relationship between Democrats and the NRA is not one of partnership, but dread. If some Democrats are afraid to take on the NRA, it’s not because of campaign cash supporting them. It’s because of the NRA money that might be used to try and defeat them. ""The NRA spent $11 million in 2012 on outside expenditures,"" Leech said. ""Many Democrats may be afraid of seeing that outside spending power used against them in an election."" Our ruling Henderson said Democrats are in the pocket of the NRA. Henderson did not send us any information to support or clarify her statement. In terms of campaign contributions, the NRA sends its money almost entirely to Republicans. In the sense that ""in the pocket"" means a cozy comfortable relationship, the political scientists we reached said Henderson’s claim was wrong. On the other hand, the record shows that on key votes, some Democrats will avoid raising the ire of the NRA. The relationship is hardly cozy but the result is the same. Henderson’s words don’t capture this factor well, but due to it, enough Democrats end up doing what the NRA wants. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAC98280>],/factchecks/2014/apr/17/nia-malika-henderson/msnbc-guest-says-democrats-are-pocket-nra/

Liberal pundit says conservative white men dominate Sunday talk shows
","Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder sparked a bit of controversy when he spoke at the annual convention of the National Action Network, a civil rights group formed by Rev. Al Sharpton. Holder’s prepared speech spotlighted what his department had done in areas that would loom large for his predominantly African-American audience. He talked about voting rights, prosecuting hate crimes and ensuring better legal counsel for defendants unable to afford a lawyer. But at one moment, Holder strayed from the script. A line that was supposed to lead into the Supreme Court’s rejection of a key voting rights tool turned into a rebuke of the Republican Congress. ""The last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity,"" Holder said. ""If you don’t believe that, you look at the way — forget about me, forget about me. You look at the way the attorney general of the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee — has nothing to do with me, forget that. What attorney general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?"" While Holder never mentioned race, the punditocracy concluded that Holder was saying that he and President Barack Obama are subject to greater disrespect because they are black. On Fox News Sunday, Brit Hume said he suspected that Holder was invoking race, and unfairly so. ""This strikes me as kind of cry baby stuff from Holder,"" Hume said. ""My sense of that this is that both Eric Holder and Barack Obama have benefited politically enormously from the fact that they are African-American and the first to hold the jobs that they hold."" Hume and his fellow panelist George Will said other presidents and attorneys general have suffered worse treatment on Capitol Hill. Those comments drew further response the next day on MSNBC’s The Ed Show. Host Ed Schultz asked Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson what he thought of the cry baby label. Dyson, himself African-American, rejected it and took his own dig at the Fox News panel, which was made up of three white men and one white woman. ""We know that Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men who carp and complain to no end about the inability to get access (to power) when they have it,"" Dyson said. We can’t fact-check the carping and complaining line, but we can drill down on Dyson’s claim that ""Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men."" Since the start of the year, PunditFact has been tracking guests who have appeared on the five most prominent Sunday news shows -- Fox News Sunday, Face the Nation, Meet the Press, This Week and State of the Union. So far we’ve logged 600 different guests, and categorized them by job, political leaning, race and gender. On politics, we created three categories -- conservative, liberal and ""other"" (a catch-all category). We, if we might say, took a conservative approach and when we had any doubts, used the ""other"" category liberally. Our tally does not include hosts or interviewers but does include all panelists. So when Jonathan Karl fills in as host on This Week, he would not count. But when Karl appears on ABC's weekly rountable, he would. Eventually we plan on building a guest tracker that will allow you to see who appears most often on the Sunday news shows. But for now we can use the data we have collected to analyze Dyson’s claim. What we found Again, Dyson is claiming that the typical Sunday morning show crowd consists of ""conservative white men."" He’s certainly right that most guests are white men. They account for two-thirds of all the people invited to the Sunday talk fests. Men, regardless of ethnic background or job, make up 75 percent of all guests. Whites, both male and female, make up 85 percent of all guests. But Dyson steers off course by adding the qualifier ""conservative,"" our data shows. Conservatives -- regardless of gender or race -- make up about 32 percent of the guests while liberals make up 26 percent. The remaining guests, about 42 percent, are neither conservative nor liberal -- a broad group that includes journalists and technical experts. (Think Judy Woodruff and lots of people talking about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.) The number of conservatives shrink when isolate on ""conservative white men."" The group of white conservative men claims about 25 percent of all appearances on the Sunday talk shows in 2014. Clearly, that’s not a majority. It's not even a plurality. The most likely group to appear on the Sunday shows is other or neutral white males. They make up 27 percent of all guests so far in 2014. We also decided to look just at pundits. Of that group, the percentage of conservative white male pundits is actually smaller, our database shows. Since the start of the year, 410 pundits have appeared on the Sunday shows. Of that group, about 20 percent were ""conservative white men."" That’s more than liberal white men, who made up 8 percent of pundits. But not nearly as much as neutral white male pundits -- who made up about 35 percent of all appearances. We reached out to Dyson to get his numbers and we haven’t heard back. What we can say is from our database of the Sunday talk shows is that conservatives are outnumbering liberals, but conservative white males don’t hold dominion. It’s people who don’t fall into any particular political category that represent the largest single group. Now, we're not the only group that tracks the Sunday show guests list. The liberal group Media Matters released findings from a review of the 2013 network Sunday shows (our list, except for CNN's State of the Union). According to their methodology, conservative white males made up 29 percent of all guests in 2013, more than the next biggest group, neutral white males, who accounted for 23 percent of all guests. Conservative white males made up the largest percentage for any one group, Media Matters said, but still accounted for just three in 10 guests. Our ruling Dyson said the the Sunday talk shows are usually given over to conservative white men. It would have been much more accurate if he just said white men. According to the liberal group Media Matters, conservative white males made up 29 percent of the guests when looking at four Sunday shows. That's the largest of any group when breaking things down for ideology, race and gender, Media Matters found. Our database for 2014 presents different findings. So far, 25 percent of all appearances on the Sunday talk shows in 2014 have been made by conservative white men. That's slightly less than neutral or ""other"" white men who made up 27 percent of all guest appearances so far in 2014. Dyson described the Sunday shows as having been ""given over"" to conservative white males. While that phrase isn't exact, it does suggest a dominant presence. The numbers don’t back that up. Conservatives outman the liberals but by the time you drill down to white, male, conservatives, they lose much of the edge. Dyson pushed too far on his adjectives. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8839C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/17/michael-eric-dyson/dyson-conservative-white-men-dominate-sunday-talk-/

Were more than half of all babies born in Oregon in 2013 Hispanic?
","Controversial proposals to issue driver’s licenses to undocumented residents and to provide permanent residency to certain immigrants highlight Oregon’s changing demographics. From 2000 to 2010, for example, the state’s population grew by 12 percent. Oregon’s Hispanic population, by comparison, grew by 64 percent over that span, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The Claim A group of education and community leaders from around the state gathered at Kah-Nee-Ta Resort in February to discuss ways to improve educational outcomes. The event, co-sponsored by the Oregon Education Investment Board, had a particular focus on helping third-grade students of color and English language learners. A meeting slide show included a ""fact"" that later showed up in the Oregon School Boards Association’s April newsletter. ""Did you know that in 2013 over 50 percent of all babies born in Oregon were Hispanic?"" said the newsletter item, written by Betsy Miller-Jones, OSBA executive director. We’re aware that Oregon’s racial complexion is changing, but are half of all newborns now Hispanic? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The Analysis We contacted Jonathan Modie, communications officer for the Oregon Public Health Division. In an email, he told us that records for 2012 show that of the 45,059 babies born in Oregon that year, 8,521 -- or about 18.9 percent -- were Hispanic, according to official statistics. Preliminary data for 2013 roughly match the 2012 numbers. Neither comes close to the ""more than 50 percent figure"" included in the claim. To determine where the number came from, we contacted Kristin Gimbel, communications director for the Oregon Education Investment Board. After checking around, she told us two things. One, that the figure came from a slide show prepared by Zeke Smith, former chief of staff to Portland Schools Superintendent Carole Smith and now chief impact officer for United Way of the Columbia-Willamette. And, two, that it was wrong. ""Regretfully (Smith) told me that he inadvertently transposed the data,"" Gimbel wrote in an email. In a follow-up phone call, she said Smith explained that, in working late on a volunteer basis to put the slide show together, he simply neglected to include an important proviso. The claim, she wrote, should have read: ""In 2013 for the first time, more than half of the babies born to parents on Medicaid were Hispanic."" Miller-Jones, who included the figure in the Oregon School Boards Association’s April newsletter, acknowledged the mistake. ""We relied on information from a normally reliable source,"" she wrote in an email. ""We appreciate your pointing out the error, about which we will inform the OEIB (Oregon Education Investment Board) as well as our members."" The Ruling The executive director of the Oregon School Boards Association, picking up on a statistic included in a slide show presented to educators and others at a conference in February, wrote in a newsletter that in 2013 ""more than 50 percent of all babies born in Oregon were Hispanic."" A check of Oregon vital statistics puts the figure at about 18.9 percent for 2012, and preliminary data for 2013 are about the same. The official who worked late on his own time to prepare the presentation, meanwhile, said he simply goofed in omitting key wording that would have made the claim correct.

No, the Washington Post did not offer $7,000 for Roy Moore dirt
","A person purporting to be a Washington Post reporter left a voicemail on an Alabama phone number offering up to $7,000 to women willing to malign Republican senate nominee Roy Moore. The Nov. 14 message was received by Pastor Al Moore of Creola, Ala., who played the recording for local CBS affiliate WKRG. The news outlet described the message as a ""robocall"" and said ""at least one person in our viewing area"" received the message. (They did not respond when we asked how many people had received the call.) ""Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I’m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000 dollars,"" the message stated. The caller then said the newspaper ""will not be fully investigating these claims"" but would make a written report, and said he could be contacted via email at [email protected] This voicemail smelled fishy to us — so we decided to investigate further. It turns out the call was a hoax that appears calculated to undermine the work of real journalists. The suspicious voicemail comes as top Republicans call for Moore to end his bid in the Dec. 12 special election after the Washington Post reported that Moore, while in his 30s, had sexual encounters with several teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, according to the women. Since then, another accuser has alleged that Moore assaulted her in locked car when she was 16. Moore’s attorney, Trenton Garmon, seized on the phone call during a Nov. 15 appearance on MSNBC and floated the possibility of pursuing legal action. ""Robocalls are now even being made asking for people to come forward against Roy, which I think is kind of an indication of the political climate that we're in, and we plan on even probably getting into some depositions related to that,"" said Garmon, who acknowledged that he did not know who was responsible for making the call. It’s unclear what relationship, if any, the voicemail bears to the Nov. 9 Washington Post report concerning Moore’s alleged sexual encounters. But for his part, Moore forcefully denied the allegations and threatened to sue the Post after their bombshell investigation led top Republicans to call for Moore’s exit. ""The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign,"" he said at a Nov. 12 campaign speech in Huntsville, Ala. ""These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue -- and for which they will be sued."" The Moore campaign did not respond to our request to comment on this story. Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron dismissed the voicemail as an effort to ""discredit real journalism,"" saying the reporting methods described in the call bear ""no relationship to reality."" ""The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post,"" Baron said in a written statement. ""The call’s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism."" The Washington Post further noted in a Nov. 15 article that no Post newsroom employees are named ""Bernie Bernstein"" or ""Al Bernstein."" Additionally, Moore, the pastor who received the voicemail, told WKRG that his attempt to email the address provided in the message came back undeliverable. (The same was true of our efforts.) A caller purporting to be a Washington Post reporter named Bernie Bernstein left a voicemail saying the newspaper was offering women up to $7,000 for damaging information on Roy Moore. The Washington Post denied having made the call and dismissed it as an effort to discredit journalism. Further, it said the reporting methods described in the call — offering cash in exchange for muck — runs counter to Post practice. We found no record of any Washington Post reporters or editors named Bernie Bernstein or Al Bernstein, and emails sent to the address provided in the message came back undeliverable.

"['Regulation', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Greitens makes mostly accurate claim about Missouri regulations
","In a Facebook post, Gov. Eric Greitens relayed the story of a small-business owner from Bolivar, Missouri. His business was forced to pay $1,500 a year for landline phones due to an outdated state regulation. ""When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations,"" Greitens wrote in the post. ""That’s more than 7.5 million words; it’s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations."" The purpose of Greitens’ post was to launch NoMORedTape.com, his website that allows Missourians to crowdsource comments on laws and rules. On the site, constituents can voice their displeasure with any government regulations disrupting their everyday lives. Its goal is to remove unnecessary regulations, and keep rules that benefit Missourians. Forty dictionaries of regulations seems excessive. Let’s see how close Greitens’ claim is to reality. When the Missouri General Assembly passes a statute, its role in the lawmaking process is done. Now, to enforce the laws, that’s up to agencies in the executive branch. Regulations provide detail to statutes. According to Maura Browning, director of communications for the Secretary of State’s office, individual agencies have their own set of rules for creating regulations. Once they follow their process for making a regulation, it becomes part of the Code of State Regulations. There are 22 separate titles in the code, many with dozens of chapters under multiple divisions. These encompass the 113,000 regulations Greitens was talking about in his post. Title 4, the Department of Economic Development, alone has 369 chapters. When you go to the No MO Red Tape website, a George Mason University study pops up explaining where the large number came from. The university used a tool it developed called StateReg data, an algorithm that reads large regulatory documents. It processes words like ""shall,"" ""must,"" ""may not,"" ""prohibited,"" and ""required"" to indicate where there are legal restrictions or obligations in the Missouri Code of State Regulations. That tool concluded that Missouri has 113,112 regulations. ""It would take an individual 418 hours, or 10 weeks, to read the entire CRS,"" the study said. Greitens’ main goal with the No MO Red Tape website is to allow small businesses to thrive without interference from the government. Browning pointed out that regulations also restrict local governments, school boards, counties and other local entities. As of Oct. 31, Missouri citizens had submitted 4,226 commentsto No MO Red Tape for various regulations. Eighty-nine percent of the comments criticized regulations. Most complaints targeted the Agriculture Department, which received 2,175 comments. Conservation was next with 658, then Public Safety with 236 comments. Finally, the Health and Senior Services department received 201 comments. Before the website was established, constituents always had the option to complain to elected officials, said Lael Keiser, an MU political science professor. That’s part of the basic relationship between representatives and who they represent. No MO Red Tape just makes commenting more accessible. The governor’s goal is to reduce regulations. One way he could do that is through appointing new heads to the state’s agencies, Keiser said. Assuming the appointees share the governor’s view of less government interference, they’ll review the statutes and determine which regulations to throw out. You can view the comments constituents made on specific regulations here. So how does 7.5 million words of regulations stack up in dictionaries? Greitens claimed the regulations would fill 40 dictionaries. That allots roughly 187,500 words per dictionary. We got no response from Merriam-Webster in our quest to find a definite number of words in one of its dictionaries. The Oxford English Dictionary’s fact page says the second edition’s entire text had 59 million words in just 336 pages. This figure dwarves the number Greitens used, but his office never clarified which dictionaries they were referring to. They also didn’t specify if ""words"" meant individual entries in the dictionary, or every word on the page. In a Facebook post, Greitens said, ""When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations. That’s more than 7.5 million words; it’s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations."" The word count of the Oxford dictionary — 59 million — blows Greitens’ estimate of the regulations’ word count out of the water. We didn’t get a response from the governor’s office, so it’s unclear which dictionary he referred to, and whether ""words"" meant every word on the page or individual entries. Still, his point is valid: The Missouri Code of State Regulations is a huge document capable of filling many dictionaries. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA16EC0>],/factchecks/2017/nov/15/eric-greitens/greitens-makes-mostly-accurate-claims-about-missou/

Blogger misleads in post tying a Roy Moore accuser to Democrats, Doug Jones
","In response to the Washington Post article about Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore having relationships with teenage girls in the past, some articles surfaced accusing one of the women of having political motivations. The conservative website Activist Mommy said that Deborah Wesson Gibson, who said Moore solicited dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s, has worked for national Democrats. The website also said that Gibson is supporting Doug Jones, the Democrat running against Moore in the Dec 12 special election. (Gibson told the Post that she was 17 when Moore asked her out on dates that did not progress beyond kissing.) ""Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent,"" states the headline Nov. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Activist Mommy story states that Gibson ""is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones. .... social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC."" The website states that Gibson is a sign language interpreter who has interpreted at rallies for former Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. We found more details in a report from the Alabama Media Group, AL.com, which stated that Gibson owns an interpreting company, Signs of Excellence, and linked to photos posted on its Facebook page showing her interpreting for Clinton as well as Biden. Fox News showed additional photos on Signs of Excellence’s Facebook page that included Gibson interpreting for U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy’s 2016 Senate bid and appearing with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, both Florida Democrats. Reached at her Signs of Excellence business phone number in Florida on Nov. 13, Gibson declined to comment. Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told PolitiFact that Gibson and her company never received payment from the DNC. The Activist Mommy website shows only a little information linking Gibson to Jones, the Democrat running against Moore. But the information doesn’t show Gibson actively campaigning for him. The site shows Gibson shared a Sept. 20 statement on Facebook by Jones’ campaign announcing that Biden would appear on his behalf. ""I was honored to interpret for Vice President Biden in the fall of 2012!"" she wrote in a comment, including a photo of her alongside Biden. The website also showed that she shared a story by New York Magazine stating that Democrats have a chance to beat Moore. Gibson, a Delray Beach, Fla., resident, is a long-time registered Republican voter in Palm Beach County. She initially registered without any party affiliation in April 1995 and then switched her registration to Republican in December 1995, according to Susan Bucher, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. She has since remained registered as a Republican. Gibson voted in the presidential preference primary in March 2016 and in the general election in November 2016. We emailed the Activist Mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, and told her that we didn’t see evidence on her website that Gibson was actively campaigning for Jones. She did not provide additional evidence to bolster her claim. Sebastian Kitchen, a spokesman for Jones’ campaign, told PolitiFact that Gibson has played no role in Jones’ campaign. ""Her name is nowhere in our volunteer database, we have no indication she ever contributed,"" he says. ""We have no evidence whatsoever that she had anything to do with our campaign."" Our ruling The Activist Mommy website states in a headline ""Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent."" The website is referring to Deborah Wesson Gibson, who owns a sign language interpretation company. The company’s Facebook photos show that Gibson has interpreted speeches for Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Biden. The website also states that Gibson worked for the DNC; however, a spokeswoman for the DNC says that it never paid Gibson or her firm. The article’s evidence is weak to link Gibson to Jones. Two Facebook shares do not prove that Gibson is actively campaigning for Jones, and the campaign says she has played no role.

How often does Gov. Scott Walker, seeking re-election in 2018, hold events open to the public?
","Gov. Scott Walker has repeatedly been criticized for not being accessible to the general public. In 2013, state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, went extreme, saying Walker ""hasn't done a public event this entire year."" That rated Pants on Fire. We noted a number of events, such as a Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda attended by hundreds of people (including a few who booed during Walker’s remarks). In 2016, we rated as True a much narrower statement from state Rep. Dana Wachs, D-Eau Claire, that Walker's ""listening sessions"" were ""invite-only and excluding the press."" As he traveled Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asked various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But these events -- held by Walker, rather than him attending events staged by others -- were not open to the public or to the press, only to people who were invited. Now the 2018 campaign for governor is in full swing, with Wachs among seven Democrats hoping to challenge Walker. And the attacks on Walker’s accessibility are returning. On Nov. 3, 2017, Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, was interviewed on ""The Devil’s Advocates,"" a liberal radio talk show based in Milwaukee. During a discussion about Walker, host Mike Crute said the governor doesn’t often meet with the general public, ""not unless they’re invited, not unless they own a corporation. What about the town hall meetings or lack thereof, Scot?"" Ross replied: No, I mean, since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list. I mean, it is disgraceful, this guy -- I mean since 2015, we’re talking two years you have not been able to go to a Scott Walker event unless you open your checkbook or your organization is a lobbying firm and they open their checkbook. As we’ll see, Walker does attend events held by others that are open to the public, but at events he stages, access is more limited. Ross’ evidence When we asked Ross to back his statement, he reiterated that he was referring to events Walker hosts, not events held by others that Walker attends. He made these points: ""The closest you can find to Walker attending events that the public can attend without paying or being on a list were the holiday tree lighting ceremony … and his attendance at the last two Martin Luther King Day Jr. celebrations as a guest of the organizers."" ""Walker doesn't release his schedule publicly."" ""Even Walker's re-election events have all been held at private businesses that do not allow the public to attend."" In July 2016, One Wisconsin Now said it had analyzed campaign contributions of people attending Walker listening sessions during the first three months of the year, and they had made nearly 4,000 contributions totaling over $1 million, overwhelmingly to Republicans and conservatives. Walker’s response In response, Walker’s campaign cited these events attended by Walker: Holiday events: Attending the 2017 Memorial Day ceremony at Wood National Cemetery in Milwaukee and participating in Fourth of July parades, such as the ones in Wauwatosa and in Menomonee Falls in 2017. Other events not organized by Walker: Participating in events such as the first lady’s walk, Special Olympics torch run, ceremonies honoring law enforcement officers, groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings. Re-election tour: At 14 campaign announcement events around the state in 2017, people were asked to register ahead of time, but were not turned away if they hadn’t, according to the campaign. Walker’s campaign also cited a 9/11 event cosponsored by the governor's office and a September 2016 news event in Madison, noting Ross attended, in which Walker made an announcement about refinancing student debt. Ross said he heard secondhand about the event, at a UW Credit Union, and that it was not generally known or accessible to the public. Our rating Ross said: ""Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay an admission or be on an approved list."" It’s pretty clear that access to Walker is limited. His schedule is generally not made public ahead of time, making it difficult for people to go to events he attends. There are events that are open to the public, such as holiday ceremonies, that Walker attends. But in terms of events Walker himself holds, his campaign team cited campaign events at which registration is requested but not required, a 9/11 ceremony that the governor's office co-sponsored and a news event that had not been announced to the general public. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA4DC80>],/factchecks/2017/nov/15/scot-ross/how-often-does-gov-scott-walker-seeking-re-electio/

Given Roy Moore's troubles, could Luther Strange run as a write-in candidate in Alabama?
","With Republican Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore reeling from allegations of sexual improprieties with teenaged girls in the late 1970s, political observers are chasing down all the angles for what could happen in the Dec. 12 special election. One key question is this: Could Luther Strange, the appointed senator who lost to Moore in the Republican runoff earlier this year, still seek the Senate seat? ""I think Luther Strange would be a strong candidate for a write-in,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on Meet the Press. ""But a write-in is very difficult, let's face it."" This possibility also came up during a segment of CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper. There, conservative pundit Amanda Carpenter said the task may be more than just difficult. ""There are ‘sore loser’ laws that would bar Luther Strange from pursuing a seat, having already lost the primary,"" said Carpenter, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In a tweet sent after her appearance on CNN, Carpenter said the state does have a sore loser law but asked her followers, ""Can someone definitively say whether that allows a primary loser to run a write-in campaign?"" She later tweeted, ""I understand Strange could not appear as a printed choice on ballot but a deliberate write-in campaign seems subject to challenge."" (Carpenter did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)   With a sitting U.S. senator pushing the idea of a Strange write-in campaign, we at least wanted to see if it is possible, or if Strange is barred from pursuing the seat in any way. The answer is there is an opening for Strange, legally. We’ll walk you through how, and the other electoral machinations that are possible. No. According to Alabama Code 17-6-21(c) any withdrawal must occur at least 76 days before Election Day. By now, it’s too late to print new ballots, and several hundred ballots listing Moore have already been cast, officials say. No. He would be fine as long as he runs as a write-in candidate. Alabama does have a ""sore loser"" law that prevents primary losers from making a second run in the same election as an independent. However, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill has told several news outlets that the law applies only to names printed on the ballot -- a scenario that is now moot because the ballot text is already set. Merrill made clear in those interviews -- and experts agree -- that the sore-loser law would not prevent Strange from running as a write-in candidate. ""There are no existing stipulations that prohibit a candidate from being elected despite having unsuccessfully run for a party’s nomination, which would normally apply due to Alabama’s sore loser law,"" the Alabama secretary of state said in a statement.   Moore’s name would remain on the ballot, but votes cast for him would not count. (This would also be the case if the state Republican Party officially disowned Moore’s candidacy, something they have not done as of this writing.) If Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or any write-in candidate were to receive the most votes of any candidate -- including Moore -- they would be the winner. If Moore gets the most votes, however, the situation gets murkier. Merrill told Fox News that under that scenario, the election would be declared ""null and void,"" and the governor, Republican Kay Ivey, would schedule a new special election, starting the whole process again. However, ""I am not sure that's accurate under state law,"" said Derek T. Muller, a Pepperdine University law professor who has written about the Alabama scenario. Muller has written that there are two approaches that have generally been taken in situations like this. One is known as the ""American rule."" Under that system, the votes for any deceased, withdrawn, or ineligible candidate would not be counted, and the election would be declared null and void. The other is known as the ""English rule."" Under this system, the ineligible candidate would also not have their votes counted, but in this case, the second-place finisher would win. Muller’s research found that Alabama has previously used the American rule, but in 2014, the legislature unanimously passed HB 62, which added language about withdrawn candidates, saying that the canvassing board ""may not certify any votes for the candidate."" To Muller, ""that means that candidate cannot receive the most votes. And that means the ‘American rule’ is not at play."" In other words, if Muller’s interpretation is correct, Jones would win even if Moore secured the most votes after withdrawing or being disowned by the party. That conflicts with what Merrill had said on Fox News. We did not hear back from the secretary of state’s office to clarify this point. For the record, Strange said on Nov. 13 that it was ""highly unlikely"" that he would run for the seat in the wake of the revelations about Moore. And on Nov. 14, Moore sent a tweet that didn’t sound like a candidate looking to leave the race. ""Alabamians will not be fooled by this #InsideHitJob. Mitch McConnell's days as Majority Leader are coming to an end very soon. The fight has just begun,"" he tweeted. Alabamians will not be fooled by this #InsideHitJob. Mitch McConnell's days as Majority Leader are coming to an end very soon. The fight has just begun. https://t.co/unVysRKDKz   Carpenter said, ""There are ‘sore loser’ laws that would bar Luther Strange from pursuing a seat,"" because he lost the primary to Moore. Alabama does have a ""sore loser"" law that prevents primary losers from making a second run in the same election as an independent or with another party. But the consensus is that this law applies only to names printed on the ballot -- a scenario that is now moot because the ballot text is already set. Carpenter said as much in a subsequent tweet but added that a write-in candidacy could face legal challenges. Winning a write-in campaign faces long odds, but the bottom line is that Strange could make the attempt if he wishes. We rate Carpenter's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE20240>],/factchecks/2017/nov/14/amanda-carpenter/given-roy-moores-troubles-could-luther-strange-run/

How unpopular is the Obamacare individual mandate?
","While President Donald Trump was overseas, he urged on congressional Republicans who were forging ahead with their tax plans.  ""I am proud of the Republican House and Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes and reform,"" Trump tweeted Nov. 13. ""We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair and highly unpopular Individual Mandate in Obamacare and reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35 percent with all of the rest going to middle income cuts?"" I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts? From Trump's tweet to the Senate Republicans' ears, apparently.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., emerged from a closed-door Republican caucus meeting Nov. 14 saying, ""We’re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful."" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repeal would reduce deficits by more than $300 billion over 10 years, although about 13 million fewer people would not have health insurance. The health care law’s requirement that most people have coverage has long stuck in Trump’s throat. We wondered if the mandate is ""highly unpopular,"" as he said. The polling shows that it is the least popular of the Affordable Care Act’s changes, but how people feel about it depends on how you frame the question. When asked simply if they like or don’t like the mandate, as many as two-thirds of the people say they don’t. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 63 percent had an unfavorable opinion in November 2016. An Associated Press/NORC poll in January 2017 came back with 36 percent in favor, 13 percent who didn’t care one way or the other, and 50 percent who opposed it. The White House press office noted a February 2017 YouGov poll that found that 34 percent favored including the mandate in any bill to replace the Affordable Care Act and 66 percent opposed it. The press office also pointed to similar results from an April 2017 Harris poll.   Public opinion became more complicated around the time Republicans started voting on bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. As that process moved forward, more pollsters began asking people if they thought the individual mandate should stay or go. In March 2017, CNN/ORC gave respondents a list of options and asked them if they ""favor or oppose including that policy in a replacement bill."" Half, 50 percent, said the requirement to obtain coverage should be kept and about half, 48 percent, said it should be ditched. The Kaiser tracking poll in October 2017 took a different approach to the same topic, and got results similar to CNN/ORC. Kaiser set up the question this way: ""The Trump administration has made a number of changes related to the health insurance marketplaces. Do you approve or disapprove of the following actions made by the Trump administration?"" Kaiser described the policy as ""the federal government may stop enforcing the requirement that all individuals have insurance or pay a fine."" Half, 50 percent, of the people said they approved of that, while 47 percent said they didn’t. Again, a split decision. An earlier Kaiser tracking poll triggered higher levels of support for enforcing the mandate. In August 2017, pollsters framed the issue in terms of ""President Trump taking actions to make the law (Obamacare) fail."" Put that way, only one-third, 31 percent, said they wanted Trump to stop enforcing the mandate, and two-thirds said it should be enforced. Broadly speaking, in the context of getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, most polls show that about half of the public opposes the mandate and about half supports it. Obamacare has many moving parts that interact with each other. The individual mandate has a particularly strong tie to the law’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The rationale is that if the government is going to force insurance companies to cover everyone, then it must deliver a big insurance pool with a lot of healthy people in it. (There might be other ways to get to more or less the same place, but this fact-check is about the mandate.) The pre-existing conditions protection is popular. In the November 2016 Kaiser poll, nearly 70 percent of the public supported that piece of the puzzle. But only 35 percent liked its evil twin, the individual mandate. In 2014, the Kaiser Family Foundation probed what people know about the mandate and found that opinions were ""malleable."" ""When people were told that most people already fulfill the mandate with coverage they get through an employer or government plan, or that people would not have to pay the fine if buying insurance would take up too large a share of their income, support increased to 6 in 10,"" said Liz Hamel, director of Kaiser’s public opinion research team. Hamel told us that attitudes about the mandate have shifted as overall support for Obamacare has grown. Republican views have largely held steady, but independents have warmed to the law, and Democrats even more so. ""Democrats in particular have rallied around the ACA in the past year as it has come under threat of repeal or dismantling by executive order,"" Hamel said. ""In the current political context, people who support the ACA are willing to defend even the pieces of it that they don’t like rather than see the whole law undermined or repealed."" Trump said the individual mandate is ""highly unpopular."" As recently as February 2017, a YouGov poll found that 65 percent of people opposed it, a finding that is consistent with earlier polls from other organizations. That’s a fair sign of the provision’s unpopularity. On the other hand, when people were given more details about the mandate, they had a more favorable view, as high as about 60 percent. And in the context of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the most recent polls found the public generally split 50/50 on whether to keep the mandate in force. Public opinion about the individual mandate is not a simple black-and-white choice. As a leading expert explained, people might not love it, but they are willing to live with it.

No, the Washington Post Roy Moore reporter doesn't have a history of 'faking'
","A website seeking to discredit sexual assault allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is digging up the alleged criminal record of a Washington Post reporter who helped break the story. ""WaPo reporter who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of ‘faking,’ "" read the headline on 100percentfedup.com. The headline on the story might make you think the reporter, Stephanie McCrummen, has a past of ""faking"" her news stories. But the details in the post aren’t related to journalism: They highlight McCrummen’s ""public criminal records in multiple states stretching across four time zones,"" including writing a ""fake check."" ""When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldn’t her character come into question when it comes to making a 40-year-old sexual allegation against one of the most-hated, Steve Bannon-backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?"" the blogpost reads. The story was shared over 24,000 times and cited a 2011 Red State blog post that similarly sought to discredit McCrummen following a report that was critical of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Again, none of the charges speak to McCrummen’s journalistic integrity. The only criminal violation and ""faking"" related to a bounced check written 25 years ago when McCrummen was in college, while the rest of her ""history"" encompassed traffic infractions. McCrummen was an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1992 when she wrote a $6.93 check that bounced. ""That was a bounced check was for groceries while Stephanie was in college, which she paid back,"" said Kristine Coratti, vice president of communications at the Washington Post, in response to our email inquiry to McCrummen. McCrummen pleaded guilty to the criminal misdemeanor charge, appeared before a magistrate and paid it off, alongside a $50 fee, according to James Stanford, the Orange County Superior Court clerk. The blogpost then pivots to McCrummen’s traffic offenses, the first of which was for speeding in Scottsdale, Ariz. ""In 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges,"" the post reads. ""After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction."" Traffic offenses can be criminal if the driver is found driving without a license or the excessive speed was not prudent for the conditions. But the court authorities doubt this was the case. ""If it was criminal it would probably still be in the records because those are retained longer than civil traffic case, but we just can’t know for sure,"" said Jennifer Ilten, executive secretary at the Scottsdale city court. Heather Murphy, communications director at the Arizona Supreme Court, said the court where the fine was paid wasn’t a ""criminal court,"" but rather, municipal. Murphy confirmed that McCrummen owed -- and paid -- $321.30, according to court records. ""The fine is fairly typical of a civil traffic violation for speeding or another moving violation, but I cannot state that as fact,"" Murphy said. ""This is not driving without a license or DUI – those fines begin in excess of $1,000. ""Even knowing the fare amount, a big chunk of that could have been the collection fees,"" Ilten said. ""It was probably a lesser charge."" Murphy also explained that FARE enforcement is much less sinister than the post made it sound. It usually occurs when a person doesn’t receive a citation because it went to an old address. A new citation is mailed to the new address when discovered. In this case, the ticket was entered for collection on Oct. 4, 2010, and paid in full on Oct. 23, 2010. The other two traffic tickets both occurred in Virginia and had been wiped from the courts. In Fairfax County, the post reported McCrummen failed to obey a highway sign -- an infraction, not a criminal offense. The same goes for Prince William County; the post said McCrummen drove at 46 miles an hour in a 25 mile per hour speed zone. That’s also not a criminal offense. Coratti declined to comment on McCrummen’s traffic infractions. A 100percentfedup.com blog post said McCrummen ""has a criminal history of ‘faking.’ "" The faking, here, isn’t really faking at all -- and certainly not in a way that would question the veracity of this report. The reporter in question wrote a bounced check while in college in 1992 for $6.93. The reporter paid back the money and a $50 fee. Case closed.

Story tying Roy Moore accuser to Obamas is fake
","Conservative websites are firing back about the women who accused Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of dating teenagers when he was an adult. The Washington Post broke a story that four women said Moore pursued them when they were teenage girls and he was in his 30s. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, is running in a Dec. 12 special election against Democrat Doug Jones. The Last Line of Defense website says in a Nov. 11 headline, ""Second Roy Moore Accuser works for Michelle Obama right now."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article states that ""Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore ‘groped her in the alley behind the’ church they both attended in 1957. The article then uses an alleged quote by Dourif on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show: ""It was the most horrifying moment of my life,"" she said. Dourif was not a guest on Rachel Maddow and never gave that quote. The website also falsely states that Dourif is employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at a Washington mansion. ""This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that ‘Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif,' "" states The Last Line of Defense. We searched the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, and found no mention of Dourif. There are several signs that the The Last Line of Defense article is fake news. First, Fiona Dourif is an actress born in 1981, so it would have been impossible for someone to molest her decades earlier. (Dourif played the role of Nica Pierce in the horror movies Cult of Chucky and Curse of Chucky.) Secondly, Moore would have been 10 years old in 1957. Third, a disclaimer on the Last Line of Defense’s website states: ""America’s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth.

The website was created by Christopher Blair who previously told PolitiFact he designed his parody site to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. We messaged Blair on Facebook to ask about his post on Dourif ""You're fact-checking fiction,"" he said. ""There are satire disclaimers on every post.""

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Chris King']","
Do Hispanic entrepreneurs often start three times as many businesses as white males?
","Chris King, a self-proclaimed ""progressive entrepreneur,"" tied Florida’s economic well-being to the prosperity of immigrants at a recent forum with fellow Democratic candidates for governor. King offered an eye-popping statistic comparing Hispanic immigrants to working white men to prove his point. ""Well, Hispanic entrepreneurs, those who have immigrated from Spanish-speaking countries, often start three times as many businesses as white males,"" King said at a forum hosted by the Florida Democratic Party on Oct. 28. ""So, we have a need that they fulfill, and this is a governor who is going to communicate that constantly."" We wondered about his statistic. A spokesperson for King’s campaign clarified that he was referring to the rate of growth in the number of businesses started by these demographics, not the raw number of total businesses started. After some digging, we found a lot of data that speaks to the fact that Hispanics entrepreneurs are opening businesses at a faster rate than the non-Hispanic white population nationwide. King campaign manager Zach Learner sent PolitiFact Florida a few pieces of evidence to support this claim, but most of the data is almost a decade old or does not speak to King’s exact wording. Remember: He was comparing the growth of businesses started by Hispanic entrepreneurs, which includes men and women, to white men. We asked the King campaign to clarify whether the candidate was referring to Hispanic immigrants, that is Hispanics who were not born citizens of the United States, or Hispanic entrepreneurs, which could include immigrants and nonimmigrants. We did not hear back. But we found that the talking point holds up with either reading. First, we turned to the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Survey of Entrepreneurs, the most up-to-data from the Bureau. This survey, which started in 2014, attempts to produce yearly estimates on businesses and business ownership by various demographic groups, and is meant to supplement the Survey of Business Owners, which is only conducted every five years. The Bureau defines Hispanic-owned businesses as those operating in the United States as 51 percent or more of their ownership to be by individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other Hispanic or Latino origin. Based on the most recent information from the bureau, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses with paid employees (owned by men and women) increased by 4.6 percent from 2014 to 2015, or by about 299,000 to 313,000 businesses. In contrast, the number of businesses owned by white men grew by about 1 percent between the same time, from 2.91 million to 2.94 million. So, based on this data, Hispanic-owned businesses grew at a rate about three times faster than white men. But there are some problems with this comparison. First off, comparing the growth of businesses started by Hispanic entrepreneurs, which includes men and women, to white men, is not an apples-to-apples comparison. More important to know is that the Census Bureau hasn’t tabulated a male, non-Hispanic white category. In other words, there’s no way to separate white men and Hispanics who identify as white. ""Since Hispanic is defined as an ethnicity and white as a race, there can be double counting within the Hispanic category as the category includes ‘Hispanic white’,"" said Virginia Hyer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Census Bureau. So the rate could actually be higher than what King said. Hyer recommended comparing the ""non-Hispanic white"" category to the Hispanic category. Based on data from those categories, the number of non-Hispanic white-owned businesses grew less than 1 percent, from about 4.1 million to 4.2 million. And the number of Hispanic-owned businesses with paid employees increased by 4.7 percent. That means the Hispanic growth rate for businesses from 2014 to 2015 was more than three times the growth rate for non-Hispanic white businesses opened by men and women. We also looked at older data that covers a larger timeframe from the Census Bureau that support that overall notion that that Hispanic immigrants are opening businesses at a faster rate than white men. According to the 2012 Survey for Business Owners, the number of Hispanic entrepreneurs not born a citizen of the United States increased 28 percent between 2007 to 2012, from 645,000 entrepreneurs to 827,000. In the same time, the number of white entrepreneurs who are men only increased 6.5 percent, from 11.7 million to 12.5 million. (Unlike the American Survey for Entrepreneurs, the data is not tabulated by non-Hispanic whites, so the total count of white men could include Hispanics who identify as white.) The growth of Hispanic-owned businesses mirrors the country’s rising Hispanic population. Hispanics are the second-fastest growing racial or ethnic group, according to the Pew Research Center. Between 2000 and 2016, the Hispanic population grew from 35.7 million to 56.5 million, a jump of more than 50 percent. In a previous fact-check on a similar claim, Javier Palomarez, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the Hispanic population is aware of and responds well to Hispanic-led businesses, which might explain some of the growth. King said, ""Hispanic entrepreneurs, those who have immigrated from Spanish speaking countries, often start three times as many businesses as white males."" King’s campaign was referring to the rate of growth in the number of businesses started by these demographics. Whether looking at just Hispanic immigrants or Hispanic entrepreneurs, King has a point. The overall trend — that Hispanic-owned businesses are popping up faster than white non-Hispanic demographics — is correct. The growth rate from 2014 to 2015 for Hispanic-owned businesses was more than three times as much as the growth rate for non-Hispanic whites. Comparing the number the number of all Hispanic entrepreneurs to white men entrepreneurs is somewhat imperfect, as the tally of businesses owned by white men could be inflated by the businesses started by Hispanics who identify as white. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE3D800>],/factchecks/2017/nov/14/chris-king/do-hispanic-entrepreneurs-often-start-three-times-/

Dick Durbin wrong that GOP tax bill hasn't had independent vetting
","Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., offered several arguments against Republican efforts to pass a tax bill during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union, including the impact of the deduction for state and local taxes and its effects on the balance of federal revenues and spending. But one criticism was procedural, echoing earlier Democratic complaints that Republican bills to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act had been crafted behind closed doors and without normal steps such as committee hearings. ""And let me tell you, there is a reason why this plan has been prepared in secret, why it's not being scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as it is traditionally,"" Durbin told host Jake Tapper. ""It's because it doesn't add up."" Does Durbin have a point that the CBO has been unusually absent in this process? Not by the way ordinary viewers would hear it.  The Senate Democratic whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, appeared on CNN's State of the Union on Nov. 12, 2017. The CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching office, best known for its detailed analyses of pending legislation. However, there’s one exception to CBO’s role in vetting proposed legislation: tax bills. That duty falls instead to a similar, nonpartisan congressional office known as the Joint Committee on Taxation. ""The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the Joint Committee (on Taxation) to provide revenue estimates for all tax legislation considered by either the House or the Senate,"" the committee’s website explains. ""Such estimates are the official congressional estimates for reported tax legislation."" And by the time Durbin had made his comment to Tapper, the joint committee had already published analyses of the House version of the tax bill. On Nov. 9, the committee published an analysis of the bill’s revenue impact. Two days later, the committee published two other analyses, including one on how the bill would affect various segments of the income spectrum. The joint committee ""has scored versions of both the House and Senate bills,"" said Eric Toder, a co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""And they are the official scorekeepers for tax legislation."" As it happens, CBO has also published one analysis of the bill, addressing estimated deficits and debt. But even this is based heavily on the Joint Committee on Taxation’s work, said Douglas Elmendorf, a former Democratic-appointed CBO director who now serves as dean of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. The joint committee ""provides the official estimates to Congress of the effects of proposed changes in the Internal Revenue Code,"" Elmendorf said. ""When a tax bill is voted out of committee, CBO releases an official cost estimate because CBO’s statutory responsibility is to provide estimates for all bills voted out of committee – but that estimate is simply JCT’s numbers with a CBO letterhead, and with due credit given to JCT in the text of the estimate."" In other words, Elmendorf said, ""the Republicans are doing their duty."" When we contacted Durbin’s office, spokesman Ben Marter pointed to a narrower interpretation of Durbin’s words. He said that in the Senate, Republicans have a potential problem with the Byrd rule, which determines whether a bill can be taken up under ""reconciliation,"" a process that effectively requires only 51 votes rather than 60 votes for passage. That violation would have to be fixed before their bill can move in the Senate, but the ""fix"" to address future revenue projections ""is being written in secret, and we likely won’t see that until the bill is on the floor in the form of a substitute amendment, as they did with their health care bill,"" Marter said. Such a substitute amendment would become the bill, Marter said, and under the budget resolution, Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., ""could waive the requirement for a full score analysis before it’s voted on."" An important point to remember about the Durbin team’s analysis: It’s based on speculation about future events. Durbin’s literal words gave viewers a different story -- that the Republicans are already blocking CBO from scoring the bill -- and that is incorrect on at least two levels. Durbin said the Republican tax bill is ""not being scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as it is traditionally."" Under the most obvious interpretation of that statement, Durbin is incorrect. The nonpartisan analysis for tax bills is actually a task handled by the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the committee has been actively analyzing the Republican tax bills. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC61A0C0>],/factchecks/2017/nov/13/richard-durbin/dick-durbin-wrong-gop-tax-bill-hasnt-had-independe/

Rep. Joaquin Castro claims TPS end will lead to $164B GDP loss over a decade
","Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro claimed the U.S. economy would be negatively impacted if the Trump administration eliminated an immigration protection mostly benefitting Central Americans. The U.S. government routinely reviews whether to extend or terminate a country’s Temporary Protected Status designation, applied to countries with ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters, epidemics and other extraordinary, temporary conditions preventing the safe return of their nationals. Opponents of this status argue that while the protection is intended to be temporary, some designations are continuously renewed, allowing some recipients to stay in the country for many years. But Castro said ending it would come at a real cost of lost workers. ""Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade,"" Castro tweeted on Nov. 1, ahead of the deadline for the U.S. government to decide on the current TPS status for Honduras and Nicaragua. Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade. We must #SaveTPS. The United States on Nov. 6 decided to end Nicaragua’s designation, effective in 2019. Honduras’ designation, set to expire Jan. 5, 2018, was extended until July 5, 2018, because the Department of Homeland Security said it needed more time ""to obtain and assess"" additional information. We wanted to know if Castro’s claim on gross domestic product losses was accurate. The Texas representative's tweet is based on a report from a left-leaning organization whose calculation included immigrants’ potential lost earnings and industry chain reactions. Another group’s estimates, without industry output calculations, found a lower GDP loss of $45.2 billion. Castro’s office told us the congressman’s claim stemmed from an October report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. The group supports the designation, which is currently in effect for 10 countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Immigrants living in the United States illegally as well as individuals on a valid nonimmigrant visa may apply for Temporary Protected Status if they meet certain criteria. Receiving the protection allows them to get work permits and avoid deportation, but does not lead to lawful permanent resident status. The center focused on GDP losses tied to recipients from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the countries with the most beneficiaries. TPS holders from those three countries ""are employed at high rates,"" and are ""key contributors"" to the industries of construction, restaurant and other food services, landscaping services, child care, and grocery stores, the report said. The group’s analysis is based on estimates from the Center for Migration Studies of New York of about 302,000 TPS beneficiaries from those three countries (estimated using recent census data). If an estimated 244,200 beneficiaries from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti are removed from the workforce, the United States would lose $164 billion in GDP over the next decade, the Center for American Progress report said. The calculation derives from a broader, separate study on GDP loss resulting from the removal of unauthorized workers in the United States. The researchers multiplied the number of employed TPS recipients with the losses associated with each unauthorized worker. ""By both assuming that the skill distribution of the workforce with TPS reflects that of the broader unauthorized workforce and expressing data in 2013 dollars, this analysis reflects a conservative estimate,"" the report said. The only other estimate of the potential consequence of ending this program that we could find was even more conservative. An April report from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimated a much lower GDP loss over a decade — $45.2 billion — without the wages of an estimated 190,000 TPS individuals from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti. Nicole Svajlenka, coauthor of the Center for American Progress analysis, said her team’s numbers are much higher because they considered ""all that goes into a GDP, which is beyond earnings."" ""We take into account workers’ educational attainment, nativity, and work experience as well as the industry composition to determine what would change if that worker was removed,"" Svajlenka said. ""Basically, we’re simulating some chain reactions — without these workers, some industries would shrink, other workers would shift, etc."" Several researchers we reached out to said they had not done their own, independent analysis on this issue, but did not challenge Center for American Progress’ findings. David Dyssegaard Kallick, director of immigration research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, said it is sound to look at industry output when thinking about GDP loss. ""GDP, after all, is about measuring total output in the economy,"" he said. The center’s GDP estimates can also be seen as conservative ""since they do not take into account impacts associated with the likely withdrawal of a significant number of U.S.-born children of TPS holders,"" said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an associate professor in the UCLA Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. He added that TPS workers are also supporting the people hiring them, helping them generate profits. Many TPS holders also bought houses and have mortgages, said Hinojosa-Ojeda.
  Castro tweeted, ""Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade."" Castro accurately cited GDP loss reported by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. But at least one other report pegged a GDP loss three times as small, $45.2 billion. The report Castro used calculated lost earnings and impact on industries, the other report only looked at lost wages.

How would the GOP tax bills affect families strapped from battling cancer?
","A conservative group is spending $3 million on a television ad campaign in 35 congressional districts -- including districts in California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin -- arguing that a family that was nearly ruined financially by the father’s bout of cancer would benefit from a Republican tax proposal. The series of ads -- run by the American Action Network, which describes itself as a center-right group advocating policies based on freedom and limited government -- features Kendra Sroka, a working mother living in Michigan with her husband and two children, according to the group. One version of the ad, targeted to constituents of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and tweeted by the group, features this narration: ""Shortly after my husband got cancer, I lost my job. We were lucky to make it through. But we spent our life savings just to get by. So we’re glad Congress has released a plan that helps families like ours by cutting middle-class taxes. An independent analysis shows a typical family saves $1,200, and the plan closes loopholes while keeping tax rates the same for the rich. That’s fair. So thank Elise Stefanik. She has a plan to cut taxes for middle-class families like mine."" Thank @RepStefanik, she is working to cut taxes for middle-class families. https://t.co/3cYkjmYzPS pic.twitter.com/JNtgnQldci   We wondered whether the ad was justified in saying that the Republican tax bill would help a family that suffered such a serious health scare. Tax experts we checked with were skeptical. That’s because whatever you may think the Republican tax bill may provide in tax cuts -- a question of some dispute -- it also includes a provision that would strike the medical expenses deduction, which is almost perfectly tailored for a situation like the Sroka family’s. (Asked for this article whether the family had used the medical expense deduction, Sroka referred us back to the American Action Network; the group declined to provide further information about the family's past tax decisions.)   In general, more Americans would benefit from the tax changes than not, as we’ve noted -- just not every American. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, 61 percent would see a tax decrease of at least $100 in 2019, and another 31 percent would see a tax change of less than $100 in either direction. That leaves 8 percent of tax filers, or roughly 14 million Americans, seeing a tax increase of at least $100. By 2027, 46 percent would see a decrease and 34 percent would see a change of less than $100, while 20 percent, or close to 40 million Americans, would see a tax increase. So it’s conceivable, even likely, that a family of four like the Srokas could come out ahead if you set their medical situation aside. But their medical situation is a focal point of the ad, so we felt that aspect deserved a closer look. About 9 million households, or 6 percent of tax filers, take the medical expense deduction, Gordon Mermin, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told the Associated Press. The Treasury Department estimates that the tax break costs $7.9 billion a year overall, while the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the figure to be $10 billion. To take advantage of the medical expense deduction, a taxpayer has to itemize rather than take the standard deduction, which for a married couple reduces taxable income by $12,700. Medical expenses can only be deducted once they exceed 10 percent of the household’s income. (The portion of medical expenses accounting for that first 10 percent of household income can’t be deducted; the amount above that first 10 percent can be.) Many taxpayers choose to take the standard deduction because they don’t have enough items they can deduct to reach the standard threshold. But one type of family that would have good reason to itemize is one that faces a lot of unreimbursed medical expenses, which is the situation the Sroka family was in, judging by Kendra’s comment that ""we spent our life savings just to get by"" after the cancer diagnosis. The ad doesn’t say how much the family spent battling cancer, but if the family earned $60,000 -- a mid-range income for a four-person household -- they could deduct every dollar over $6,000 in unreimbursed medical expenses they had that year. So, if the family had medical expenses of $18,700, they would benefit from itemizing. (That’s equal to the first $6,000 non-deductible expenses they’d need to qualify, plus the $12,700 they would have gotten automatically from the standard deduction.) They could also reach that threshold of $18,700 with a lower amount of medical expenses if they also had other deductions to rely on, such as the state and local tax deduction. And non-cancer-related medical expenses they would have counted as well. All told, it’s not inconceivable that the Srokas, facing a diagnosis as serious as cancer, could have been hit with expenses in that ballpark. According to the AARP, citing IRS figures, the average medical expenses claimed by taxpayers with incomes below $75,000 ranged from just below $10,000 to almost $15,000. The ad’s claim is ""a very questionable statement,"" said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business. ""Medical expenses could have wiped out most of their income so that they would have owed no income tax, especially if she lost her job too. So the scenario in the ad is not plausible. It doesn’t pass the smell test."" The American Action Network told PolitiFact that the point of the ad was not to focus on the medical expense aspect of the family’s situation, but rather on the broader point that having another $1,200 would ""unambiguously help a family’s budget, and in particular, those facing adverse circumstances"" of any kind. The group also touted the potential for the tax bill to expand the economy more generally. One important caveat: Two days after the American Action Network launched its ad campaign, the Senate released its version of the tax bill and -- unlike the House version -- it would preserve the medical expense deduction. The American Action Network ad said the Republican tax plan ""helps families"" like one in which a woman lost her job and then lost her life savings fighting her husband’s cancer. There’s a good chance that, if you ignore their medical situation, a family of four like the Srokas would have come out ahead under the Republican tax bill. However, it’s conceivable that the expenses they incurred fighting the cancer diagnosis could have enabled them to reduce their taxes even more -- an option that the House bill would take away. That would not be a factor in the Senate version of the bill, however.

Did bump stocks prevent more casualties in Las Vegas?
","Some legislators see the legal manufacture and use of bump stocks — found on 12 of the 23 guns in the Las Vegas gunman’s Mandalay Bay hotel room — as a loophole in firearms regulation. State Sen. Michael Williams, a Republican candidate running in Georgia’s gubernatorial primary, recently came out against any legislation banning the devices, which can be attached to a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon. To stress his point, he announced he would give away a free bump stock to a random person who enters the giveaway event. ""The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians,"" Williams said in a news release. ""In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence."" Williams continued: ""Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures (sic) due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control."" That didn’t sound right to us, because the basic point of a bump stock is to help someone shoot really fast. The device allows the recoil from firing a semiautomatic weapon to slide the firearm back and forth. The movement ""bumps"" the trigger against the shooter’s finger without having to manually squeeze the trigger for each shot. We should note that police have not yet said precisely which weapons were used in the shooting. But we wanted to look into the claim that the gunman would have hurt fewer people had he not had the ability to fire rapidly. Is this a popular expert opinion? So who are these experts? We reached out to Williams and his campaign but received no response. The campaign has previously pointed to a post from Legally Armed America — written by Paul Glasco, who reviews guns and gun products — that argued that a ban on bump fire stocks would be useless to prevent these kind of attacks. As part of our own research, we talked to five experts who said Williams is factually correct on one point about the nature of this attachment: Because because bump stocks use a weapon’s recoil to allow the user to fire rapidly and repeatedly, the use of a bump stock makes the weapon more difficult to control when firing. This decreases the weapon’s accuracy, which depends on a weapon’s steadiness. Two experts supportive of gun rights — United States Concealed Carry Association president Tim Schmidt and lawyer John Pierce — were not convinced bump stocks would have made the crime more deadly. They agreed that a more accurate weapon could have hurt more people, but they needed more information about the crime to come to a conclusion. But three of the five experts said the rapid gunfire is likely what made the recent shooting so devastating. Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in firearms, said the use of a semiautomatic weapon without a bump stock would have made a difference if the Las Vegas gunman was trying to hurt a specific person. ""When you don’t care who you hit, being a little more inaccurate doesn’t matter,"" Winkler said.  To be fair, Arthur Alphin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and West Point graduate, made the case to the Los Angeles Times that accuracy did matter, but so did the rapid fire. The weapon could have been held steady with a bipod, which was found in the gunman’s room.  If the gunman had been trained by military or law enforcement, an unaltered semiautomatic weapon could have been more harmful than one outfitted with a bump stock, said Rick Vasquez, a former assistant chief and acting chief of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ firearms technology branch. But given the gunman’s lack of formal training and the fact that the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest music festival was somewhat blocked in, ""any device that is going to spray a lot of ammunition is going to be more deadly,"" Vasquez said. ""He was shooting into a densely packed crowd of thousands of people,"" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist from Florida State University who studies the effects of guns on injuries and death in crimes. ""The main effect of using bump stocks in this particular situation was to increase the number of rounds the shooter could fire in a short period of time before police crashed into his hotel room, which increased the numbers of victims hit somewhat randomly."" The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Williams said many firearms experts have determined that the use of a bump stock in the Las Vegas shooting prevented more injuries and deaths than would have otherwise occurred had he not used a bump stock. Outside of a blog from a pro-gun rights group, we did not find ""many firearms experts"" making that argument. We did learn that bump stock devices tend to affect a weapon’s accuracy. But we found several firearms experts who attributed the high number of people injured and killed to the shooter’s ability to fire rapidly, which a bump stock would have amplified. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE48CC0>],/factchecks/2017/nov/13/michael-williams-georgia/did-bump-stocks-prevent-more-casualties-las-vegas/

Trump raised more dollars from small donations
","Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany wanted to highlight some good news: Trump’s ""underreported"" success with small dollar donations in the 2016 presidential election. She tweeted on Oct. 11, ""Underreported fact: President @realDonaldTrump raised more in small dollar donations than Obama in 2012 and than Clinton and Bernie combined!"" We hadn’t heard that, so we decided to look into it. Cassie Smedile, Republican National Committee national press secretary, said that McEnany got her information from a Washington Post article that cited a Campaign Finance Institute report. The institute used data from the Federal Elections Commission disclosure reports to analyze campaign contributions. It focused on donations from people who gave less than $200 over the course of the entire campaign to both the campaigns and the joint fundraising committees. The $200 limit comes from the FEC. A quirk in the campaign reporting process means the FEC only records each individual donor who donates more than $200, while tracking the sum of contributions of $200 or less to the campaigns.   This is important to remember, because over the course of the campaign, donors could have given smaller amounts repeatedly that added up to more than $200. These donors technically gave small amounts, but they would not be captured in the institute’s report because the report focused on donors who gave less than $200 total. ""I've reviewed the CFI report but I can't replicate their methodology, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the report,"" said Doug Weber, senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""I can’t match up the numbers for you, but the Campaign Finance Institute does good work,"" said Judith Ingram, press officer at the Federal Elections Commission. Here is the breakdown of how much each candidate received from small donors, according to the institute's report: Trump received about $239 million from donors who gave less than $200 in total. That amounts to  69 percent of the Trump campaign’s individual contributions; Hillary Clinton received about $137 million from $200-or-under donors. That made up 22 percent of the campaign’s individual contributions; Going back further, President Barack Obama received about $219 million from small-dollar donors in 2012, or 28 percent of his campaign’s individual contributions. In 2008, Obama received about $181 million, or 24 percent of his total individual contributions. So, according to the Campaign Finance Institute, Trump raised $20 million more from small-dollar donors than Obama in 2012 and $2 million more than Clinton and Sanders combined in 2016. A few more details: Obama ran unopposed in the 2012 Democratic primary election. Sanders was not the Democratic party nominee in 2016 and did not run in the general election. The report only looked at Sanders’ fundraising through June 30, 2016.   Aspects of the campaign calendar contributed to Trump’s success with under-$200 donors. Sanders, Obama and Clinton raised money over a longer period of time so that some of the small donors may have donated more than once and exceeded the $200 threshold. Trump, by contrast, raised more money in a shorter time frame. ""Because Trump raised most of his money over four months, fewer of his donors had this experience (of donating more than once). Even this caveat, however, does not negate the fact that his small donor numbers were record shattering,"" said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager at the Campaign Finance Institute. The institute looked at not only how much each candidate received, but also how much the candidates’ joint fundraising committees helped raise as well. Glavin said that the RNC and the Trump campaign made a deal and split the fundraising from committees. ""The main joint fundraising committee was the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which raised in 2016 $263 million,"" said Glavin. Here’s a breakdown of how much each campaign raised from donors who gave $200 or less, without the help of the joint fundraising committees, according to FEC reports: Trump raised $86.6 million, or 64 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Obama in 2012 raised $234.4 million, or 42 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Sanders raised $134.6 million, or 58 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Clinton raised $105.5 million, or 26 percent of the campaign’s total individual contributions. Rick Hasen, campaign finance legal scholar at University of California Irvine School of Law said, ""This seems like a correct tweet. The only caveat is the point at the end of the report about some donors being so enthused they went over the $200 threshold."" The Clinton campaign encouraged this enthusiasm in the fundraising emails they sent out to their supporters. This is an example of the language used in the emails: ""FEC policy is that only supporters who have contributed more than $200 are included on the record. Your support has been above average, but you're a few donations away from that threshold. Donate before Wednesday's deadline to get your support on the official record."" McEnany said Trump ""raised more in small dollar donations"" than his Democratic competitors. Trump, in conjunction with his joint fundraising committees, did raise more money from people who donated less than $200. Because McEnany did not mention what constitutes a small donation and that the institute also was looking at contributions to joint fundraising committees, we rate this statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9B8DF40>],/factchecks/2017/nov/13/kayleigh-mcenany/trump-raised-more-dollars-small-donations/

Ted Cruz says Obama administration prosecuted few people for lying during gun purchases
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that Barack Obama’s administration bears some responsibility for the mass shooter in a Texas town acquiring guns. In a late-night Nov. 6, 2017, interview with Shannon Bream of Fox News, the Republican senator said that he’d spent the day comforting residents of Sutherland Springs, where the shooter killed 26 people in a church. Cruz said he felt his anger rising on his return flight to Washington ""because,"" Cruz told Bream, ""this should have  been stopped beforehand. Under federal law, it was illegal for this individual to purchase a firearm. He had a conviction for a crime that’s punishable by more than a year in prison and he had a conviction for multiple domestic violence crimes. Both of those, it’s already ineligible. ""But several things happened,"" Cruz said. ""Number one, the Air Force, the Obama administration, didn’t report those convictions to the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) database. That’s an endemic problem; it’s a problem with the federal government, it’s a problem with the states. ""And so, when he went in to buy the guns, they ran the background check and they didn’t find it because it wasn’t in the database. But I’ll tell you we could have prevented this. In 2013, in the wake of Sandy Hook, I joined with Chuck Grassley, we introduced legislation, it was called the Grassley-Cruz legislation, and it was aggressive legislation targeting felons and violent criminals to stop them from getting guns."" Cruz went on: ""There were a couple elements of that legislation that were critical. One, it mandated that federal agencies including the Air Force report to the NICS because that was a problem back then. But two, and this is an even more critical piece, if it had been reported to the background database, when he went into Academy to buy this, these weapons, he lied on the forms. That is a felony to lie on those forms. The Obama administration didn’t prosecute those cases. In 2010,"" Cruz said, ""48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. They prosecuted only 44 of them."" Readers request fact-check We’re not checking all of what Cruz said though PolitiFact in Washington found Mostly False Cruz claim’s in the interview that Democrats filibustered legislation that would’ve resulted in the Texas church shooter being in prison rather than wreaking havoc. Readers asked us if Cruz was correct about the very few prosecutions of individuals for lying while buying a gun from a licensed dealer. Previous fact-checks A 1993 law requires a criminal history background check by the FBI or a state agency. If a potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the lead investigative agency in gun enforcement.  The automated national instant background check system began operating in 1998. Some perspective: In 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia reviewed federal reports before concluding that the Justice Department hadn’t been prioritizing perjury charges in connection with background checks for at least two administrations. During George W. Bush’s presidency, there had been 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year and some 15/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. In the first two years of Obama’s presidency, 8/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. By email, a Cruz spokesman, Phil Novack, told us Cruz drew on a 2012 federal report to reach his 2010 figures. Novack noted too that when Cruz made a similar claim in 2013, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post confirmed the declared 44 prosecutions based on information in the report. 2010 statistics In 2010, the report says, FBI background checks led to initial denials of 72,659 applications to purchase a gun--with 34,451 denials attributed to a person’s felony indictment or conviction and 13,862 due to the person being a fugitive from justice--48,313 combined. But most of those denials never made it to prosecutorial consideration. The report says the ATF overturned, canceled or chose not to refer for further investigation 71,410 denial cases sent its way by the FBI; some 4,732 cases were then referred to field offices for further review. Ultimately, the report says, 62 cases were referred for federal prosecution with 18 of those not taken up by a prosecutor--which leaves 44. Then again, that doesn’t mean 44 prosecutions proceeded. That’s because a dozen referrals were still pending action by a prosecutor as of Dec. 13, 2011, the report says. Otherwise, an accompanying chart shows that the 44 possible prosecutions would have been down from 77 prosecutions the year before and 105 in 2008--and prosecutorial referrals also had declined through those years. By phone, we asked the report’s author, Ron Frandsen, about the availability of more recent data. Frandsen, who works for the Missouri-based Regional Justice Information Service, said that to his knowledge, no analyses of post-2010 data have been funded. By email, Frandsen said that most likely, the 48,321 denied applications tallied for felony or fugitive reasons were found in FBI background checks after applicants failed to disclose such information on a form. ""FBI denials are referred to ATF, which investigates the cases deemed most worthy of possible prosecution. From the 2010 FBI denials, ATF referred 62 charges (against 33 people) to U.S. or state attorneys for possible prosecution,"" Frandsen said, involving nine different federal offenses and two to seven state offenses. Frandsen said Cruz was accurate in his reference to 48,000 denials. He said the reference to 44 prosecutions wasn’t accurate because the ""44"" from the service’s report refers to charges, not individual people, and those charges involved ""more than just felons and fugitives, and,"" Frandsen wrote, ""because some of the prosecutorial decisions were made by state attorneys."" There’s more data available, PolitiFact reporters have noted, in a 2013 analysis of federal weapons cases by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, based at Syracuse University. The analysis doesn’t mention background checks directly. But a chart lists 123 prosecutions in 2010 in which the lead charge was making false/fictitious statements in order to acquire a firearm or ammunition. The comparable count was 143 in 2011 and 170 in 2012, the chart states. The relevant law says it’s unlawful for anyone acquiring a firearm from a licensed dealer to knowingly make false or fictitious oral or written statements intended to deceive the seller about the sale’s legality. Explaining the few prosecutions Why has Uncle Sam seemingly been reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general provided several answers. It said ATF agents viewed the violations ""as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives"" and ""saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm."" The report also said that the cases lack ""jury appeal"" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation ""juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle."" Frandsen told us he hasn’t researched in depth why few violations get prosecuted. But, he said, such cases are hard to prosecute ""because the government must prove that the denied person intentionally failed to disclose a prohibition on the federal form (as opposed to just being unaware of what was on their record)."" Also, he said, there’s a belief that the main purpose of the background check requirement is to prevent a firearm transfer to a prohibited person--and the additional step of prosecution ""should be reserved for the most dangerous people, especially those with an extensive criminal history."" Our ruling Cruz said: ""In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns"" and the Obama administration ""prosecuted only 44 of them."" There may have been even fewer federal prosecutions of such felons and fugitives, figures indicate, though Cruz failed to note that this paucity wasn’t unique to one administration. It’s also worth clarifying that we don’t know if all 48,000 individuals knowingly misled the government. Few of the tallied background checks resulted in further investigation. We rate Cruz's claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Could Ted Cruz measure have prevented the Texas church shooting? Not likely.
","Reacting to the church shootings in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz said there could have been laws on the books to prevent what happened, had his opponents in Congress not defeated his proposal a few years ago. ""The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison instead of murdering those innocents in that Texas church,"" Cruz said on Fox News on Nov. 6. Cruz, a Republican, is talking about a failed amendment he co-sponsored to curtail an expansion of background checks and increase prosecution of people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. He has a point that the Democrats didn’t back it, but he fails to mention that every amendment on the 2013 gun control bill faced the same hurdle, and a Democratic one also fell short. While Democrats defeated his proposal, experts said it would not have made the crucial difference in this massacre for a couple of reasons. The Texas church shooter was discharged from the Air Force for bad conduct after he was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson's skull. Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction, but he got past the background check system because the Air Force failed to enter the shooter’s felony into the background check database. So when he purchased two guns at the San Antonio gun shop Academy Sports + Outdoors, both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When we asked Cruz’s office for details, they softened what Cruz originally said, saying his legislation would have ""increased the chances of preventing the Air Force error that led to the failure to submit the relevant information to NICS."" The amendment pushed for clearer guidance on submissions of federal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (mandated by NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) and required that federal agencies submit plans for making the information available. ""The only possible contribution may have been that the reporting requirement to the AG might have led the Defense Department and the Air Force to realize that the procedures they had in place needed enhancement,"" said Geoffrey Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. But the language was a near replica of President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013 memorandum to the Justice Department, which officials were already trying to implement. Molly Moran, who served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General from 2014 to 2016, said she and her colleagues at the Justice Department worked from 2013 until the end of Obama’s second term in implementing the memo. It made no difference in the Texas church shooting. The Air Force needed to submit the shooter’s 2012 court-martial, and it failed to do so. Cruz said on Fox that a lack of reporting of federal and state records to the background check system was a problem. But his legislation did not seem to make this easier. The amendment eliminated sanctions for states that failed to submit records and lowered the cap on grant money to help states submit them from $100 million to $20 million. The original bill from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would have expanded background checks on purchases from only federally licensed gun dealers to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. But the Grassley-Cruz amendment chucked the expansion of background checks and even allowed for the interstate sale and transportation of firearms. ""If anything, the only way this would have affected the Texas shooting would be to make it easier for the shooter to attack a church in a neighboring state instead,"" said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Cruz also summoned a familiar talking point against gun regulation that few background check lies (where felons say they are not felons) are prosecuted. His amendment created a task force to increase these prosecutions, but it did not mandate that the Justice Department prosecute all of them. Enhanced prosecution efforts still would not have put the shooter behind bars. Without the court-martial in the database, the shooter would still have passed the background check after marking that he was not a felon. ""He could have been prosecuted had his lie been known by prosecutors, but they had no reason to investigate this until after the shooting,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. Reid set a 60-vote threshold on all amendments to his Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 to prevent a situation in which the amendment passed by a bare majority and then was filibustered — by the Republican minority. Cruz’s amendment failed 52-48, with nine Democrats voting for it and two Republicans voting against (Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah). So did the bipartisan Toomey-Manchin background check amendment favored by Democrats, which got 54 votes. Experts said it was fair to call this a filibuster, though Reid attained the Senate's unanimous consent for the 60-vote threshold. ""The notion that the Democrats are responsible for the failure of this proposal ignores the fact that the GOP was filibustering the underlying bill, which had all the same provisions except the state-to-state expansion of gun rights and a requirement to expand background checks,"" Koger said. Cruz said, ""The Democrats filibustered the legislation that would’ve resulted in this shooter being in federal prison."" The amendment Cruz cosponsored, which was defeated largely by Democrats after failing to reach a 60-vote threshold, strengthened efforts to prosecute people who lied about their criminal histories to obtain firearms. But the shooter in this case wouldn’t have showed up as having lied because of the Air Force’s failure to report his felony. The Cruz proposal also aimed to facilitate reporting to the instant background check system with guidelines and deadlines for federal agencies, including the armed services. While similar action by the Obama Justice Department around the same time didn’t help, Cruz’s clarifications becoming law may have. But it’s impossible to say with any certainty. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE201C0>],/factchecks/2017/nov/10/ted-cruz/could-ted-cruz-have-prevented-texas-church-shootin/
