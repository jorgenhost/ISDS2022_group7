Rick Scott's political committee says CBO report describes Obamacare as jobs killer
","Before he was governor, Rick Scott spent millions attacking Obamacare. After he was elected in 2010, he continued to bash Obamacare, and in a new attack ad, his political committee portrays it as a jobs killer. Let’s Get to Work, Scott’s political committee, unveiled the ad March 24, 2014, and it is expected to run statewide starting March 27. The ad repeats snippets of Crist’s March 9 interview on CNN when he called Obamacare ""great."" Here’s part of the ad script: ""Great?"" the narrator says. ""News reports say 300,000 health plans cancelled. Obama says patients may lose their doctors. The federal government says less work hours for American jobs,"" the narrator says, as an apparent quote from a February Congressional Budget Office report appears on the screen: ""Obamacare will drive 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce."" Are 2.5 million Americans being driven out of the workforce due to Obamacare? The CBO report The Republican Party of Florida pointed to the February report by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper. The report has prompted numerous attacks about the impact of Obamacare and jobs -- the inaccuracies have varied depending upon the wording. This ad states that Obamacare will ""drive"" 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce, which could leave listeners with the impression that those folks will lose their jobs against their will. But that’s not what the CBO report says. The Florida Republicans quoted this line from the CBO report: ""CBO’s updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA."" Greg Blair, a spokesman for Scott’s re-election campaign, told PolitiFact Florida: ""The ad states what the report states – Obamacare will result in fewer work hours for American jobs."" The CBO report says that with Obamacare providing greater access to insurance on the individual market and subsidies to help pay for it, some Americans will decide on their own to work less. That’s different from being ""driven"" out of work, for example due to layoffs or being fired. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would ""reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive."" This would equal a ""decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,"" the report continued. ""By providing subsidies that decline with rising income and by making some people financially better off, the ACA will create an incentive for some people to work less,"" the report said. An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesn’t mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs or become unemployed. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job, while others may stop working entirely. Some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, previously told PolitiFact. ""Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,"" Sinclair said. ""But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing."" Our ruling Scott's TV ad says, ""Obamacare will drive 2.5 million Americans out of the workforce."" The ad suggests it is an actual quote in a February Congressional Budget Office report, but we didn’t find that quote in the report. The statement relates to a CBO report that says workers who can now receive subsidized insurance will cut back on hours equivalent to about 2.5 million full-time workers by 2024. The ad is misleading because the equivalent of those hours does not translate to 2.5 million actual workers, and by stating they will be driven out of the workforce suggests it’s against their will. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Let’s Get to Work, ""Charlie Crist on Obamacare: great"" TV ad, March 24, 2014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstMy-wu_yw&feature=youtu.be'), ('Congressional Budget Office, ""The budget and economic outlook 2014-2024,"" February 2014', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times The Buzz, ""New Rick Scott TV slams Crist for calling Obamacare ‘great,’"" \xa0, March 24, 2014', 'https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-Outlook2014_Feb.pdf'), ('PolitiFact, ""John Boehner says Obamacare is ‘expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs,’"" Feb. 5, 2014', 'No link'), ('PunditFact, ""Carlson: CBO says Obamacare will cut full-time jobs by 2.3 million,"" Feb. 5, 2014', 'http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/new-rick-scott-tv-ad-slams-crist-for-calling-obamacare-great/2171646'), ('PolitiFact, ""Cantor says CBO predicts Obamacare will cause ‘millions’ to lose jobs,"" Feb. 7, 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""NRCC says Congressional Budget Office predicts Obamacare will cost economy 2.5 million jobs,"" Feb. 14, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/05/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obamacare-expected-destroy-23-mi/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Details reveal distinction in Obamacare jobs claim,"" Feb. 24, 2014', 'No link'), ('Washington Post The Fact Checker, ""No, CBO report did not say Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs,"" Feb. 4, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/05/gretchen-carlson/carlson-cbo-says-obamcare-will-cut-full-time-jobs-/'), ('Interview, Kevin Cate, spokesman Charlie Crist campaign, March 24, 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview, former state Sen.

Rick Scott's political committee says Obamacare has led to 300,000 health plans canceled
","A new TV attack ad against former Gov. Charlie Crist zeroes in on Crist’s support for Obamacare. Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, unveiled the ad March 24, 2014. Scott’s campaign said it will spend $2 million on the statewide ad set to start running March 27. The ad repeats snippets of Crist’s March 9 interview on CNN when he called Obamacare ""great."" ""Great?"" the narrator says. ""News reports say 300,000 health plans canceled. Obama says patients may lose their doctors. The federal government says less work hours for American jobs,"" the narrator says, repeating Crist’s ""great"" comment. ""Great, Charlie? Obamacare may have been great for Charlie’s political career, but it’s not great for the rest of us."" Crist is a Republican turned independent who is now the Democratic frontrunner challenging Scott. There are a lot of claims about Obamacare in the ad, but we wanted to focus on one that has received considerable media attention in Florida: Were 300,000 health plans canceled? Florida Blue The ad flashed a picture of an October front page article in the St. Augustine Record about 300,000 plans from Florida’s version of Blue Cross Blue Shield, known as Florida Blue. In 2013, Florida Blue started sending letters to about 300,000 members that explained that the Affordable Care Act mandates that plans provide 10 categories of essential benefits. Some Florida Blue plans didn’t include those services, so those plans would be closed. But that didn’t mean those 300,000 members were stranded without insurance. The Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network obtained copies of letters received by Florida Blue consumers. The letters stated that due to the Affordable Care Act, the consumer’s particular plan ""will be closed"" and recommended another Florida Blue plan. ""To help ensure that you have continuous health care coverage, you’ll be enrolled in this health plan effective Jan. 1, 2014, unless we hear from you by Nov. 1, 2013."" The letters stated that consumers could choose a different Florida Blue plan. ""We’ll help you find a plan that’s right for you,"" the letter stated. What happened to the 300,000? There’s more to the 300,000 number than the ad suggests. ""It is important to note that the ‘300,000’ was a number that was being used when describing how many Florida Blue members could receive a notice that their policies would not be compliant with ACA requirements throughout all of 2014, if no extension was provided to these plans,"" spokesman Paul Kluding told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""In actuality, only 40,000 letters were mailed to members with Jan. 1, 2014, effective dates. Subsequent notices were sent to these members notifying them that their existing plans would remain active and unchanged through 2014."" In November, Florida Blue announced it was giving policyholders another year to keep their coverage after President Barack Obama asked insurers to allow customers who wanted to keep the old plans to keep them for an additional year. ""To date, most of the members in our pre-ACA plans have kept their plans,"" Kluding said. Former state Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist’s campaign, pointed to that decision by Obama and said, ""few if any Floridians will lose their current health insurance policies.""   Florida Blue helped about 60,000 move to the exchange -- those were members who would benefit from moving to Obamacare plans either due to subsidies, the new coverage or premiums, Kluding said. If their income was below 400 percent of the poverty level (below about $94,200 for a family of four, for example), they would have gotten a subsidy to buy insurance on the federal marketplace. Some of these people may end up paying more but getting more robust coverage. It’s unclear how many, if any, would simply stop buying coverage altogether. But since Obama offered the extension, it’s too soon for us to conclude what will ultimately happen to the majority of the 300,000 Florida Blue members. This 300,000 number has become a political football with varying degrees of accuracy depending upon how it is worded. ""Whether or not new plans are available (in some cases they are not and in others, as I said, they’re less desirable for consumers than those that were canceled), those policies were canceled as a result of Obamacare,"" Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair told PolitiFact in an email. ""This is the central component to the ‘if you like your plan you can keep it’ falsehood, which I believe was rated ‘lie of the year’ by PolitiFact."" The Republicans pointed to news articles from last fall after the initial news broke and before the extension. A Kaiser Health News article in October explained that while consumers were shocked by the cancellation notices, insurers were poised to place those with canceled policies on other plans. ""By all accounts, the new policies will offer consumers better coverage, in some cases, for comparable cost -- especially after the inclusion of federal subsidies for those who qualify,"" the article stated. The AP article in early November stated that at least 3.5 million Americans had received cancellations but were being transition to other plans. Our ruling Scott's TV ad says, ""300,000 health plans canceled,"" attributing the number to news reports. Last fall, Florida Blue started sending letters to 300,000 members stating that their plans didn’t comply with Obamacare and would be canceled. However, the ad omits key information here: Members were offered new plans that complied with the law. Obama later announced that people could keep their plans for another year and most of the Florida Blue members have kept their pre-Obamacare plans for now. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details, so we rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Let’s Get to Work, ""Charlie Crist on Obamacare: great"" TV ad, March 24, 2014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZstMy-wu_yw&feature=youtu.be'), ('Tampa Bay Times The Buzz, ""New Rick Scott TV slams Crist for calling Obamacare ‘great,’"" \xa0, March 24, 2014', 'No link'), ('Associated Press, ""Scott launches new TV ad ripping Crist,"" \xa0March 24, 2014', 'http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/new-rick-scott-tv-ad-slams-crist-for-calling-obamacare-great/2171646'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Canceled by Florida Blue?

Facebook meme blames Great Society for large rise in African-American fatherlessness
","A reader recently sent us a bare-knuckled Facebook meme about race and fatherhood. The meme features a photograph of President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose ""war on poverty"" agenda in the mid 1960s was known as the Great Society. Superimposed on Johnson’s image is the following text: ""Black children born without a father in the home rate pre-LBJ's 'Great Society' welfare system in 1964: 7 percent. Black children born without a father in the home rate post-LBJ's 'Great Society' 2014 = 73 percent. Hey, liberals, how's your 'Great Society' working out for the black family?"" We wanted to know if the meme’s numbers were right: Did the percentage of black children born without a father in the home rise from 7 percent before the Great Society to 73 percent today, and was it due to Johnson and the Great Society? As we researched this claim, we noticed a problem: There is no federal data on ""black children born without a father in the home."" Instead, we found two types of data that are similar -- but not a perfect fit. One is unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births. The other is the percentage of black children living without a father in the home. The first option addresses births, a key focus of the Facebook claim. But this figure ignores cases in which a couple isn’t married, but where the father is living in the home. The second option, by contrast, does address living arrangements, but it includes all children up to age 18, not those who were ""born"" that year. So to be as complete as possible, we’ll analyze both statistics here. Unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births In 1964, according to federal health statistics, 24.6 percent of births to non-whites were considered ""illegitimate,"" the term used for out-of-wedlock births at the time. In 2012, the percentage of black births that were made to unmarried black mothers was 72 percent. This is a large increase, and the more recent figure is more or less on target. However, the starting point in 1964 is higher than the Facebook post suggests. So the overall increase is more limited than the meme says. (Note: The 1964 figure was based on the ""non-white"" population, a category that includes Hispanics and Asian-Americans, while the 2012 figure was for African Americans only.) So if you use this measurement, the meme’s numbers are off. The percentage of black children living without a father in the home These figures offer even less support for the Facebook claim. According to Census Bureau data, about 20 percent of black children in 1960 were living with just a mother. The comparable figure for 2013 is 50 percent of black children living with a mother only. (The only pre-Great Society year for which data is available is 1960.) So this measurement, too, shows an increase. But the increase is two-and-a-half times bigger, not 10 times bigger, as the meme says, and it’s up by 25 to 30 percentage points, rather than the 66 points cited in the meme. When we checked with experts, we found additional problems of context and logic with the claim. Here are a few of them: Black families weren’t the only group to see an increase in single motherhood over the same time period Rates of fatherlessness for whites have always been lower than for blacks, but fatherlessness among whites still rose between 1960 and 2012. Six percent of white children lived in a single-mother household in 1960, a figure that rose to 18 percent in 2013. That’s a tripling, which was proportionately an even bigger percentage increase than what was observed for black children. We don’t really know how common black single parenthood was prior to the Great Society Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, said the official data on black marriage from the early- to mid-20th century is unreliable. It was not uncommon, he said, for black mothers to tell survey-takers that they were separated, when in fact they had never been married, he said. The data for white women is similarly misleading, since many young white women got married as teens and divorced a few years later -- a ""shotgun wedding"" pattern that doesn’t suggest long-term stability for children. This pattern would mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African-Americans may have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low. ""Welfare"" -- the implicit target of the meme -- existed well before the Great Society  The welfare rules of the 1960s may have imposed a ""marriage penalty"" on recipients -- benefits that could be earned as a single person would disappear once a recipient got married. But such a pattern should have become evident well before the Great Society. "" ‘Welfare’ was part of the New Deal in the 1930s,"" said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. ""It was designed for widows with kids who didn’t qualify for Social Security, but it soon became a single-parent program for divorcees and later unmarried mothers."" Correlation does not equal causation Just because rates of fatherlessness rose after Johnson and the Great Society doesn’t mean they caused the increase. Lots of other factors were at play. Besharov said the focus on Johnson is off-base. He said that the broader social currents of 1960s ""liberalization"" -- more permissive sexual mores, easier divorce laws and greater financial independence due to rising rates of female employment, for instance -- did play a role in higher rates of single-motherhood for all races, but ""if you define ‘the Great Society’ as the things Johnson did, then there was very little impact"" on single motherhood rates. Our ruling A meme circulating on social media said the percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7 percent in 1964 to 73 percent today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. There’s no federal data to back up the meme’s specific claim, but the most applicable statistics show an increase in black fatherlessness that is more limited, and the rise might have been even more modest still if the early-1960s data had been more reliable. In addition, the focus on Johnson and the Great Society is likely a red herring, since broader, societal factors are believed to have played a major role in rising rates of single-parenthood -- not just among blacks, but also among whites. The exaggerated statistics, combined with an ignorance of important context, leads us to rate the claim False.","[('Facebook post, received by PolitiFact in March 2013', 'http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1967.zip'), ('Statistical Abstract of the United States 1967', 'No link'), ('Statistical Abstract of the United States 1966', 'http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1966.zip'), ('Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Births: Final Data for 2012,"" Dec. 30, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Table CH-2: Living Arrangements of White Children Under 18 Years Old: 1960 to Present,"" accessed March 24, 2014', 'http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_09.pdf'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Table CH-3.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Kathleen Sebelius']","
Low cost insurance available with subsidies
","U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was in Atlanta recently, encouraging young Georgians to join a health insurance exchange before the March 31 deadline and suggesting that reasonably priced plans are out there. In a speech that later made it to YouTube, she said some Georgians can get a plan for as low as $105 a month. ""Here in Atlanta, if you’re 27 years old and make $25,000 a year, you can find a plan that would cost you $105 a month,"" she said. Sebelius acknowledged that some people might be skeptical. After all, she said, it’s hard to get a pair of decent running shoes or a monthly contract for cellphone service at that price. Knowing that what’s affordable to one person might be out of reach for another, we decided to run her statement on premium prices through the Truth-O-Meter. At HealthCare.gov, we were able to confirm that, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, such premiums do exist. We found, for example, that a 27-year-old living in Cobb County and making $25,000 a year can qualify for the lowest bronze plan and $105-a-month premiums. But there are several caveats to consider. The premium we found is after a monthly tax credit of $61. The maximum out-of-pocket expenses for that Cobb resident will be $5,200, which for some can be, or seem, cost-prohibitive. And lastly, plan costs can vary widely across the state. Information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows plans available to a 27-year-old living anywhere in Georgia, in some cases, for as low as $142 a month (basically catastrophic coverage), $179 a month (the lowest bronze plan), $208 a month (the lowest silver plan), $221 a month (second-lowest silver plan) and $242 a month (lowest gold plan). Should that same person qualify for a tax credit, he or she could obtain the lowest bronze plan for $103 a month and the second-lowest silver plan for $145 a month. The lowest bronze plan in the Atlanta area would be $105 after the tax credit, according to HHS. As of March 1, 139,371 people have actually signed up for a marketplace plan in Georgia. Of those, 85 percent qualify for federal subsidies, HHS data show. According to Region IV of HHS in Atlanta, qualifying health plan providers in Georgia are: Ambetter from Peach State Health Plan; Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield; Humana Insurance Co.; Humana Employers Health Plan of Georgia Inc.; and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Georgia. William Custer, the director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said, by comparison, the average monthly premium for a single person with an employer plan is $490, with 75 percent of the employees paying at least 25 percent, or $122 or more, out of their own pocket. Generally, group plans are richer than plans in the individual market, Custer said. But, he said, according to a Kaiser/HRET Survey from 2013, 43 percent of employer plans with an out-of-pocket maximum have an out-of-pocket max of $4,000 or more. For 12 percent, there is no maximum on the out-of-pocket, Custer said. Sebelius’ statement is ""true on the face of it,"" he said. ""There is a plan for $105, and there are other plans that offer more coverage with a modest increase in premiums,"" Custer said. A single person making $25,000 could buy a silver plan for $144 a month, regardless of where he or she lived in Georgia, even though the full premium could vary considerably and vary more here than in other states, he said. For example, a 25-year-old living in rural Miller County and making $25,000 a year can apply his or her subsidy, which is based on a silver plan, to a bronze plan and have coverage for $78 a month with a $4,000 deductible, he said. The Affordable Care Act limits out-of-pocket costs under any plan to $6,350 annually for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Humana offers a silver plan in the Atlanta market for $128 a month with an out-of-pocket maximum of $4,750, Custer said. But how will it play? ""Health insurance is expensive, so the costs of coverage for individuals may seem unaffordable even with the subsidies available,"" Custer said. John Crew, a health care consultant who primarily works in rural parts of Georgia, said the high deductible creates a plan that is not usable for many consumers. ""If someone making $25,000 a year purchases a plan with a $6,300 deductible, 25 percent of their gross income would go toward medical expenses if they ever needed significant health care services,"" he said. ""Basically, they have purchased catastrophic coverage,"" he said. ""Although preventive services are covered at no cost share to the patient, I don’t think that this plan would encourage the patient to get any sub-acute care."" Crew also pointed out something that gave us additional pause about Sebelius’ claim. A plan that may cost $105 a month in Atlanta can cost much more in other parts of the state. Why? In the Atlanta area, there are at least three health care companies offering insurance, so there is a consumer-friendly marketplace that drives prices down. In much of Georgia, Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only health care provider, so those seeking health care have to pay its prices, he said. A spreadsheet Crew sent PolitiFact Georgia with federal marketplace health care plans offered in Georgia highlighted the differences. The price for bronze plans in the five largest metro Atlanta counties ranged from $166 to $243 a month. In some counties with one health care provider, the bronze plans ranged from $305 to $360 a month. The top prices for gold plans in counties with one provider were about 50 percent higher than similar plans in metro Atlanta counties. Custer said it would be burdensome for anyone earning $25,000 to have to meet the full deductible. But in that circumstance, a person would likely be facing a serious health condition, he said. ""Without health insurance, they may not have access to adequate care at all,"" Custer said. Last year, HHS estimated that nearly 1.7 million Georgians were uninsured and eligible for coverage through the marketplace. Of those people, about 1.2 million, or 69 percent, had at least one full-time worker in the family, and 671,466, or 40 percent, were ages 19 to 34. Sebelius says, and data from HHS show, that health insurance is available to some Georgians for as little as $103 to $105 per month, with a qualifying tax credit. But for others, the premiums can be much higher. Some of these policies come with high deductibles that experts worry could discourage people from seeking medical attention. That’s something only time may tell. It’s also some context we believe is necessary to fully examine this claim. Sebelius’ statement is accurate but needs some context to be fully understood. We rate it Mostly True.  ","[('YouTube video of Channel 2 Action News story about Kathleen Sebelius, March 11, 2014.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGF0vl1WgDg'), ('Telephone interview with health care consultant John Crew, March 18, 2014.', 'No link'), ('Emails with William Custer, director, Center for Health Services Research, Georgia State University.', 'http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report on health insurance marketplace premiums, September 2013.', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2013/marketplacepremiums/ib_marketplace_premiums.cfm'), ('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services addendum to October 2013 - March 2014 enrollment marketplace report, March 11, 2014.', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, ""How the Health Care Law is Making a Difference for the People of Georgia,"" updated July 29, 2013.', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2014/MarketPlaceEnrollment/Mar2014/ib_2014Mar_enrollAddendum.pdf')]",/factchecks/2014/mar/25/kathleen-sebelius/low-cost-insurance-available-subsidies/

Mark Begich ad says he forced D.C. to open the Arctic to oil drilling
","As a Democratic senator from Alaska -- a state that President Barack Obama lost by 14 points in 2012 -- it’s been in Mark Begich’s best interest to distance himself from many of the president’s policies as the midterm elections approach. But there’s one topic where Begich has been touting his ability to influence Obama -- oil drilling, a crucial issue for Alaskans, whose economy is heavily dependent on oil production. In Begich’s latest statewide TV ad, the narrator -- Begich’s wife, Deborah Bonito -- highlights his commitment to fighting for Alaskan issues, including drilling. ‘There’s nowhere he won’t go to listen and stand up for Alaskans,"" the ad says. ""He forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling."" We thought we’d take a closer look at Begich’s involvement in the Alaska Arctic drilling. When Royal Dutch Shell started fighting to drill in the Arctic, Begich wasn’t yet in office. By February 2008, Royal Dutch Shell held leases to drill in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, portions of the Arctic Ocean near the Alaskan mainland. No one had drilled there for two decades. But lease-holding companies can’t drill without first clearing a number of other procedural hurdles. Once it had sold Shell leases, the government still needed to grant dozens of technical approvals, including exploration plans, water permits and air permits. That’s where Begich, the only Democrat elected statewide, came in. After getting elected in November 2008, he made his priorities known to the White House. The New York Times reported that when Begich and Obama first met in 2008, Begich said of oil drilling issues, ""If I’m elected, this is what I’m going to focus on."" Begich -- a Democrat working with a Democratic administration -- may have had more sway than his colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in pushing along the permitting process. Peter Van Tuyn, whose law firm Bessenyey and Van Tuyn LLC has fought against oil drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, agrees that Begich has had a key role on the issue. ""His biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying ‘Dammit, we need to get this done,’ "" Van Tuyn said. Begich told the Times that ""any time (Obama) initiated a call, I felt that was carte blanche to make my case"" for Arctic drilling. As of 2012, Begich had assembled a six-page chronology of contact on oil drilling between his office and the White House. Eventually, in September 2012, Shell began drilling in the Chukchi Sea. However, it didn’t go according to plan. After spending $5 billion on the project, Shell wasn’t able to fully drill any wells that season. In March 2013, an Interior Department report found that Shell had violated permits, didn’t test certain systems in advance and lost a drilling rig. After that, Shell said it still planned to drill during the summer of 2014. But the company backed out in January after a court sided with environmental groups in ruling that in 2008, the federal government had underestimated how much oil drilling would happen when awarding the lease. This ruling didn’t block all drilling, but it did put more legal obstacles in Shell’s way. The administration could choose to appeal the decision, which only directly affects one lease sale, not all Arctic lease sales. Shell’s CEO said there was too much uncertainty to move forward with drilling in 2014. Other companies have leases to drill in the area as well, but experts told us they’ve hung back and waited to see how Shell does. So, in 2014, no companies are drilling in the Alaska Arctic, despite the efforts of Begich and others. Our ruling Begich’s ad claimed that ""he forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling."" Begich wasn’t in the Senate when the government awarded leases to Shell, but the leases were only the first step toward drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Numerous other federal permits were required before Shell could drill there, and by multiple accounts, Begich played a key role in pushing the administration from the time he began serving in the Senate. Shell did drill in 2012 -- the first activity in that region of the Arctic in decades -- though after complications arose, including legal ones, the company hasn’t done so again. So Begich can rightfully take credit for helping advancing Shell’s oil-drilling permits in the Arctic Ocean, but there’s currently no drilling taking place. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('Alaskans for Begich, ""Alaska’s Son,"" March 20, 2014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnVDAfkLHK8&app=desktop'), ('Anchorage Daily News, ""Begich, other incumbent Senate Democrats in energy spotlight,"" Feb. 13, 2014', 'No link'), ('Anchorage Daily News, ""Court rules environmental study of offshore oil leases in Alaska Arctic was flawed,"" Jan. 22, 2014', 'http://www.adn.com/2014/02/13/3324964/begich-other-incumbent-senate.html'), ('Anchorage Daily News, ""Shell begins drilling in Chukchi Sea,"" Sept. 9, 2012', 'No link'), ('Anchorage Daily News, ""Shell won’t drill offshore in Alaska Arctic this year,"" Jan. 30, 2014', 'http://www.adn.com/2014/01/22/3285973/appeals-court-rules-offshore-oil.html'), ('Email interview with Edward Murphy, Republican National Committee spokesman, March 20, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Gerald McBeath, University of Alaska Fairbanks political science professor, March 21, 2014', 'http://www.adn.com/2012/09/09/2618404/shell-begins-drilling-in-chukchi.html'), ('Email interview with Max Croes, Mark Begich campaign spokesman, March 20, 2014', 'No link'), ('Los Angeles Times, ""Salazar on Arctic drilling: ‘Shell screwed up in 2012,’ "" March 14, 2013', 'http://www.adn.com/2014/01/30/3298785/shell-abandons-plans-for-alaska.html'), ('New York Times, ""New and Frozen Frontier Awaits Offshore Oil Drilling,"" May 23, 2012', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Betsy Baker, Vermont Law School Arctic policy and law professor, March 21, 2014', 'http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/14/nation/la-na-shell-arctic-interior-report-20130314'), ('Phone interview with Peter Van Tuyn, Bessenyey and Van Tuyn LLC attorney, March 21, 2014', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Rebecca Noblin, Center for Biological Diversity Alaska director, March 21, 2014', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/science/earth/shell-arctic-ocean-drilling-stands-to-open-new-oil-frontier.html?pagewanted=5&_r=1'), ('U.S. Department of the Interior, ""Review of Shell’s 2012 Alaska offshore oil and gas exploration program,"" March 8, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2014/mar/24/mark-begich/mark-begich-ad-says-he-forced-dc-open-arctic-oil-d/

Kathleen Sebelius understates Obamacare health-dental costs, also not mentioning Texan's federal subsidy
","Urging Texans without health insurance to hop to shopping before a looming enrollment deadline, Kathleen Sebelius enthused about a Texan she described as landing a good deal via the HealthCare.gov website. Sebelius, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, said in an opinion column published in the March 18, 2014, Austin American-Statesman: ""On a recent visit to the Lone Star State, I met Mark Sullivan, a 31-year-old software developer. Though he was eager to start his own business, the thought of fending for himself without his employer-based health coverage made him hesitate. ""But then Mark researched his options on HealthCare.gov. You can imagine his excitement when he found a good plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month."" That column touting Sullivan’s experience also appeared in the Dallas Morning News, San Antonio Express-News, El Paso Times and McAllen Monitor. We were curious about Sullivan’s experience on the Obamacare website, which often didn’t function at its launch. Did Sullivan, co-founder of an Austin-based company, snag an early health/dental bargain anyway? An account re-told Sullivan’s sign-up success has been a centerpiece for advocates at least since an Oct. 4, 2013, web post by Enroll America, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on maximizing the number of Americans enrolled in and retaining health coverage. Enroll America’s post said Sullivan overcame glitches on HealthCare.gov shortly after the site’s debut to line up affordable coverage for himself, effective in 2014. After comparing plans, Enroll America said, Sullivan ""settled on a bronze option and added dental insurance. He will receive an $82 per month subsidy, which will halve the monthly premium he will pay down to $78."" Sebelius’ oped column, distributed about five months later, made no mention of Sullivan’s subsidy. Enroll America’s write-up further noted that Sullivan’s subsidy might decrease: ""While his new startup will require a lot of personal expense early on, if profits grow faster than he projects, his subsidy may end up being a bit lower by the end of the year. That’s no concern for Mark, since even without the tax credit, his total premium is still much more affordable than the private plans he had been able to find on the individual market."" On Oct. 25, 2013, Sullivan joined an Austin press conference where Sebelius talked up the importance of residents complying with the mandate that Americans obtain coverage, as noted in news stories by outlets including the American-Statesman. (The next enrollment deadline is March 31, 2014.) Agency spokesman: Dental plan an added cost We asked a Washington, D.C.-based HHS spokesman, Fabien Levy, for backup related to Sebelius’ description of Sullivan’s shopping success. Levy largely deferred to Sullivan, though by email Levy said the described dental coverage has been costing Sullivan $15 a month in addition to the less than $80 for health and dental coverage celebrated by Sebelius. Hence, Levy said, the original column was being revised. A fresh version sent by the agency to the Statesman lacked any mention of Sullivan’s dental plan. Sullivan offers details Fortuitously, Sullivan elaborated on his experience on HealthCare.gov. By phone, Sullivan told us he pays $77.67 a month to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas to be in its Blue Advantage Bronze HMO plan. On a Blue Cross and Blue Shield web page, the plan is described as having an individual annual deductible of $6,000 along with maximum annual out-of-pocket costs to the purchaser. Notably, though, the purchaser must pay all medical costs up to that ceiling. Also, according to information on the web page, the plan covers 100 percent of prescription costs once the deductible is paid. By phone, Sullivan told us that in addition to the costs of his health policy, he chose to pay about $15 a month for a Starmount Life Insurance Co. dental plan. By email, Sullivan shared a computer screen shot of a Blue Cross Blue Shield web page showing that his health coverage, effective Jan. 1, 2014, would cost $159.67 without his $82 monthly subsidy; which was awarded based on his income, Sullivan said. The image shows that thanks to the subsidy, he’s been paying $77.67 a month.   Sullivan said he appreciated the plan’s low monthly cost to him, its provision for a free annual check-up and its cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Notably, too, he said a medication he purchased in February that would have cost him more than $340 if he had no coverage ended up costing only $30 out of pocket. Looking back, Sullivan wrote that he had trouble logging on to HealthCare.gov the first three days of October, but by Oct. 4, he was browsing 76 available plans and, to his memory, signed up for his plan a day later. ""Overall, the shopping experience was a good one,"" Sullivan wrote. In his view, he wrote,""the only thing slightly off"" in Sebelius’ published statement ""is that the dental coverage was separate from health insurance, which was an additional $15/month that I probably wouldn't have chosen without the subsidy."" Our ruling On HealthCare.Gov, Sebelius wrote, Texan Mark Sullivan ""found a good"" health insurance ""plan that includes dental, for less than $80 a month."" No doubt, Sullivan liked how things worked out for him. But Sebelius’ recap struck us as incomplete and misleading. The secretary incorrectly described what Sullivan pays as covering both medical and dental coverage; the latter costs him about $15 more a month. The article also didn’t acknowledge that Sullivan’s monthly charge was fueled by an $82-a-month subsidy. Also, there was no concession that purchasers including Sullivan must pay $6,000 a year for medical procedures before the plan pitches in on such. We rate this statement as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

A look at Medicare's 'grossly excessive' spending on ... penis pumps
","Distinguished legal minds of the U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments over whether the federal government can compel businesses to cover contraceptives at no cost to women through the Affordable Care Act. It’s a serious issue. And Comedy Central’s The Daily Show is all over it. Correspondent Samantha Bee took viewers into the debate in a segment host Jon Stewart described as the rare intersection of health care, the economy, aging and penises -- ""the issues of greatest consequence to you, the American people."" Some conservatives and Catholics argue the contraceptives mandate violates the religious rights of business owners who would have to provide coverage for a medication they do not agree with, and that women who want it should get it on their own. Bee sat down with Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group that supports birth control and the morning-after pill being made available to everyone. Hogue said women use birth control for a number of reasons, including avoiding unintended pregnancies, regulating menstrual cycles and treating endometriosis. The contraception mandate addresses a disparity with the federal government paying for men’s sexual health treatments, she argued. ""The existing system is absolutely a double-standard,"" Hogue said. ""Medicare has spent $172 million on penis pumps in the last five years at $360 a pop."" Bee considered the information. ""Wait, Medicare funds penis pumps?"" Truth be told, we were curious too. Can Hogue’s numbers be right, or are they inflated? ""Vacuum erection systems"" (that’s a more technical term) are one of several ways a man might treat erectile dysfunction, which affects 30 million men, according to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse. We found an inspector general report from the Department of Health and Human Services detailing the issue. (A spokeswoman for NARAL Pro-Choice America later pointed us in the same direction.) The December 2013 report didn’t weigh in on whether it was inappropriate for Medicare to pay for penis pumps. The crux of the review was to find out if Medicare was paying exorbitant rates for them. The devices are among medical supplies eligible for Medicare Part B, which offers supplementary health insurance for medically necessary and preventive services for seniors. The cost of a device like a penis pump is subtracted from a beneficiary’s deductible, and Medicare picks up 80 percent of the cost after that. The auditors’ findings: Medicare payments for vacuum erection systems are more than twice the average payment rate for non-Medicare payers. The difference is ""grossly excessive,"" the report says. From 2006 to 2011, Medicare paid a total of $172.4 million for 473,629 claims for pumps, or about $364 a pump. That’s almost exactly what Hogue said (though spending was measured over a six-year period ending in 2011, not the last five, as she said). Over those six years, annual claims payouts almost doubled, jumping from $20.6 million in 2006 to $38.6 million in 2011, the report says. Medicare would save $18 million a year, and its beneficiaries would pocket $4.5 million, if the program retooled its fee schedule rate to be more in line with other programs and the private market. The report suggests the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services either establish a payment limit or to seek authority from Congress to include the products in its competitive bidding program. Our ruling Hogue said, ""Medicare has spent $172 million on penis pumps in the last five years at $360 a pop."" We’ll stay out of saying whether it’s legitimate for Medicare to cover vacuum erection systems for older men, and whether it’s unfair that many health plans would have to cover contraception. The Daily Show was trying to make a humorous point about tax money paying for some male sexual health products, which hasn’t been a source of controversy. As for Hogue’s statement, she gets the dollars right but misses on the timeframe. An inspector general’s report measured six years ending in 2011, not the most recent five years. That’s a minor point in judging her overall claim. We rate Hogue’s statement Mostly True.","[('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, ""Medicare Payments For Vacuum Erection Systems Are More Than Twice As Much As The Amounts Paid For The Same Or Similar Devices By Non-Medicare Payers,"" December 2013', 'https://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region7/71205024.pdf'), ('NBC News, ""Penis pumps waste Medicare millions: inspector general,"" Jan. 13, 2014', 'No link'), ('The Daily Show, ""Federally funded penis pumps,"" March 12, 2014', 'http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/13/22294537-penis-pumps-waste-medicare-millions-inspector-general?lite'), ('National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse', 'No link'), ('Interview with\xa0Christina DiPasquale, spokeswoman on behalf of NARAL Pro-Choice America, March 24, 2014', 'http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/pvhtvo/federally-funded-penis-pumps?utm=share_twitter')]",/factchecks/2014/mar/24/ilyse-hogue/look-medicares-grossly-excessive-spending-penis-pu/

Florida Stop Common Core Coalition says education testing company promotes gay lifestyle to school children
","In choosing the American Institutes for Research to create new accountability tests for Florida, education commissioner Pam Stewart stressed the group’s ability to create tests specifically tailored for Florida. ""The new assessment will measure each child’s progress and achievement on the Florida Standards, which were developed with an unprecedented amount of public input,"" Stewart said in a press release. Common Core foes, who contend the ""Florida standards"" differ little from the widely adopted national Common Core academic standards, were again disappointed. With their efforts to derail the initiative itself foundering, one group took aim at the testing company instead. They noted the American Institutes for Research, called AIR, was tied to the Common Core with its work creating tests for the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. Then they accused the organization of promoting a homosexual lifestyle for children. ""This is completely unacceptable. Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old,"" Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. The group takes a page from Utahns Against Common Core, which also blasted AIR for its work on LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender)  issues after that state adopted AIR tests in 2012. There is some basis for the statements. AIR has an active practice area creating materials for schools on LGBT Youth issues, in which it studies the youngsters’ experiences and offers recommendations for how to help them survive a world that can be harsh and judgmental. It describes its practice in this way: ""AIR’s Human and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness."" AIR only provides materials on gay and lesbian issues to schools and organizations that request it.  It also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters. And the group does not promote the issues, spokesman Larry McQuillan said. ""We are not an advocacy group,"" McQuillan said. ""AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards."" That is generally how the organization is viewed. ""AIR is known for being an independent and important provider of high-quality educational research, resources, and training for federal, state, and local stakeholders,"" said Anne Hyslop of the New America Foundation. ""Their work is widely respected, and they have a long history of producing valuable contributions to the field."" She suggested that the attack had more to do with the Common Core than with AIR itself. AIR received no criticism when selected to develop Florida’s hotly controversial ""value-added"" model of teacher evaluations. When it came to standards-related testing, though, the Stop Common Core coalition suggested that AIR’s work on LGBT issues would come through. ""We know that our children's tests will likely include these types of issues and that the test and other data will go to the state, the federal government, and to corporations,"" said co-founder Karen Effrem, urging tea party conservatives to pressure Gov. Rick Scott to stop the process. (PolitiFact Florida has fact-checked claims that personal data will go to the federal government and found such claims exaggerated.) Effrem and Osborne did not respond to interview requests. The issue could resonate with groups who find that even simple acknowledgement of LGBT people is activism to be demonized, said Daryl Presgraves of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. Florida Department of Education spokesman Joe Follick, however, did not bite at the rhetoric, which he deemed essentially irrelevant. ""AIR was chosen for their ability to provide an assessment that aligns with Florida’s standards. Not anything else,"" Follick said. Republican legislative leaders also backed the commissioner. Senate President Don Gaetz ""supports Commissioner Stewart and is confident that AIR will develop a Florida-specific assessment that will test students based on Florida-specific standards,"" spokeswoman Katie Betta said. Our ruling The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition said that the American Institutes for Research promotes the identification of homosexual lifestyles in young children. It is true that AIR does research on LGBT youth issues and offers advice to organizations that request it on how to assist these children. This is one piece of the group’s initiatives, which also include work on disease management and student assessments. AIR does not advocate a homosexual lifestyle for children, nor is it an advocacy group at all. There is no indication that the organization or the state will have a homosexual agenda in its state testing.

Matt Damon: 'Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation'
","When we woke up Sunday morning to catch the political talk shows, we expected plenty of talk about Ukraine and the lost Malaysian airplane. We didn’t quite anticipate a conversation about clean water with Matt Damon. Or a startling statistic worth fact-checking. How do you like them apples? (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) Damon appeared on ABC’s This Week to discuss the serious issue of clean water scarcity in developing countries, a plight he has personally sought to impact through the charity he co-founded, Water.org. ""Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation,"" Damon said. ""Every 20 seconds, three kids every minute somewhere on planet Earth. Not here. Our kids aren't going to die from diarrhea. That's just an inconvenience to us in the West. But it is a stark, terrifying reality to billions of people on the planet."" One child dying every 20 seconds amounts to 4,320 deaths every day, or roughly 1.5 million deaths a year. It’s a jarring statistic, but is it accurate? We decided to investigate. We reached out to Water.org to see if they had source material to back up Damon’s stat. We didn’t hear back. But we did find the number on their website. There, the organization put the figure at one death every 21 seconds. Water.org cited research from UNICEF and the World Health Organization, and a report released by the two agencies in 2009. It paints a pretty stark picture of the issue. Due to poor sanitation conditions in much of the developing world, millions of people are risking their health virtually every time they take a sip of water. Infection in the intestinal tract from tainted water often leads to diarrhea, defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day. It can last days or weeks, and if persistent can cause death due to fluid loss. Young children are especially at risk because of their weaker immune systems. According to the report, there are 2.5 billion (yes, that’s billion with a ""b"") cases of diarrhea every year in children under the age of five. It’s the second leading cause of child deaths in the world after pneumonia, taking the lives ""more young children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined,"" it says. Half the cases are in South Asia and Africa. Just how many lives does it take? The report put the total at 1.5 million. Water.org on their website acknowledged that this statistic – deaths from diarrhea among children under five – is the number they used to claim a death every 20 seconds. So that’s where the figure comes from. But it’s outdated, we found. The report came out in 2009, but it was referencing World Health Organization statistics from 2004. There has actually been considerable adavancement since then, in part because of an international effort to improve sanitation and hygiene awareness in developing countries. More recently, the World Health Organization has estimated deaths from diarrhea have fallen to about 760,000 a year, half of what it was less than a decade ago. UNICEF has cited the newer statistic as well, as does the Center for Disease Control in the United States. That would mean a child dies every 40 seconds from water-related illness. Still a harrowing statistic, but not quite what Damon said. Our ruling Damon said, ""Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation."" The Bourne series star appears to be using an outdated statistic in his ABC appearance that claimed 1.5 million deaths from diarrhea caused by tainted water. More recent reports put the number at about 760,000 deaths a year. That said, Damon is accurately highlighting a little-known problem to an American audience. The statement ignores subsequent improvements but does not give viewers a different impression of the seriousness of the issue. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.","[('ABC News, ""Matt Damon: ‘Real Opportunity’ to Save People through Clean Water,"" March 23, 2014', 'https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/03/matt-damon-real-opportunity-to-save-people-through-clean-water/'), ('Water.org, Water Facts, accessed March 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('The United Nations Children’s Fund/World Health Organization, ""Diarrhoea: Why children are still dying and what can be done,"" 2009', 'http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241598415_eng.pdf'), ('World Health Organization, ""Safer Water, Better Health,"" 2009', 'No link'), ('Search query on child deaths through World Health Organization Global Health Observatory Data Repository, accessed March 23, 2014', 'http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241596435_eng.pdf'), ('World Health Organization, ""Facts and figures: Water, sanitation and hygiene links to health,"" accessed March 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('World Health Organization, Water-related diseases, accessed March 23, 2014', 'http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.CMNRWORLD-CH3?lang=en'), ('World Health Organization, Diarrhoeal Disease Fact Sheet, updated April 2013', 'No link'), ('Center for Disease Control, Maternal and child health, updated March 5, 2014', 'http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/factsfigures04/en/'), ('The United Nations Children’s Fund, ""Children dying daily because of unsafe water supplies and poor sanitation and hygiene, UNICEF says,"" March 22, 2013', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/diarrhoea/en/')]",/factchecks/2014/mar/23/matt-damon/matt-damon-every-20-seconds-child-dies-because-the/

Romney: Obama stopped missile defense shield 'as a gift to Russia'
","President Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign for calling Russia ""our No. 1 geopolitical foe."" Now, as the country’s relationship with Russia worsens over Ukraine, Romney is getting the chance to take a few political swipes himself. Romney appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday and said Obama has been naive about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions all along. Romney said Putin has blocked Iran from harsher sanctions, stood with dictators in Syria and North Korea, and provided Edward Snowden a safe haven.   Romney said he would have handled things differently. ""For instance, you reconsider putting in our missile defense system back into the Czech Republic and Poland, as we once planned,"" Romney said of steps he’d take if he were in the White House. ""And as you recall, we pulled that out as a gift to Russia.""   PunditFact has heard several Republican politicians and pundits bring up the missile defense system in recent weeks, so we wanted to look back into the program and why it was scrapped. The missile defense system The missile defense issue represented the first significant break from President George W. Bush administration policy in Obama’s first year in office, so it attracted a lot of attention. Bush, taking advice from Defense Secretary Robert Gates, pushed for an initiative to install 10 interceptor missiles on the ground in Poland and an advanced radar system in the Czech Republic to fend long-range missiles from Iran. American officials saw the Europe-based plan as improving their ability to deflect long-range missiles launched by Iran (not Russia) to Europe or the U.S while strengthening military partnerships with countries in Eastern Europe. Some interceptors had already been built on America’s West Coast to protect against nuclear attacks from North Korea. The interceptors in Europe would not be ready until at least 2017, Gates later wrote. The interceptors couldn’t do much against Russia’s nuclear weapons, experts said, but Russia still saw them as a threat to its arsenal and NATO-Russia cooperation. Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov told a Belarus newspaper in 2006, ""The choice of location for the deployment of those systems is dubious, to put it mildly,"" according to the New York Times. Enter Obama, who explained he supported the missile shield to Fox News host Bill O’Reilly during the 2008 campaign. He gave himself wiggle room, however, by saying, ""I want to make sure it works, which is actually one of the problems we've got."" He ordered a review. Washington’s relationship with Moscow was icy at the time following Russia’s war with Georgia. Obama took office in 2009 talking about hitting the ""reset"" button with Russia. Then, three years after Bush announced his missile defense proposal, Obama changed course. On Sept. 17, 2009, Obama announced that the United States would pursue a new missile defense policy focused on knocking out short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran. Russian concerns about the previous program were ""entirely unfounded,"" Obama said. ""Our clear and consistent focus has been the threat posed by Iran's ballistic missile program, and that continues to be our focus and the basis of the program that we're announcing today,"" Obama said. ""In confronting that threat, we welcome Russians' cooperation to bring its missile defense capabilities into a broader defense of our common strategic interests, even as we continue to -- we continue our shared efforts to end Iran's illicit nuclear program."" A ‘gift’ to Russia? Russians cheered the decision, though Russian officials said they didn’t promise anything in return. Putin called Obama’s move on the missile defense shield ""correct and brave."" Bush allies and congressional Republicans thought Obama caved. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. (who is now governor of Indiana), and Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, released statements along the lines of Obama is soft and let down American allies. Pundits like John Bolton, whom Bush appointed as ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia and Iran came away as ""big winners"" in a ""bad day for American national security."" Meanwhile, Israel and most NATO countries in Western Europe approved of the move, news stories show, as they thought the missile system provoked Russia. Initial reactions from Polish and Czech leaders were not thrilled. Obama delegated explaining the decision to an interesting source: Gates, the same official who recommended the missile defense plan to Bush in 2006 to combat the growing threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. Gates explained why he urged Obama to change course in a 2009 New York Times op-ed and in his 2014 book Duty, in which he described the new strategy as necessary due to changing times, technology and threats. (And in which he said some not-so-nice things about Obama.) ""It was neither the first nor last time under Obama that I was used to provide political cover, but it was okay in this instance since I sincerely believed the new program was better -- more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat,"" he wrote. Gates wrote that Defense Department officials realized the Iranian government was putting more stock into building short- and medium-range missiles over long-range ones. The agency wanted to uproot the old plan to better counteract that threat, and the new tactic Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Obama was not only cheaper, but the sea-based missiles could be more easily and quickly produced. ""While there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian ‘reset,’ we in Defense did not,"" Gates wrote in Duty. ""Making the Russians happy wasn’t exactly on my to-do list."" Lost in the GOP fury, Gates wrote, was that Russians found Obama’s new approach to be an even bigger problem than the Bush-era plan as they worried about future adjustments that could make the short- and medium-range missiles a bigger threat to Russia. ""How ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians,"" Gates wrote. ""It would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington -- just once in my career -- say, Well I got that wrong."" Lance Janda, chairman of the Department of History and Government at Cameron University, told us Romney’s comments are partially accurate. Yes, Obama ended the missile shield planned in Poland and Czech Republic, but the U.S. will address the ballistic missile threat with Aegis missiles in Eastern Europe by 2018, he said by email. ""While our decision to cancel the sites in 2009 eased tensions with Russia -- which DEEPLY opposed the sites -- we also had legitimate security reasons for not moving forward and in that sense it's not like we were really doing Putin a ‘favor,’ "" Janda said. ""And we're certainly not leaving Poland or the Czech Republic exposed. They're covered by the rest of NATO and will get the Aegis system ... soon."" We reached out to Romney through CBS and a press contact on MittRomney.com but did not hear back. Our ruling Romney said, the United States stopped plans to build a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe ""as a gift to Russia."" Romney’s impression about Obama’s decision to end the program is certainly shared by GOP politicians and pundits, and Obama took office with a vow to reset relations with Russia. Russia found Bush’s missile defense program in neighboring countries offensive and was pleased to see it go (though Gates asserts they dislike the new policy more). But Romney’s comments do not reflect the whole story. Gates, the Bush official who recommended the plan in 2006, acknowledged he drove the change in policy because of improved American intelligence of what the Iranians were working on -- not solely to be nice to the Russians. Plus, new defense systems are still planned.

Mary Burke says Wisconsin's job agency has unspent funds

","In 2011, Gov. Scott Walker led the transformation of the state Commerce Department into the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The creation of a quasi-private agency was meant to spearhead job creation. After a rocky start, including staffing turmoil and a scathing audit in 2013 , WEDC executives say the agency is finally on solid ground. Walker’s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, thinks otherwise. ""Our state economic development agency under Walker, WEDC, actually isn’t even using the funds that are appropriated to it,"" she said in a Jan. 21, 2014  video interview with the Appleton Post Crescent. The claim caught our attention because Walker is less than half way to meeting his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. Is Burke right that the agency has not even spent the money it has been given to boost job creation? When we asked Burke for backup to the claim, campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki cited news stories  and a Jan. 8, 2014 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau about the state of WEDC finances. That report was prepared as WEDC asked the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee to release the second year of the agency’s two year budget. WEDC leaders were ordered to appear before the committee so lawmakers could hear a progress report and get a detailed look at agency finances. The report said WEDC had a ""surplus"" of about about $18 million. That’s for an agency that has 90 employees with a  budget of about $95 million. The agency also is allowed to issue employers some $300 million in economic incentives in the form of tax cuts. Not surprisingly, leaders of the agency viewed their performance differently. They say a good part of the the surplus stems from the switchover from the old Commerce Department. They also say the agency is track to spend all of it’s budget for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2015. Burke’s claim is a ""bumper sticker about a pretty complicated topic,"" said WEDC deputy secretary Ryan Murray. The surplus WEDC ended its last fiscal year, which closed in June 2013, with a surplus of $34 million. About $14 million of that was money that ""carried over"" from the old Commerce Department. The largest chunk -- $30 million -- was due to low demand for loans from the agency. In short, WEDC had expected to lend out $30 million more than was sought by businesses planning to relocate or expand in Wisconsin. The lower demand for loans came from the weak economic recovery, and also the rocky transition to the new agency, Murray said. The agency’s board took two actions to deal with this surplus. First, it created a new policy -- one overlooked when the agency was created in 2011 -- that creates a reserve fund of between 15 to 25 percent of the agency’s budget. The fund gives the agency greater flexibility to handle unexpected events, such as loans offered during propane shortages this winter. The reserve fund was set at $16 million for the current fiscal year. Secondly, WEDC sought for and received funding for the current fiscal year that was $18 million less than the agency’s original request. That action happened in January 2014, after WEDC executives were ordered to appear before the committee. In the end, the panel voted to provide $44.7 million in new taxpayer money for WEDC through June 2015. Spending pace Murray and WEDC spokesman Mark Maley also noted that the agency is on pace to spend its entire appropriation for the current fiscal year. The organization’s total appropriation for the fiscal year ending in June -- including programs, loans and operating expenditures -- is $95.2 million. Through the first six months of the fiscal year, WEDC has spent, made commitments or signed contracts totaling $53.4 million --  56 percent of the total appropriation, Maley said in an email. That’s a good point. But, of course, it’s not what Burke was talking about. She was criticizing the $18 million surplus -- the amount that was left even after the creation of the reserve fund -- even though she spoke in the present tense. Our rating Burke says that Walker’s jobs agency ""isn’t using the funds appropriated to it."" She referred to WEDC’s well-documented surplus. No one disagrees about the amount, how it came about or what was done in response to it. Officials note the current budget is on track to be spent in its entirety. We rate Burke’s claim Mostly True.","[('Legislative Fiscal Bureau report on Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. funding request, Jan. 8, 2014', 'http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Section-13.10/Documents/2014_01_08_WEDC.pdf'), ('Associated Press, ""Budget committee votes to keep WEDC surplus,"" Jan. 8, 2014', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin State Journal, ""WEDC cuts state funding request by $18.4 million after surplus grows,"" October 30, 2013', 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/budget-committee-votes-keep-wedc-212214413.html'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin Walk-O-Meter', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.2012 annual report', 'http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/wedc-cuts-state-funding-request-by-million-after-surplus-grows/article_aca82838-7de2-533d-b637-6913bd61dee9.html'), ('Legislative Audit Bureau report on Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., May 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview, Ryan Murray, Deputy Secretary, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Feb. 27, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/'), ('Interviews and emails, Mark Maley, spokesman, Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Feb. 26, 27, 2014', 'No link'), ('Emails, Joe Zepecki, spokesman, Burke for Wisconsin campaign, Feb. 25, 26, 2014', 'http://inwisconsin.com/content/uploads/2013/02/2012-Annual-Report.pdf')]",/factchecks/2014/mar/23/mary-burke/mark-burke-says-wisconsins-job-agency-has-unspent-/

Allan Fung says he had to pay a $100 hazardous materials fee to the state when he hired a campaign manager
","With Rhode Island currently hobbled by the nation’s highest unemployment rate, gubernatorial candidates have been suggesting all sorts of ways to improve the state’s business climate. During a March 7 interview on Rhode Island Public Radio, Cranston mayor and Republican candidate for governor Allan Fung said the state sometimes nickel-and-dimes its businesses. He gave an example from his own experience. Fung said he hired a campaign manager for one of his previous campaigns. ""Well, lo and behold, I got this hundred-something dollar fee that came from the Department of Labor and Training, for hazardous materials."" Fung said he had only the one employee, and, as a political campaign, no contact with hazardous materials. ""But because you have an employee, you have to pay that,"" he said. Do you? We checked it out. Fung’s political career goes back to 2002, when he won a seat on  the Cranston City Council (he was the second highest council vote getter). His first mayoral run, unsuccessful as it turned out, was in 2006, when he lost to Democrat Michael Napolitano by 79 votes. It was for that campaign that he hired a manager, Ryan Bilodeau. Copies of Fung’s 2006 campaign finance reports on file in the State Archives show regular payments to Bilodeau, as well as IRS withholding and state tax payments. They also show, on March 12, 2006, a $42 check made out to the state Department of Labor and Training, with the notation ""right to know registration form."" The Department of Labor and Training is charged with enforcing what is known as the ""Hazardous Substances Right to Know Act,"" so named because it says employees in Rhode Island have a right to know what hazardous materials are used in their workplaces. The law requires businesses that deal with hazardous materials to notify workers -- and the labor department -- about the materials.  Even if a business doesn’t use any hazardous materials, it still has to file the form. In 2006, when Fung hired his campaign manager,  all Rhode Island employers were assessed a $42 fee when they filed the required declaration form, DLT spokeswoman Nikki Armstrong said. And that was the law. Until July 2013. That was when the General Assembly passed a budget article, submitted by Governor Chafee’s administration, that eliminated the fee. ""This change is the latest in a series of cost-saving initiatives my administration has made to improve regulations and to build a more customer-friendly business climate in Rhode Island,"" Chafee said in a statement announcing the abolition of the fee, an action he said was projected to save about 10,000 state businesses collectively around $400,000 a year. Fung for Governor campaign manager Patrick A. Sweeney acknowledged that the candidate was off by $58. But he said Fung’s bigger point, ""that we have a plethora of regulations that are hurting small businesses across the country,"" was still valid. Our ruling Allan Fung, recollecting events of eight years ago, said he had to pay a fee of about $100 for filing a hazardous materials notification form when he hired his first campaign staff member. He was right about there being a fee, but he overstated the amount. And in expressing his frustration about the fee, he gave the impression it still exists, when, in fact, it was eliminated a year ago. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Jimmie Massie says 30 percent of Virginia's Medicaid spending is lost to fraud and waste
","Del. Jimmie Massie says expanding Medicaid basically amounts to throwing good money after bad. In Virginia’s Medicaid program, ""approximately 30 percent, or $2.7 billion a year, is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies,"" the Henrico County Republican wrote in a March 12 post on his Facebook page. Massie has made the same claim repeatedly this year in maintaining that Virginia should not rush to accept federal funds available under Obamacare to extend eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to 400,000 low-income and disabled people. The General Assembly is starting a special session Monday to decide whether to expand Medicaid -- a partisan debate that is blocking passage of a two-year state budget. Massie and his GOP colleagues in the House refuse to broaden Medicaid before the state program has undergone a two-year audit. We wondered whether Massie’s claim of 30 percent waste, fraud and inefficiency in Virginia’s $8 billion a year Medicaid program is accurate. The delegate pointed us to a presentation in a December 2013 meeting before the Medicaid Innovation and Reform Commission, a panel seeking to streamline the state program. Massie sits on the commission. In the presentation, Virginia Secretary of Health Bill Hazel noted that a 2012 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that out of the $2.5 trillion in total U.S. health care spending, about $765 billion was lost to waste. That comes to 30 percent. Hazel’s presentation included a pie chart showing that the national waste estimate, when applied to Virginia, equates to about $15 billion of the state’s $49 billion in annual, total health care spending. Hazel did not break down the figure any further, but Massie did. The delegate extended it to the state Medicaid program and concluded that about one third of its funds, or $2.7 billion a year, is being wasted. ""I would be willing to bet the public sector is less efficient than the private sector, therefore the waste, fraud and inefficiencies in the public system is somewhat greater than 30 percent,"" Massie told us. We contacted Hazel for his take on Massie’s comments. Hazel, who supports Medicaid expansion, said his waste chart has been taken out of context. ""The folks who say that reflects Medicaid, I believe are misusing the information because I don’t think it directly applies to Medicaid,"" Hazel said. We couldn’t find any figures on the amount of wasteful spending in Virginia’s Medicaid program and Hazel said a definitive estimate doesn’t exist. Now, let’s return to the original source of the 30 percent estimate -- the national study by the Institute of Medicine. The 416-page report does not offer waste estimates for individual states, let alone the Medicaid program in a state. Dr. Mark Smith, the chair of the committee that authored the IOM report, cautioned against taking the findings too far. ""My comment on the face of is that 30 percent of overall spending being wasteful does not necessarily translate into 30 percent of Medicaid being wasteful, let alone Medicaid in a particular state,"" Smith told us in an email. We did find a study that offer broad insight into the amount of national fraud and waste major government health programs. In April 2012, a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association said that somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion of the $1 trillion spent nationally a year on Medicaid and Medicare is wasted. That comes down between 20 and 40 percent. The author of that report, Don Berwick, was President Barack Obama’s head of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and is now running as a Democrat for governor of Massachusetts. He told us he did not have additional figures specifically looking a Medicaid. We should finally note that Virginia is an outlier state in many statistics measuring the scope of its Medicaid system. As noted in a 2012 report by the Joint legislative Audit Review Commission, the General Assembly’s watchdog agency, Virginia has one of the most restrictive Medicaid programs in the nation, both in terms of eligibility requirements and the services it provides. Our ruling Massie said that 30 percent of the Virginia’s Medicaid program is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies. He gets the figure by extrapolating an estimated amount of waste in all U.S. health care spending and applying it to the Medicaid program in Virginia. The problem is that no study has ever quantified the amount of Medicaid waste in Virginia, so nobody knows. We don’t completely dismiss Massie’s number, because a variety of studies say 30 percent is a reasonable national gauge of the waste in the health system and in overall government health programs. But Massie takes liberty in applying that rule to Virginia’s Medicaid system, one of the most restrictive programs in the nation.

"['Immigration', 'California', 'Kevin McCarthy']","
MOSTLY TRUE: Visa overstays account for ‘half’ of all people in the country illegally
","The debate over illegal immigration in America most often centers on the unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. President Trump frequently stokes that debate as he did with this tweet in June 2018: ""We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country."" But Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed there’s another factor — visa overstays — that accounts for half of the people in the country illegally. ""Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the US) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa,"" McCarthy, a Republican from Bakersfield, said at a Public Policy Institute of California event in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018.  McCarthy made his claim at a Public Policy Institute of California event in Sacramento in August 2018.  That’s not to say McCarthy, a close Trump ally, was breaking with the president’s hardline immigration stance. He told the crowd he supports Trump’s border wall and opposes sanctuary cities. PolitiFact and its affiliates have fact-checked statements similar to McCarthy’s on visa overstays in the past. They’ve found those statements are generally correct. But they’ve also noted that the supporting evidence is now somewhat dated. For this fact check, we examined whether current available data support McCarthy’s claim. Our research Past fact-checks, including one by PolitiFact Virginia in 2016, have relied on a 2006 Pew Research Center report. It estimated ""nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" Each year, the United States grants thousands of temporary visas for foreign students, tourists and workers. They can last from a few weeks to several years. The Pew report put the share of visa overstayers at ""as much as 45 percent of the total unauthorized migrant population."" The study, however, used data more than two decades old from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an agency that doesn’t exist anymore and whose functions were folded into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ""The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed visas since that aging study,"" PolitiFact Virginia reported in 2016. More recent data Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an email that recent DHS reports include data limited to foreign visitors who arrived by air and sea crossings, but not by land. ""They do not tell you anything about the full population of overstays,"" she wrote. She said a 2017 study by the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank, is more helpful. That report estimated visa overstays in 2014 accounted for 42 percent of the total undocumented population, or about 4.5 million people. It also projected that overstays made up about two-thirds of the total number of people who became unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. that year. McCarthy’s claim of ""half"" is not far from the 42 percent figure. Asked to support the congressman’s statement, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to a recent article by The Washington Post that cited the Center for Migration Studies report. The center’s report said its figures ""are based primarily on detailed estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 compiled by (the Center for Migration Studies) and estimates of overstays for 2015 derived by DHS."" Share of overstays on the rise? Given the past decade’s dramatic and well-documented decline in illegal Southern border crossings, there’s a strong case that visa overstayers now account for a larger share of the overall total of unauthorized immigrants. In April, we rated ‘True,’ Gov. Jerry Brown’s claim in a letter to the Trump administration that ""immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years."" Brown’s office cited U.S. Border Patrol figures showing nearly 304,000 arrests in 2017 across the borders of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The previous low was just under 264,000 in 1971. Arrest totals along the Southern border reached well over 1 million annually in the 1980s and 1990s. They peaked at 1.64 million in 2000. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, told PolitiFact Virginia in 2016 that while estimates of undocumented immigrants have been stable since 2007, the number of people entering illegally across the southwestern U.S. border has ""collapsed."" That means that the proportion of those overstaying their visas likely is on the rise, he said in 2016. We asked Nowrasteh whether that still holds true in 2018. ""Yes, about half of illegal immigrants currently are overstays,"" he told us by email. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed ""Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the US) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa."" Past fact checks found this statement and ones like it are generally correct. But they cautioned that the claims mainly rely on figures from a 2006 report, which used federal immigration data from the mid-1990s. More recent Department of Homeland Security reports don’t offer the full picture of foreign visitors who arrived on visas. A 2017 report by the Center for Migration Studies, however, gives a more current look at visa overstays. It shows McCarthy’s claim, while it should have been couched as an estimate rather than a statement of fact, is on the right track. It projects overstayers were 42 percent, or nearly half, of the country’s undocumented population in 2014. Finally, with the decline in illegal border crossings, it’s fair to estimate that visa overstayers now account for an increasing share of the country’s undocumented population. We rate McCarthy’s statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.","[('Kevin McCarthy, speech, Aug. 15, 2018', 'http://www.ppic.org/event/a-conversation-with-congressman-kevin-mccarthy-2018/'), ('Matt Sparks, spokesman for Rep.

Did Kevin Cramer’s votes harm pre-existing condition coverage for 300,000 people?
","The midterm elections are dredging up talk of Obamacare once more, but the Democrats are not calling it by its name. Heidi Heitkamp, a vulnerable Democrat from North Dakota running for Senate re-election, attacked her Republican challenger in a digital ad campaign for his votes to repeal President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Her challenger, Kevin Cramer, has been a representative for North Dakota in the House since 2013. ""This is Denise,"" Heitkamp says in the 30-second spot released on Aug. 16. ""She lives in Kildeer. Like 300,000 North Dakotans, Denise has a pre-existing condition. That used to mean no health insurance. For me it’s breast cancer, for Denise it’s heart disease."" ""She has something she’d like to say to Kevin Cramer. ‘Mr Cramer, I don’t know why you voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. But I know Heidi would never do that.’ "" Heitkamp is talking about several votes Cramer cast in 2013 and again in 2016 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Let’s take a look at what they did. • 300,000 includes everyone with some sort of pre-existing condition. The people whose health plans might be at risk is a fraction of that. • Cramer cast votes to both repeal Obamacare and replace it with skimpier plans. • While these replacements kept protections for pre-existing conditions in place, they stripped some of the safeguards that make those plans affordable today. The Affordable Care Act made sure that people without health insurance got coverage. The problematic sector was the individual, or non-group, market: those not covered by their employer or by the government. They form the smallest part of the market. Before the Affordable Care Act, people in that market could get turned down for having a pre-existing condition (anything from hay fever to cancer); could get charged more for it; or could be offered a health plan that excluded its coverage. Now, all of those things are illegal. The Heitkamp campaign said there are 300,000 individuals with pre-existing conditions in North Dakota, rounding the 275,556 calculated by Health and Human Services in 2009 and 316,000 calculated by the Center for American Progress. Those numbers are credible, but the majority of those individuals are covered by group plans. So voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not a vote to strip coverage from all 300,000. Instead, it would jeopardize coverage for the non-group market, which covered 9 percent of North Dakotans in 2016. The ad does not make clear whether Denise is in the group or individual market. Heitkamp sent us Cramer's votes to strip funding for the Affordable Care Act and one vote to repeal it. Cramer’s campaign told us he has always supported coverage of pre-existing conditions, pointing to the American Health Care Act and Graham-Cassidy. Whatever Cramer’s wish is, his votes jeopardize coverage as it stands for pre-existing conditions in the individual market, according to Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care organization. By the letter of the law the bills protect pre-existing conditions. But they take away the mandate that everyone be insured and the subsidies that make that affordable. In practice, plans for individuals in the nongroup market would become exorbitantly priced, if available at all. Heitkamp said Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions. Cramer's votes technically included provisions to prevent health care companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But the limits of what insurance companies could charge would have been watered down, which would have sent premiums skyrocketing, experts say, to the point that coverage for many would be unattainable. However, only about a tenth of the 300,000 people in the ad would be directly affected by the laws in question. We rate this statement Half True.","[('Phone interview with Julia Krieger, spokeswoman for Heitkamp campaign, Aug. 20, 2018', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/compilation-state-data-affordable-care-act'), ('Phone interview with Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, Aug. 21, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Tim Rasmussen, spokesman for Cramer campaign, Aug. 21, 2018', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/20/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-offers-misleading-defense-face-jimmy-/'), ('Email interview with Tasha Bradley, Health and Human Services spokeswoman, Aug. 20, 2018', 'No link'), ('ASPE, Compilation of state data on the Affordable Care Act, December 2016', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/04/05/430059/number-americans-pre-existing-conditions-congressional-district/'), ('PolitiFact, Bill Cassidy offers misleading defense in face-off with Jimmy Kimmel, Sept. 20, 2017', 'No link'), ('Center for American Progress, Number of Americans with Pre-Existing Conditions by Congressional District, April 5, 2017', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628'), ('Congress.gov, American Health Care Act of 2017, introduced March 20, 2017', 'No link'), ('CQ, House Roll Call Vote 88, March 21, 2013', 'http://cq.com/vote/2013/h/88?0'), ('CQ, House Roll Call Vote 154, May 16, 2013', 'No link'), ('CQ, House Roll Call Vote 478, Sept. 20, 2013', 'http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-239285000?0&amp%3Bsearch=7Mk63wNp'), ('Congress, H.R.3762, Feb. 2, 2016', 'No link'), ('Congress, H.Con.Res.27, April 13, 2015', 'http://www.cq.com/doc/floorvote-241640000?1&amp%3Bsearch=2wL38Fp7')]",/factchecks/2018/aug/24/heidi-heitkamp/kevin-cramers-votes-pre-existing-conditions/

West Virginia GOP largely accurate about food stamp decline
","In a recent tweet, the West Virginia Republican Party praised President Donald Trump for his role in reducing the number of Americans who rely on food stamps. ""Thanks to President Trump and Republican leadership, the number of people collecting food stamps has declined by more than two million. Our economy is (in) recovery and more jobs are available! #WVGOP,"" the party tweeted Aug. 1. Thanks to President Trump and Republican leadership, the number of people collecting food stamps has declined by more than two million. Our economy is recovery and more jobs are available! #WVGOP https://t.co/taRt2i2O0O Is this correct? We looked at the official data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the program formally known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. When Trump took office in January 2017, there were 42.7 million Americans on food stamps. By May 2018, there were 39.3 million Americans collecting food stamps. That’s a decrease of 3.4 million -- an even bigger decrease than the tweet had touted. Measured another way, the number of households with at least one food-stamp recipient declined over the same period by almost 1.5 million. But the tweet drew a connection between Trump’s policies and the downward trend. Is there one? That’s less clear. Food stamp usage peaked in late 2012 and has been declining ever since -- under both Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. The Agriculture Department wrote in an April 2018 report that the decline in 2017 ""in large part"" reflected ""the continued improvement in economic conditions in recent years. Because eligibility for SNAP is based largely on a person’s financial situation, program participation is countercyclical, expanding during economic downturns when people lose their jobs and see their incomes fall, and contracting during periods of economic growth when unemployment falls and people’s incomes rise."" The department’s report noted that in 2017, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, well below the 7.4 rate in 2013. And the share of Americans with incomes below the poverty line fell, from 14.8 percent in 2013 to 12.7 percent in 2016. Michael Wiseman, a professor of Public Policy at George Washington University said the biggest reason for the drop to ""the ongoing economic recovery that begin in the first year of the Obama administration."" No president can be fully credited with (or blamed for) economic conditions on their watch, but to the extent that a president can reasonably claim a share of the credit, both Obama and Trump can. There was no sudden turnaround after Trump took office. Another likely reason for the decline in food stamp usage was a tightening of restrictions on SNAP participation by those who fall into the category of ""able bodied adults without dependents."" Childless adults, aged 18 to 50, who aren’t employed or in a training program for at least 20 hours a week may only receive SNAP benefits for up to three months. However, these restrictions began before Trump took office. ""While the Trump administration has proposed various restrictions on SNAP access, none have been implemented,"" Wiseman said. The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, ""Thanks to President Trump and Republican leadership, the number of people collecting food stamps has declined by more than two million."" That’s actually an undercount -- the number of Americans collecting food stamps has decreased by 3.4 million. But the decline began years before Trump took office, so it’s a stretch to attribute sole credit to Trump or his policies.

Was Omarosa working with the Clintons?
","Omarosa Manigault Newman was known on The Apprentice for her dramatic flair and ruthless ambition. President Donald Trump hired his former contestant to work on his campaign and then in the White House. Now that she’s not part of the administration, those reality TV tactics have come to haunt him. Omarosa re-entered the headlines in August with her book Unhinged, which recounts a tumultuous year in the Trump White House. She also claimed to have heard a tape in which Trump used racial slurs, and then provided CBS with a recording of Trump campaign staffers discussing the incident. (On Aug. 14, Trump tweeted that Omarosa was ""a lowlife"" and ""a dog."") The drama led some websites friendly to Trump to speculate about Omarosa’s motivations. One article written by the Young Conservatives and posted on Chicks on the Right has the headline, ""Omarosa exposed: Turns out she was actually working for Hillary."" The article was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We decided to investigate whether Omarosa ""was actually working"" for Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton. It turns out the connections are nothing new. The headline of the article implies a new revelation about Manigault Newman’s connections to the Clintons by saying she was ""exposed."" But the body of the article focuses on Omarosa’s previous connections to the Clintons, which were already public knowledge. There is no evidence that Omarosa double-crossed Trump in favor of Hillary Clinton. In 2000, she briefly worked for President Bill Clinton in the White House. After moving between jobs in the administration, she was fired. Omarosa emerged as a reality television star in 2004, making her name as a contestant on Trump’s TV show, The Apprentice. She quickly became known as a reality TV villain, fighting with the other contestants and creating chaos within the competition. She was invited back to The Apprentice twice, and also participated in Celebrity Big Brother. During her early career as a reality TV contestant, Omarosa openly supported the Clintons and would mention her experience in the White House alongside them. In a 2015 Washington Post article, she identified as a ""die-hard"" Hillary supporter. In 2018, while competing on Celebrity Big Brother after leaving the Trump administration, she said that she had done work on the Ready For Hillary super PAC before joining the Trump campaign: ""It wasn’t hard when (Trump) called me and said ‘Can you be on board?’ because I had just been used and abused by the Ready for Hillary organization."" We contacted Chicks on the Right to ask if they had proof that Omarosa was working for Hillary while serving as Trump’s White House director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison. They responded with a quote from Nick Arama, who wrote the story. ""Our added commentary is only opinion and our commentary doesn't claim Omarosa was simultaneously working for Hillary while working in the Trump White House,"" he said. ""We think many people do find it troubling that she was working Ready for Hillary in 2015, just one year before the election."" They also clarified that the ""added commentary is only opinion."" After we contacted them, Chicks on the Right added a clarification at the end of the article: ""We’re not claiming that we have evidence that Omarosa was working for Hillary during her work for Trump. We are noting how soon in time that she worked for Hillary before she worked for Trump."" The Young Conservatives article featured the headline, ""Omarosa Exposed: Turns Out She Was Actually Working For Hillary."" This headline may mislead readers into believing Omarosa was a double-agent during her time in the Trump administration. There is no evidence this is true. The article calls into question Omarosa’s loyalty to Trump from his campaign to her year in the White House given her previous record of supporting Hillary Clinton and working for Bill Clinton. After she had a falling-out with Hillary Clinton’s campaign organizers, Omarosa was recruited by Trump to help his campaign. The claim is partially accurate but missing substantial context.

Beto O'Rourke says U.S. blacks have 10 times less wealth than whites
","Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic nominee challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said that vast U.S. wealth differences show the economy doesn’t work for everyone. The El Paso congressman’s half-page ad, in the Houston Defender’s July 26, 2018, issue, shows O’Rourke shaking hands with an African-American man. Accompanying text says: ""Our economy isn't working for everyone when black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans. Let's level the playing field by ensuring access to good jobs, higher pay, skills training, and a fair shot at economic success."" A reminder: Wealth is distinct from income. It measures how much we own, not how much we make. While the two are closely tied, economists talk about wealth in terms of net worth. A house, for example, adds to net worth if its value is higher than the amount of the mortgage. Assets minus debts gives you net worth. 2016 federal survey We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the basis of O’Rourke’s ""10 times less"" claim in the ad, which had come to our attention in a Texas Tribune news story on O’Rourke’s advertising expenditures. By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign pointed out an October 2017 Washington Post Wonkblog story and other reports rooted in 2016 consumer survey data summed up by the Federal Reserve in fall 2017. That data, Evans told us, pegged the median net worth of white families at 10 times the median net worth of black families. The Wonkblog story says that according to the survey results, the ""median net worth of white families — $171,000 — is now 10 times that of black families and eight times that of Hispanic families."" A factor, the story says, is that ""white families are five times more likely than black or Hispanic families to inherit money. That translates into opportunity — a down payment on a home, tuition to go to school, capital to build a small business, savings to retire on."" Other factors, the story says, include distinct rates of home ownership and participation in job-related savings plans. Median and average wealth differences According to a pair of September 2017 Federal Reserve articles, the agency’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances reached 6,254 families with queries on households’ total pre-tax income, balance sheets, pensions, income and demographic characteristics. ""No other study for the country collects comparable information,"" the agency says. The 2016 survey found about a 10-to-1 difference in the median wealth/net worth of white and black Americans--the ratio between $171,000 and $17,600. Net worth is defined as the difference between families' gross assets and their liabilities. The survey results otherwise suggest the difference in the average wealth of white and black Americans is nearly 7-to-1--$933,700 for white residents and $138,200 for black residents. (An equal number of households earn more and less than each median. Averages are based on adding up reported incomes and dividing by the number of households.) The Fed offered one other comparison: Nearly 1 in 5 black households reported zero or negative net worth compared to a smaller share of white households, 9 percent, the study says. Factors behind white-black difference We spotted a Fed chart specifying disparities by race identified in the survey in household income and by whether people reported owning  homes and cars or having retirement accounts: SOURCE: Excerpted from chart in data analysis, ""Recent Trends in Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,"" FEDS Notes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Sept. 27, 2017 (accessed Aug. 17, 2018) As O’Rourke’s spokesman also noted, the Pew Research Center took a longer view of the wealth disparity singled out by O’Rourke. Pew’s November 2017 Fact Tank story says that according to the Fed’s surveys over the years, the wealth gap between white and black and Hispanic households shrank by about half from 2007 to 2016. The month before, another non-partisan entity, the Urban Institute, updated its charts drawing on the Fed’s surveys. For more than 50 years, the institute says, white families have outpaced black and Hispanic families in average wealth. We asked the institute to evaluate O’Rourke’s claim. The statement had the right spirit, we heard back, though Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow, offered a caveat in that the 2016 Fed survey suggests that black Americans had one-tenth the median wealth of whites, not 10 times less. Older survey A 2014 PunditFact fact-check led us to fetch what turned out to be older results from a different survey. In June 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau released its estimates of household net incomes attributed to its 2013 Survey of Income and Program Participation. Tables in the release suggest that white households at the time had median net worths of $103,796 and black households had net worths of $9,211--signaling an 11-to-1 ratio. White households had average net worths of $292,217, the bureau says, compared to $91,595 for black households--indicating a 3-to-1 ratio. Our ruling O’Rourke said that ""black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans."" Survey results pinpoint two ways to gauge such disparities. According to the Fed’s 2016 consumer survey, black Americans had one-tenth the median wealth of white Americans while black Americans had a little over one-seventh the average wealth of white Americans.

West Virginia GOP tweet correct about job growth
","President Donald Trump often touts job growth on his watch as one of his top accomplishments in office. State Republican party organizations have followed his lead. The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted on Aug. 8, 2018, that ""the American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history, with 3.9 million jobs added since President Trump was elected."" The American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history, with 3.9 million jobs added since President Trump was elected. https://t.co/qmaW68IDdH #WVGOP The tweet cited a White House web page as its source. But we dug into the numbers ourselves just to be sure. We’ll take the two parts of the tweet separately. PolitiFact has previously confirmed that the United States is in the midst of its longest positive job growth streak in history -- 94 months and counting. Here is a chart showing month-to-month employment increases or decreases since January 2008. There has not been a monthly decline since 2010. The tweet fails to mention that most of these months of job growth occurred on President Barack Obama’s watch, which are noted in blue in the chart above. So Trump, whose months of job growth are noted in red starting in 2017, did not accomplish this feat on his own. We looked at official Bureau of Labor Statistics data and found that since November 2016, when Trump was elected, the economy has added about 3.9 million jobs. That’s what the tweet said. Starting from this point, of course, includes two and a half months when Obama was still president. If you calculate the figure using January 2017 instead -- when Trump actually took office -- the number would be 3.4 million. We’ll note that economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. The West Virginia Republican Party said, ""The American economy is continuing its longest monthly streak of job growth in history, with 3.9 million jobs added since President Trump was elected."" Both parts of this claim are accurate, and while it’s worth noting that no president deserves full credit for economic achievements on their watch, the tweet was carefully worded and is not substantially misleading.

No, the United States isn't the cleanest country
","President Donald Trump touted the United States’ environmental health during a speech in coal country. ""I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we’ve got it. We’ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now,"" Trump said in an Aug. 21 rally in Charleston, W.Va. ""There’s nobody cleaner than us, and it’s getting better and better."" Does the United States dominate when it comes to water and air quality? Let’s take a look. The Environmental Performance Index is the go-to source for questions on environmental quality. Yale and Columbia University researchers teamed up with the World Economic Forum in 2018 to compile the data. Using 10 categories, they ranked the United States 27th. On air it ranks 10th and on water, 29th. Among wealthy democracies, the United States ranks toward the bottom, according to Zachary Wendling, principal investigator at the Environmental Performance Index. Switzerland ranked first on the overall index, Barbados ranked first on air quality, and eight European countries tied for first on water. European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan tend to top the United States in environmental performance. Clean air The air quality ranking is broken up into three parts. On indoor air quality, the United States ranks first. We don’t cook by burning biomass, so that isn’t surprising, Jeffrey Geddes, a Boston University professor who studies air quality, told us. The United States ranks 88th on exposure to particulate matter, which Geddes called ""a really good indicator for health effects from air pollution."" The scientists used satellites and ground-based measurements to collect the data for 228 countries and territories dating from 2008 to 2015. That predates Trump. In general, however, changes between 2018 scores and the baseline (roughly 10 years earlier) are mixed and small, Wendling said. The Environmental Protection Agency’s own research shows a continued decline in air pollutants from 1990. But experts said Trump’s deregulatory practices may have the opposite effect. ""Deregulation of automobile emissions standards will increase air pollution, particularly in dense urban areas,"" said Elizabeth Albright, an environmental science professor at Duke University. The United States ranks 29th overall in water quality. In drinking water, it ranks first (alongside nine other countries) and in sanitation, 31st. ""For both drinking water and sanitation, the United States is performing okay in absolute terms, with about 3.3 disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 people from risks due to unsafe drinking water, as compared to 6.4 for unsafe sanitation,"" Wendling said. Wendling said the lower sanitation ranking might be explained by rural populations that rely on septic tanks, but there is enough uncertainty in the data that estimates for high-income countries should be treated with caution. Experts said the United States still had a long ways to go before being ranked cleanest. ""Any idea we have the freshest water is entirely laughable,"" said Ashok Gadgil, an environmental engineering professor at Berkeley University. ""The U.S. does a very good job of producing relatively clean drinking water at very low cost, but we fall far short on our investments in water infrastructure investments—that was the case in Flint, and it also is the case in thousands of other water systems around the country,"" said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer. ""Some people could argue it is clean enough for the price, but we are not the cleanest."" In 2016, 5,363 water systems serving 17.6 million people violated EPA's lead and copper rule, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist non-profit group. The White House did not respond our request for comment. Trump said, ""I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we’ve got it. We’ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now."" No ranking places the United States at the top of their list for cleanliness. The United States has ample room to improve on air quality when it comes to other developed democracies. While some cities’ water systems violate domestic environmental standards, the United States overall ties for best when it comes to drinking water.

Not so fast: Vin Diesel didn’t die in a failed stunt attempt
","A rumor making the rounds on social media regarding the untimely death of actor Vin Diesel may be leaving readers feeling quite aghast and furious. ""Just in: actor ‘Vin Deisel’ (sic) dies after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set,"" reads a headline of an article on the website thth.mayatmenen.info. That sounds sadder than the death of Groot. But did it really happen? The article is a pitch-black void of evidence to suggest that Diesel died. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Figuring out the facts of this story was less complicated than the plot of XXX. For starters, Diesel’s name is spelled incorrectly in the headline.  It’s also notable that there’s no byline for the article. Reputable news stories usually come with a byline to keep writers accountable and allow readers to contact the author if necessary. Below the headline, there are two paragraphs lifted, word-for-word, from Vin Diesel’s Wikipedia page.  The page also contains a video clip featuring a Fox News logo and a newscaster. Clicking on it, you’d expect to hear a news anchor reporting on the news of Vin Diesel’s death.   But if you click on the video, you’ll actually hear the anchor say, ""Finally, I have some very sad news,"" before the clip freezes and is replaced by the words ""Share to Uncover This Video."" Clicking on those words opens up a pop-up window that allows you to share a link to the article on Facebook. We found after we shared the story, the video still would not load. A Nexis search revealed that no major news outlets have reported on Diesel’s death, and no obituaries have been written for him.

Flip-Flop: Leah Vukmir accused donor of trying to buy U.S. Senate seat, now she's asking his support
","In the space of nine days, Leah Vukmir went from condemning Richard Uihlein’s campaign cash to essentially soliciting it. Seem like a flip-flop? Unwrap the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to rate a person’s consistency on an issue  — in this case, Vukmir’s position toward Uihlein, the conservative mega-donor. Who is Uihlein? Uihlein, an Illinois resident, is a founder of Uline Corp., a shipping and packaging supply company based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., near the Illinois border. If anyone could almost single-handedly make political newcomer Kevin Nicholson into a viable candidate for the U.S. Senate, it was Uihlein. All of our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Nicholson ultimately lost to Vukmir, a longtime state lawmaker, in the Aug. 14, 2018 Republican primary for the right to take on the incumbent, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, in the fall. But he took the fight to Vukmir -- in no small part because of spending by Uihlein. Groups supported by Uihlein spent nearly $11 million in support of Nicholson and against his rival, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported several days before the primary. For example, the Uihlein-backed group Solutions for Wisconsin made a $911,000 television buy in the final days. What Vukmir said about him Now, to what Vukmir has said about Uihlein  — the contrasting statements having been pointed out in an Associated Press news article. Aug. 6, 2018: ""Try to buy"" Eight days before the primary, Vukmir was salty toward Uihlein. ""I think it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of a lot of people that a particular out-of-state donor is spending as much money as he is to, in essence, almost try to buy a Senate seat, and that’s not what Wisconsin politics is about,"" Vukmir told Green Bay conservative radio talk show John Muir, in a clear reference to Uihlein. That Vukmir remark echoed criticism from Democrats, who 10 months earlier were complaining that Uihlein was trying to buy the seat for Nicholson. Aug. 15, 2018: ""Reaching out"" The day after her primary win, however, Vukmir was conciliatory. ""We are already reaching out to Dick Uihlein and I hope that he will want to continue with his commitment,"" Vukmir said to conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling. ""Let’s face it, he wants to defeat Tammy Baldwin. And so I will look forward to having that conversation with him,"" Vukmir added, noting she would be attending a unity dinner two days later co-hosted by Uihlein. Our rating The Flip-O-Meter has three ratings:

No Flip – No significant change in position.

Half Flip – A partial change in position.

Full Flop – A complete change in position. In this case, Vukmir went from condemning Uihlein’s campaign contributions to essentially soliciting them.

Beto O'Rourke arrested in 1990s for burglary and DWI
","Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke of Texas has said that in younger days he was twice arrested in his hometown of El Paso--once, he says, for leaping a campus fence and the other time for driving while intoxicated. Readers have asked us whether the third-term congressman challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has a criminal history. We decided to fact-check mention of the arrests in a 2012 TV ad that also was screenshot for an April 2017 Texas Tribune news story. In the ad, sponsored by then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, text next to what looks like O’Rourke’s mugshot states that the ""facts"" are that O’Rourke has a ""criminal record"" including burglary and DWI. The ad’s narrator says O’Rourke ""has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests."" That he does, we confirmed, which he’s acknowledged since his first run for office. We tried to phone and email Reyes about his claim and failed to connect. Next, we attempted to get our own fix on the facts by seeking documentation of the DWI arrest through a public information request to the El Paso Police Department. Martin Rodriguez, a department records specialist, said by email the agency had no responsive records. We similarly queried the University of Texas at El Paso about the earlier arrest and didn’t immediately hear back. A background check Separately, we ran a background check of O’Rourke using the LexisNexis service. According to the results, O’Rourke’s May 1995 misdemeanor arrest on the UTEP campus was later declined and his September 1998 misdemeanor DWI arrest in El Paso was dismissed. The check gave us case numbers for the arrests enabling us to fetch an El Paso County record stating that O’Rourke was initially arrested in May 1995 and that case was disposed of in February 1996. We saw too that after the DWI arrest, according to another county record, O’Rourke was referred to a misdemeanor diversion program in March 1999 and completed ""DWI school"" in May 1999. That document’s last entry, dated Oct. 20, 1999, says: ""Misdemeanor diversion completed successfully."" Campaign: O’Rourke often confirms arrests When we sought detail from O’Rourke’s spokesman, Chris Evans, he said by email that O’Rourke had consistently addressed his arrests, notably during campaign stops in Paris, Sunnyside, San Antonio and Houston, where O’Rourke told a group in August 2018 that he spent a night in the El Paso County jail after what he referred to as his 1995 arrest for criminal trespass. In San Antonio, a resident told O’Rourke she’d seen what someone described as his mugshot. O’Rourke replied: ""More than 20 years ago, I was arrested--not once, but twice. So you should know that and we should all own that, if asked."" O’Rourke specified that he’d been arrested for attempting to hop a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso and later, he said, for a ""far more serious mistake: I drove under the influence of alcohol. There’s no justifying that."" April 2005 news story The oldest published account of the arrests appears to be an April 2005 El Paso Times news story about O’Rourke’s successful run for a seat on the El Paso City Council. The story, which we found by searching the Nexis news database, quoted the incumbent, Anthony Cobos, stressing O’Rourke’s DWI arrest. Cobos, who later served as county judge before being convicted on embezzlement charges, said at the time: ""I think you lead by example and his example speaks for itself."" According to the story, O'Rourke was arrested on a DWI charge in September 1998 that was dismissed in 1999 after he completed a court-recommended DWI program. ""I've been open about that since the very beginning. I have owned up to it and I have taken responsibility for it,"" O’Rourke told the paper. The Times further reported that court records showed that O’Rourke earlier was arrested in 1995 at UTEP on a burglary of building charge, which was later dropped. O’Rourke told the paper: ""That happened while I was in college. I along with some friends were horsing around, and we snuck under the fence at the UTEP physical plant and set off an alarm. We were arrested by UTEP police. ... UTEP decided not to press charges. We weren't intending to do any harm,"" he was quoted saying. O’Rourke’s campaign later provided a photo of a document Evans described by email as the original UTEP police report on O’Rourke’s arrest there. It says O’Rourke and two other students were arrested at the university’s Physical Plant under the ""burglary"" portion of the state penal code, section 30.02, for ""attempted forcible entry."" Congressman Reyes’ TV ad Seven years later, then-Rep. Reyes unveiled his ad, which was still viewable online as of Aug. 22, 2018. A May 2012 Times news story on the ad quoted O’Rourke saying that he was driving an intoxicated friend home when he was arrested for DWI. The story said that according to police records, O’Rourke completed a diversion program and the charge was dismissed. In August 2017, more recently, O’Rourke described the arrests to an East Texas newspaper. The Palestine Herald-Press quoted him saying: ""Some 20 years ago, I was charged with driving under the influence and, during my college years, I jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge,"" O'Rourke said. ""I was not convicted of either. ""Both incidents were due to poor judgement and I have no excuse for my behavior then. However, since then, I have used my opportunities to serve my community and my state. I'm grateful for the second chance and believe that we all deserve second chances."" Our ruling A 2012 Reyes TV ad still viewable online six years later said O’Rourke ""has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests."" O'Rourke's comments and records indicate that UTEP police arrested O'Rourke in 1995 for  burglary, a misdemeanor charge disposed of the next year. In 1998, El Paso police arrested O'Rourke for DWI, a misdemeanor charge that was dismissed after he completed ""DWI school"" the next year. We rate the claim True.

","With three top research universities a half-hour drive from one another and the well-established Research Triangle Park, the Triangle area is increasingly attractive to large corporations.

Roy Cooper to discuss a possible new project.  Talk of the two tech giants coming to North Carolina has sparked pushback from advocacy groups. The Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, launched a campaign telling these companies to stay away from North Carolina because the state’s November ballot will ask voters whether to approve a constitutional amendment creating a voter ID requirement. No Gay No Way, a Washington-based campaign, is against Amazon putting a second headquarters in any state with discriminatory policies against the LGBTQ community, and the organization lists North Carolina as one of those states. The Civitas Institute, a conservative Raleigh group, tweeted on June 25, 2018, that Amazon and Apple already operate in states with various levels of voter ID laws, so the proposed voter ID amendment should not be a factor in deciding to open an Apple campus or Amazon headquarters in North Carolina. Is that true? Do Apple and Amazon, known for their liberal social stances, already operate in states with strict voter ID laws? According to the National Conference of State Legislators, 34 states have voter ID laws as of 2018. The strictest voter ID laws are in Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Dakota and Ohio. PolitiFact North Carolina looked at Apple and Amazon press release archives for information on their locations. Where does Amazon operate? Amazon’s headquarters is in Seattle. A voter ID bill became law in Washington state in 2005, after the company was founded in 1994. The law is categorized by NCSL as non-strict, meaning there is an option for voters without identification to be able to vote, such as signing an affidavit of identity. Strict voter ID laws, according to the NCSL, require voters to have ID, or vote on a provisional ballot and take extra steps to have their vote count. At Amazon fulfillment centers, the company stores the products sellers send before shipping them to buyers. Arizona, home of several fulfillment centers, passed a strict voter ID law in 2005. Three years later, Amazon opened its first fulfillment center in Goodyear, Arizona. Indiana passed one of the country’s strictest voter ID laws in 2005. Amazon opened fulfillment centers there in 2008 and 2011. Virginia passed a strict voter ID law in 2013, a year after Amazon opened a fulfillment center there. In 2011, Amazon opened three fulfillment centers in Tennessee. That’s the same year the state passed a strict voter ID bill. Nine of the American cities on the Amazon shortlist have some type of voter ID law. Where does Apple operate? Apple’s first campus was built in Cupertino, California, where there are no voter ID laws. However, Apple’s third campus is in Austin, Texas. There has been a voter ID requirement in Texas since 1997. Apple has had a presence in the state since 1992, according to Terri Bolin, the manager of lobby operations for the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Apple expanded its presence in Austin again in 2016, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce’s 2016-2018 relocation and expansion records. The state tried to make the 1997 voter ID law stricter in 2011 by allowing only government-issued IDs to be used. The law was struck down by a federal district court, but a non-strict photo ID law from 2017 went into effect in 2018. The original 1997 law is categorized as a strict photo-ID law by the NCSL. In 2017, Apple announced it would be building a data center in Iowa. That’s the same year Iowa passed a voter ID bill. The company also has plans to expand its existing operations in Arizona. Arizona is known for having some of the strictest voter ID requirements in the country since 2005. The North Carolina General Assembly placed six constitutional amendments on this fall’s statewide ballot. If the voter ID amendment passes, the legislature would follow up by writing a law with details, so there is no information on how strict the voter ID requirement would be. A North Carolina voter ID law from 2013 was struck down by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as unconstitutionally discriminatory. PolitiFact ruling The Civitas Institute’s statement that Apple and Amazon already operate in states with voter ID laws is accurate. While some of their offices, such as in Washington state and Virginia, predate the laws, many others don’t. They have built offices, such as in Tennessee and Iowa, either after a voter ID bill became law, or the same year. PolitiFact North Carolina rates this statement True.

In Florida governor's race, ad attacks Gwen Graham for mega mall project
","Democrat Gwen Graham is facing attacks for her family’s role in the American Dream mega-mall project in Miami. Unite Here Florida PAC, a union group that represents service industry workers, launched a TV ad that refers to the Graham family and the project as ""their controversial mega-mall."" ""Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall,"" says the text of the ad. ""60 percent of the jobs at the American Dream Mall will be low-wage. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion."" The ad is running in advance of the Aug. 28 primary for governor. A union associated with the PAC has endorsed Philip Levine, one of Graham’s Democratic rivals. Levine said he is against the development, citing low-wage jobs and traffic. The ad overstates the role of Graham and her family in the project, and more context is needed about the low-wage jobs and impact on wildlife and traffic. The PAC sent us information from local news reports, as well as county records about the project. Graham Companies is involved in the mall project. But Graham has not served on the board for the company since she won elected office, and her family is not the project developer. When Graham started in Congress in 2015, she stepped down from the company and put all of her assets in a transparent trust. Graham owns about $13.7 million million in company stock, and made about $830,000 in income in 2017, according to her financial disclosure. Her campaign spokesman said she owns less than 1 percent of voting stock. Graham said if the state had to act on the project and she were governor, she would recuse herself and let her elected counterparts on the Cabinet make decisions. Graham has emphasized that her family isn’t the developer. ""My family is not building a mall. Period. End of story,"" she said during a forum in Jacksonville. It’s true that her family isn’t building the mall, but approximately 80 acres owned by the Graham Companies is under contract for purchase by the American Dream developers, said Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, the developer’s lobbyist. That piece of land is a little less than half of the 174-acre project. Triple Five, the company that developed Minnesota's Mall of America, wants to build the $4 billion mall project, which includes an indoor ski slope, hotel and a submarine lake. The project between Interstate 75 and Florida’s Turnpike in northwest Miami-Dade County is expected to draw 30 million visitors a year. Diaz de la Portilla said the amount of money the Graham Companies will receive from the land sale is confidential. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate research analyst who isn’t involved in the project, estimated that the 80 acres would sell for between $2.4 million and $6.5 million. The Graham Companies is also planning to build a mixed-used development on 300 acres south of the mall. In May, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted in favor of zoning approval for the mall. In July, the South Florida Regional Planning Council voted against the project but that is largely symbolic because the county and the state have authority. It still has to go through several other approvals before it is built. County records show the American Dream will create about 14,530 permanent full-time jobs. About 64 percent of those workers would earn less than $25,000 a year. The federal poverty guideline is $25,100 for a family of four. For an individual it is $12,140. Diaz de la Portilla said the developer projects 25,000 permanent direct and indirect jobs based on the developer’s experience at other malls. He said the county used a specific model to project a range of direct jobs of 9,236 to 22,331. The project has drawn criticism from environmentalists, such as the Sierra Club and Everglades Trust. The trust endorsed Graham in spite of it. ""While we are fighting like the dickens to ensure the survival of the Everglades and the source of drinking water for eight million Floridians, mega-developers and projects like these continue to put it all at risk,"" said Everglades Trust executive director Kimberly Mitchell. The county staff analysis, which recommended approval, stated that the site contains wetlands. It also stated that the site is within the core foraging area of wood stork colonies and may provide habitat and/or foraging areas for several threatened and endangered animal species. The county’s environmental resources department drafted provisions within the development agreement related to stormwater management, natural resources and endangered species, Diaz de la Portilla said. The project is expected to generate 70,000 vehicle trips a day. Diaz de la Portilla said that the developer has to mitigate the impacts on the environment and the traffic, which includes spending more than $200 million on road infrastructure and public transportation. He said that the site has been inside the county’s Urban Development Boundary for over a decade. A Unite Here Florida TV ad said, ""Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion."" The ad was imprecise when it said that her family’s company is ""behind the American Dream Mall."" That could create a misleading impression that her family is developing the mall. Her family owns about 80 acres which is under contract for the developer, less than half of the future mall site. We don’t know how much Graham and her family will earn from the sale of the land, which is under contract, but one real estate analyst told us the sale could be for millions of dollars. Graham’s financial disclosure shows she owned $13.7 million in stock in the Graham Companies in 2017. Graham has not been on the board of her family's company since she won elected office. About two-thirds of the permanent jobs will pay less than $25,000. That is the federal poverty guideline for a family of four, but more than twice the poverty level for an individual. Plans show that the development site includes habitats for threatened and endangered species and will add to traffic in the area. We rate this statement Half True.","[('Unite Here Florida PAC, TV ad, Aug. 16, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7tkXLlU1E4&feature=youtu.be'), ('Miami Dade County Commission, American Dream Mall application, May 17, 2018', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""How a mega-mall project became an issue in Florida governor race,"" Aug. 8, 2018', 'http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/legistarfiles/Matters/Y2018/181204.pdf'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Jeff Greene says he sold his oil, energy investments as feud with Gwen Graham escalates,"" Aug. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Labor union launches ads targeting Gwen Graham over the American Dream mega-mall,"" Aug. 15, 2018', 'https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/08/08/jeff-greene-says-he-sold-his-oil-energy-investments-as-feud-with-gwen-graham-escalates/'), ('Miami Herald, ""Westward whoa: Planning board gives thumbs down to mega-malland 836 extension,"" Aug. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Miami Herald, ""Five things to watch for as Miami-Dade prepares for American Dream mega-mall vote,"" May 17, 2018', 'https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/08/15/labor-union-launches-ads-targeting-gwen-graham-over-the-american-dream-mega-mall/'), ('Miami Herald, ""Nation\'s largest mall wins Miami-Dade approval as county backs American Dream Miami,"" May 17, 2018', 'No link'), ('Tallahassee Democrat, ""Gwen Graham\'s net worth tops $14 million,"" June 29, 2018', 'https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/06/20/gwen-grahams-net-worth-tops-14-million/718221002/'), ('WLRN, ""These Are The Wetlands Where Developers Plan To Build American Dream Mega-Mall,"" July 3, 2018', 'No link'), ('Orlando Sentinel, ""Commentary: Malarkey Meter vets claims by Putnam, Greene and Grayson,"" Aug. 10, 2018', 'http://www.wlrn.org/post/these-are-wetlands-where-developers-plan-build-american-dream-mega-mall'), ('AP, ""Miami-Dade approves megamall that would be largest in US,"" May 17, 2018', 'No link'), ('CBS4, ""Facing South Florida: One-On-One With Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Philip Levine,"" Aug. 12, 2018', 'http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-putnam-desantis-graham-greene-malarkey-meter-scott-maxwell-20180809-story.html'), ('WPLG ABC10, ""Panel urges Miami mega-mall be delayed over traffic concerns,"" Aug. 8, 2018', 'No link'), ('Sun Sentinel, ""Massive American Dream mall tricky for governor candidate Gwen Graham,"" July 26, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEyiRtI6D6w'), ('South Florida Business Journal, ""North America\'s biggest mall and entertainment center coming:American Dream Miami approved,"" May 18, 2018', 'No link'), ('Interview, Austin Shafran, Unite Here Florida PAC spokesman, Aug. 14, 2018', 'https://www.local10.com/news/florida/miami-dade/panel-urges-miami-mega-mall-be-delayed-over-traffic-concerns'), ('Interview, Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, lobbyist for Triple 5, developer of American Dream, Aug. 16, 2018', 'No link'), ('Interview, Matt Harringer, Gwen Graham spokesman, Aug. 16, 2018', 'http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/miami-dade/fl-reg-american-dream-miami-gwen-graham-20180726-story.html'), ('Interview, Jack McCabe, McCabe Research & Consulting, Aug. 16, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/aug/22/unite-here-florida-pac/florida-governors-race-ad-attacks-gwen-graham-mega/

Despite Brad Schimel's claim, in Wisconsin you don't need an ID to buy a beer like you do to vote
","It’s hard to imagine how many thousands of times a day someone in Wisconsin, without having to prove who they are, buys a beer at a bar or a restaurant. Or, for that matter, at a baseball stadium, a church festival or any number of other places in the Beer State  — er, Badger State. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. So, it was puzzling to see the state’s top law enforcement officer — speaking in the context of the state law that requires photo identification to vote  — claim that ""we need an ID"" to ""buy a beer."" The claim Brad Schimel’s claim came in a video attached to a tweet from what is labeled as his campaign Twitter account. The tweet was posted on Aug. 12, 2018, two days before Wisconsin’s primary elections. Schimel ran unopposed in the Republican primary, seeking re-election as the state attorney general, where he leads the Department of Justice (DOJ). The text of Schimel’s tweet noted that Wisconsin law requires a photo identification to vote. The reference to beer comes in the 40-second video, which also focuses on the voter ID law and was produced as part of his re-election campaign. Tweets: In Wisconsin, ""300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict voter ID law"" in the 2016 presidential election. False. The video begins with words on the screen, echoed by a narrator, that say: Integrity. It matters at the DOJ.  And it matters at the ballot box. That’s why Wisconsin voters have said time and again voter ID protects our votes. We need an ID to rent a car, buy a beer, check out a library book. It’s common sense to prove our identity when we vote. Need a photo ID to buy a beer? What the law requires Schimel campaign spokesman Johnny Koremenos, who has also worked as Schimel’s official spokesman at the Department of Justice, defended Schimel’s statement by telling us that getting asked for an ID to buy beer ""is commonplace in bars, liquor stores, and grocery stores across the state. In fact, some stores have policies to ID everybody, regardless of whether age has shown its physical signs or not."" Well, sure. But Schimel didn’t say you might be carded. He said -- likening it to casting a ballot at the polls -- that you need an ID to buy a beer. Article: Does Wisconsin’s new voter ID law ‘disenfranchise’ voters? In its publication about alcohol laws for retailers, the state Department of Revenue says retailers should demand proof of age of anyone ""who appears to be under the legal drinking age."" That is, 21. And the law on alcohol beverages says sellers may require a customer to provide ID. But the law does not require that identification be provided to buy a beer. As those of us well beyond 21 well know, there are countless times at countless venues where we’ve bought beer without having to show an ID. Which is something you can’t get away with at the polling place if you want to vote. Our rating Schimel says: ""We need an ID"" to ""buy a beer."" It’s a particularly misleading statement in the context in which the attorney general made it  — citing the state law that requires a photo ID in order to vote. In some places, especially if you look like you might be younger than 21, you might be required to show an ID in order to buy beer. But state law does not require people who want to buy a beer to produce an ID  — as many Wisconsin beer drinkers have known for many years. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Schimel a Mostly False.","[('Twitter, Brad Schimel tweet and video, Aug. 12, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/bradschimel/status/1028698795889094657?s=21'), ('Email, Brad Schimel campaign spokesman Johnny Koremenos, Aug. 16, 2018', 'No link'), ('Interview, Wisconsin Legislative Council senior staff attorney Melissa Schmidt, whose specialties include alcohol beverage regulation, Aug. 16, 2018', 'http://lc.legis.wisconsin.gov/staffdetail/detail/13'), ('Wisconsin Department of Revenue, ""Wisconsin Alcohol Beverage and\nTobacco Laws for Retailers,"" December 2016', 'No link'), ('Email, Wisconsin Department of Revenue spokeswoman Patty Mayers, Aug. 17, 2018', 'https://www.revenue.wi.gov/DOR%20Publications/pb302.pdf'), ('Wisconsin Legislature, Chapter 125 \xa0— Alcohol Beverages\n\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/aug/22/brad-schimel/despite-brad-schimels-claim-wisconsin-you-dont-nee/

Misleading claim by ‘Fox & Friends’ on California kids meal bill
","Would a California bill really limit restaurant drink options for children to ""only milk and water""? That’s the impression left by a recent segment on ""Fox & Friends"", an influential show that’s sometimes live-tweeted by President Trump. ""This is a state that can run amok with the regulations and the nanny state. Now they want to legislate what drinks kids can get at restaurants,"" claimed host Ed Henry early in the segment. ""There’s a bill that’s been proposed in the state of California (that would) only give children two options at restaurants: either milk or water,"" he continued. A second host then adds: ""Of course, obviously, I’m the parent, I want to be able to make that decision. Where does it go? Some people in California think dairy is bad… . Or maybe it’s wheat. So how far will this go? That’s the question."" We wanted to know: Does the bill really restrict kids drinks to only milk or water? Or is there more to the legislation? We set out on a fact check. Our research The legislation in question is Senate Bill 1192 introduced by Democratic State Sen. Bill Monning. He has championed it as a way to encourage healthy beverage options for children. The bill has gained attention from many news outlets in addition to Fox and many have offered misleading or incomplete ways to describe the legislation. The bill received final approval from the California Legislature on Aug. 21 and was sent to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's desk for consideration.  Here’s part of what the bill says: ""This bill would require a restaurant, as defined, that sells a children’s meal that includes a beverage, to make the default beverage water, sparkling water, or flavored water, as specified, or unflavored milk or a nondairy milk alternative, as specified."" The Fox hosts generally get that portion of the bill correct. But they leave out, until the end of the segment, any reference to a key provision of the bill:   ""The bill would not prohibit a restaurant’s ability to sell, or a customer’s ability to purchase, an alternative beverage if the purchaser requests one."" The hosts also fail to mention that the bill applies only to restaurants with kids menus, though a chyron on the screen does reference kids’ meals. A third host near the end of the segment added: ""The parents have to actively ask to have soda for their children."" Based on the bill, and if their child is having a kids meal, that appears to be correct. Some restaurants have already removed soda from their kids meal menus. McDonald’s, for example, removed it in 2013, though the restaurant doesn’t turn down parents who ask for sodas with their child’s Happy Meal. A Fox News spokeswoman declined to speak on the record about the show’s presentation of the bill. Fox wasn't the only news outlet to leave the wrong impression. TheHill.com, a political news site, tweeted ""California bill blocks restaurants from serving kids anything to drink but water, milk."" Meanwhile, a patch.com news headline read ""Kids Menus Can Only Have Water, Milk Under California Bill."" In an interview, Monning described the Fox segment as ""misleading."" He added that ""Fox & Friends"" appeared to have shaped the story ""to fit preconceived notions"" about the proposal. Numerous health organizations support the bill and there’s no known opposition from other interest groups, according to reports by state Senate and Assembly committee staff.   Our ruling  During a recent ""Fox & Friends"" segment and on the show’s Twitter page, the claim was made: ""California is proposing to legislate what drinks restaurants can serve your kids, only giving two options: milk or water."" The claim ignores the critical fact that the bill allows restaurants, upon request, to serve children other drinks such as juice or soda. It also disregards the fact that the bill would only apply to restaurants with a kids menu. Two of the show’s hosts, along with a tweet following the segment, offered deceptive portrayals of the bill, leaving the average person with the impression it could be milk, water or nothing for kids at California restaurants. A third host then noted parents could still request soda for their children. That clarification, buried near the end of the segment, doesn’t balance out an otherwise misleading presentation. We rate the show's claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.","[('""Fox & Friends,"" segment and tweet on California Senate Bill 1192, Aug. 19, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/1031151926623330310'), ('Senate Bill 1192, text, accessed August 2018', 'No link'), ('Caley Cronin, spokeswoman, Fox News, phone interview Aug. 21, 2018', 'https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1192'), ('California State Sen.

Did Kelli Ward call for 'restraint in fighting terrorism'?
","A political ad in Arizona portrays Republican U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward as soft in the fight against terrorism. ""ISIS killed thousands. Plotted attacks on U.S. soil. They're a real threat. But Kelli Ward called for restraint in fighting terrorism. Restraint against those who want to kill our citizens?"" said the narrator in an Aug. 11 ad launched by Defend Arizona, a political action committee that supports conservatives and ""leaders who have fought for our country — not just career politicians."" Ward is a former Arizona state senator competing for the U.S. Senate seat opening up as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake retires at the end of his term in January 2019. Other Republicans in the race include former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Rep. Martha McSally, who served in the U.S. Air Force. Defend Arizona supports McSally. The primary election is Aug. 28. We found that Defend Arizona’s ad cherry-picked comments Ward made in a 2016 radio interview discussing terrorism. Ward said that the traditional conservative foreign policy of restraint and realism needed to be ""brought back into the process,"" but also said the U.S. should be willing to ""decimate,"" not just curb or control the terrorist group ISIS. Defend Arizona’s ad opens with the image of a man wearing a black mask and raising a knife as the narrator says, ""ISIS killed thousands."" ""Plotted attacks on U.S. soil. They're a real threat,"" the ad continues, including a photo of the perpetrator of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, who claimed to be a soldier of the terrorist group ISIS. ""But Kelli Ward called for restraint in fighting terrorism,"" the narrator said, over an image and video of Ward along with text that read, ""Kelli Ward on fighting ISIS ‘...restraint and realism.’ That scene cites as its source the Seth Leibsohn Show, June 28, 2016. Ward in 2016 ran an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate against Sen. John McCain. McCain won the Republican primary and went on to be re-elected in the general election. In a June 2016 radio interview, host Leibsohn said that while the economy is often the factor driving an election, in 2016, national security was the focus. Leibsohn asked Ward how to combat global terrorism and, ""What would you say should be our policy towards ISIS?"" Ward: ""It’s a huge, huge problem. I think that No. 1, we do have to have a president in the oval office, a commander in chief who has a strategy to win. ""We can’t continue with this strategy of go in and do nation building, try to spread democracy, and unfortunately we had that policy under George W. Bush as well. It isn’t what traditional conservative foreign policy has been, which is restraint and realism. Those things need to be brought back into the process in the foreign policy arena. I think that we also, we have to be willing to decimate ISIS – not control them, not to curb their activities."" Leibsohn: ""Not live with them, right?"" Ward: ""Not live with them, not to empower them, certainly not to empower them, and I think it is going to take that strong commander-in-chief and then conservative reinforcements in both the House and Senate to make it happen."" Ward referenced ""restraint and realism"" as needed for overall foreign policy, but she spoke differently of combating terrorism. Defend Arizona did not respond to PolitiFact’s query by deadline. It’s not the first time Ward’s ""restraint"" comment is used against her.  A pro-McCain ad in July 2016 also highlighted her ""restraint and realism"" response, with the narrator adding, ""When Americans are under attack, restraint won’t destroy ISIS."" Ward’s 2016 campaign spokesman Stephen Sebastian told the Arizona Republic in 2016 that Ward ""believes in Reagan’s 'Peace Through Strength' as well as 'realism and restraint’."" ""As a military wife whose husband has served in Iraq, Dr. Ward said she will support military engagement 'only as a last resort when national security is clearly at stake, only when Constitutionally approved by Congress, and only when there is a real strategy for victory, not expensive occupations and endless nation-building,"" Sebastian then told the newspaper. A Defend Arizona ad said Ward, ""called for restraint in fighting terrorism."" In a 2016 radio interview, Ward said ""restraint and realism"" needed to be brought back into U.S. foreign policy in the fight against terrorism, but Ward’s comment did not stop there.

Ashley Moody, Republican candidate for Florida AG, wasn’t a “lifelong Democrat”
","Once a Democrat, always a Democrat? That’s how a Republican candidate for Florida attorney general attacked his primary opponent in an ad weeks before the Aug. 28 primary. Frank White, a member of the Florida House since 2016, is challenging Ashley Moody, who was a Florida circuit court judge for 10 years before she resigned to run for attorney general. ""Ashley Moody sued Donald Trump for fraud,"" said an ad from White, referencing when Moody was a plaintiff in a lawsuit concerning Trump’s involvement in the development of the unfinished Trump Tower Tampa. ""Now she wants to be our Republican attorney general. How could we ever trust her?"" Then the ad goes even further: ""Ashley Moody was a lifelong Democrat."" That would be an interesting development in a Republican primary, if it were true. But it is not. Moody was a registered Democrat for five years, but has been a registered Republican for the last 20. ""Lifelong"" ≠ 1993 to 1998 Under law, Florida voter registrations are public records and can be released to any person upon request. So we acquired Moody’s records from the supervisor of elections in Hillsborough County, where Moody currently lives, as well as elections supervisors in other counties where she had previously lived.    We found that Moody first registered to vote in 1993, when she was 18. At that time, she registered as a Democrat in Hillsborough County.   Moody later moved to Alachua County to attend the University of Florida. On Jan. 6, 1998, she updated her voter registration and switched her party affiliation to Republican. Moody then moved back to Hillsborough County and registered again to vote there in 2002. She then switched her registration so that she was registered in Duval County on June 30, 2004, said Katrell McKenzie of the Duval County Supervisor of Elections Office. In June 2006, Moody switched to being registered in Hillsborough County once more. She has been registered as a Republican in Hillsborough since 2006. So Moody was a registered Democrat for five years, but for the last 20 years, she’s been a registered Republican. Asked how this qualifies Moody as a ""lifelong Democrat,"" a spokeswoman for Frank’s campaign gave an interesting response. Erin Isaac pointed out that ""the ad does not say she IS a lifelong Dem."" ""Ashley Moody WAS a lifelong Democrat. Moody first registered as a Democrat and maintained that registration continually before reregistering, by continuing to act like a liberal. So she was a lifelong Democrat before she switched and continued liberal actions,"" Isaac explained. But most viewers of the ad aren’t paying attention to the small detail of whether White decided to call Moody a ""lifelong Democrat"" in the past or present tense.  The Moody campaign website points out that Moody is not the only Republican politician to have started out by registering as a Democrat. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (who has endorsed Moody in the race) were all previously registered Democrats. (Pence, regarded as a stalwart Republican who hosted a conservative talk radio show, was a youth coordinator for his county’s Democratic Party.) Our ruling White claimed Moody ""was a lifelong Democrat."" Voter registration records show Moody did register as a Democrat in 1993, when she was 18. But she switched her party affiliation in 1998 to Republican, and has remained registered as a Republican ever since then.   We rate this claim False.

Nope, an elderly woman with an AK-47 did not rescue LAPD officers from gang members
","A nearly three-year-old fabrication touting a fictitious elderly woman as a real vigilante has recently resurfaced on fake news sites. The story goes that this 79-year-old woman looked out her kitchen window and saw two Los Angeles police officers struggling to match a local street gang’s firepower. Naturally, the woman then donned her bulletproof vest, busted out her personal AK-47 assault rifle and saved the officers by firing off 160 rounds at the gang members. That didn’t happen. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article originally appeared online in 2015 on World News Daily Report, a website with a disclaimer page saying, ""All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.""

Since then, numerous fake news websites have copy-pasted the story, presenting it as a true act of heroism. In addition to the text being fabricated, the photo caption of the officers who were supposedly saved misidentifies the officers in the photo. That picture originates from a 2010 blog about Melrose Village — a different neighborhood than the one where the incident supposedly took place. We rate this story — written as a joke nearly three years ago — Pants on Fire.","[('Police Info,\xa0Grandmother with ak-47 saves cops being attacked by street gang, Feb. 20, 2018', 'http://policenews.info/2018/02/20/grandmother-ak-47-saves-cops-attacked-street-gang/'), ('Melrose Village Blog, ""Support our local police station at Carnival Nov. 19-2,"" Nov. 8, 2010', 'No link'), ('World News Daily Report, ""Disclaimer,"" accessed Aug. 20, 2018', 'https://melrosevillage.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/support-our-local-police-station-at-carnival-nov-19-21/'), ('World News Daily Report, ""Grandma with AK-47 saves cops being attacked by street gang,"" September 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/aug/21/blog-posting/nope-elderly-woman-ak-47-did-not-rescue-lapd-offic/
