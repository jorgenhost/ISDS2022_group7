Pro-Democratic PAC says Scott Brown 'delivered for Wall Street, saving big banks $19 billion in taxes'
","Republican Scott Brown hasn’t tipped his hat about whether he’ll run for office in New Hampshire, but the buzz about Brown hasn’t died down in the Granite State. One poll conducted in January 2014 showed Brown tied in a hypothetical match-up against U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who faces re-election in the fall. Other polls have him trailing Shaheen by 10 points and 3 points, but within striking distance. Political groups have filled the airwaves with messages aimed at swaying the Senate race. Shaheen has been targeted for her support of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law. Meanwhile, Brown came under attack from a committee aimed at keeping Democrats in charge of the Senate. An ad released by Senate Majority PAC in January 2014 painted the former Massachusetts senator as a friend of big banks. ""When Scott Brown was the senator from Massachusetts, the Boston Globe reports, he delivered for Wall Street, saving big banks $19 billion in taxes,"" the ad states. The claim has been picked up elsewhere, with the New Hampshire Democratic party posting on its Buzzfeed page an item titled, ""10 things Scott Brown thinks are no biggie."" One of the items cited in the post was that ""Brown delivered a $19 billion break for his Wall Street pals."" We wondered whether it was true that Brown delivered a tax break for big banks while he was serving in the U.S. Senate. If so, how big was it? We asked Senate Majority PAC to help us evaluate the claim, but we didn’t get a response. Next, we looked to the Globe, the newspaper of record in Brown’s former home state. The Globe did indeed report that Brown ""delivered for Wall Street"" while he was in the Senate. A story published in 2012 highlighted Brown’s role in the battle over the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a bill to overhaul financial regulation that was signed in 2010. Brown withheld his support for the bill until Democrats agreed to eliminate a proposed $19 billion tax on banks, the Globe reported. Brown’s own statements from the time jibe with the Globe’s reporting; Brown opposed the $19 billion tax proposal. Furthermore, his intransigence played a part in getting the tax dropped from the final bill, according to multiple reports. But to evaluate whether Brown delivered a political favor for Wall Street -- the underlying message of the attack ad -- it’s important to consider the context of the Dodd-Frank bill, and its full impact on the financial services industry. Brown crossed party lines Dodd-Frank was crafted in response to the financial collapse that began in 2007. It was designed as a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system, intended to increase oversight and prevent the risky practices that contributed to the economic crisis. Brown was one of the only Republicans in the Senate who supported the bill. His vote was crucial to getting the legislation signed into law, delivering a victory for Obama and supporters in Congress who were pushing for regulatory changes. ""I was the deciding vote on the Dodd-Frank bill,"" Brown told PolitiFact New Hampshire. ""I was tired of banks acting like casinos with our money."" Brown was hailed for supporting the bill by then-Sen. Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, who called his actions an example of how bipartisanship is supposed to work. Obama also thanked Brown and the two other Senate Republicans who voted in favor of Dodd-Frank. During an interview this week, Brown pointed out that Shaheen and nearly every other Senate Democrat joined him in voting for passage. Brown said he faced blowback from Republicans, and is still criticized by Tea Party conservatives for supporting the bill. ""If Jeanne and the Democrats are so upset over it, then why did they vote for it?"" he said. Financial companies face fees Although Brown lobbied against one form of taxation, the bill had other ramifications for big banks. When Dodd-Frank was being hammered out in committee, lawmakers received a projection from the Congressional Budget Office that showed one version of the bill was on track to increase budget deficits by $19.7 billion over a decade. Because of federal pay-as-you-go requirements, lawmakers needed to find some way to pay for the deficit increase. Members of the conference committee sought to make up the difference by taxing certain large financial institutions to the tune of $19 billion -- a roughly equal amount. Since Brown’s support was crucial to getting the bill through the Senate, he did play a significant role in getting the $19 billion tax eliminated. Brown asked members of the conference committee to reduce federal spending instead. ""This tax will be paid by consumers who will have to pay higher fees and the small businesses that won't get the funding they need to invest and create jobs,"" Brown wrote in a June 29, 2010 letter to Dodd and then-U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. The solution that emerged used a combination of measures to offset the anticipated deficit increase. It redirected $11 billion by shutting down the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the fund established after the financial collapse to rescue banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. Much of the remainder of the money came by requiring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to charge higher deposit insurance premiums. The change applied only to banks with assets greater than $10 billion. The compromise won Brown’s support, but it didn’t sit well with some in the financial services industry. Jim Chessen, the chief economist at the American Bankers Association, called the new FDIC requirements a ""tax by another name"" in a June 30, 2010 report from American Banker. James Barth, a scholar in finance at Auburn University and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute, agreed the deposit insurance changes were essentially a new tax on banks. ""You can do it indirectly through the Deposit Insurance Fund or you can do it directly and call it a tax, but you've heard the old analogy: If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck,"" he told American Banker. The net impact Brown helped to thwart one tax increase, but Dodd-Frank still instituted other fees on the financial industry. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the higher FDIC premiums that came about through Dodd-Frank will save the government about $6 billion over 10 years by taking in more money from big banks. The bill also changed federal deposit insurance programs in ways unrelated to the compromise struck to appease Brown and other Senate Republicans. One of those changes raised deposit insurance coverage levels. It was expected to yield about $9 billion in savings -- money that would come through corresponding increases in premiums paid by depository institutions. Another fee on financial companies came through changes to the Federal Reserve. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to charge fees for the examination of large thrift and bank holding companies, a move expected to increase revenues by about $580 million over 10 years. Dodd-Frank also established several new regulatory entities. Among them were the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research. Both entities were slated to be funded for two years by transfers from the Federal Reserve, then through fees assessed on certain financial companies totalling $500 million. In all, those new fees and taxes on big banks calculate to around $16 billion. The actual amount could be far higher; in a blog post in 2011, the American Bankers Association wrote that Dodd-Frank is ""likely to result in nearly $27 billion in new private-sector fees, assessments and premiums."" Our ruling Brown might have ""delivered"" for Wall Street by opposing a specific $19 billion tax proposal that would have been part of Dodd-Frank, but his support for the law -- which proved pivotal for its passage, and which drew Brown significant flak from the financial-services industry -- still helped bring about billions worth of new taxes and fees on the financial sector, not to mention additional regulation. The claim has an element of truth, but ignores important details that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.","[('YouTube, ""#Bqhatevwr,"" Jan. 8, 2014.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UN1MIJ52Yw&feature=youtu.be'), ('Senate Majority PAC, Backup information for #Bqhatevwr, accessed Feb. 12, 2014.', 'No link'), ('Purple Strategies, Purple Poll: New Hampshire Statewide, January 2014.', 'http://www.senatemajority.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Bqhatevwr-Backup-FINAL.pdf'), ('University of New Hampshire Survey Center, Granite State Poll, Jan. 31, 2014.', 'No link'), ('Ending Spending, ""Like Your Senator,"" Dec. 16, 2013.', 'http://www.purplestrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/Jan2014NHPoll_Final.pdf'), ('FactCheck.org, ""Senate Majority PAC not telling whole story,"" Jan. 17, 2014.', 'No link'), ('The White House, ""Remarks by the president on 21st century financial regulatory reform,"" June 17, 2009.', 'http://cola.unh.edu/sites/cola.unh.edu/files/research_publications/gsp2014_winter_senate013114.pdf'), ('Congressional Budget Office, ""Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, H.R. 4173, Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010, as passed by the Senate on May 20, 2010,"" June 9, 2010.', 'No link'), ('Congressional Budget Office, ""Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, H.R. 4173, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Conference Agreement, as Reported on June 26, 2010,"" June 28, 2010.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYyMMs-WO4U'), ('Letter from U.S. Sen.

Charlie Crist flips on the Cuba embargo
","In a national TV interview on Feb. 7, 2014, former Gov. Charlie Crist announced that he supports lifting the decades-long Cuba embargo -- setting off a flurry of media attention and reaction from Republicans including Gov. Rick Scott. Scott's recently named lieutenant governor, former state legislator Carlos Lopez-Cantera, called Crist's announcement ignorant. ""Charlie Crist’s comments just show his ignorance on the issue of what is going on in Cuba,"" said Lopez-Cantera at a Feb. 10 press conference in Broward. ""As a Cuban-American, I was insulted by it. Crist, a Republican turned independent turned Democrat, is running to get his old job back from Scott. He’s also on a book tour and doing a series of national TV interviews to promote The Party’s Over: How The Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became A Democrat. On HBO’s Real Time, Bill Maher asked Crist about the Cuban vote: ""I feel like this is something that has been held hostage by a small Cuban community in Florida for a very long time,"" Maher said. ""If we had done the right thing years ago, Cuba now would be St. Barts and all the kids going on spring break would be there next month having a great time and drinking Mai Tais. But I don’t see a lot of politicians from Florida having the courage to stand up to that small Cuban community."" Crist responded: ""Well, I think they need to. I think it’s the right thing. The embargo’s been going on what, 50 years now, and I don’t think it worked. It is obvious to me we need to move forward and I think get the embargo taken away. From a selfish point of view, as a Floridian, I’d like to see that happen because a lot of construction would be required on the island, and South Florida could be the launching pad for all of that and really create a lot of jobs for the people of my state."" We decided to research Crist’s past stances on the Cuba embargo and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which doesn’t pass judgment on changing stances but evaluates if a candidate has flipped and to what extent. Some voters see some flips as a sign of inconsistency, while others view some flips as a sign that a politician has the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of constituents. Crist’s and Scott’s stance on the Cuba embargo will be a hot topic in Miami during the election, though there have been signs that the Cuban-American vote is less reliably Republican than it has been in the past. A poll released by the Atlantic Council in February showed Crist’s position is in line the majority of Floridians who want changes in the U.S.-Cuba relationship. Among Cubans polled in Florida, 79 percent favor normalizing relations (though the numbers of those of Cuban descent in Florida polled were small). Tensions between the U.S. and Cuba started after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959 leading to the full trade embargo in 1962. We’ll cite the Miami Herald’s explanation of the meaning of the embargo and the governor’s role: ""Supporters of the 52-year-old embargo have long argued it gives the United States leverage and should not be removed until democracy returns to the island. Opponents argue that with the Castro brothers still in control of the country, the communist regime has used the embargo as an excuse to continue its abusive human rights record and oppressive economic policies. Florida’s governor has no authority to lift or modify the embargo, which would take an act of Congress, but he can influence public opinion and the issue is considered a political litmus test for many hardline Castro opponents."" In 2009, Obama lifted the limit on visits by Cuban Americans to their homeland, but only Congress can rescind the embargo. Crist isn’t the only Democrat to call for dropping the embargo. U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, announced her support for ending the embargo last year. Former state sen. Nan Rich, who is running in a Democratic primary against Crist, also supports lifting the embargo. Crist’s statements about Cuba as governor In a general election debate in 2006, Crist criticized his Democratic opponent Jim Davis for visiting Cuba in 2003. ""I understand that it's important not to go to Cuba when she's under the dictatorship, but unfortunately the man I'm running against doesn't understand that,"" Crist said while campaigning in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood in October 2006. ""But I know that you do."" After Crist won the governor’s race, Crist was asked in 2006 whether he would support altering the embargo to let Floridians send more money to family. ""No. I feel very strongly about not supporting the totalitarian dictator's regime, and I understand others may have a different point of view. It just isn't mine. I believe in freedom, and I support the embargo. I've been counseled about it by Mario Diaz-Balart and Lincoln (Dias-Balart) and the senator and Ileana (Ros-Lehtinen), and I trust their judgment very much. You know, I'm the kind of guy that, you know, if there are other people who are more expert or closer to a particular issue, I think it's important to seek their counsel and rely upon it, and in this area, I do."" As a Republican governor, Crist signed a law in 2008 that required Florida-based companies selling trips to countries on the U.S. State Department’s list of nations that sponsor terrorism to put up a $250,000 bond and pay registration fees. More than a dozen travel agencies sued the state and a federal district judge ruled the law unconstitutional in 2009. In April 2010 as he struggled in a U.S. Senate Republican primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the party and ran as an independent. One month later, he told the Sun-Sentinel editorial board: ""The problem is you have this totalitarian regime that is down there that locks up journalists, suppresses freedom, doesn’t allow for open dialogue. And I think unless and until that begins to occur it is not in Florida’s or I don’t think America’s best interest to be embracing of that kind of a government."" When the Sentinel asked Crist if he would be open to fewer restrictions on travel to Cuba, Crist said: ""No, I wouldn’t. Not until they offer more freedoms to their own people first and demonstrate they are serious about it."" While campaigning in Miami Beach in June 2010, Crist reiterated his support for the embargo but said he supported Obama’s decision to allow Cuban-Americans to freely visit their relatives. ""I think the current policy in place is responsible,"" said Crist. ""I do support the embargo, and I think that what the current administration has done by allowing families to visit (Cuba) is compassionate.'' Crist running as a Democrat After the interview with Maher, Crist released a statement his campaign shared with PolitiFact Florida: ""The embargo has done nothing in more than 50 years to change the regime in Cuba. If we want to bring democracy to Cuba, we need to encourage American values and investment there, not block ourselves out and cede influence to China. It will take time, and we must do it in a way where American investment helps people, not the dictatorship. But the reality is that no state's economy is hurt more by America’s Cuba policies than Florida. Changing these policies to allow Florida’s’ farmers, manufacturers, and construction industry to sell goods and services in Cuba would boost Florida's economy and help businesses create more jobs in our state."" Our ruling While campaigning for governor, serving as governor and running for the U.S. Senate, Crist supported the embargo. Even once he left the GOP he continued to support it, though he also agreed with Obama’s decision to ease travel restrictions. But on national TV in 2014, Crist changed position and said the embargo has failed and that we should ""get the embargo taken away."" A poll released days after Crist’s announcement reflects that his new position is in line with the majority of Floridians. We rate his change of position on the embargo for Cuba a Full Flop.","[('Palm Beach Post, ""Governor candidates take swipes,"" Oct. 25, 2006', 'http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=102x2582796'), ('Palm Beach Post, ""Crist ad blitz links opponent to Castro,"" Oct. 27, 2006', 'No link'), ('AP, ""Excerpts from AP interview with Gov. elect Crist,"" Dec. 2, 2006', 'http://www.miamiherald.com/2009/08/29/1209008/cuba-trade-ban-stands-despite.html'), ('Miami Herald, ""Cuba trade ban stands despite efforts to rescind it,"" Aug. 29, 2009', 'No link'), ('Miami Herald, ""Judge rules Florida law on Cuba travel unconstitutional,"" April 14, 2009', 'http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2009/04/judge-rules-florida-law-on-cuba-travel-unconstitutional.html'), ('Sun-Sentinel, Interview with Gov.

George Will says Social Security was created in the 1930s 'as a way of getting people to quit working'
","The issue of Americans’ choices about whether to work attracted wide attention last week when the Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting that President Barack Obama’s health care law would lead to people deciding to work less. The CBO projection was spun -- largely incorrectly, in our estimation -- into claims that the health care law would kill more than 2 million jobs. But as commentators of all ideological stripes grappled with the complexities of this headline-grabbing statistic, discussion branched out into the question of whether a worker’s individual decision to work less was something positive, negative or a mixture of the two for the economy as a whole. Obama supporters suggested that the opportunity to buy health insurance outside a job was a boon to workers who hated their job or who wanted to work less so they could spend more time taking care of children or aging relatives. The president’s critics saw it as an example of the government essentially using tax dollars to encourage people not to work. This topic came up during a roundtable on the Feb. 9, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday. During the segment, syndicated columnist George Will told host Chris Wallace, ""People forget Social Security was advocated ... in the 1930s, as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country."" We’d always believed Social Security stemmed from a desire help keep the elderly out of poverty, so we decided to take a look. (Will’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) We checked with eight historians who have written about the 1930s, including several who have studied the Social Security legislation that President Franklin D. Roosevelt shepherded into law in 1935. They told us there’s little evidence that Roosevelt or his administration sold Social Security as a way to get people to quit working, thus opening up jobs for younger, unemployed workers. However, several historians pointed to a different pension proposal that was popular in the United States at the time. This proposal, known as the Townsend Plan, did make that argument, more or less -- and its popularity was strong enough that it’s credited with prodding Roosevelt into advancing the more modest, compromise proposal that would ultimately become Social Security. The Townsend Plan In 1933, during the depths of the Depression, a doctor from Long Beach, Calif., named Francis E. Townsend came up with a plan to support the elderly. Under the proposal, the government would provide a $200-a-month pension to citizens age 60 or older, funded by a 2 percent national tax on transactions. To receive the benefits, a citizen would have to be retired and not a ""habitual"" criminal. And they would need to spend all of the money within 30 days. This appears to be the source of the notion that Social Security stemmed from efforts to get older Americans to retire. The Townsend Plan ""was explicitly supposed to free up jobs, as well as stimulate the economy through spending,"" said Edwin Amenta, a University of California-Irvine sociologist who wrote the 2006 book, When Movements Matter: The Townsend Plan and the Rise of Social Security. ""It was meant to end the Depression and bring permanent prosperity."" The plan became wildly popular. ""Dr. Townsend published his plan in a local Long Beach newspaper in early 1933, and within about two years, there were 7,000 Townsend Clubs around the country with more than 2.2 million members actively working to make the Townsend Plan the nation's old-age pension system,"" according to the Social Security Administration’s historical office. Public opinion surveys in 1935 found that 56 percent of Americans favored adoption of the Townsend Plan. This is not to say that the plan made much sense economically (Townsend was not a trained economist.) More plausible projections suggested that the tax rate would have needed to be between 6 percent and 14 percent -- not 2 percent -- to cover the cost of $200-a-month pensions. And there was no guarantee that the money spent by beneficiaries would exceed the amount that would have been spent by the taxpayers from whom it was taken -- a problem if you are trying to increase the amount of overall economic activity in the economy. And those $200-a-month pensions? They were double the typical monthly pay of ordinary workers. ""It may well have been the most generous retirement pension promise of all time,"" according to the Social Security Administration’s historian. Roosevelt’s Social Security The Townsend Plan may have been economic pie in the sky -- but it had serious political influence. The strength of the grassroots movement that supported it is credited with pushing Roosevelt to fast-track an alternative. Roosevelt’s Labor secretary, Frances Perkins, wrote in her memoir The Roosevelt I Knew that the president said Congress ""can't stand the pressure of the Townsend plan unless we are studying social security, a solid plan which will give some assurance to old people of systematic assistance upon retirement."" Roosevelt’s more cautious plan was based on Americans being taxed on their earnings from work, then qualifying for old-age benefits based on how much they had paid into the system. By contrast, under Townsend’s plan, workers did not have to pay into the system, and the benefits they received were identical, regardless of how wealthy or poor they were. ""The administration contrasted its proposal with the utopian and fantastic schemes of the Townsend Plan, and there was no suggestion that these pensions would end the Depression or significantly solve unemployment problems"" of the ongoing depression, Amenta said. Indeed, Social Security was not designed to pay out benefits until 1942 -- seven years after passage. While that was eventually moved up to 1939, the delay in offering benefits undercuts the notion that the government wanted to force people to retire quickly and en masse. ""Restoring the financial condition of the elderly in a way that did not bankrupt the country was a primary motivation for the program,"" said Edward Berkowitz, a historian at George Washington University and the author of several books about the history of Social Security. ""Getting Americans to quit was only an indirect motivation."" Indeed, in its public rhetoric, the administration played up the program’s ability to help the elderly, not on its larger macroeconomic impact. That seemed to mesh with public expectations. ""The idea of creating a public pension system for the general population had been around since the 1920s or even earlier on the political left, but they faced three successive Republican presidents who were uninterested,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""So, nothing happened until there was a Democratic president with a large congressional majority backing him up."" When Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, he said, ""Today, a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled. … We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age."" Where the evidence supports Will’s claim While Will’s statement is largely unsupported, several historians said he has a partial point. Other pieces of Roosevelt’s agenda, including establishment of the National Recovery Administration from 1933 and 1935 and his reemployment agreements in 1933 ""had goals of reducing weekly hours while maintaining or increasing employment"" -- a mission not all that different from Will’s scenario, said Price Fishback, a University of Arizona economist. ""Those fears were still there in 1935."" Some scholars have also argued that the creation of Social Security actually helped crystallize the previously unfamiliar concept of ""retirement."" In an influential if somewhat controversial 1980 book, A History of Retirement: The Meaning and Function of an American Institution, 1885-1978, historian William Graebner wrote that Social Security grew out of a broader movement in industry toward the notion of retirement as a life stage, ""one of whose functions was to move older people out of the workforce, partly for reasons of job availability and partly for reasons of efficiency,"" wrote Kathleen W. Jones, a Virginia Tech historian. Graebner, she wrote, saw Social Security as a way to reduce unemployment among the young. On balance, though, scholars say it’s important not to overplay the idea that Roosevelt intended -- or ""advocated,"" to use Will’s word -- for Social Security to be a tool for transitioning the elderly out of the work force. What Will pointed to ""is part of the story, although not the whole story by any means, because the crisis of the elderly was so severe,"" said Michael Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. ""All major institutions and policies have multiple, not always consistent purposes."" Our ruling Will said, ""Social Security was advocated … in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country."" The idea that old-age pensions would transition older Americans out of the labor market and usher in younger, unemployed workers was a goal of the Townsend Plan (and of some other Roosevelt policies). But judging both by its design and by the rhetoric used to sell it, Roosevelt’s Social Security Act was targeted more at alleviating poverty among the elderly than at shaping the demographics of the labor market. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. *** EDITOR’S NOTE, Feb. 12, 2014: After we published this fact-check, a reader pointed us to an April 28, 1935, ""fireside chat"" by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that seemed to provide clearer support for George Will’s claim.  Roosevelt said, ""The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government. … It proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age."" When we showed this statement to a couple of the historians we had originally interviewed, they acknowledged that it was an unusually clear statement on Roosevelt’s part, but they added that it is an exception within the documentary record.

MSNBC's Melber: Congressional wealth climbed while median American saw no change
","If Democrats have their way, the growing gap between the wealthy and everyone else will play a major role in the 2014 elections. The trend certainly raises questions about government policies, but it also has implications for the make-up of our government itself. In an interview with retiring U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., MSNBC host Ari Melber noted the increasing affluence within the halls of Congress. ""The median net worth of American households hasn't changed much over the past decades, it's about $20,000,"" Melber said. ""But Congress' average median net worth has ballooned, more than doubled."" As Melber spoke, a chart comparing 1984 and 2009 appeared on the screen. The column showing the median household net worth was about the same in both years. But the column for members of Congress started out tall and became much taller. Melber cited a Washington Post article that brought together two sets of information. One was a detailed survey of the financial status of Americans collected by University of Michigan researchers. The other was the disclosure forms from members of Congress. In constant dollars, the net worth in Congress went from $280,000 to $725,000. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for the median American household went from $20,600 to $20,500. It’s important to note that these numbers don’t look at net worth the way most analysts use that term. The Washington Post analysis excluded the value of peoples’ homes. And home values significantly boost people’s net worths, said Richard Fry, a senior economist with the Pew Research Center. ""The total median wealth of American households, if you include the home, was not flat since 1984,"" Fry said. ""There was a big run up house prices over the 25 years."" But the Post had a reason for excluding this real estate in their analysis: Members of Congress don’t have to disclose the value of their homes. Cutting it out of the tally for regular Americans allowed the newspaper to compare apples to apples. MSNBC host Melber said if the network decides to quote somebody else’s work, they stick to what was originally reported. ""We avoid adding data to the results or findings,"" Melber said. The downside of this approach is it left MSNBC viewers with the misleading impression that Americans have far fewer assets than they actually do. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a more accurate figure today for all Americans, including home value, is a bit under $69,000. (Members of Congress would have higher net worths, too, using this calculation.) So while both numbers are higher, Melber’s point about the widening gap between the wealth of typical Americans and their elected representatives in Washington is spot on. The gap has grown because as investments, real estate and Wall Street have followed very different trajectories. To put it simply, stocks and other financial investments have shot up, while real estate has not done nearly as well. By one analysis, home prices fell 31 percent from 2005 to 2011. In the same period, the S&P 500 delivered a 13 percent return. Who tends to have more money in stocks and such? Wealthy people. And what’s the profile of our elected officials in Washington? Affluent. More than 300 members are in the millionaires club, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For John Samples, director of the Center for Representative Government at the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington, the impact on net worth over time is predictable. ""Higher net worth individuals tend to be more invested in capital markets, which have done well since 2008 and indeed, over the long term,"" Samples said. According to the Census Bureau, nearly two-thirds of households with a net worth over $500,000 owned stocks or mutual funds, compared to about 10 percent of all other households. In 2012, the median net worth in Congress was over a million dollars, putting members squarely in the high-end group. As for why Congress might have so many members with a high net worth, Sarah Bryner, an analyst with the Center for Responsive Politics, said there is no one answer. A hypothesis? It’s not easy to run for office unless you’re wealthy. ""If I work for somebody else, I can't tell that person I will need a year and a half off to run for office,"" Bryner said. ""They would laugh at you. But if I own a law firm, then I do have the flexibility to take off large chunks of time to go fundraising."" Our ruling MSNBC’s Melber said that the median net worth of Americans has barely changed since 1984 while it has skyrocketed for members of Congress. Experts confirmed that the real and growing gap between the typical American and a member of Congress is on the order described by Melber. However, when Melber said that the median net worth of American households is about $20,500, he failed to note that the figure relied on a peculiar definition of net worth that omitted the value of people's homes. That omission left viewers with a signficant misunderstanding of the real number. Because of that, we rate the claim Half True.","[('MSNBC, The Cycle, Feb. 5, 2014', 'https://on.msnbc.com/LyZ6XC'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Household wealth in the U.S.: 2000-2011', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Growing wealth widens distance between lawmakers and constituents, Dec. 26, 2011', 'https://www.census.gov/people/wealth/files/Wealth%20Highlights%202011.pdf'), ('Center for Responsive Politics, Wealth trends of members of Congress, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Detailed tables on wealth and asset ownership, 2012', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/growing-wealth-widens-distance-between-lawmakers-and-constituents/2011/12/05/gIQAR7D6IP_story.html'), ('USA Today, 57 members of Congress among wealthy 1%, Nov. 15, 2011', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, Rebuilding Household Wealth: Implications for Economic Recovery, Sept. 13, 2013', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/averages.php'), ('Congressional Research Service, An Analysis of the Distribution of Wealth Across Households, 1989-2010, July 17, 2012', 'No link'), ('Brown University, The Asset Price Meltdown and the Wealth of the Middle Class, May 2013', 'https://www.census.gov/people/wealth/data/dtables.html'), ('New York University, Annual returns on stock, T. bonds and T. bills: 1928 to present, Jan. 5, 2014', 'No link'), ('CBS News, History says home real estate is a bad investment, Feb. 1, 2012', 'https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-11-15/congress-wealthy-1/51216626/1'), ('Journal of Wealth Management, Measuring residential real estate risk and return, Winter 2011', 'No link'), ('Interview, Ari Melber, co-host, The Cycle, MSNBC', 'http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43228.pdf'), ('Interview, Richard Fry, senior economist, Pew Research Center, Feb. 7, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview, John Samples, director, Center for Representative Government, Cato Institute, Feb. 7, 2014', 'http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33433.pdf'), ('Interview Sarah Bryner, research director, Center for Responsive Politics, Feb. 7, 2014', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/data/report/report05012013.pdf')]",/factchecks/2014/feb/11/ari-melber/msnbcs-melber-congressional-wealth-climbed-while-m/

Female leadership nothing new to buffalo
","One of the Democratic candidates for Texas agriculture commissioner recently made a ranching claim that caught our eye. Hugh Fitzsimons, who’s been endorsed by lieutenant governor candidate Leticia Van de Putte, referred to her and gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis in a lighthearted (if perhaps hastily typed) way in a Jan. 19, 2014, blog post: ""I’ve learned from my bison that is it the female buffalo that lead heard. It is time for Texas to have women leading our state, and Senators Davis and Van de Putte will make sure Texas does do better."" The ag commissioner race is crowded -- 3 Democrats and 5 Republicans have filed to run -- and bison leadership has not been a prime topic. Campaign issues the candidates have raised include the state’s water supply, federal government subsidies and regulations and managing the Texas Department of Agriculture budget. But for a moment, we were curious about female leaders among the bison, commonly called buffalo. Via email, Texas Bison Association president Roy Liedtke told us, ""Yes, it is common that a bison herd have a ‘lead cow.’ This is usually an older cow and she is the leader of the herd.  As with many undomesticated animals, the bulls are with the herd during breeding season and frequently spend the rest of the time alone in a bachelor herd."" We also checked with Donald Beard, superintendent of Caprock Canyons State Park, where the state’s buffalo roam. (The Official Bison Herd of the State of Texas began with stock saved by ranchers Charles and Molly Goodnight in 1878 and was donated to the state in 1996.) By email, Beard told us, ""Hugh is correct about the females’ status in the herd. North American bison are very much a matriarchal society. In fact, the males generally stay away from the main herd and will either be solo or in ‘bachelor’ groups until the breeding season. Once the rut begins, however, the large males return to the herd and fight each other for the right to breed. You will find males dominating the females during this time."" Main herds, Beard said by phone, will consist mainly of cows, calves, yearlings and perhaps 2- or 3-year-olds, including males. In the mating season, starting around late June and extending 60 to 90 days, the big bulls return to a herd and break it up into harem groups, he said. At Yellowstone National Park, where 4,600 bison range, team leader Rick Wallen of the Bison Ecology and Management Program emailed us more detail: ""The larger groups are mixed gender with adult females being the primary leaders of those groups. ... During the breeding season (July and August), some of the older bulls will join the cow/calf groups to contribute their genes to the next generation. I would argue that the older cows tend to lead those groups around the landscape and not the older males."" Fitzsimons told us by phone that those descriptions match his experience, with males splitting off and roaming as ""satellite bulls"" most of each year. The cows keep the main herd disciplined, and when the bulls return, the females maintain some control: ""They choose the bull when it comes to mating,"" he said. Bison find calmness, social stability and safety in herds, he said. ""Not to anthropomorphize too much, but it really does make you think about the role of women."" Footnote: Females also lead herds of cattle, elk and elephants. The National Wildlife Federation -- in a Feb. 16, 2011, blog post on social organization that asked, ""Does a gorilla want a strong central government? Does a bear?"" -- listed bison, ants, African lions and sperm whales as species with female leadership roles. ""Females rule in the animal kingdom,"" the post concluded. Our ruling Fitzsimons, making a point about putting women in charge, said that female buffalo lead the herd. Bison are a matriarchal society, though female bison don’t lead the entire population. Adult males split off on their own until each mating season, when they come back to carve up the main herd for a couple months. We’ll rate Fitzsimons’ statement as Mostly True.

Mayor working to keep more Tech grads
","Before Snowjam turned into a verbal snowball fight between Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and some news outlets, Reed planned to spend most of his time Jan. 31 with the Atlanta Press Club talking about his initiatives for 2014. Reed did address some goals for the year, such as keeping more young, smart people in the city. One statistic the mayor cited about the percentage of Georgia Tech students who stay after graduation piqued our curiosity. ""Right now, we only keep 50 percent of Georgia Tech’s graduates,"" Reed said. Is this correct? Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the mayor, said Reed based his comments on information from the 128-year-old college located in Midtown Atlanta. Campos specified that the mayor was referring to the percentage of Tech graduates who remain not just in Atlanta, but the entire state of Georgia. College graduates, statistics show, typically earn higher salaries, so elected officials want to keep them around. Reed told the audience he’s planning an effort to raise upward of $150 million to fund high-tech startup firms in the city. The mayor said those companies are needed to keep more college grads in Atlanta and away from Silicon Valley. Reed said he’s working with local business leaders on the retainment effort and set a long-term goal of keeping at least 75 percent of Tech graduates here. Reed is not the first person to raise concerns about a brain drain. Some Michigan educators and elected officials talked about the need to keep more college graduates in that state. A first-of-its-kind survey of all 2007 Michigan public university graduates, conducted by Michigan Future Inc., revealed that half of grads left the state within a year, The Detroit News reported. The percentage of Michigan State University graduates who left the state doubled between 2001 and 2009, from 24 percent to 49 percent, the newspaper reported, citing statistics from the school. Nationally, there’s little research on the topic. A 2007-08 federal survey found 69 percent of college graduates were living in the state where they earned their degree one year after graduation. Georgia Tech spokeswoman Laura Diamond gave us some data from surveys done in 2012 and 2013 about its graduates. Over those two years, 52 percent of Tech undergraduates remained in the state. The total increases to 55 percent once you include those who attended graduate school. The 2012 survey polled 2,619 students who were scheduled to graduate with bachelor’s or master’s degrees that year with questions about employment prospects and future plans. About 55 percent of the students completed the entire survey. Georgia Tech has about 21,500 undergraduate and graduate students. The report contains job placement rates and salary offers in 34 majors for bachelor’s students. Seventy percent of those graduates found jobs, and the median salary was just above $63,000 and a median bonus of $5,000. For graduate students, the job placement rate was nearly 72 percent, and the median salary was $78,000 with a median bonus of $10,000. Reed said in his remarks to the Atlanta Press Club that one-half of Georgia Tech graduates stay in Georgia. He based his statement on data from Georgia Tech. The school’s surveys are pretty close to the mayor’s statement. There’s not much data out there on this subject. Georgia Tech’s surveys showed the percentage of graduates who stayed in the state were slightly higher than what the mayor said at the luncheon. Still, Reed appears to be on the right track with his comments, based on the limited information available.

CNN's Van Jones says Keystone pipeline only creates 35 permanent jobs
","The debate over whether President Barack Obama should approve the Keystone XL pipeline often turns to jobs, but should it? Liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones says the pipeline is not the jobs creator supporters talk it up to be. ""Every time we have a show, somebody says something ... about Keystone, and somehow Keystone is going to create all these jobs,"" Jones said in the Feb. 3 episode of Crossfire. ""Then it turns out, look at the actual numbers. It turns out the actual numbers are 3,900 temporary jobs in the construction sector and 35 permanent jobs."" Ralph Reed, a conservative activist who founded the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Jones’ claim is unfair because a long-anticipated report by the U.S. State Department says the project will create 42,000 jobs. Reed went on to say the report cleared the main argument against the project, that it’s bad for the environment. We are fact-checking claims from each pundit about the project. Here, we’ll focus on Jones’ claim about the project creating ""35 permanent jobs."" The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch 875 miles from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines and usher up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Because TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project ""serves the national interest."" Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued a recommendation to Obama based on the study. Obama is under political pressure from all sides, with environmentalists and Democrats like Jones on one side who want him to shut it down and Republicans and some Democrats supportive of organized labor on the other who say it would strengthen the country’s energy independence and, yes, create jobs. When the State Department released its 11-volume report about the pipeline’s impact Jan. 31, 2014, the big headline in most news coverage centered on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution. Some see that as giving Obama an opening for approval. With that backstory out of the way, let’s crack open the chapter on jobs. There’s plenty of debate over how many jobs the project would create during construction. The State Department report puts the total at 42,100 jobs, though the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year. Much of the construction work would come in four- or or eight-month stretches. About 10,400 seasonal workers would be recruited for construction, the State Department said. When looked at as ""an average annual job,"" it works out to about 3,900 jobs over one year of construction or 1,950 jobs each year for two years. The rest of the jobs would be the result of spillover spending (formally called indirect or induced economic activity) as Keystone workers buy equipment and materials to complete the project and spend their money on an array of services, including food, health care, and arts and entertainment. As you might expect, it’s much harder to measure the widespread effect on job creation. There’s no doubting that most of the economic activity comes during construction. Jones honed in on jobs after construction, which aren’t really a source of sharp debate. ""There’s very few jobs operating pipelines,"" said Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Ltd., an energy and economic consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif. ""That’s one of the reasons why pipelines are attractive to the oil industry. They’re relatively inexpensive to build and operate."" The report says the project would provide jobs for about 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors. The full-timers would be ""required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair."" Some would work in Canada. The U.S. employees would work at pump stations along the pipeline route as well as a Nebraska office. The project’s impact on housing, property taxes and service industries once in operation? Not much. Not much is known about the contractors’ workload except they would provide additional specialized support. Still, arguments about the relatively small number of permanent jobs from the pipeline often belie the nature of construction jobs, which are comprised of temporary projects by definition, said Matt Dempsey, a spokesman for a coalition of pro-Keystone groups known as Oil Sands Fact Check. ""You build it, you move on,"" Dempsey said. Our ruling Jones said the Keystone pipeline will only result in 35 permanent jobs after construction. The numbers, as reported by the State Department, back him up, though that’s the nature of any big construction project, be it a highway or monument. Jones’ claim is True.","[('CNN.com, Crossfire transcript, Feb. 3, 2014', 'http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1402/03/cfr.01.html'), ('Interview with Van Jones and his assistant Colin Holtz, Feb. 4, 2014', 'No link'), ('The New York Times, ""Report opens way for approval of Keystone pipeline,"" Jan. 31, 2014', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/us/politics/report-may-ease-way-to-approval-of-keystone-pipeline.html?_r=0'), ('U.S. Department of State, ""Final Supplemental Environmental Impact statement for Keystone XL pipeline,"" January 2014 (chapter on socioeconomic impact)', 'No link'), ('Interview with Sean Sweeney, director of the Global Labor Institute at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Feb. 6, 2014', 'http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221135.pdf'), ('Interview with Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Limited, Feb. 7, 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview with Matt Dempsey, Oil Sands Fact Check spokesman, Feb. 10, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/31/barack-obama/obama-says-keystone-xl-would-mean-maybe-2000-jobs/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Obama says Keystone XL would mean ‘maybe 2,000 jobs,’"" July 31, 2013', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""President Obama’s low-ball estimate for Keystone XL jobs,"" July 20, 2013', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/president-obamas-low-ball-estimate-for-keystone-xl-jobs/2013/07/29/ce886b1e-f897-11e2-afc1-c850c6ee5af8_blog.html'), ('PolitiFact Georgia, ""Isakson: Keystone pipeline to employ 20,000,"" April 11, 2012', 'No link'), ('Sierra Club, Keystone XL 101, 2013', 'https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/apr/11/johnny-isakson/isakson-keystone-pipeline-employ-20000/'), ('Cornell Global Labor Institute, ""Pipe Dreams?

John Cornyn voted against leadership's immigration plan at committee level and on Senate floor in 2013
","A Republican primary challenger to John Cornyn said in an email blast Jan. 31, 2014, that the senior senator for Texas is teaming with Barack Obama, the Democratic president, to ""ram amnesty down your throat."" U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood went on to say that no GOP leader is working harder for amnesty than Cornyn. More: ""Last year Cornyn helped pass Obama’s amnesty bill in the Senate."" We decided to check the to-the-point claim in the banner topping Stockman’s email: ""John Cornyn voted twice in 2013 to back Obama’s amnesty plan."" He did? We zeroed in on Cornyn’s votes, also exploring Obama’s connection to the plan. The legislation, which has yet to gain traction in the House, isn’t universally considered an amnesty scheme in part because it’s not as forgiving of immigrants lacking legal residency as the overhaul signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.  In April 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated as Half True a claim that the legislation drafted by the Gang of 8 --four Senate Democrats and four Republicans intent on building a bipartisan coalition--was not an amnesty plan. The legislation did not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants while it mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods, making it tougher than its 1986 predecessor. However, the proposal did afford a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. Our email to Stockman’s spokesman, Donny Ferguson, about Cornyn’s votes elicited no response. Cornyn’s campaign spokesman, Drew Brandewie, emailed us instances of Cornyn voting against the measure. Among substantive votes, Brandewie said, Cornyn voted against the measure when it cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by 13-5 in May 2013, as noted in a news blog post by the Dallas Morning News on June 5, 2013, which also said that backers of the plan ""had fended off many amendments"" that Cornyn ""authored or supported, including some to beef up enforcement or strip the path to citizenship for 11 million people"" already estimated to be ""in the country illegally."" Cornyn’s ""no"" vote in committee, on May 21, 2013, wasn’t his last. On June 27, 2013, the Senate sent the House an immigration proposal ""that would allow millions of illegal immigrants the chance to live legally in the United States and to eventually become U.S. citizens,"" the Washington Post said in a news story posted that day. The legislation, which did not draw widespread House support, also called for doubling the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the story said, and required the construction of 700 miles of fencing there. In addition, employers would newly be required to check the legal status of all job applicants using the government’s E-Verify system, the Post reported. Senators voted 68-32 for the plan with 14 Republicans joining Democrats on the ""aye"" side, the Post said. But Cornyn and fellow Texas Sen. Ted Cruz voted against final approval, the Dallas Morning News said in a news blog post the day of the vote, after voting earlier that day against bringing the proposal to a final vote. ""The votes were no surprise,"" the News said. ""Both openly opposed the bill."" Stockman’s email blast condemning Cornyn singles out two other votes as indicative of Cornyn helping to advance Obama’s plan. Stockman wrote: ""Cornyn voted with Democrats twice to kill our Republican filibuster of amnesty,"" adding that he was referring to two Senate votes that preceded days of floor debate. And what were those votes? On June 11, 2013, Cornyn was among 82 senators and more than 25 Republicans (though not Cruz), who voted for cloture, a hurdle that had to be cleared before the body could consider starting floor action on the legislation. That afternoon, Cornyn was among 84 senators to vote to proceed to debating the legislation. Brandewie guided us to a news blog post by the Houston Chronicle on that day, which said that although Republican leaders in the Senate ""said they could not support the bill as written, they voted to move the legislation forward and allow lawmakers to change it through amendments."" The blog post quoted Cornyn as saying that he voted to launch floor debate so he could offer a tighter border security amendment. ""The bottom line is that if border and national security cannot be guaranteed in this bill, I cannot and will not support it,"" Cornyn said. Separately that day, Obama gave the measure his wholehearted endorsement, according to a New York Times news story posted online that afternoon, describing it as consistent with principles he had aired. ""Nobody got everything they wanted,"" Obama said, according to the Post story. ""Not Democrats. Not Republicans. Not me. But the Senate bill is consistent with the key principles for common-sense reform that I — and many others — have repeatedly laid out."" We found no sign of Obama presenting an immigration proposal. That’s correct, Marc Rosenblum, an analyst for the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, told us by phone, though he also said the Senate plan largely aligned with a ""blueprint"" for reform issued by Obama in May 2011 that outlined his desired changes in law. The blueprint called for focused border security and holding employers accountable for hiring legal residents while also creating a way for farmers to hire foreigners to raise and harvest crops. In the document, Obama also said he favored giving law-abiding U.S. residents lacking legal residency, including children, ways to become eligible for citizenship. So, Cornyn voted against endorsing the immigration plan in committee, in favor of starting the Senate floor debate and against the legislation advancing to the House. Of course, there were other votes related to the legislation during floor action. Starting from Cornyn’s posted list of Senate floor votes, we peeked at the details of a dozen of his votes between the beginning of the floor action and final approval. Summing up, it looked to us like after agreeing to let debate proceed, Cornyn consistently voted on the side of Republicans opposed to the Senate plan. Ready to dig in? In a roll call vote on June 13, 2013, Cornyn was on the losing end of a 57-43 vote that set aside revisions offered by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that were described in a CNN news story that evening as intended to delay the legalization process for millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. until the Department of Homeland Security could certify it had effective control over the Southern border for six months. On June 18, 2013, Cornyn was on the losing end of several Republican efforts to change the legislation. In an initial floor vote, he and 38 fellow senators voted in favor of a failed move by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.,  to prevent the government from granting illegal immigrants legal status until at least 350 miles of double-tier fencing had been erected on the southern border, withholding full citizenship rights until 700 total miles had been built, according to a Washington Times news story posted online that day. Cornyn also voted for an unsuccessful attempt to stop any illegal immigrant from being granted legal status including citizenship until the government had put in place a biometric check-in and check-out system at every land, sea and airport entry point. Also that day, 94 senators unanimously voted to include tribal government officials on a border oversight task force. It seems reasonable to clump this vote with some others that were less contested as the immigration proposal edged forward: On June 19, 2013, Cornyn was among 72 senators who agreed to provide for limiting salaries for contractor executives and employees involved in border security and he also voted with most to include a Nevada resident on the Southern Border Security Commission. A day later, Cornyn was again on the losing end of Senate votes--including when he voted against setting aside a proposal by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., giving Congress, and not the Department of Homeland Security, ultimate authority to determine if the border is effectively secure, according to a National Review news blog post, which said Paul also sought enhanced security measures, such as requiring a double-layer fence to be completed within five years, plus other triggers to implemented before illegal immigrants could be awarded legal status, the magazine said. Similarly that day, Cornyn voted for a failed amendment described by authoring Sen Mike Lee, R-Utah, as giving the Senate a future say on whether the borders were secure before allowing immigrants to start the pathway to citizenship, according to a news story in The Hill, a Capitol Hill publication. Cornyn took a personal lump on June 20, 2013, as senators voted 54-43 to table his proposed revamp, which he pitched as reasonably beefing up border security, just before the Senate moved instead to a more ambitious border build-up approach. A news blog post by the Dallas Morning News in the wake of that action described Cornyn as steamed, going on to note that while Cornyn’s amendment called for 5,000 additional Border Patrol officers, the substitute proposal favored by Senate leaders called for 20,000 additional officers. ""How much is it going to cost?"" the News quoted Cornyn as saying of the successful amendment. From that moment through the Senate decision a week later to advance the immigration plan to the House, Cornyn was on the losing end of seven floor votes, including several related to considering and then accepting the alternative border security language. It looked to us like none of these votes could be interpreted as aligning Cornyn with the Senate’s Democratic majority or Obama. Summing up, Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute told us that he sees Stockman’s claim as a distortion. ""On a fundamental level, it’s a misleading statement. It’s not Obama and it’s not amnesty,"" Rosenblum said, ""but there were those two votes,"" he said, referring to Cornyn’s votes to let floor debate proceed. Our ruling Stockman said Cornyn voted twice in 2013 for Obama’s amnesty plan. That’s inaccurate to a ridiculous degree. For starters, Obama never offered an amnesty plan, though he endorsed the Senate-approved legislation, which envisioned ways that unauthorized immigrants could attain citizenship. This was also the plan that Cornyn consistently voted against; the two ""aye"" votes singled out by Stockman were procedural, relating to whether floor debate commenced and not to the legislation's merits. Given that Stockman’s claim misrepresented both the immigration measure and Cornyn’s votes, it merits flames. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

"['Abortion', 'Sexuality', 'Texas', 'Cecile Richards']","
U.S. and Canada lead industrialized, developed regions of world in rate of unintended pregnancy
","Asked about differences among Americans on abortion rights, Cecile Richards suggested this country leads in a dubious way. Texas Monthly editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein asked Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America whose mother, Ann, served as governor of Texas: ""It’s often said that abortion is an issue on which there’s no room for compromise; there are two sides that fundamentally disagree, and there’s just no coming together. Do you think that’s true?"" Richards replied: ""Where we see enormous common ground—maybe not among politicians but among people—is that folks want women to have access to birth control; they want young people to have access to sex education that helps them prevent becoming pregnant before they are ready to be parents. ""Frankly,"" Richards continued, ""it’s an outrage that the U.S. has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country. So that, I think, is where there is enormous common ground, and we’ve demonstrated that when women have access to family planning services and can choose the family planning that works for them, we can reduce teen pregnancy, we can reduce unintended pregnancy, and we can reduce the abortion rate."" Silverstein told us the bulk of the interview took place Dec. 6, 2013, with excerpts debuting in the magazine’s February 2014 edition and online. So, does the U.S. have the highest rate of unintended pregnancies among Western industrialized countries? A word: The United Nations says online that it has no established convention for identifying ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries or areas, but in common practice, Japan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Europe are considered developed regions or areas. Guttmacher Institute research By email, Justine Sessions, a Planned Parenthood aide, offered as the basis of Richards’ claim a December 2013 ""fact sheet"" from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. It states: ""The U.S. unintended pregnancy rate is significantly higher than the rate in many other developed countries."" According to the sheet, 51-plus percent of U.S. pregnancies in 2008--or 3.4 million of 6.6 million--were unintended, which the sheet defines as mistimed (31 percent) or unwanted (20 percent). That percentage was reached by institute researchers Lawrence Finer and Mia Zolna based on U.S. government data and the institute’s Abortion Patient Survey, according to a Dec. 19, 2013, Guttmacher press release. ""Although many unintended pregnancies are accepted or even welcomed,"" the release said, ""40% end in abortion."" The rate of unintended pregnancies — that is, factoring in population —  is another statistic, and it’s the one Richards referred to. According to the Guttmacher fact sheet, there were 54 unintended U.S. pregnancies in 2008 for every 1,000 women aged 15-44. ""In other words,"" the sheet says, ""about 5% of reproductive-age women have an unintended pregnancy each year."" The sheet’s reference to unintended pregnancies in the U.S. and other developed countries was footnoted to a December 2010 research article, published in the journal Studies in Family Planning, on global levels of unintended pregnancy as analyzed by Susheela Singh, Guttmacher’s vice president for research, and two colleagues. But that article, emailed to us by Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind, didn’t break down unintended pregnancy rates country by country. This lack of detail made us wonder how the researchers concluded that the U.S. rate significantly exceeds the rates in other Western industrialized  nations. Charting unintended pregnancy rates by region Instead, the article presented a chart comparing the prevalence of unintended pregnancies by regions of the world, which the researchers said they estimated using nationally representative and small-scale surveys of 80 countries. ""Of the 208 million pregnancies that occurred in 2008, we estimate that 41 percent were unintended,"" the authors wrote. That was up from 38 percent from an estimate in 1995. Unintended pregnancies were defined as ""being comprised of unplanned births, induced abortions and miscarriages."" The researches concluded that 48 percent of the 7.2 million pregnancies in 2008 in North America, in this analysis meaning only Canada and the United States, were unintended. As noted, the authors separately said 51 percent of the U.S. pregnancies that year were unintended. Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest unintended pregnancy rate in the report, at 58 percent. But both areas are not developed and industrialized, at least per the U.N.’s characterizations. Other world regions saw fewer occurrences of unintended pregnancy: Europe (44 percent), Africa (39 percent) and Asia (38 percent). By email, Wind said there are no Western industrialized countries in most of the regions with more unintended pregnancies than the U.S., with the exception of Eastern Europe. She noted, too, that the U.S. rate of unintended pregnancy in 2008 was 54 per 1,000 women aged 15-44, ""well above"" the 48 per 1,000 in Eastern Europe. Given that Richards spoke of the rate of unintended pregnancies, here is the 2010 study’s breakdown of such rates by region: North America (48 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44); Latin America and the Caribbean (72); Europe (38); Asia, not including Japan (49); and Africa (86). Country by country data almost non-existent Guttmacher researcher Gilda Sedgh, asked about unintended pregnancy rates for individual developed countries, told us by email: ""Data on unintended pregnancy rates in developed countries are not systematically collected."" Referring to the institute’s latest number-crunching, Sedgh added that researchers have preliminarily estimated that in Europe in 2012, there were 43 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44, while in North America there were 51 per 1,000. In the end, we did not identify on-point sources of information on unintended pregnancy rates in specific countries. Wind, the institute spokeswoman, said the absence of country-specific data in the published study doesn’t mean that such data always isn’t available. ""Some developed countries publish unplanned birth data, some publish abortion data, and some publish both,"" Wind emailed. ""Because not all countries publish those data, we do our analysis at the regional level. What is true is that there are no published country-specific data that directly address that claim. However, based on our research, we are confident that the US unintended pregnancy rate is higher than that of most other developed countries."" At Wind’s suggestion, we reached out to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, which  oversees the National Survey of Family Growth. By email, an unidentified spokesperson pointed us to a July 24, 2012, research article published in National Health Statistics Reports. The article, drawing on interviews of 12,279 U.S. women aged 15-44, estimated that 37 percent of domestic births occur due to unintended pregnancies; the researchers did not develop an independent estimate of the prevalence of unintended pregnancies or make comparisons to other countries, though it referenced Guttmacher research in stating that about half of U.S. pregnancies are unintended. Separately, James Trussel, a Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs who co-authored a January 2008 Contraception editorial on reducing unintended pregnancies, told us by email that statistics ""do not exist for most countries. Even in the"" United Kingdom, ""we have estimates only for Edinburgh. That said, the percentage of pregnancies that is unintended is very high in the U.S. (and probably the highest in any Western industrialized society)."" Our ruling Richards said the U.S. ""has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country."" She did not offer nor did we find a breakdown of unintended pregnancy rates for individual Western industrialized nations, evidently because none exist. This gap leaves us with the Guttmacher institute’s conclusion that in 2008, Canada and the U.S., combined, had more unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44 than every region except Asia (not including Japan), Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. None of these regions with higher rates are commonly considered developed and industrialized. We rate Richards’ claim, which lacked this clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Gillespie says Warner voted for new taxes and more debt
","Republican Ed Gillespie kicked off his campaign for the U.S. Senate by denouncing Democratic incumbent Mark Warner as a spendthrift. ""Sen. Warner promised us fiscal responsibility, but he’s voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt."" Gillespie said in a video last month.   We wondered whether Gillespie was right. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said his boss’s claim stems from Warner’s support of a Democratic budget plan that squeaked through the Senate last March on a 50-49 vote. The plan -- authored by by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash. -- called for $975 billion in new revenues over 10 years to be matched by an equal amount of budget cuts. The new revenues would come from targeting tax breaks used by high earners and corporations. That accounts for the ""nearly $1 trillion in new taxes,"" that Gillespie cited. What about the $7 trillion in new debt? Logan said that also came from Murray’s bill. The legislation contained estimates that it would expand total debt from $17.1 trillion in fiscal 2013 to $24.4 trillion in fiscal 2023. That comes to a $7.3 trillion increase. Total U.S debt is the sum of two major calculations: 1) The amount of ""intergovernmental holdings"", or money the government owes itself to support beneficiary programs such as Social Security; and 2) The amount of ""public debt"" in Treasury securities that are held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve and state, local and foreign governments. Economists generally prefer to discuss the national debt in terms of the amount that is publicly held. Murray’s bill would have lifted that portion from $12.2 trillion in 2013 tor $18.2 trillion in 2023 -- a $6 trillion increase. Now, let’s turn to Warner, who’s made budget reform his signature issue since entering the Senate in 2009. He’s tried to establish a bipartisan coalition of senators who share his views that the nation’s financial problems can be solved only through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. He’s criticized Republicans who refuse to increase taxes and Democrats who refuse to rein in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Warner cast four major votes on budget plans last year: Our ruling Gillespie says Warner ""voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt."" Although some economists might quibble with his debt figure, we don’t. We rate his statement True.","[('Ed Gillespie, ""Meet Ed,"" on YouTube, Jan. 16, 2014.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDkAjSIlYFk'), ('Gillespie, ""Release: Ed Gillespie Announces Campaign for United States Senate in Virginia,"" Jan. 16, 2014.', 'No link'), ('Emails from Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie, Jan. 20 and 22, 2014.', 'http://edforsenate.com/release-ed-gillespie-announces-campaign-for-united-states-senate-in-virginia/'), ('POLITICO, ""Patty Murray budget: $1 trillion in new revenue,"" March 12, 2013.', 'No link'), ('POLITICO, ""Patty Murray plan doesn’t balance budget,"" March 13, 2013.', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/patty-murray-budget-1-trillion-in-new-revenue-88736.html'), ('Congress.gov, THOMAS, S.Con.Res.8, Murray budget plan, accessed Jan. 21, 2014.', 'No link'), ('U.S. Senate, Roll Call list vote #45, March 21, 2013.', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/murray-budget-cuts-spending-but-not-to-ryan-levels-88828.html'), ('U.S. Senate, Roll Call list vote #92, March 23, 2013.', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Senate Passes $3.7 Trillion Budget, Setting Up Contentious Negotiations,"" March 23, 2013.', 'http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-concurrent-resolution/8/all-actions/?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S.Con.Res.8%22%5D%7D'), ('Congressional Budget Office, ""Updated Budget Projections: Fiscal Years 2013-2023,"" May 2013.', 'No link'), ('CNN, ""Congress avoids shutdown, bickers over 2014 budget,"" March 22, 2013.', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00045'), ('Real Clear Politics, ""Key Budget Duel Question: How Big a Problem is the Debt?""

"['Georgia', 'Legal Issues', 'Hugh Thompson']","
Access to legal help an issue, justice says
","In his first State of the Judiciary address, Chief Justice Hugh P. Thompson declared that all Georgians need access to justice, regardless of their economic backgrounds. And in many cases, he said, that means they need the services of a lawyer. Yet in Georgia, Thompson said, that's not as easy as it might seem. He cited statistics showing: Too few lawyers? What about the so-called ""lawyer glut?"" In the interest of truth (and justice), we decided to do some checking. Jane Hansen, spokeswoman for the Georgia Supreme Court, said the chief justice's comments were based, in part, on a report by the State Bar of Georgia titled ""Lawyer Distribution in Georgia."" The report showed the state with 28,883 active lawyers in 2011, including 20,027 or 69.3 percent, working in Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties in metro Atlanta. The State Bar research revealed that there are no lawyers in six rural counties - Baker, Chattahoochee, Clay, Echols, Glasscock and Webster. In three of those counties, Baker, Clay and Echols, at least 30 percent of residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census data. Follow-up research in August 2013 showed the number of lawyers in the state had grown to 29,973. But none of them had established a practice in those six lawyerless counties, said Michael L. Monahan, an attorney and pro bono director for the State Bar. The findings came directly from the State Bar’s membership data, Monahan said. In Georgia, membership in the State Bar is mandatory for all lawyers. In his address to a joint session of the state Senate and House of Representatives, Thompson recalled the promise of ""liberty and justice for all"" in the Pledge of Allegiance. ""I don’t believe we ever meant ‘liberty and justice only for those who can afford it,’ "" he said. ""... As Georgia continues to grow in population and diversity, access to justice is a challenge requiring the commitment and hard work of us all."" Thompson told lawmakers that many attorneys and two groups -- the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation and the State Bar of Georgia -- have stepped up to offer their services at no cost to the poor. ""But these voluntary efforts do not fill the gap,"" he said. Thompson cited a report from the Supreme Court’s Committee on Civil Justice in 2008 that showed only 9 percent of low-income Georgians with a legal need were able to get help from a lawyer. He also pointed out that two nonprofit law firms, the Georgia Legal Services Program and the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, provide civil legal services to the poor. But both firms have been hard hit financially since the start of the recession in 2007, Thompson said. Phyllis Holmen, the executive director of Georgia Legal Services, said her budget is back up slightly this year but had been cut $2 million since 2008. That meant that the agency had to freeze positions and lay off staff, including 23 of the 75 lawyers who work in 154 counties, Holmen said. Judges, Thompson said, have been reporting that more people are coming into court trying to represent themselves. That creates fairness issues, particularly in family law cases where the opposing party has an attorney, Holmen said. Monahan said the State Bar is looking to address a difficult problem. ""The fix is not going to be easy,"" he said. ""The market decides where people work."" Thompson said other states are also experiencing a void of lawyers outside their major cities. In South Dakota, where 65 percent of attorneys practice in five cities, the chief justice has warned that the large populated areas of his state are becoming ""islands of justice in a rural sea of justice denied,"" Thompson said. ""Georgia’s lack of legal services in rural areas is every bit as severe as South Dakota’s, if not more so,"" he told lawmakers. ""We must take steps to correct the imbalance."" So where does this leave us? Thompson said, ""Six of Georgia’s counties have no lawyers at all."" Credible data from the State Bar of Georgia and other information, including anecdotal evidence from local judges, support his statement. We rate it True.","[('Emails with Jane Hansen, spokeswoman, Georgia Supreme Court, starting Feb. 3, 2014.', 'https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.georgiaadvocates.org%2Flibrary%2Fattachment.191040&ei=yarzUpW3DcrokAfv0oCYDw&usg=AFQjCNGyot2InFxmuDG327_wOr3CiNlYKw&sig2=Kj8V2aA0JVp8p2SMtmw_pA'), ('State Bar of Georgia, ""Lawyer Distribution Report in Georgia"" 2011.', 'No link'), ('Phone and email interviews with Michael L.

","Relations between Russia and the United States have been decidedly frosty recently, and the international spirit of the Olympics doesn’t seem to have delivered much of a thaw. Or at least, that is one way to read the roster of the official delegation to the games in Sochi. Former Homeland Security director Janet Napolitano leads the group named by the White House. CNN’s Candy Crowley reminded Napolitano of how administrations have handled this before. ""I'm sure it's been noted to you, that it's been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics,"" Crowley said on CNN’s State of the Union. ""Can you tell me as a practitioner of both policy and politics why Sochi is different for the U.S.?"" Napolitano denied that any snub of Russian President Vladimir Putin was intended. Obama, she said, had sent a group that ""represented the broad values of the United States."" The Obama administration has made it clear that acceptance of gays and lesbians ranks prominently among those values. When the White House announced the delegation list, a spokesperson said it ""represented the diversity that is the United States."" The list included the gay tennis star, Billie Jean King. Russia’s anti-gay bias has become a sticking point between the two nations. The president himself said his schedule doesn’t allow him to attend. The meaning behind the make-up of the delegation is a matter for diplomats and students of international relations. In this fact-check, we will look at whether the tradition that Crowley suggested actually has been in place since 2000. As this table shows, the record speaks for itself. Year City Who went 1998 Nagano, Japan Tipper Gore 2000 Sydney, Australia Chelsea Clinton 2002 Salt Lake City, Utah George W. Bush 2004 Athens, Greece George H.W. Bush, Barbara Bush 2006 Turin, Italy Laura Bush 2008 Beijing, China George W. Bush 2010 Vancouver, Canada Joe Biden, Jill Biden 2012 London, England Michelle Obama   While it’s uncommon for an American president to attend, the White House has reliably extended the personal touch. Crowley’s statement includes the important catch-all category of family member to make her claim accurate. As far back as 1998, the then-wife of Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore, represented the White House at the Winter games in Nagano, Japan. For the 2000 Summer games in Sydney, Australia, President Bill Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, took time off from college to watch the competition. In 2004, it was the president’s father and mother, former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, who made the family connection in Athens, Greece. George W. Bush stands out for having personally attended twice. The first time, the games took place on American soil in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the leader of the host country pretty much always attends. But Bush also made the trip to Beijing in 2008 where he memorably bumped a volleyball to a bikini clad member of the U.S. beach volleyball team.  Our ruling Crowley said ""a president or a vice president or a member of their family"" has attended every Olympic games since 2000. That is accurate. In fact, the tradition goes back 16 years to 1998. We rate Crowley’s claim True.","[('CNN, State of the Union, Feb. 9,2014', 'https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/president-obama-explains-why-he-didn-t-attend-the-sochi-olympics-015916217.html'), ('Yahoo Sports, President Obama explains to Bob Costas why he didn’t attend the Sochi Olympics, Feb. 7, 2014', 'No link'), ('USA Today, Obama sends message by naming Sochi Olympic delegation, Dec. 20, 2014', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/sochi/2013/12/17/white-house-sochi-olympics-delegation-to-include-gay-athlete/4051581/'), ('White House, President Obama Announces Presidential Delegations to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2014 Olympic Winter Games, Dec. 17, 2013', 'No link'), ('Politico, For U.S. Sochi delegation: Diversity, not diplomacy, Dec. 17, 2013', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/12/17/president-obama-announces-presidential-delegations-opening-and-closing-c'), ('Olympic Games, List of past Olympics', 'No link'), ('White House, Tipper Gore in Nagano, Japan, at end of games', 'http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/billie-jean-king-united-states-delegation-sochi-2014-winter-olympics-101253.html'), ('CNN, It’s offiicial: Mrs Obama is going to the Olympics, June 22, 2012', 'No link'), ('White House, Vice President Biden, Dr. Jill Biden to Lead U.S. Delegation to Opening Weekend of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, Feb. 2, 2010', 'https://www.olympic.org/olympic-games'), ('CNN, Past presidential Olympic delegations: photo gallery, Dec. 17, 2013', 'No link'), ('White House, Mrs. Bush to lead presidential delegation to Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, Jan. 30, 2006', 'http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/VP_Wife/trips/column5.html'), ('UPI, Bush names delegation to Athens Olympics, July 15, 2004', 'No link'), ('Sports Illustrated, Olympics open with celebration of American heros, Feb. 9, 2002', 'http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/22/mrs-obama-is-going-to-the-olympics-and-taking-some-medal-winners-with-her/'), ('AP Archives, Australia: Sydney Olympics: Chelsea Clinton arrival, Sept. 14, 2000', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/vice-president-biden-dr-jill-biden-lead-us-delegation-opening-weekend-vancouver-201')]",/factchecks/2014/feb/09/candy-crowley/cnns-candy-crowley-says-its-unusual-president-or-t/

Keith Ellison says Americans work 'way more' than others
","A recent Congressional Budget Office report is the latest spark in the Affordable Care Act debate. Conservatives on ABC’s This Week roundtable criticized President Barack Obama’s signature health care law for its predicted effect on the economy. As we’ve previously noted, the nonpartisan report shows that health care reform may reduce the total number of hours worked by 1.5 to 2 percent from 2017 to 2024 -- the equivalent of about 2 million jobs. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., pushed back against the Obamacare critics, arguing that a little less time in the office might not be such a bad thing. ""We're going to have parents being able to come home, working reasonable hours. People are going to be able to retire,"" he said. ""People might be able to actually cook dinner rather than have to order out and get some takeout. I mean, the fact is, is that if Americans can have more choices to open up a new business they've been wanting to start, this is a good thing. You know, if you look at international comparisons country by country, Americans work way more than an average of industrialized countries around the world."" PolitiFact wondered how other developed nations stack up to the United States in terms of hours worked. We fact-checked a similar claim from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., back in 2011 and rated it False, but Ellison’s take is more nuanced. Ellison’s spokesman pointed us to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. They track the average annual number of hours worked for 34 countries, which include many of the most developed nations as well as developing economies. Experts confirmed OECD is a good resource for this information. This report, last updated in November 2013, shows by country the average number of hours an employee works per year. Across all OECD countries (except for Israel, which they didn’t provide data for), the average number of hours an employee works per year is 1,715. The United States does come in above that mean, at 1,790 hours worked per year. That’s 10th among OECD countries. It’s a far cry from No. 1 Mexico at 2,226 hours or No. 2 South Korea at 2,163. On the other end of the spectrum, the Netherlands recorded just 1,384 hours annually. The U.S. average of 1,790 hours is 75 hours higher than the OECD average. That translates to about 1.5 hours more per week. So Ellison’s claim that we work ""way more"" is misleading, considering that’s just 4.4 percent more time spent at work, on average. Our ruling Ellison said that an average U.S. employee works ""way more than the average industrialized countries around the world."" The data shows that U.S. workers spend about 1,790 hours per year on the clock, which is above an average of developed countries at 1,715 hours. So he’s right that Americans work a lot, but we’ll dock Ellison a notch on our Truth-O-Meter for exaggerating the difference. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('Center for Economic and Policy Research, ""No-vacation nation revisited,"" May 2013', 'http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/no-vacation-update-2013-05.pdf'), ('Email interview with Bill Lastrapes, University of Georgia economics professor, Feb. 9, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email and phone interviews with Michael Casca, Rep.

"['Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Alberta Darling']","
Did Wisconsin Democrats flip flop on pre-existing conditions because they voted against a GOP bill?
","Broadly speaking, Democrats generally support Obamacare and its guarantee that people with pre-existing medical conditions can’t be denied health insurance coverage, or be charged more because of their conditions. Meanwhile, many Republicans have tried to overturn the federal law, known as the Affordable Care Act — a move that would eliminate that guarantee. So, is it true that in Wisconsin  — during a tumultuous lame-duck session of the state Legislature that has drawn national attention — Democrats turned their backs on protecting people with pre-existing protections? On Dec. 5, 2018, as part of the lame-duck session that Democrats called a Republican power grab, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a GOP bill on pre-existing conditions. Then state Sen. Alberta Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, issued a news release with a headline that made this attack: ""Democrats flip flop on pre-existing conditions."" Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. ""Democrats had a chance to turn their campaign ads into law. Instead, they turned their backs on Wisconsin voters and proved they were only worried about getting elected,"" the release said. All Democrats in the state Senate (along with two Republicans) did, in fact, vote against the Republican bill, which failed to pass. But to call that a flip-flop (or hypocrisy, as GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said, making a similar attack) is oversimplified and misleading. Darling told us in an interview that her flip-flop claim is based on what Democrats had said ahead of the November 2018 elections. She said they campaigned by saying that Wisconsin needed to take action to protect people with pre-existing conditions in the event that Obamacare is eliminated. Darling argued that Democrats flip flopped on their campaigning because the Senate Democrats voted against the GOP pre-existing conditions bill. But not voting for a particular bill, one proposed by the opposing party, doesn’t constitute a flip flop. 1. The GOP bill would have required health insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions. But it would not have provided the same protections that Obamacare does. Democratic senators said they voted against the bill because it would have allowed insurers to impose lifetime caps on coverage. They also noted that premiums in the so-called individual market, where people buy health insurance on their own, likely would skyrocket. The bill ""would have been a step backwards, not a step forward,"" said state Sen. Jon Erpenbach, a Madison-area Democrat. 2. Democrats supported an an amendment to the GOP that they said would provide more protections than the GOP for people with pre-existing conditions. 3. On the same day the Republican bill was approved, the GOP majority in the Senate also approved a bill to sustain the GOP efforts to overturn Obamacare. That measure would hamper Gov.-elect Tony Evers and incoming Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats, from withdrawing the state from a federal lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act. GOP Gov. Scott Walker signed the legislation into law. As part of that lawsuit, Wisconsin and other states sought a preliminary injunction suspending the Affordable Care Act or, at a minimum, striking down the parts of the law that prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions or charging them higher rates. So, Democrats pointed out that while some Wisconsin Republicans were supporting a pre-existing conditions bill, others, including GOP Gov. Scott Walker, were pushing the lawsuit to strike down Obamacare and its more comprehensive pre-existing conditions protections. (Acting on that lawsuit on Dec. 14, 2018, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. No immediate effect was expected, however, and the case likely is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.) As a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis observed: Q. Would the state law have protected people with pre-existing conditions? A. Not in the long term — or, in all likelihood, even in the short term.
If the Affordable Care Act was struck down and the state required health insurers to cover people with pre-existing health conditions and not charge them higher rates, health plans sold directly to families and individuals would be even more costly than they are now.
That's what happened in New York, which required insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions before the Affordable Care Act. It also is what happened in other states that had a similar requirement and eventually were forced to abandon it. Darling declared: ""Democrats flip flop on pre-existing conditions,"" referring to all Democrats in the state Senate voting against a Republican bill on pre-existing medical conditions. Democrats pointed out that the bill would not have provided the same protections to people with pre-existing conditions as Obamacare does, and to the likelihood that some health insurance premiums would skyrocket. Meanwhile, they did vote for an amendment to the GOP bill, pushing more protections for pre-existing conditions, but that failed. Moreover, on the same day the GOP bill came up for a vote, Darling and her fellow Senate Republicans voted for a separate bill that would sustain GOP efforts to overturn Obamacare -- and with it, the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. In short, Democrats’ votes against what they considered to be an inferior bill is not a flip flop on protecting people with pre-existing conditions. We rate Darling’s statement False.","[('Sen.

"['Elections', 'Virginia', 'Mark Herring']","
Mark Herring hasn't flipped on vow to quit as a.g. if he runs for governor
","A top Republican legislator was ready to pounce after Attorney General Mark Herring, a  Democrat, informally said on Dec. 7 that he plans to run for governor in 2021. ""If he is a man of his word, Mark Herring’s resignation will be on Governor (Ralph) Northam’s desk by the end of the year,"" House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in news release four days later. For nearly three decades, it was customary for Virginia attorneys general to resign when they ran for governor. The tradition was broken in 2013 by Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican who lost the gubernatorial  election that year to Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Cuccinelli was criticized by many Democrats and editorial writers for remaining attorney general throughout the campaign. Herring was on the Democratic ticket in 2013, making his first of two successful runs for attorney general. Gilbert says Herring made a ""pledge"" then to resign as the state’s chief lawyer should he run for governor. Gilbert points to the following paragraph in a Sept. 30, 2013 article in The Virginian-Pilot: ""In line with his pledge to take politics out of the office, Herring has said he would resign as attorney general if he decided to run for governor. Cuccinelli has weathered criticism for staying in office as he campaigns for governor, bucking a pattern set by several of his predecessors."" Gilbert said, ""If Herring is serious about his announced plan to run for governor, he must immediately make good on his pledge to resign his office."" Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Herring, said the attorney general ""will not be resigning anytime soon."" Is this tantamount to Herring reversing his position on resigning, as Gilbert says? We put the matter to the Flip-O-Meter, which gauges whether politicians have been consistent on issues. Timing is pivotal Election Day for the next governor in Nov. 2, 2021 - almost three years ahead. Nine attorneys general have resigned to run for governor over the last seven decades, and they all waited to the election year to step down. Here are their names, political party, and the month and year they left their posts: There’s no precedent for an attorney general seeking a promotion in state government to resign three years before the next gubernatorial election - as Gilbert demands - or even one year out. It’s a stretch to assume that Herring implied groundbreaking action when he promised that he, too, would step down. Kelly, Herring’s spokesperson, dismisses Gilbert’s statement as ""manufactured outrage."" Kelly noted the Pilot's article ran about a month before the 2013 general election and, at that time, Cuccinelli stayed as attorney general despite ""campaigning full time for governor for many, many months."" Kelly added that ""Herring has told folks what he intends to do in a few in a few years, but ain’t exactly ‘running a campaign’ at the moment, so the situations are very different."" Our ruling In 2013, Herring said he would resign as attorney general if he decided to run for governor. Now that he has acknowledged his intention to run for governor in 2021, Gilbert is calling on Herring to honor his pledge and immediately step down as attorney general. Herring will not. We don’t find this hypocritical. The next gubernatorial election is almost three years away. The nine attorneys general who have resigned to run for governor since 1957 all waited to the election year to do so. There’s no reason to believe that Herring, who did not specify when he would resign, was promising anything different. Herring ""has told folks what he intends to do in a few years,"" his spokesman says. Herring has been consistent.

"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Bill Daley']","
What’s missing from Daley’s property tax freeze pledge
","Bill Daley, the son of one former Chicago mayor and brother of another, is running for mayor in his own right with a pledge in his first TV campaign ad that suggests he’s following the family playbook. In the ad, a narrator promises: ""Bill will put a moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes"" as the words ""PROPERTY TAX FREEZE"" appear on the screen. Daley’s mayoral kin, Richard J. and Richard M., often made similar sounding claims in unveiling annual city budgets. Outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel has sometimes done the same. But what the Daley ad fails to make clear is that he is only promising to freeze a portion of the various property tax levies that make up a typical bill, not the whole thing. First, it’s important to understand how property tax bills break down. In Chicago, there are levies that fund city government and separate levies that fund schools, parks, Cook County government, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and a handful of other public agencies. Last year, only about 25 percent of a typical Chicago property tax bill covered city government, according to the Cook County Clerk’s office. So holding the line on the city’s levy, as Daley proposes in his ad, might slow the growth of tax bills for property owners in the city but it wouldn’t contain them. By contrast, school taxes comprised more than half of Chicago tax bills in 2017. If elected mayor, Bill Daley would gain the power to appoint the Board of Education and top schools officials and effectively control the city’s education apparatus. The same goes for the Chicago Park District, whose levy made up about 5 percent of the typical bill in 2017. We asked Daley spokesman Peter Cunningham whether the candidate’s freeze pledge extended to those sister city agencies under a mayor’s thumb. Cunningham, in an email, said it did not, though he stressed Daley ""will very aggressively push other taxing bodies to be efficient and to look for alternatives including new state funding — especially for schools."" Cunningham served as a spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools when Daley’s brother, Richard M. Daley, was mayor. Property tax levies at CPS have annually risen even when city government holds the line. That isn’t to say it would be politically or fiscally prudent to freeze the schools’ portion of the property tax. The district faces chronic financial woes, and often finds it hard to make ends meet even after raising its annual property tax levy to the amount allowed under state law. It does suggest, however, that Daley’s ad skates around critical nuance of how property tax bills in Chicago are calculated. Proposals like Daley’s also leave out the other big question raised by the possibility of a property tax freeze: how else to come up with revenue to cover spiraling projected costs, particularly for pensions. Past mayors have managed to keep property taxes flat by employing a number of fiscal sleights of hand, including underfunding pensions. What was once a much smaller problem for the city’s bottom line has ""snowballed"" over the years, said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago, forcing the city to make much more significant increases in order to catch up. Kass said this practice has also led Chicago residents to expect the current level of services the city provides without an increase in property taxes. ""Residents weren’t feeling the full cost of services because the pensions were being underfunded,"" she said. Richard M. Daley also staved off property tax increases by spending proceeds from a controversial $1 billion long-term lease of the city’s parking meters to private investors. The tradeoff in signing away decades of meter revenue was said to be the ability to invest and grow the lease proceeds for future city needs. By late 2010, his last full year in office, Richard Daley had spent almost all of the proceeds. Bill Daley’s TV ad promises he would, as mayor, ""put a moratorium on tax hikes to keep families in their homes."" That claim is misleading. A spokesman for his campaign told us his freeze would apply only to taxes that directly fund city government. The promise does not extend to property taxes levied for schools, parks and other sister city agencies the mayor effectively controls though they comprise well over half of a typical bill. So Daley is promising to freeze the city’s direct property tax levy — but not all of the city-level property taxes Chicago homeowners pay. We rate Daley’s statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['New York', 'Carl Heastie']","
Heastie says legislators' compensation hasn't kept pace
","Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie recently appeared before a panel of current and former comptrollers to make the case his colleagues deserve more pay. The panel eventually  recommended substantial raises for New York State’s 213 state legislators. During the public hearing in Manhattan, Heastie told the New York State Compensation Committee about several economic indicators, saying that as costs have risen, legislators’ pay has not. ""Under any objective measure, our static compensation has failed to keep pace with economic realities,"" he said. The consumer price index has risen, as well as the costs of health care, child care, and housing, while the base salary for legislators has remained at $79,500 for the last 20 years, Heastie said. ""During this same period, the state median household income has risen by 67 percent,"" Heastie said.    Has lawmakers’ compensation failed to keep pace with ""economic realities?"" We reached out to an economist at the Brookings Institution to ask about the best way to evaluate Heastie’s argument that lawmakers’ salaries have lagged as expenses increased. Economist and Senior Fellow Gary Burtless pointed us to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which offers a tool that calculates how inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, affects the buying power of a certain salary.   Here’s what the calculator shows: It now takes a $121,954 yearly salary to have the same buying power that the legislators’ base $79,500 salary provided in January 1999, the last time a raise for legislators took effect. Burtless said the advantage of using the index when measuring whether wages have kept pace with expenses is that it accounts for all of the goods and services an average American consumes. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also pointed us to the index in evaluating Heastie’s claim. Burtless, of the Brookings Institution, agreed with Heastie that the rise in the median household income ""provides additional, helpful information, quite apart from the cost of living."" Heastie’s spokeswoman provided data from U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey and the Annual Social and Economic Supplement for evidence that the median household income in New York has risen as legislators’ base salary has remained the same.   The data show that in New York, the median household income was $62,447 in 2017, and it was $37,394 in 1998, the last time a raise was approved. The increase between 1998 and 2017 is indeed 67 percent. But there are other forms of compensation legislators receive in addition to their base salary. Legislators can also take home extra pay for various leadership positions, such as committee chairmanships. This extra pay ranges from $9,000 to $41,500 per year, depending on the job. In general, they can also collect mileage and a per diem rate of $59 for a day trip or $174 for an overnight stay while they are in Albany, which is set by the U.S. General Services Administration and increases over time. They can also participate in New York’s Empire Plan, a health insurance policy offered to state and some local government employees, or they can participate in a variety of health maintenance organizations, according to information provided by the state Department of Civil Service. ""The Empire Plan's combination of managed care features and reasonable copayments keep benefits rich and costs down,"" according to the state. For those in the legislators’ pay group, the state pays 84 percent of the premium for enrollees, and 69 percent for eligible dependents. This is consistent with national trends, according to a 2018 employer health benefits survey of private and non-federal public employers from Kaiser Family Foundation. The survey showed that ""on average, covered workers contribute 18% of the premium for single coverage and 29% of the premium for family coverage."" The employee share of premiums in the legislators’ pay group for the Empire Plan is $1,490.58 for individuals and $5,831.54 for family coverage. Kaiser found that ""the average annual dollar amounts contributed by covered workers for 2018 are $1,186 for single coverage and $5,547 for family coverage, similar to the amounts last year."" State lawmakers can also have dental and vision coverage, retiree health insurance, defined benefit or defined contribution retirement plans, according to Ken Girardin, a policy analyst with Empire Center for Public Policy, a nonprofit think tank that studies government spending. Girardin noted that the New York State Compensation Committee, in its Dec. 10 report, did not include an analysis of the entire compensation package lawmakers receive. The recommendation The compensation committee recommended incremental pay increases for legislators, reaching $130,000 in 2021. The recommendation stands unless lawmakers take action to stop it before the end of the year, which appears unlikely. The four-member panel -- former State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, and former City Comptroller Bill Thompson -- were charged with making recommendations ""with respect to adequate levels of compensation, non-salary benefits, and allowances"" for legislators, statewide elected officials, and certain executive branch commissioners and department heads."" During a public hearing on Nov. 13, the committee said it would consider job performance of state officials, ""overall economic climate,"" inflation rates, changes in public sector spending, pay for comparable positions elsewhere, whether the state can attract talented people given private-sector pay rates, and whether the state can afford to pay these positions more. The last raise for lawmakers came in 1998 and took effect in 1999. Two years ago, when a pay raise for legislators was under discussion, PolitiFact found Heastie’s claim that the purchasing power of legislators’ base salary was actually only $53,000, when inflation is taken into account, to be Mostly True. To support his case that state lawmakers deserve a pay raise, Heastie said that ""under any objective measure,"" lawmakers’ compensation had not kept up with their expenses. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census show how inflation has far outpaced legislators’ static salaries and how other New Yorkers’ have enjoyed growth in their household incomes over the last 20 years. However, a complete look at legislators’ compensation package would include their per diem income, which increases over time, and their health care and retirement benefits. We rate Heastie’s claim Mostly True.    ","[('""New York State Lawmakers Set to Receive First Pay Raise in Two Decades,"" Wall Street Journal, Dec. 6, 2018.

Did tourism in West Virginia increase faster than U.S. as a whole?
","Has West Virginia’s tourism industry been going gangbusters recently? Gov. Jim Justice suggested that it had. Justice wrote in a tweet, ""WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million. This is a landmark day for our tourism industry and our economy as a whole!"" WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million. This is a landmark day for our tourism industry and our economy as a whole! #WV pic.twitter.com/jjyWXYgJ15 In a follow-up  tweet, Justice cited a Sept. 9 press release from his office that offered figures from 2012 to 2017 to support his claim. We decided to zero in on the first part of his assertion -- that ""WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017."" Is that correct? Let’s start with the percentage comparison. According to a West Virginia Press report published in the Herald-Dispatch, the data comes from the 2017 West Virginia Travel Impacts study undertaken by the firm Dean Runyan Associates. The study was prepared on behalf of the state tourism office. The study supports the specific figures Justice cited in his tweet. In the nation as a whole, the report said, spending by resident and foreign visitors increased by 3.0 percent over 2016. In West Virginia, by contrast, total travel spending increased by 3.9 percent. If you do the math, 3.9 percent is 30 percent higher than 3.0 percent. That said, it’s worth noting a few additional bits of context. First, a chunk of these increases stem from inflation. Nationally, the inflation rate was 2.2 percent in 2017. This wouldn’t affect the comparison of West Virginia to the nation as a whole -- both increases were boosted by inflation -- but it does make the 3.9 percent increase in West Virginia less impressive. Second, Justice chose to highlight the most favorable data in the report. He chose not to highlight the fact that, according to the report, local tax revenue from tourism fell by 2.7 percent over the same period, while state tax revenue fell by 1.2 percent. How about Justice’s assertion that ""this increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million""? The report shows that tourism fell by $695 million from 2012 to 2016, a four-year period. Justice’s office did not respond to the data critiques we sent them. Justice said, ""WV's tourism industry grew at a rate 30% above the national rate in 2017. This increase reversed a four-year decline in which travel-generated spending fell more than $600 million."" He’s right about the comparison of West Virginia and the nation as a whole, and he’s also correct about the decline from 2012 to 2016. However, he engaged in a bit of cherry-picking of the data and glossed over the role of inflation in the state’s tourism spending increase. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Jim Justice, tweet, Sept. 19, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/WVGovernor/status/1042484811544383488'), ('Dean Runyan Associates, ""West Virginia Travel Impacts,"" September 2018', 'No link'), ('Beckley Register-Herald, ""WV tourism growth above national rate,"" Sept. 19, 2018', 'http://www.deanrunyan.com/doc_library/WVImp.pdf'), ('Office of the Governor, ""Gov.

Before he was president, did Donald Trump say a government shutdown shows a president is weak?
","President Donald Trump said he would own a government shutdown if he does not get the money he wants for a border wall. Now, a widely shared post is making the rounds on social media and shows a picture of Trump with the following quote, attributed to 2013: ""A shutdown falls on the President’s lack of leadership. He can’t even control his own party and get people together in a room. A shutdown means the president is weak."" Did Trump really say that? The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This was supposedly said during the 2013 government shutdown during the Obama administration. We couldn’t find that exact quote from Trump, in a tweet or otherwise, but we did track down several comments he made at the time of a 2013 government shutdown that supported the idea of blaming the president. The alleged quote started to gain attention earlier this year, when the government shut down from Jan. 20 to Jan. 22, 2018. That shutdown was due to disagreement over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Trump was critical of President Barack Obama during the October 2013 shutdown, which lasted 17 days. It happened after a budget standoff over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. But what did Trump actually say back in 2013? We couldn’t find a match for the quote attributed to Trump, but we did pinpoint similar comments. In a September 2013 Fox & Friends phone interview, Trump blasted Obama for failing to ""get everybody in a room."" ""If you say who gets fired, it always has to be the top. Problems start from the top, and they have to get solved from the top, and the president’s the leader, and he’s got to get everybody in a room, and he’s got to lead. And he doesn’t do that, he doesn’t like doing that, that’s not his strength."" Trump also said that further down in history ""when they talk about the government shutdown, they’re going to be talking about the president of the United States, who the president was at that time. They’re not going to be talking about who was the head of the House, the head the Senate, who’s running things in Washington. So I really think the pressure is on the president."" In an Oct. 7, 2013, interview with then-Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, Trump criticized Obama for not being a dealmaker during the shutdown. ""You have to get everybody in a room. You have to be a leader. The president has to lead. He has to get (the Speaker of the House) and everybody else in a room, and they have to make a deal. You have to be nice and be angry and be wild and cajole and do all sorts of things, but you have to get a deal. ""And, unfortunately, he has never been a dealmaker. That wasn't his expertise before he went into politics and it's obviously not his expertise now. But you have to get the people in a room and you have to get a deal."" A few days later, Trump appeared on CNN for an interview with Piers Morgan, repeating that the shutdown meant Obama ""is not leading and not getting people into a room."" Trump also took to Twitter before, during and after the shutdown to voice his opinion, agreeing with users that it would never happen if he were president and that Obama had ""failed to lead."" FACT – the reason why Americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because Obama refuses to pass a budget. Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible. Obama has not passed a single budget in 4 years. Democrats don’t even vote them in Congress. He has failed to lead! ""@jj10471 @realDonaldTrump if you were in office this would of never happen #trump2016"" True! A Facebook post claims Trump said a government shutdown ""falls on the president’s lack of leadership"" and means the ""president is weak"" in 2013. We couldn’t find an instance when Trump said those exact words all together, but he did repeat similar statements on social media and in interviews at the time, saying ""the pressure is on the president"" during a shutdown and that the president ""has to get everybody in a room and be a leader."" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Website falsely claims United Nations 'caught helping and coaching' migrants
","The United Nations has not been ""caught helping and coaching"" caravans of migrants who want to come to the United States. That’s a misleading claim circulating on a phony website. ""United Nations caught helping and coaching caravan illegal aliens!"" said the headline of a Nov. 22 post on usanetwork.info. The website’s banner USA Network and its internet address — usanetwork.info — seemingly attempts to masquerade as the TV channel USA Network. The internet address for the actual USA Network is usanetwork.com. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post’s headline and story suggest that the United Nations has been exposed or outed for efforts to move the caravan along and into the United States. That’s not true. The United Nations has provided assistance for migrants, and none of that has happened in a covert manner. The Mexican government in October asked for the United Nations’ help to respond to the migrants’ needs and immigration requests. The UN’s refugee agency, in line with its humanitarian mission, sent staff to Mexico to help authorities register asylum seekers, to help shelter migrants, and to set up ""identification and referral mechanisms for those with specific vulnerabilities and needs."" The United Nations has also said it’s providing legal advice and counseling to people in the caravans. The organization considers it essential that migrants have a chance to request asylum and that their international protection needs are properly assessed before authorities send them back to their country of origin. The USA Network post doesn’t describe it that way. ""The United Nations was simply found in a compromising position helping the parade travel to the fringe,"" said the usanetwork.info post. ""What’s more, now, UN authorities are training the unlawful vagrants on the best way to round out their refuge printed material!"" The post falsely claims that the United Nations paid for transportation to speed up the caravan’s movement in Mexico and toward the United States’ southern border. (The United Nations declined a request from migrants for buses.) The website also argues in favor of cuts to financial assistance the United States provides the United Nations. ""The GOP is truly going to remunerate the UN with a huge number of American taxdol.lars! (sic) You should stop them!"" the post said. ""It would be ideal if you send your moment and ur.gent (sic) letter to Congress at this moment and FORCE them to safeguard Trump’s slices to the United Nations and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act to cut whatever remains of the subsidizing!"" A post on usanetwork.info says, ""United Nations caught helping and coaching caravan illegal aliens!"" The United Nations has not been ""caught helping and coaching"" migrants in caravans wanting to come to the United States.

Did the migrant caravan demand $50,000 for each member?
","It’s true that members of migrant caravans seeking entry into the United States have requested that the United States let them into the country or pay them $50,000 each. ""Migrants DEMAND $50,000 each to go home, or else…,"" said the Dec. 12 headline of an opinion post on thefederalistpapers.org. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Thefederalistpapers.org quotes a Fox News report, which in turn cites the San Diego Union-Tribune. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that on Dec. 11 two groups of Central American migrants separately marched to the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, ""demanding that they be processed through the asylum system more quickly and in greater numbers, that deportations be halted and that President Trump either let them into the country or pay them $50,000 each to go home."" The newspaper said that the group with the request for payment or admission amounted to about 100 people. Another group of about 50 people asked that the United States speed up and increase the processing of asylum seekers. Both groups had a letter with them and reported to have been received by U.S. consulate staff, but they were unaware of each others' demands, the San Diego Union-Tribune said. The consulate on Dec. 11 posted on its website an alert about a march expected that day at the consulate. PolitiFact reached out to the consulate to confirm details about the letter but did not get a response. The letter regarding the $50,000 request was addressed to Trump and extends a greeting on behalf of all caravan members, and expresses grievances in Honduras. ""If you needed any more proof that the migrant caravans at our Southern border are NOT what they appear to be, now these invaders are making a new demand,"" said the post on thefederalistpapers.org. ""Now these ‘migrants’ are saying ‘give us $50,000 each to return home, or else we’ll bust down your border’."" Steve Straub, the website’s director, told PolitiFact that its website is one of opinion, not a news site, that its story was clearly labeled ""opinion,"" and that it did not claim that all migrants are demanding $50,000. ""We take pride in the fact that the content of our articles is fact based and we only use mainstream or other legitimate sources as the basis for our story,"" Straub said. At some point, some estimates said there were as many as 8,000 people in caravans from Central America walking to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek entry into the United States. About 6,000 arrived in Tijuana in November, but the number of people still seeking to be let into the United States is believed to be much lower. Hundreds have gone back to their countries, hundreds more have being deported by Mexican authorities, and many more have applied for permission to stay in Mexico, according to news reports. A headline on thefederalistpapers.org says, ""Migrants DEMAND $50,000 each to go home, or else…"" A group of about 100 migrants went to the U.S. consulate in Tijuana requesting to be let into the United States or be paid $50,000 each, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. The letter is addressed to Trump and offers a greeting on behalf all caravan members. Another group that had a separate letter for the consulate about asylum processing said it was unaware of the other group’s demands.

In controversial Wisconsin lame-duck session, will Scott Walker OK measures he's vetoed?
","Now that he’s a lame duck himself, Republican Gov. Scott Walker supports taking major actions during a lame-duck session of the Wisconsin Legislature — a Full Flop from the position he took when he was first elected in 2010. As he enters his final weeks in office, the two-term governor has signaled that he generally supports bills adopted by the GOP-controlled Legislature that would weaken the powers of Gov.-elect Tony Evers, who defeated Walker in the November 2018 election, and incoming Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats. There are also measures that would limit early voting, put lawmakers in charge of litigation aimed at overturning the federal Affordable Care Act and give Republicans more control over the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the state jobs agency. The Legislature’s lame-duck bills and Walker’s change in position have made national news. They’ve also drawn threats of legal action by liberals and criticism from prominent Republicans calling the move a ""power grab"" and urging Walker not to sign the bills. On Dec. 9, 2018, four days after the measures won approval from the Legislature during an overnight session, Evers appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" He repeated his call for Walker to veto the lame-duck bills, saying: ""The entire thing is a mess, it’s a hot mess, and I believe that he should veto the entire package. In fact, at least three or four of the pieces that are in there now, he has vetoed previously. And so, it makes no sense to me."" Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.

The Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, a nonpartisan state agency, identified four provisions in the lame-duck legislation that are similar to four measures Walker vetoed in September 2017 in the 2017-’19 state budget. That information was requested from the bureau by the office of state Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha. Barca’s office then produced a memo on the similarities. That memo was cited to us by Evers’ spokeswoman as evidence to back Evers’ claim. We also reviewed a memo on the lame-duck legislation by the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, another nonpartisan state agency. What we found is that the lame-duck legislation does contain some provisions that are the same -- or similar to -- provisions Walker previously vetoed. But those provisions aren’t the ones in the lame-duck legislation that have caused the big headlines. Here’s a look: Walker 2017 veto 2018 GOP lame-duck legislation Effect Veto allowed transfer of funds by Department of Transportation between state highway programs  — without legislative oversight. Legislation would repeal altogether DOT's authority to
transfer state funds between state highway program components. Less flexibility for Evers’ administration than Walker’s administration. Veto deleted requirement that Department of Administration do annual report on state’s ""self-funded portal"" for consolidating accounting, budget and other services. Would require the annual report. Imposes requirement on Evers administration that Walker administration did not want to do. Veto deleted requirement that the Department of Veterans Affairs receive approval from Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee before transferring money for state veterans homes to veterans trust fund. Would require  department to notify the committee of any transfers. Walker vetoed the measure because it would have ""encroached"" on the executive branch’s responsibility to manage state agency programs. The requirement is more of a burden on Evers, given that the Joint Finance Committee is majority Republican. Veto deleted requirement that Department of Health Services submit report to Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee on Walker initiative to require childless adults to work or get work training in order to receive Medicaid. Veto also eliminated  requirement that the Joint Finance Committee give approval before the work/work training requirement could be implemented. Legislation would codify into law the work and work training requirement. Without codifying the initiative into law, Evers administration could have made adjustments to the program; with new legislation, Evers administration would need approval from Joint Finance Committee or full Legislature. Evers said, ""At least three or four of the pieces that are in"" in the Republican lame-duck legislation, Walker ""has vetoed previously."" There are four provisions in the lame-duck bills that Walker has vetoed previously and that would put new requirements or restrictions on the incoming Evers administration. But those provisions aren’t the major ones in the lame-duck session that have generated so much controversy and threats of lawsuits. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.","[('YouTube, Tony Evers ""Meet the Press"" interview (2:35), Dec. 9, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddkHUYSYFAk'), ('Email, Tony Evers spokeswoman Carrie Lynch, Dec. 10, 2018', 'No link'), ('Rep.

"['Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Missouri', 'Roy Blunt']","
Roy Blunt is right: The military pay increase is the largest in years
","Part of being a politician requires helping decide how much money to set aside to sustain and provide for members of the U.S. military. This process, which is reviewed annually, is lengthy and often quite partisan. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sent out a tweet praising the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019. He said it ""includes the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years and provides our service members with the resources, equipment and training they need."" We wanted to take a closer look and see if service members were getting everything that Blunt asserted that they would. The goal of the act, as stated in its introduction, was to restore readiness and increase capability and capacity in a force that has been asked to do too much with too little for too long. The bill, approved in August, proposed a military budget $639.1 billion with funds divided into areas including: $17.7 billion to rehabilitate and replace worn out Army equipment. $23.5 billion to sustain, repair and rebuild crumbling military buildings and other infrastructure. $36.3 billion to ""restore America’s strength at sea."" $40.8 billion ""to overcome the crisis in military aviation by getting more aircraft in the air."" $69 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations. Overseas Contingency Operations are defined as a separate pot of funding that is set aside and operated by the Department of Defense and the State Department. They are sometimes referred to as ""war funds."" The other large component of the act was to provide a 2.6 percent pay raise for those currently serving. This also extended special pay and bonuses for those in high demand fields. To compare the pay raise that service members could receive in 2019 to the ones they have received in the past decade, we reached out to Blunt’s team. It sent us records of the annual pay adjustments for those who have served dating back to 2007. Fiscal year of 2010 was the last time a pay raise greater than 2.6 percent was awarded. From 2011 to 2016, the pay raise remained under 2 percent. Mark Cancian, a Center for Strategic and International Studies senior advisor on the International Security Program, shared records of military and civilian pay increases, including estimates up to 2023. The information was published by the Department of Defense’s Comptroller in Table 5-12 of National Defense Budget Estimates for fiscal year 2019. Experts we reached out to agreed that the first part of Blunt’s statement rang true. Although last year’s pay raise is just shy of 2.6 percent, the last pay raise higher that was higher was offered nine years ago. Todd Harrison, the strategic center’s director of defense budget analysis, said that is is fair to say that the bill fully authorizes the level of total funding that the Department of Defense requested. Blunt said that members of the military would receive their highest pay raise in nearly 10 years thanks to legislation signed in August. Military compensation records and experts in defense analysis and government spending fields verified that this was correct. We rate this statement True.","[('Sen.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Women', 'Christine Lagarde']","
If women worked as much as men, would US GDP jump 5 percent?
","Most economist agree that hefty tax cuts and more government spending have –– at least in the short run –– boosted America’s economy. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said policy makers have another lever they could pull. Women, she said, are a phenomenal source of growth. ""In the United States, if there was equal participation of women in the labor market, GDP would be up by 5 percent,"" Lagarde said on CBS’ Face the Nation Dec. 9. We wondered, how solid is the method behind the 5 percent prediction? Adding millions of people to the workforce would give the economy a shot in the arm. The formula behind the 5 percent is simplistic. Key factors, such as how quickly the change happened, would lead to very different economic results in the near term. We asked the IMF for Lagarde’s supporting data and didn’t hear back. But a 2012 article from Booz, an accounting and consulting firm now owned by Price Waterhouse Cooper, made the case, and many groups have cited it ever since. ""Our own estimates indicate that raising female employment to male levels could have a direct impact on GDP of 5 percent in the United States,"" the authors wrote. How did they get there? The Booz article, sponsored by a women’s advocacy fund, said that GDP per person is the result of productivity, the number of hours worked, the fraction of people of working age in the population as a whole, and the fraction of people actually working. Simple math dictates that if you increase the last variable, you get a higher GDP per person. The analysis factored in a couple of adjustments that brought the result down for large numbers of women getting into the job market. New workers would have less experience and be less productive. And given the demands of caring for children, many women, the authors said, would choose to work part-time. But even with those analytic haircuts, the results were still impressively positive. Government surveys tell us that the fraction of American women in the workforce is 57 percent. For men, the number is 69.1 percent. Today, about 75 million women are either working or looking for work. To bring that up to the labor participation rate of men, there would need to be 91 million, or an additional 16 million women ready and able to work. The fraction of women in the workforce grew rapidly for decades, but in the past 20 years, it has largely leveled out. Development economists told us that broadly speaking, the report makes the valid point that adding a lot of women to the workforce would boost the economy. Beyond that, the results are dodgy. ""It is essentially a back-of-the-envelope calculation, used by others to arrive quickly at numbers for advocacy's sake,"" Elizabeth King, an economist and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. ""Would I put my bet on the numbers?  Not likely."" King said the study’s formula is static and failed to look at important ripple effects, such as whether men might change their own labor habits if their wives entered the job market. The formula didn’t account for how wages might fall with so many new workers. Betsey Stevenson, associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said the article skips over how long it would take for the economic impact to play out. ""The 5 percent number is saying this is what GDP will be once they are all working compared to now, but is silent on how long it will take, precisely because that's almost impossible to predict,"" Stevenson said. Stevenson observed that the participation rate for women has barely changed since 1990. One likely constraint is the limited options for affordable child care, she said. Even if the country moved to fix that, there would be a lag. ""It would take a few years for that policy change to fully raise female employment and thus impact GDP,"" she said. Whatever the weaknesses of the analysis behind Lagarde’s statement, a rising fraction of working women helped drive growth in the United States. Janet Yellen, former head of the Federal Reserve, weighed in during a speech in 2017. ""Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about half a percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic product,"" Yellen said at a conference at Brown University. The impact at the end of that period was particularly strong, Stevenson said. ""In the 1970s and 1980s, 20 percent of GDP growth was due to women's increased work –– both increasing participation and hours worked,"" she said. ""That means that GDP today is roughly 13 percent bigger than it would be if women still worked like they did back at the start of the 1970s."" Stevenson faulted the study in its details but said it was roughly right on the scale of the impact of new women workers. Lagarde said if women were in the American workforce at the same rate as men, the country’s GDP would be up by 5 percent. The likely source is a 2012 article that used a simple formula to yield the 5 percent result. Two economists told us that the article’s approach skipped over several key factors, such as how quickly GDP would change and how the entry of millions of new women workers might change other aspects of the labor market and put a drag on economic growth. But in the end, it is generally accurate that if millions of women got into the job market, the economy would grow more than if they didn’t. We rate this claim Half True.","[('CBS News, Face the Nation, Dec. 9, 2018', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-christine-lagarde-on-face-the-nation-december-9-2018/'), ('Booz & Co., Empowering the Third Billion: Women and the World of Work in 2012, 2012', 'No link'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Women in the labor force: a databook, April 2017', 'https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Strategyand_Empowering-the-Third-Billion_Full-Report.pdf'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population by age, sex, and race, 2017', 'No link'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Civilian labor force participation rate, November 2018', 'https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-databook/2016/home.htm'), (""Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, So We All Can Succeed: 125 Years of Women's Participation in the Economy, May 5, 2017"", 'No link'), ('Boston University, The Female Labor Force and Long-run Development: The American Experience in Comparative Perspective, November 2013', 'https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat03.htm'), ('St Louis Federal Reserve, GDP change 1930-2017, July 27, 2018', 'No link'), ('Harvard Business Review, More Women in the Workforce Could Raise GDP by 5%, Nov. 1, 2012', 'https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm'), ('S&P Global, Adding More Women To The U.S. Workforce Could Send Global Stock Markets Soaring, 2017', 'No link'), ('McKinsey Global Institute, How advancing women’s equality can add $12 trillion to global growth, September 2015', 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170505a.htm'), ('Email interview, Elizabeth King, senior fellow, Center for Universal Education, Brookings Institution, Dec. 11, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Betsey Stevenson, associate professor of economics, University of Michigan, Dec. 11, 2018', 'https://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/11/olivetti_chapter_November2013_complete.pdf')]",/factchecks/2018/dec/12/christine-lagarde/if-women-worked-much-men-would-gdp-jump-5/

But one decade later, the 2007 figure remains the state’s highest median income level since the statistic was first recorded in 1984. Over that decade, the median income fell by 9 percent when factoring in inflation. (Data for 2018 is not available yet.) The nation as a whole has seen some income stagnation since 1999, but nothing as severe as West Virginia experienced. Nationally, median incomes have risen every year since 2014 and hit an all-time high in 2017. Comparing the specific years Romano used — 2007 to 2017 — the national figure rose by 3 percent. Romano wrote that ""adjusting for inflation, West Virginia’s median household income has not grown in a decade.""

The recordings are legitimate, and U.S. Border Patrol denounced the actions back in January when they first became viral. The 1 minute and 30 seconds video includes footage of Border Patrol agents kicking and emptying into the ground bottles of gallons of water.

""Watch U.S. border agents vandalize supplies left for migrants,"" said text over footage of agents kicking gallons of water left on the ground. Another frame in the video shows an agent pouring out water from a bottle into the ground.

The NowThis Politics video attributes the footage to No More Deaths. No More Deaths is an Arizona humanitarian group that leaves water, food, and other supplies for migrants traveling through the desert to get to the United States. In January, the group released a report on the ""intentional destruction"" of thousands of gallons of water left for migrants.

Voters weren't 'denied a ballot' when NC had voter ID
","Critics of requiring voters to present a photo ID at the polls say it’s a hurdle too high for some to clear. Supporters say the requirement is necessary to prevent voter impersonation. That debate is playing out in North Carolina as legislators draft a bill aimed at appeasing voters who, in a November referendum, endorsed the photo ID idea with 55 percent support. Republican legislators passed a photo ID law several years ago, but it was struck down in 2016 by judges who said that law aimed to suppress minority voters. Republicans on Nov. 27 introduced the latest photo ID proposal that would go into effect next year. In a committee meeting, state Sen. Terry Van Duyn argued the rollout would be too fast. Van Duyn, a Democrat from Buncombe County in western North Carolina, referenced the 2016 primary – when the old photo ID law was applied. ""With three years to educate the public, over 1,000 people were denied a ballot on Election Day. This seems like a pretty aggressive schedule. … That seems a little unreasonable,"" Van Duyn said on Nov. 27. Were 1,000 people ""denied a ballot"" in that 2016 primary? Elections board data Contacted by PolitiFact, Van Duyn (pronounced ""van dine"") cited a PowerPoint presentation in a legislative committee Nov. 26 by Kim Strach, executive director of the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. Strach explained to the committee that the NC elections board spent more than $2 million to raise awareness about the 2013 voter ID law that judges later shot down. The money went toward 400,000 posters and flyers, as well as TV, radio and online ads. Van Duyn’s point: Despite the state’s outreach effort, some would-be voters still didn’t understand or comply with the voter ID law during the 2016 primary. ""If you look at the second to the last slide, (Strach) states that 1,200+ voters, for a number of ID related reasons, were unable to vote. Some were offered provisional ballots, but were not counted,"" Van Duyn said in an email. The slide Van Duyn referenced says: ""1,248 voters did not present acceptable photo identification, or execute a Declaration of Reasonable Impediment, or return to the county office by the deadline after election night. These votes did not count. They were offered ballots Provisional ballots are conditional ballots that aren’t counted until the voter’s status can be confirmed. Van Duyn’s email statement that ""some were offered provisional ballots"" implies that some weren’t offered provisional ballots — which isn’t accurate. All of the 1,248 voters referenced in the email were offered provisional ballots, according to Josh Lawson, general counsel to the NC Board of Elections and Ethics Commission. ""Poll workers are required to offer a provisional voting opportunity to any voter who isn’t in the poll books or lacks identification or appears not to meet the requirements,"" Lawson said in an email to PolitiFact. ""Our numbers were compiled using data on provisional voting applications, so all those voters were offered provisional ballots,"" Lawson said. ""We do not have aggregate data on individuals who may have left the polling place without attempting to vote provisionally."" What does a ""declaration of reasonable impediment"" mean? Under the old law, voters filed a declaration with NC elections boards if they couldn’t obtain a photo ID for any of the following reasons: -Lack of transportation. -Disability or illness. -Lack of birth certificate or other documents needed to obtain photo identification. -Work schedule. -Family responsibilities. -Lost or stolen photo identification. -Photo identification applied for but not received by the voter voting in person. The PowerPoint says 1,048 voters completed a ""reasonable impediment"" form and that 864 of those ultimately counted. As for ""returning to the county office,"" the 2013 bill allowed people who didn’t bring an acceptable ID to the polls to cast a ballot if they presented a valid ID ""to the county board of elections (no) later than 12:00 noon the day prior to the time set for the convening of the election canvass."" So the 1,248 voters whose ballots didn’t count could’ve legitimized their provisional ballots by bringing a valid ID to their county elections board at a later date. But they didn’t. Our ruling Van Duyn said ""over 1,000 people were denied a ballot on election day"" in the 2016 primary. She’s got a point that more than 1,000 people showed up to vote and that their votes ultimately didn’t count. But her claim gives the impression that would-be voters were turned away by election workers, which isn’t the case. They were offered provisional ballots and didn’t take the necessary steps to make them count. Her claim in the committee is partly accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",[],/factchecks/2018/dec/11/terry-van-duyn/voters-werent-denied-ballot-when-nc-had-voter-id/

Yes, a school principal tried to ban candy canes
","An elementary school principal has been portrayed as a scrooge after multiple news reports and websites said she banned candy canes at her school due to what she said was religious significance. Several posts on Facebook had a version of this headline: ""Principal bans candy canes because the ‘J shape stands for Jesus.’"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, it was accurate that the principal attempted to ban candy canes, but the district reversed her ban. Leading up to the holiday season, the principal at Manchester Elementary School in Nebraska, Jennifer Sinclair, sent a staff memo outlining rules for the holiday season. Her list included ""not acceptable"" items or practices for the classroom including Santa or Christmas art on worksheets, Christmas music and books and ornaments. Then she provided the guidance on candy: ""Candy Cane — that’s Christmas-related. Historically, the shape is a ‘J’ for Jesus. The red is for the blood of Christ, and the white is a symbol of his resurrection. This would also include different colored candy canes."" Sinclair listed several winter symbols as ""acceptable"" including hot chocolate, snowmen, gingerbread people, and Olaf, the snowman from ""Frozen."" She signed the memo as ""The (Unintentional) Grinch who stole Christmas (from Manchester)."" The Liberty Counsel, a national conservative Christian organization based in Florida, heard about the memo and fired off a letter Nov. 30 to district? Superintendent Bary Habrock asking him to ""disavow the sweeping directive banning Christmas holiday items."" The Liberty Counsel included the text of Sinclair’s memo in its letter, which then drew national media attention. The Liberty Counsel said that the ban showed ""hostility toward Christianity"" and violated the district’s own policy, which allows teaching about religion. While the district policy doesn’t mention candy canes per se, it does say ""Christmas trees, Santa Claus and Easter eggs and bunnies are considered to be secular, seasonal symbols and may be displayed as teaching aids provided they do not disrupt the instructional program for students."" (The Anti-Defamation League, a national group that fights against anti-semitism, recommends that if a school has holiday decorations, ""they should represent the diversity of the season and should avoid symbols with patently religious meanings to avoid sending the message to students that a religion or a particular denomination is preferred."") Mat Staver, founder of the Liberty Counsel, told PolitiFact that the school district said Sinclair’s memo was not consistent with district policy. Principal Sinclair later sent an email to parents apologizing for the staff memo, saying the information she initially provided was incorrect, according to WOWT TV. Elkhorn school district spokeswoman Kara Perchal told PolitiFact that Sinclair was placed on administrative leave Dec. 6. Sinclair is in her first year at the school district. PolitiFact was unable to reach Sinclair — a person in the school office said she currently has no voicemail or email. ""Dr. Sinclair's memo did state that candy canes could not be used; however, this information was in direct opposition to our district policy regarding holiday symbols in the classroom,"" she said. Sinclair ascribed religious significance to the candy cane, from its shape to its red and white stripes. Our fact-checking friends at Snopes found statements that candy canes were created as Christian symbols representing the blood and purity of Jesus are false. (The original Snopes report was in 2000 and the website updated the story in 2017.) The National Confectioners Association’s article about the history of candy canes makes no mention of Jesus. It says, according to legend, in 1670 a choirmaster in Germany handed out sugar sticks to his young singers and had the candies bent into shepherds’ crooks. It wasn’t until the turn of the century that the red and white stripes and peppermint flavors became the norm. The association wrote that In the 1920s, Bob McCormack began making candy canes as Christmas treats. In the 1950s, Bob’s brother-in-law, Gregory Keller, a Catholic priest, invented a machine to automate candy cane production. Susan Benjamin, author of ""Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America's Favorite Pleasure,"" told the Charleston Gazette-Mail in 2015 that there have been various rumors about the origins of candy canes. But she told the Gazette-Mail that candy canes are not a symbol of Jesus. ""The candy cane is not a ‘J,’ the red is not meant to represent the blood of Jesus,"" said Benjamin, founder of True Treats Historic Candy, based in Harpers Ferry, W.V. Several news articles and websites said that a school principal banned candy canes. A principal wrote a memo to staff banning candy canes and said it was a symbol of Jesus. Comments by the school district show that this was no holiday tale. Ultimately, it's important to know the school quickly reversed the ban. So we rate this Mostly True.  ","[('CBS Pittsburgh, ""‘The Shape Is A J Is For Jesus’: Principal Bans Candy Canes, Christmas-Related Items From Classrooms,"" Dec. 9, 2018', 'https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/elementary-school-principal-christmas-candy-cane-ban/?fbclid=IwAR1brf6Jo192_1SpbK9vsgvnDDdcJWuDskuUImoGQHO1CyB2-i3EP2xrvIA'), ('Inner strength Zone, ""Principal bans candy canes because the ‘J shape stands for Jesus,’"" Dec. 9, 2018', 'No link'), ('Fox2Detroit, ""Principal bans candy canes, says ""J"" shape stands for Jesus,"" Dec. 8, 2018', 'https://innerstrengthzone.com/life/principal-bans-candy-canes-because-j-shape-stands-for-jesus/?fbclid=IwAR1HcRbxkom-vxbj63IQn3kgFOgRux9F0qqNYtSypniUtI_H8RwPAie5gjA'), ('Star-Herald (Scottsbluff, Nebraska), ""A Nebraska elementary school principal tried to ban Christmas.

Agreement to limit late-night sessions falls by the wayside
","With a change in power in the governor’s office coming in January 2019, Wisconsin’s lame-duck session in December 2018 was interesting. To say the least. The Republican-controlled Legislature passed several measures that limit the powers of Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers and incoming Attorney General Josh Kaul, also a Democrat. Gov. Scott Walker has signaled he supports the changes, though he is being lobbied heavily to reject some or all of them. Republican leaders say the moves were aimed at better balancing the power between the legislative and executive branches. A Washington Post opinion piece called Republicans’ post-election strategy ""thievery."" Evers labeled it ""a hot mess."" Here, we are not looking at what was done. Rather, we are looking at how it was done. Specifically, whether the process -- the initial legislation released late on a Friday, a committee vote Monday, and Tuesday-into-Wednesday final passage -- is consistent with a 2013 agreement that was aimed at avoiding rushed votes. As we have done a few times in recent days, we’ll use the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether elected officials or others have been consistent on an issue over time. We’ll look at Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, since he was an architect of the 2013 agreement and, among other things, has final word on Assembly schedules. While you were sleeping Although GOP leaders released an initial version of their plans on Friday, Nov. 30, 2018, things kept changing in the days -- even hours -- until the final votes early on Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018. Republicans spent much of the night working behind closed doors and unveiled a modified version of their legislation around 4 a.m. Senators passed the legislation 17-16, with Republican Sen. Rob Cowles of Green Bay joining Democrats in opposing the legislation. The Assembly passed the measure 56-27 along party lines. The final vote came at 8:20 a.m. As reported Dec. 5, 2018, by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, it was the latest session for the Senate since 1995, when it deliberated over the legislation to build Miller Park, according to Senate Chief Clerk Jeff Renk. ""Not a way to run a government,"" state Sen. Dave Hansen, D-Green Bay, said when the new legislation was released. For most of the early-morning hours, rank-and-file members from both parties were in the dark about what would be taken up. ""We've had 132 legislators milling around this building for a day. And night. And morning,"" Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse said, while unsuccessfully pushing to recess until lawmakers could get some sleep. The 2013 agreement State Assembly leaders from both parties struck a deal in January 2013 to cut down on their body's frequent and contentious overnight sessions, with time clocks installed to track the length of future floor speeches. ""We are going to stop all-night sessions; that is the reason we got together and made this agreement,"" Vos said at a news conference with Democratic leaders. ""We think it'll be the exception rather than the rule and maybe it won't happen at all this session,"" Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, said of overnight sessions. How it played out The 2013 agreement had several specific provisions. Here’s a look at how they played out during the lame-duck session (sometimes referred to as an ""extraordinary session."") In 2013, lawmakers said they would meet before each Assembly session to set time limits on debate for each bill. In 2018, there was no agreement for time limits for the special session. In 2013, lawmakers vowed to strictly follow the scheduled start time. In the 2018 session, the start time was supposed to be 1 p.m., but lawmakers didn’t start until hours later. In 2013, lawmakers planned to have private caucus meetings between the members of each party in advance. In 2018, they did do that, but also met in caucus after the official start time. In 2013, the plan was to minimize the number of contentious bills on any session day and ensure a minimum of 30 minutes of debate on the final vote on each bill unless leaders of both parties agree otherwise. In 2018, lawmakers appeared to adhere to this, as there was no complaint from Democrats of debate getting cut off early.    In 2013, the aim of the new rules was to end debate by a ""reasonable time"" each session day, though there was no curfew set for debate as Democrats had sought. In 2018, no one could claim the latest session ended at a ""reasonable"" time, since a 4 a.m. bill unveiling and a 8:20 a.m. vote are not reasonable hours.   Weighing in on how it played out Aaron Collins, communications director for Assembly Democratic Leader Gordon Hintz of Oshkosh, noted ""Republican leadership didn’t come to the floor until 10:30 p.m. and we adjourned at approximately 8:30 a.m. That is the definition of an all-night session."" He argued Republicans had ""completely flip flopped on their earlier pledge."" But the agreement did not outright ban overnight sessions. Even Barca, the Democratic leader at the time, said when the plan was unveiled that ""we think it'll be the exception rather than the rule."" Meanwhile, Vos communications director Kit Beyer said the agreement amounted to a ""Memorandum of Understanding."" ""The MOU allows both parties to discuss and agree to debate times,"" she said. ""Every effort was made to establish debate times for the extraordinary session. The Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke met with Democratic leaders on two occasions, but Democrats would not offer any time frame for debate or enter into that discussion."" Our rating In 2013, state Assembly leaders from both parties struck a deal to cut down on their body's frequent and contentious overnight sessions. Vos did say ""we are going to stop all-night sessions,"" but from the context at the time -- including statements by Democratic leadership -- it’s clear it was not a ban, but an agreed-upon goal. That said, there were many other parts of the agreement aimed at ensuring key issues would be debated fully and in the public eye -- and not while most constituents are sleeping. The Assembly fell far short of that. The final wording of the bills that passed was unveiled around 4 a.m. Less than five hours later, it was all headed to Walker’s desk. We see that as a Full Flop.","[('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Republicans worked all night to limit power of Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers,"" Dec. 5, 2018.', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/05/lame-duck-session-what-you-need-know-gop-lawmakers-moves/2213793002/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Assembly leaders agree to limit overnight debates, install time clock,"" Jan. 10, 2013.', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter""', 'http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-assembly-leaders-to-discuss-overnight-session-rule-er8aqvb-186315092.html/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Wisconsin lawmakers reject bill to protect pre-existing conditions,"" Dec. 5,2018.', 'No link'), ('Washington Post ""The Republicans’ post-midterm strategy: Thievery,""Dec. 4, 2018. \xa0', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Flip-O-Meter%20ratings'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Controversial lame-duck proposals now in Scott Walker’s hands as Democratic groups eye lawsuits,"" Dec. 5, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Email, Aaron Collins, communications director for Assembly Democratic Leader Gordon Hintz, Dec. 7, 2018.', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/12/04/republicans-vote-tuesday-curbing-powers-tony-evers-limiting-early-voting/2198624002/'), ('Email, Kit Beyer, Vos communications director, Dec. 7, 2018.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/dec/11/robin-vos/agreement-limit-late-night-sessions-falls-wayside/
