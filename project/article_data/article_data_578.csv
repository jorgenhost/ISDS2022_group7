The facts behind Joe Donnelly's Senate effectiveness
","Joe Donnelly, incumbent senator running for re-election in Indiana, touted his effective lawmaking during a seven-day campaign trip around the state. ""43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office,"" an Aug. 8 press release from the Donnelly campaign read. The campaign has repeated this figure time and again, on the road and in campaign statements. It contradicts, however, what President Donald Trump said about Donnelly, whom he dubbed ""Sleepin’ Joe"" during a May 11 campaign rally for Republican challenger Mike Braun. ""The Center for Effective Lawmaking named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate,"" Trump said. ""He's never sponsored a bill that has become a law."" So who’s right? In a way, both are correct. The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a nonpartisan research project run by two political science professors, assigns credit based on who is the sponsor of a bill, as recorded by the Library of Congress. Based on that definition, Donnelly has never sponsored a bill that became a law during his first term in the Senate. That doesn’t mean none of his legislative proposals in the Senate have become law. Craig Volden, who co-directs the center, noted that the criteria for advancing a legislative proposal could be broadened. A closer search of the Library of Congress database shows 28 bills that became law on which Donnelly was among the co-sponsors. He was an original co-sponsor, a higher bar, on five of these. Language from Donnelly’s bills, and from amendments he proposed, have also made their way into law, mostly through annual budget acts. In all, these add up to 43 total and 17 under Trump. For example, Donnelly introduced a bill in 2013 to improve suicide prevention efforts in the military. The bill didn’t get far on its own, but Donnelly got the proposal passed in the National Defense Authorization Act in 2014 as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. More recently, Donnelly helped author Right to Try, a bill aimed at getting drugs that had not been FDA-approved to terminally ill patients. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., was the sponsor of the bill, so Donnelly didn’t get that credit on Congress.gov — but Johnson gave it to him at a press conference. ""My primary co-sponsor, Sen. Donnelly, was a stalwart,"" Johnson said. ""This would not have happened without Joe Donnelly."" Volden said that while valid measures of effectiveness, ""there is no similar comprehensive measure of the other senators in this regard that would allow a systematic comparison and ranking of senators on these criteria."" Experts told us being in the minority in a divided Congress makes it harder for Donnelly to have gotten much passed anyway. Donnelly took office in 2013, and Democrats held the majority until 2015. ""As you can see, passing the version he sponsors would let him claim credit easily — incorporating it elsewhere would not,"" said Corrine McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University. ""Partisans busy undermining each other absolutely may seek ways to prevent credit-claiming by the other party's members."" That said, Donnelly has demonstrated willingness to cross the aisle. The Lugar Center's Bipartisan Index (named for former Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.) measures the frequency with which a member gets co-sponsors for their bills from the other party and the frequency with which they co-sponsor bills introduced by the other party. They ranked Donnelly fourth among senators and first among Democratic senators.  Donnelly’s campaign said, ""43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office."" None of those were the bills he sponsored on his own that became law. But in a gridlocked Congress, that’s not unusual for a senator in the minority. Instead, Donnelly co-sponsored bills, wrote amendments and crafted language that made its way into 43 laws during his single Senate term.

Roskam ad makes absurd claims about Democratic challenger’s health care stance
","In a current Facebook ad, U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam accuses his Democratic challenger of supporting ""disastrous health care policies for your family,"" among them ""doubling premiums,"" and ""cutting current health care plans."" It’s no surprise that Roskam, a six-term Republican incumbent fighting to keep his 6th District seat in the Western suburbs, doesn’t see eye-to-eye on health care with Sean Casten, a clean-energy entrepreneur from Downers Grove. Roskam was a key architect of last year’s congressional tax overhaul that struck the controversial Obamacare penalty for not having health insurance. Casten has made protecting and expanding health care access under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a top priority of his campaign. Republicans have been complaining about the effects of Obamacare for years, but Roskam is taking some wild swings with this attack on Casten. There’s a lot here to unpack, so to keep it simple this fact-check focuses on the ad’s unsubstantiated health care claims. Veronica Vera, a Roskam campaign spokeswoman, said the ad connected the dots between Casten’s support for Obamacare and a federal report—itself containing a number of caveats—that found premiums sold to individuals on the federal health care exchange were 105 percent higher in 2017 than premiums for existing individual market plans available in 2013 before the exchange opened. If it happened in the past it surely then will happen in the future, Vera reasoned, and so to the Roskam campaign that means Casten backs a doubling of premiums. One obvious problem with that line of thinking is that the Roskam campaign could provide no evidence that Casten had ever said such a thing. What’s more, experts say a major factor behind recent premium spikes on the individual market was uncertainty over the law’s future given frequent attempts by Roskam and other Republicans, including President Donald Trump, to kill or weaken Obamacare. Even so, there is evidence in Illinois that the days of Obamacare sticker shock may be over. Illinois’ largest insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, has proposed a slight reduction in its premiums for Obamacare plans next year. It’s also important to note that most Americans obtain insurance through their employers, not Obamacare. Overall, premium hikes for work-based policies have been modest in recent years. For those who do rely on Obamacare, just a small share have been exposed to the full brunt of past Obamacare premium increases. Of the 15.2 million Americans who in 2017 purchased Obamacare coverage through the federal health care exchange, 8.2 million qualified for federal subsidies that cushioned them from increases, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care. Another 5.4 million Americans also purchased full-price individual insurance through the off-exchange plans that existed prior to Obamacare, according to Kaiser. ""We’re really talking about maybe 2 percent of the population that’s paying full-price premiums for the individual market overall,"" said Cynthia Cox, a health reform and private insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation. ""It's important to think about these people because the ACA was intended to make insurance more affordable,"" she said. ""But putting it into perspective, it's a relatively small share of the population."" Roskam’s other health care attack on Casten is also convoluted. The logic works this way: Obamacare shoppers had fewer options when picking plans for 2018, so that must mean that if Obamacare were expanded as Casten wants the options would narrow even further. ""Expanding the ACA would mean limiting health care options for everyone affected,"" Vera wrote. That argument is riddled with holes. Obamacare plans didn’t exist prior to 2014, so any number of options offered on the exchange are a plus, even if pared back. A key reason for the reductions was uncertainty over the law’s future following the election of Trump, who demanded it be scrapped. And Obamacare also mandates minimum levels of coverage that did not exist prior to implementation of the health care law, which vastly expanded access to coverage for millions of Americans who previously had none, including those who didn’t qualify based on their health. ""Before the ACA, if you had a pre-existing condition, there could be any number of plans to choose from, but you couldn’t get any of them,"" said Cox, the insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation. Roskam alleges that Casten supports ""doubling premiums"" and ""cutting current health care plans"" for Illinois families. Casten doesn’t support doubling premiums or reducing options—and Roskam’s campaign could point to nothing that said he did. The crux of Roskam’s argument centers on Casten’s support for expanding Obamacare options. Premiums on the federal exchange have spiked in past years, but Illinois’ largest insurer now says it expects them to go down slightly for 2019. What’s more, most Americans get insurance through employers, not Obamacare. But among those who do, most have been insulated from the full force of premium increases by federal subsidies. Health care policy has more wrinkles than a Shar Pei dog, and the complexity makes it easy for partisans to demagogue. Roskam’s claims are a clear example. They’re not just wrong, they’re absurd.

Wisconsin GOP radio ad takes aim at Democratic candidate for governor Flynn's role in priest case
","In a radio ad attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn, the Wisconsin Republican Party claims that Flynn ""told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities."" Flynn has taken heavy criticism from Gov. Scott Walker and others for his role representing the Milwaukee Archdiocese in priest sexual abuse cases from 1989 to 2004. Flynn is one of eight Democrats in the Aug. 14 primary who hope to face Walker in November. The former priest and Flynn have given differing accounts of what happened. But this much is clear: Describing the former priest in question as a ""child predator"" is one step (or several) too far.
  Let’s take a look. The case A criminal complaint filed against against Marvin Knighton in 2002 claimed the priest had sexually assaulted a 12-year-old boy. Under Wisconsin law, the charge applies to cases in which an adult has sexual contact with a child under 16 without threats, violence, or injury. According to the criminal complaint, ""Knighton would frequently talk about his own penis and told (the boy) that one day he, (the boy), would have hair on his genital area and that when this happened, he would be a man and that he would take him out to dinner."" The accuser claimed that the contact involved kissing and touching. The priest would call the boy by a feminine name and tell him how beautiful he was, according to the complaint. Before that, the case had played out behind the scenes. It began when the father of the alleged victim contacted Knighton in 1993 and accused him of sexually assaulting his son. Knighton reported the allegations to the archdiocese, saying he wanted to ""clear this up."" In a 2003 letter to then-Archbishop Timothy Dolan, Knighton wrote that he went to Flynn regarding the allegation that had been made against him. Knighton stated in the letter that ""nothing inappropriate ever happened with this young man."" Knighton wrote that Flynn ""suggested that we simply wait to see if he would file a report with Project Benjamin,"" an archdiocesan program to help victims of abuse. When the accuser failed to file a report, Knighton’s letter claimed Flynn told him ""not to worry about it. He felt that the young man wasn’t going to do anything."" Knighton’s letter went on:

""I did not feel comfortable with that decision and again requested that as ‘legal counsel’ for the Archdiocese, that we be proactive in such a delicate matter and meet with my accuser. Mr. Flynn told me that it would be too much of a hassle to do anything legally and most likely nothing would happen. How wrong was that?"" The archdiocese partially corroborates Knighton’s account on its website, which in a summary of the case says ""the attorney advised Knighton that, because no one had filed a complaint, nothing could be done. Knighton continued to exercise ministry."" What the candidate says In July 2018, Matt Flynn held a conference call with reporters in hopes of addressing all questions related to the priest abuse scandal. In it, Flynn confirmed that he did meet with Knighton in 1993 while representing the archdiocese as a lawyer for Quarles & Bradley. However, he denied Knighton’s account and said that Knighton was an unreliable source, given that the letter in question was written a decade after the meeting. ""What he says there is false,"" Flynn said. ""I insisted (the archdiocese) go to the police on any allegation."" Of course, by that definition, Flynn himself would be an unreliable witness, since he, too, is recollecting events from many years prior. The GOP claim The ad characterizes Knighton as a ""child predator."" According to the state Department of Corrections, a sexual predator (the law uses the term ""sexually violent person"") is ""a person who has been committed in a civil court proceeding under Chapter 980 of the Wisconsin Statutes."" For such a commitment to be made, the person has to have been ""previously convicted of certain sexually violent offenses"" and ""diagnosed with a mental disorder that predisposes the person to engage in further acts of sexual violence."" Knighton does not meet either criteria. He has never been convicted in a criminal court of sexual assault. In the 2003 criminal case, a jury acquitted Knighton of the single charge of second-degree sexual assault of a child. A second allegation of sexual abuse from a 1974 victim fell outside the criminal statute of limitations and thus was never tried in court. By 2004 a third allegation had surfaced but never translated to legal action. Indeed, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections’ sex offender registry does not list Knighton’s name. That said, the archdiocese conducted a separate investigation of Knighton and in a canonical trial found him guilty of both charges of abuse. The church dismissed him from the priesthood after he lost his appeal in 2011. Colloquially, a ""predator,"" as defined by Merriam Webster, is ""a person who has committed a sexually violent offense and especially one who is likely to commit more sexual offenses."" If the multiple allegations against Knighton are true, he potentially meets this definition. But in this context, we think the legal definition carries the most weight. Reporting to authorities The GOP also claimed that Flynn ""should have turned (Knighton) in to authorities."" Should he have? Peter K. Rofes, professor of law at Marquette University, doesn’t think so. But the reasons are complicated. Let’s break it down. First, there is the confidentiality obligation between a lawyer and a client. ""With very modest exceptions, lawyers must safeguard confidential information and refrain from revealing all information that relates to representation of a client,"" said Rofes. A lawyer could only share information on a client with, say, the police, if the client threatened to imminently endanger life or inflict massive monetary harm. Under the law in 1993, Rofes said, a lawyer had no legal obligation to report a non-client who threatened similarly harmful acts.  In this case, Flynn’s client was the institution of the archdiocese, not Knighton specifically. Under the ""principles of confidentiality"" contained within Chapter 20 of Supreme Court rules, ""Lawyer Flynn did not have an affirmative legal obligation to go outside the archdiocese, to go outside the organization he was representing, with any information on the priest,"" said Rofes. In 1993, Flynn’s only legal obligation was to make sure the archdiocese was aware of the allegations against Knighton. Since Knighton reported the allegations to the archdiocese, they were aware. Some might argue Flynn had a moral obligation to report Knighton to authorities. Flynn was not precluded from doing that. Nor was the archdiocese. Neither did, which is the thrust of the GOP point. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP claims that Flynn ""told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities."" Knighton and the archdiocese have described events that would support the claim, but their accounts have been disputed by Flynn. That said, Knighton does not legally qualify as as a child predator (or even a sex offender) -- which is central to the claim in the GOP ad. Finally, Flynn had no legal obligation to report a non-client to the authorities, but some might argue he had a moral one.

Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor miscalculates on tax claim
","Josh Pade was a latecomer to the crowded Democratic governor’s race. The Kenosha lawyer has not been a major factor in the polls, or the fundraising tallies. But we were struck by a claim Pade made June 1, 2018, in an interview on WisconsinEye, since it went right to the tax cuts Republican Gov. Scott Walker touts as a major achievement. When asked what he would do about the state’s struggling middle class, Pade referenced his tax background and said as governor he wants to put together a bipartisan group to reform the state’s tax code. He also said this: ""Scott Walker touts his tax cuts. Unfortunately Wisconsin’s still one of the highest-taxed states in the country."" Is he right about Wisconsin’s tax status? The evidence When we asked Pade’s campaign to provide backup for the statement, spokeswoman Kate Cooney pointed us to a study by Wallethub, a personal finance website, that ranked Wisconsin as 46th in effective tax rate (Number 1 being the lowest). ""We do acknowledge that other measurements of taxation have shown a lowered trend over time beginning before Governor Walker took office, but those studies are not as comprehensive in their data sets,"" said Cooney. ""We have also pointed out the tax burden as a percentage of income in Wisconsin is often lower on the most wealthiest income brackets than those with lower income."" A spokesman for Walker’s campaign declined to offer any evidence on the issue, so we checked with a variety of experts and other rankings. Since Pade’s statement referred to taxes in general, we’ll start with what experts said about the overall tax burden. Tamarine Cornelius, a research analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project: She said the state ranks somewhere in the middle when looking at state and local taxes -- 20th when measured on a per-state resident basis in 2015 and 21st when measured as a share of personal income. ""Measured either way, state and local taxes in Wisconsin are actually below the national average,"" she said, noting that when fees are included it drops Wisconsin’s rank even further. ""In Wisconsin, residents pay lower fees than residents in many other states,"" she said. Tax Foundation: A 2018 report from the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, also shows Wisconsin in the middle of the pack with a rank of 18 for state tax collections per capita for 2016. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute: ""It looks like it’s a stretch to say Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country,"" he said. He mentioned the state’s ""somewhat progressive"" income tax rates, noting the top rate isn’t that high compared to other states; the existence of an Earned Income Tax Credit, though it isn’t as large as some others; and an average, if not low, sales tax rate compared to other states. So, all three put Wisconsin in the middle of the pack, not ""one of the highest."" Why does the Wallethub study differ? Cornelius said she had concerns with how Wallethub did its analysis. She noted thestate Legislative Fiscal Bureau had determined the amount of property taxes paid on a median-valued house in Wisconsin to be $2,830. Cornelius said the Wallethub study ""overestimated property taxes on a median-valued house by 27%.""   Specific taxes What about Wisconsin’s rank for specific taxes? On property taxes, we contacted senior research analyst Adam Langley from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a nonprofit focused on economic, social and environmental components of land. He pointed us to a ranking of states by property tax collection as a percentage of personal income from the Tax Policy Center’s State and Local Data Query Systembased on a survey of state and local governments. Wisconsin ranked 12th at 3.7 percent. He also pointed to an analysis his group did using U.S. Census Bureau data. That  analysis examined the median property tax bill as a percentage of the median household income for homeowners for 2015. Wisconsin ranked eighth at 4.6 percent. ""Property taxes are definitely higher in most New England states, New Jersey and Illinois than they are in Wisconsin,"" Langley said, ""Depending on the specific measure of property taxes used for the comparison, there are several more states that also have higher property taxes than Wisconsin."" On income taxes, Auxier called Wisconsin’s income taxes ""somewhat progressive"" and referenced the state Department of Revenue’s tax rates and an Urban Institute summary of U.S. Census Bureau data. Auxier said Wisconsin’s four brackets, with a top rate on income above $329,810 for married filers, are relatively progressive because half the states that have an income tax have one flat rate or a threshold for their top rate on income below $40,000, which is ""essentially flat."" Auxier said the most important thing to keep in mind when thinking about state taxes is different people pay different taxes. This is why statements saying one state is the highest-taxed are not that simple. He referenced an Urban Institute study he co-authored that estimated what each state’s revenue would look like with a tax system based on national average tax rates. Results showed ""Wisconsin’s actual taxes raise about as much revenue as it would with the average system,"" Auxier said. Our rating Pade said ""Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country."" The study his campaign provided as evidence was from an organization that does not specialize in tax analysis and experts we spoke with were skeptical of how the study was done. In any case, the statement was too broad to be accurate. Specific taxes may rank higher than others, and the rankings might vary for different income groups. But the claim was about taxes in general. And, in general, the state is now more middle of the pack. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/aug/10/josh-pade/democratic-candidate-wisconsin-governor-miscalcula/

Matt Flynn heavily involved in priest abuse cases, but was he part of transferring accused priests?
","At a debate for the Democratic candidates for governor, the first question posed to attorney Matt Flynn was about his work defending the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in pedophile priest cases. ""I was not part of transferring anybody,"" Flynn told the audience in Madison on Aug. 8, 2018, six days before the primary election. Eight Democrats are competing for the right to take on GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the fall. Citing the priest cases, Walker has called on Flynn to drop out of the race. For years, accused Catholic priests were routinely transferred from one parish or school to another, and many of them continued molesting children. Certainly, transfers were actually ordered by the archdiocese, not by lawyers such as Flynn who were retained by the archdiocese. But was Flynn, whose campaign has been dogged by questions about the priest scandal, involved in those transfers? Flynn represented the archdiocese from 1989 to 2004 and was heavily involved in priest abuse cases. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The history Earlier on the day of the debate, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice posted a column about Flynn’s work. The article detailed cases indicating Flynn, to some extent, was part of the transfers: Informed of Adamsky transfer: In an August 1992 letter, the vicar for clergy in the archdiocese contacted Flynn about the transfer of Father Raymond Adamsky in response to allegations of abuse. A bishop ""suggested that I send a copy of the new assignment for Fr. Ray Adamsky for your records,"" the letter said. ""We hope this will be satisfactory to all involved. Thanks for meeting with us. It was good to have an update on everyone."" Adamsky was transferred 11 times during his work for the church. Flynn’s campaign told Bice the meeting was not about Adamsky's transfer, but about legal claims regarding Adamsky and others. In any case, Flynn was at least aware of the transfer. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Lawyers involved: Adamsky had his ministry restricted by a bishop in 1991, but was allowed to continue to serve as priest at the church and have access to its school. Church officials removed Adamsky from the parish in 1992 after two more children complained to their principal about the priest's ""rough physical contact"" with the pair.

The archdiocese's website says: ""Negotiations between lawyers took place about what kind of assignment would be agreeable, and it was determined that chaplain work at a retirement home would be possible."" So, Flynn was not named, but he was a key attorney for the archdiocese at the time. Another meeting: In a case involving a different priest, Father Mike Krejci, Flynn is listed in court records as being in a November 1994 meeting with Krejci, the archbishop and other archdiocese officials. Krejci had just been accused in a letter from another priest of sexually abusing a child. Flynn’s campaign told Bice the records do not indicate that the meeting involving Flynn had to do with a reassignment of Krejci. The decision regarding the priest's future was made at a meeting the next day, without Flynn in attendance, the campaign contended. So, here, too, Flynn is centrally involved in a priest case and attended a meeting about one of the accused priests the day before the priest’s transfer. Response from Flynn For this fact check, Flynn campaign manager Bryan Kennedy told us that despite the documents cited in Bice’s column, there are no letters from Flynn ""directing the archbishop to transfer priests nor are there directives or memos that Matt signed off on that would show his approval or collaboration in making decisions about transfers."" Fair enough. But it’s also clear Flynn was heavily involved in cases where accused priests were transferred. Our rating Flynn says he was ""not part of transferring"" any priests accused of sexual abuse. There is no evidence to show that Flynn advised the archdiocese to transfer priests accused of molesting children to different parishes. But Flynn was a top attorney for the archdiocese during a period of years when a number of such transfers were done, and he had at least some involvement with cases in which accused priests were transferred.

Cutting Wisconsin prison population 50% wouldn't 'require' release of thousands of violent felons
","So, are some of the Democrats running for governor planning to open prison doors to release thousands of thugs? It’s a picture Republican Gov. Scott Walker painted with a tweet on Aug. 7, 2018, one week before the primary election that will determine which one of eight Democrats will run against him in the fall. Walker issued more than a dozen tweets on prisons that day, including this one: A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%. That would require the release of thousands of violent felons. Walker also issued a news release and did a news conference the same day. The next day, Walker went on conservative radio talk shows to press his points more, and the 50 percent reduction proposals were part of a debate in Madison for the Democratic candidates. What we found is Walker is right on the first part of his claim, but not on the second. Who supports 50 percent cut At least two of the Democrats have called for cutting the state’s prison population in half  — by some 12,000 inmates — according to a July 2018 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article. Kelda Roys, a former state lawmaker, and liberal activist Mike McCabe both said they want such a cut -- with Roys saying she wants to do it within four years and McCabe not stating a time frame. (The Wisconsin Republican Party has attacked Roys for her proposal in a radio ad.) Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Two of the other candidates have expressed support for the idea. State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout has said cutting the inmate population in half is an ""absolutely doable statistic,"" while state schools superintendent Tony Evers has said a 50 percent cut is ""a goal that’s worth accomplishing."" So, Walker is correct on the first part of his claim. Violent offenders But what of the second part? Would a 50 percent cut would ""require"" the release of thousands of violent felons. Walker’s news release said that according to the state Department of Corrections, 67 percent of state prison inmates have committed at least one violent offense, including crimes such as murder, rape and assault; but also offenses such as intimidation, illegal abortion and extortion. His campaign argued to us that, therefore, it would be impossible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing violent offenders (although Walker’s statement referred to violent felons). All our fact checks in the governor’s race That suggests the only way to achieve a 50 percent cut is to release violent offenders who are already in prison. But none of the Democrats has stated they would achieve this instantly. What’s more, there are other ways over time to reduce the prison population. If the 50 percent cut were to be done immediately, or in short order, that would require releasing violent felons, according to Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School. He has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. In contrast, Streit said, the 50 percent cut could be achieved by reducing the population by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.  That could be done, he argued, without the early release of any current inmates. As far as the candidates, Roys has said she could achieve a 50 percent reduction with steps including releasing more inmates who are eligible for parole, releasing ill and aging inmates, expanding diversion programs and overhauling the truth-in-sentencing law. Similarly, McCabe called for sending fewer people to prison through steps such as ending parole revocations when new crimes have not been committed and by boosting prison alternatives for nonviolent offenses and mental health and drug addiction treatment. It’s unknown, of course, whether Roys’ or McCabe’s plans would achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing violent felons. But it’s also not clear that a 50 percent cut would necessitate such a release. Our rating Walker says: ""A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%"" and ""that would require the release of thousands of violent felons."" Two Democrats have called for a 50 percent cut and two have said that should be a goal. But evidence is lacking that such a cut would require the release of thousands of violent felons. While a short time frame might require that, a longer time frame  — and reducing incoming inmates as well as releasing some others — would not.

LeBron James's Akron school won't cost taxpayers more money
","An entertainment blog took a shot at LeBron James for not paying a fair share of the cost of his I Promise School in Akron, Ohio. Wannabe Entertainment published a story criticizing national media for not acknowledging that James isn’t paying for the bulk of the school’s costs. Its headline paints taxpayers as bearers of the burden for the school, which opened July 30. ""LeBron’s ‘I Promise School’ To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year,"" it says. Wannabe Entertainment is correct that taxpayers will pay millions of dollars for the school. However, the framing of the article could mislead readers to believe taxpayers will pay millions of dollars on top of what they were paying before, which is not the case. The first few paragraphs of the story are lifted straight from an Aug. 5 Cleveland Plain Dealer story. After that, the Wannabe Entertainment story switches to a diatribe about Trump's tweeted critique of James and CNN's Don Lemon after an interview and the ""entire anti-Trump universe"" coming to the basketball star's defense. Its version does not go on, as the Plain Dealer did, to credit James's investment. The I Promise School is a first-through-eighth grade public school that is part of the Akron Public School District. Because it is a public school, the LeBron James Family Foundation will foot a portion of the cost, but not the entire bill. ""This is a public school,"" Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact. ""Taxpayers support all of our schools including this one."" Public schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to. The foundation pays for the additional services at the school that the other schools in the district do not have, including GED classes and job placement for parents, guest speakers and a food pantry. Stephanie Rosa, a spokeswoman for the LeBron James Family Foundation, told PolitiFact the foundation hasn’t added up how much it contributed to the school. A $2 million rough estimate covered some building renovations, such as rewiring for technology and staff hires for the family center. But the amount of money spent up until the day the school opened has not been made public. Before the opening of James’s school, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools and kids from all those schools were in the program but now in one location. ""It’s not a new program, not new students, not even a new building,"" Williamson said. Point being, taxpayers were going to pay for the students whether or not James got involved. There are 46 schools in the Akron Public School District. Williamson said 35 of those schools have been rebuilt and during that time, the home of the current I Promise school served as the temporary school for those students who were displaced in that in-between time. ""For about 15 years, this building housed every student from every school that has been rebuilt,"" Williamson said. Williamson said the 240 students enrolled at I Promise were already in the program but in their respective elementary schools. ""All we’re doing is taking kids that we already support and putting them in a different location,"" he said. The cost of educating the students is consistent. So are the teachers’ salaries. The opening of this school puts all the students in the I Promise program under one roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July through May. There are no additional costs because the district didn’t hire any new teachers or recruit new students.

In Montana Senate race, long-standing battle between developers, farmers looms large
","In Montana’s contentious U.S. Senate race, Democratic incumbent Jon Tester accused his Republican challenger of placing the interests of property developers over Montana farmers. Tester is making the case that opponent Matt Rosendale’s previous career as a land developer colored his voting decisions as a state lawmaker. ""Matt Rosendale consistently supported land use rules that would help developers like him and hurt farmers in Montana,"" Tester said on his website. While the legislative debate over Montana land use laws may not have grabbed national headlines, communities across America are familiar with the push-and-pull between developers and farmers, as well as local government’s attempts to balance these often adversarial competing interests.   We decided to take a closer look at Montana’s case. Montana — nicknamed ""Big Sky Country"" — holds farmland so dear that its soil gets a nod in the state constitution in a provision directing lawmakers to ""protect, enhance, and develop all of agriculture."" So what happens if you want to take a piece of Montana property and divide it into smaller lots for individual sale? Under longstanding Montana law, local governments generally have a legal duty to weigh the agricultural impact of such subdivisions. Basically, if planners determine the move would have a ""potentially significant adverse impact"" on agriculture, they can force the developer to take ""reasonable steps"" to minimize the impact, according to a report from the University of Montana School of Law. Not surprisingly, developers have faced political headwinds from some agricultural and environmental groups when they’ve sought to change the rules. Tester’s campaign pointed us to votes on two such measures that Rosendale, who is now the state’s auditor, cast in his previous role as a Montana lawmaker. Both bills were vetoed by the state’s Democratic governor. But had they passed, they would have substantially altered Montana’s land use law. One bill — the more sweeping of the two measures we looked at — was a 2011 proposal to reduce the influence local governments have on whether a proposed subdivision can move forward. Specifically, the bill — HB 542 — would have narrowed the range of factors planners could consider while assessing a subdivision’s agricultural impact. The proposal would also have imposed a requirement that planners back up their arguments with peer-reviewed studies, and it set a strict deadline on the amount of time the government had to deliver its findings. And under the bill, if a court ruled in a developer’s favor, the losing party would have to pay attorney’s fees — a provision that experts said was meant to discourage legal challenges to subdivision proposals and environmental permitting decisions. Rosendale voted in favor of both the House bill in 2011, as well as a similar Senate bill in 2013. His campaign did not dispute Tester’s characterization of the bills as pro-developer. In fact, every source we consulted unanimously agreed with that conclusion.    ""This bill was an attempt by developers to make it easier to subdivide suburban property for housing development,"" Mike Dennison, chief political reporter for Montana Television Network who covered the HB 542 debate in 2011, told us. Because the pro-developer portion of the claim is not disputed, we’re concerned here with only one question: Did the measures that Rosendale supported stand to hurt Montana farmers? The answer is a mixed picture. Opponents’ main argument against changing the law was that it would lead to the disappearance of Montana farmland. As evidence, Tester’s campaign pointed us to a 2011 op-ed in The Missoulian that carried the headline, ""Subdivision bill bad for farmers, ranchers."" In it, Stephanie Laporte, a member of the Community Food and Agriculture Coalition, argued the proposed changes would gut the law’s original intent of protecting Montana farmland, by ""allow(ing) subdivisions to run wild through farming and ranching communities."" ""Make no mistake,"" Laporte wrote, ""if approved by the Senate, HB 542 will hurt farmers and ranchers, lead to the permanent loss of agricultural land, and jeopardize Montana's top industry for decades to come."" Dennison, who covered the legislative debate for the Billings Gazette, said some farmers may have viewed the prospect of rolling back agricultural protections as a kind of slippery slope. ""It’s possible that farmers who don’t want to subdivide their land may feel squeezed by other landowners doing it and feel powerless to stop encroaching development,"" Dennison told us. ""They may have seen this bill as making it harder (for local government) to slow things."" Despite these concerns, the House bill (and a similar 2013 Senate bill) cleared both legislative chambers before dying on the desk of a Democratic governor. ""I issue this veto because the amendments to Montana’s subdivision review process contained in HB 542 are unnecessary, contrary to the public interest, and could jeopardize one of Montana’s most important industries – farming and ranching,"" Gov. Brian Schweitzer said in an April 2011 veto message. On the other hand, some farmers welcomed the bill. To its supporters, the changes represented a regulatory rollback that would broaden farmers’ rights to do as they wish with their private property. ""Farming and agricultural interests in Montana, on land-use policy, tend to default toward less regulation,"" Dennison told us. ""They see regulation and planning as possible encroachment on private-property rights, which they are very enthusiastic about."" Rather than a government planner blocking the subdivision of farmland, property owners always have another option, Dennison noted: ""If farmers don’t want development, they don’t have to subdivide their land."" Based on an analysis the voting breakdown of the 2011 House bill, Dennison reasoned that while some farm interests opposed the bill, most of the mainstream agricultural groups likely either supported or didn’t oppose it because of the property-rights issue. Chuck Johnson, a veteran Montana political and state government reporter for the Last Best News and Missoula Current, also said the bill presented a mixed picture in terms of its effect on Montana farmers. ""It would have hurt some farmers,"" he told us. ""But it would have benefited those farmers — probably in the small minority — who wanted to subdivide their land or sell it to someone who wanted to subdivide."" A spokesman for Rosendale cited the case of a Montanan named George Lake who saw the measure as a way to broaden his property rights. In testimony before his local government committee, Lake said he spent three years appealing to local planners to approve the subdivision of his relatively modest plot, before ultimately giving up. ""The unpredictable and inconsistent approval process is a huge issue for small-time property owners like (Lake) who don’t have the clout that a major developer does,"" said Shane Scanlon, communications director for Matt Rosendale. Farm groups were divided on the subdivision law changes Rosendale backed, which would seem to underscore the farming community’s mixed feelings. The Montana Farmers Union, which tends to align with Democrats and has traditionally represented relatively smaller farmers, opposed the 2013 Senate measure, calling it ""an anti-agriculture bill."" (The Montana Farmers Union did not respond to a request for comment.) But the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, which typically lines up with Republican positions and tends to support relatively larger farmers, backed the measure. ""It was helpful to developers but not particularly harmful to agriculture,"" John Youngberg, executive vice president of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, told us. Johnson, the veteran Montana politics reporter who explained the farm groups’ political leanings to us, said that despite the groups’ partisan tendencies, they don’t always line up on opposite sides of the aisle. ""At times, the various farming and ranching groups work together on issues, and are quite formidable,"" he said. ""This issue was one where they disagreed."" Tester said, ""Matt Rosendale consistently supported land use rules that would help developers like him and hurt farmers in Montana."" For this fact-check, we looked at two measures that would have relaxed Montana’s land use rules. Sources we consulted unanimously characterized these bills as pro-developer. The question of how farmers would fare under the proposed changes, however, yielded a much more mixed answer. Some farmers appeared fearful that laxer regulation would lead to the disappearance of Montana farmland. Yet others welcomed the broader private-property rights engendered in the new laws. Farm groups were divided on the subdivision law changes Rosendale backed, which underscores the farming community’s mixed feelings.

Putnam ad exaggerates DeSantis votes on Social Security, Medicare
","A TV ad for Adam Putnam narrated by Florida seniors says that while President Donald Trump has their back, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis doesn’t. ""Congressman DeSantis voted to cut Social Security and Medicare,"" said one senior. ""DeSantis even voted to increase the retirement age,"" said another man. Putnam and DeSantis will face off in an Aug. 28 primary. (While the ad tries to link Putnam to Trump, the president has endorsed DeSantis.) Multiple Democrats are also running in their own primary. The ad was referring to votes DeSantis took on budget resolutions between 2013 and 2015. DeSantis did vote on nonbinding budget resolutions that called for raising the retirement age and slowing the rate at which future spending would grow. Whether that is a ""cut"" is debatable. Putnam’s campaign cited three votes DeSantis cast in favor of budget proposals by the Republican Study Committee in 2013, 2014 and 2015. All three were considered the more conservative budget proposals, and all three failed. The first thing to know about budget resolutions is that even if they pass, they aren’t law. ""Resolutions themselves do nothing to change law, do nothing to change benefit levels,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""All they do is set out a plan."" An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget stated that the 2013 budget plan transitioned Medicare to a premium support system by 2019 for new beneficiaries, and raised the Medicare retirement age to 70 and indexed it to life expectancy. It also included this policy statement: ""Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or near retirement."" For Social Security, the proposal called for switching to another method for cost of living adjustments economists consider more accurate, known as chained CPI, and increasing the full retirement age to 70 and indexing it for life expectancy. The budget would have led to savings relative to the baseline of $129 billion in Medicare and $126 billion in Social Security over 10 years. The legislation would have balanced the budget in four years, as opposed to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan, which set out to balance the budget in 10 years. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget referred to these savings as ""cuts"" but that requires further explanation. To determine whether this resolution would have actually led to a cut would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that actually became law. It’s possible to reduce future without cutting benefits seniors are getting today, Goldwein said. For example, the government could cut what it pays to providers. The proposed change to use chained CPI for inflation would not lower seniors’ Social Security checks. It would mean that their checks grow at a slower rate in the future. Putnam’s ad omits that we face some challenges in funding these programs in the future. Projections show that both Medicare and Social Security lack fiscal balance. It’s likely Congress will have to make changes to current law in the coming years. While it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both, said Eugene Steuerle, a tax expert at the Urban Institute. ""The growth that is built into the systems like Social Security and Medicare is unsustainable,"" he said. The Republican Study Committee tried to acknowledge the problem of future insolvency, calling for Congress to come up with a plan to protect the program and those in or near retirement. DeSantis doesn’t support changes to Social Security or Medicare for current recipients or those nearing retirement, said his office spokeswoman Elizabeth Dillon. She pointed to his effort to help seniors by reintroducing the Let Seniors Work Act in 2015, which sought to eliminate the payroll taxes for seniors. A Putnam TV ad said, ""Congressman DeSantis voted to cut Social Security and Medicare"" and ""voted to increase the retirement age."" DeSantis voted for three Republican Study Committee budget resolutions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 that failed. Even if they had passed, nonbinding resolutions alone do not change law, and therefore don’t cut any seniors’ benefits. Whether a vote for the resolutions is a ""cut"" depends upon how you define a cut. They were a cut in terms of the programs’ future growth relative to the baseline. But the goal of these resolutions was to persuade Congress to make changes to shore up these programs in the future to avoid steeper cuts down the road.

Retaliatory tariffs take heavy toll on U.S. farmers
","As President Donald Trump’s trade war wages on, we decided to check in on the most affected sectors. U.S. Agriculture Department Secretary Sonny Perdue said farmers, who will receive $12 billion in aid, were particularly affected by the dispute. ""America’s hard-working agricultural producers have been treated unfairly by China’s illegal trading practices and have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs,"" Perdue said in a USDA press release on July 26. We’ll leave aside the question of whether the retaliatory tariffs are any more illegal than the initial U.S. tariffs on imports. But we were interested in the second half of his claim: Have agricultural producers taken a disproportionate hit? The Agriculture Department pointed out that 37 percent of U.S. exports facing retaliatory tariffs are agricultural exports. Those are the tariffs as of July 31, 2018 coming from China, the European Union, India, Turkey, Mexico and Canada. That’s disproportionate to the total goods the United State exports: about 10 percent are agricultural goods, according to the USDA’s 2017 data. It’s hard to measure the exact numbers, though. That’s because tariffs are listed individually by the governments that issue them (in this case, not the United States), and because the United States doesn’t keep close tabs on exports. USDA calculated the 37 percent figure using official import customs data from the retaliating partner through a private third party, Global Trade Atlas. ""Export data is notoriously bad,"" Laura Baughman, president of the Trade Partnership, told us in July. ""It’s inaccurate because people don’t necessarily report it very carefully, since you are not assessing tariffs on exports."" However, the agricultural industry is on average much more dependent on world markets than other industries, according to David Laborde, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. Exports comprise 10 percent of total GDP in the United States, whereas they comprise about 20 percent of GDP in the American agricultural sector. That fraction is even higher for crops like cotton (76 percent is exported), soybeans (50 percent) and wheat (46 percent), according to USDA. About 16 to 17 percent of exports to China are agricultural goods, so any conflict with China (like the ongoing one) takes a heavy toll on agriculture, Laborde said. He calculated that 86.8 percent of agricultural exports to China are impacted by retaliatory tariffs while 36.9 percent of the non-agricultural exports are covered. Farmers face two additional aggravators: their products are easily replaceable and they’re an easy political target. One ton of U.S. soybeans is a nearly perfect substitute to one ton of Brazilian soybeans, Laborde pointed out. But high-tech medical equipment (another type of products exported to China) is difficult to substitute, so Chinese consumers are more willing to endure the tariff. And from a political economy point of view, Laborde said it made sense for China to maintain pressure on farmers in particular, as a core constituency for the Trump administration. Perdue said, ""America’s hard-working agricultural producers … have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs."" It’s difficult to measure the impact of tariffs on the economy and particularly hard to measure the impact of retaliatory tariffs on exports. That said, the economy sets up agricultural producers to bear the brunt of tariffs. Exports are doubly important for the agricultural sector’s GDP as for the country’s GDP. USDA calculated that 37 percent of exports facing tariffs are agricultural goods, whereas agricultural goods comprise 10 percent of total exports.

Wisconsin GOP takes jabs at Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell
","As eight Democrats fight for the right to take on Gov. Scott Walker in November, the state Republican Party is throwing its own punches from the sidelines. Their latest jab came in the form of an Aug. 1, 2018, news release announcing a series of radio ads against four Democrats running for governor. The ads pick up some of the same themes found on a party-created webpage that slams the ""Democrats’ dangerous race to the left."" Here’s what the GOP has to say about Mahlon Mitchell, head of the statewide firefighters union: ""Mitchell received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund."" So, it’s a double shot. Let’s look at both parts of the claim -- the ""massive raise"" and the ""personal political slush fund."" Compensation increase When asked for evidence to back up this part of the statement, state GOP communications director Alec Zimmerman referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Jan. 22, 2018, piece by watchdog columnist Dan Bice in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The online headline: ""Firefighter leader Mahlon Mitchell would take pay cut if elected governor."" The piece noted that Mitchell was named president of the state firefighters group early in 2011 in the wake of a scandal in which top union officials were filing fraudulent expense reports. Specifically, Zimmerman cited this paragraph: Since taking the union's helm, Mitchell has seen his pay jump from $54,500 in 2011 to $90,600 in 2016 (plus another $6,787 in other income) — a 66% bump, according to federal Department of Labor filings. His predecessor made about half what Mitchell does. PolitiFact Wisconsin checked the firefighter union’s Department of Labor filings for 2017 and found there had been another increase. Those filings show Mitchell’s 2017 union compensation  at $70,922, plus $31,727 for disbursements for official business and an additional $12,431 for other disbursements for a total of $115,080. So, Mitchell’s overall union compensation went from $97,387 in 2016 to $115,080 in 2017, an increase of about 18 percent. When compared to $54,500 when he began in 2011, his union compensation has increased to $115,080 in 2017, or about 111 percent over six years. While there is no official definition for a ""massive pay raise,"" Mitchell’s union compensation increase of 111 percent from 2011 to 2017 compares to an 18.3 percent increase in base pay for an entry level Madison firefighter during that same period. According to the City of Madison Fire Department website, an entry level firefighter is currently paid $50,204.70. In 2011, an entry level firefighter salary was $42,449.16. ""Since he’s working at a Union funded by the dues of firefighters, it’s accurate to say that his raises were funded by their contributions,"" said Zimmerman. Still, framing it as on the ""backs of hard-working firefighters"" goes a little too far in that it portrays it as something imposed on union members. Steve Wilding, secretary/treasurer of the state firefighters union, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in January 2018 that salaries and per-diems for the union's brass are voted on by the nearly 200 delegates at the group's annual convention. (Note: Mitchell’s pay from the City of Madison is not included in this discussion because the state GOP allegations are specifically addressing compensation from ""hard-working firefighters"" not city taxpayers.) Political spending On the ""political slush fund"" part of the claim, Zimmerman provided spreadsheets that showed, in his words, that the union’s political spending under Mitchell shifted to ""being overwhelmingly supportive of liberal causes while he was at the helm, including over $40,000 to Mahlon’s campaigns."" We turned to Follow The Money, a website that is part of the National Institute on Money in Politics, which compiles campaign-donor, lobbyist, and other information from government agencies nationwide. The site shows that the Wisconsin Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin has made an overwhelming majority of its contributions to Democratic candidates over the years, including Gov. Jim Doyle, Mary P. Burke and yes, Mahlon Mitchell, who in 2012 unsuccessfully ran for the office of lieutenant governor in a recall election against Rebecca Kleefisch. The union has also contributed to GOP candidates, such as Scott Walker and Brad Schimel, though the amount of the donations to the Republican candidates have fallen far short of the donations to Democrats. According to the Journal Sentinel January article, since 2011 to that point, the firefighter union's political action fund had donated a total of $129,250 to state candidates and PACs, with 98% of the cash going to Democrats. Also, during Mitchell's 2012 lieutenant governor's bid, the firefighters PAC gave $3,500 to his campaign and the union itself donated $40,000 to an outside group backing Mitchell with independent expenditures, the Journal Sentinel reported in the January article. Mitchell had no role, officials said, in the spending of these union funds, having recused himself on the matter. In the current campaign, a U.S. Department of Labor website listing shows the union contributed $25,000 to Mahlon Mitchell for Wisconsin on Nov. 13, 2017, and $15,444 on Nov. 30, 2017, for a total of $40,444. But what of the ""slush fund"" characterisation? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines ""slush fund"" as ""a fund for bribing public officials or carrying on corruptive propaganda; an unregulated fund often used for illicit purposes."" While there is plenty of hyperbole in politics, in our view this goes too far. For instance, there are no allegations that contribution limits were ignored or any campaign finance laws broken. What’s more, there is no evidence that Mitchell alone decides where the union contributions go. In January, when the state GOP first made the ""slush fund"" allegation, Wilding -- the union secretary/treasurer --  told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the union’s bylaws and constitution prevent individuals from enriching themselves at the expense of other members. In an Aug. 8 Journal Sentinel article, Wilding noted to columnist Dan Bice that Mitchell’s base compensation dropped from some $90,000 in 2016 to $70,000 in 2017. Wilding said top union officials are paid a small salary and a payment for services performed for the organization on a day-by-day basis.  Meanwhile, Mitchell’s campaign communications director Kirsten Allen responded with a general slam on Walker. Allen did not provide a response when asked in a series of emails and telephone calls to address the specific issues that are part of this factcheck.
  Our rating The state GOP says Mitchell ""received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund."" The union members did OK the compensation increase, so saying it was ""on the backs"" of firefighters goes too far. But Mitchell’s 111 percent increase over a period of about six years is a major one. So the GOP has a point on that part of the claim. Meanwhile, the union’s political contributions have shifted to Democrats, including more than $40,000 to Mitchell’s current campaign. But the GOP provided no evidence Mitchell solely decides where the political contributions go. Indeed, the union says he recuses himself from any discussions. Even with an allowance for the hyperbole of campaign season, the ""slush fund"" characterization goes too far.

Romney claims Obama's actions on Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo run counter to his campaign positions
","In his recently released book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate Mitt Romney unloads on President Barack Obama. So on the Today Show on March 2, 2010, host Matt Lauer opened up his interview of Romney by asking if Obama has done anything right in the last year. ""No question about it,"" Romney said. ""He's done several things well. Most of those things are places where he changed his view from where he had during the campaign. So, for instance, he's left our troops in Iraq, and they're being more successful there. He boosted our effort in Afghanistan, which is the right course to take. He did not close Guantanamo, thank heavens."" That's about as backhanded a compliment as you can give. Romney says the things Obama has done right are essentially all things he has changed position on since the presidential campaign. Has he? We'll tackle these one by one. First: Troop levels in Iraq Eric Fehrnstrom, a spokesman for Romney, noted that during the campaign, Obama routinely claimed the controversial troop surge in Iraq was a failure. For example, in a July 17, 2007, interview with USA Today, Obama said, ""Here's my view on the situation. There are two indisputable facts, and then there's a choice. Fact No. 1: The surge is not working. It has not changed the dynamics on the ground. It has put more U.S. troops at risk. It has not strengthened the Iraqi government. It has not quelled the antagonism between the various factions, and it has not lessened the strength of the insurgency."" But Obama never said he would immediately pull all of the U.S. troops out of Iraq. To the contrary, Obama said in that very same interview that he would withdraw troops ""in a gradual fashion."" As for how quickly the troops should leave, Obama's campaign Web site said: ""Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, for example, Obama said, ""As soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed."" Obama also stressed repeatedly that he would strongly consider the recommendations of his commanders on the ground before removing any troops. So that was Obama's position in the campaign. Now, what has he done as president? As it turns out, the drawdown of troops actually began before Obama took office. President George W. Bush began to reduce troop levels in June 2008, a full six months before Obama was sworn in. But Obama has continued on that path of reducing troop levels. When Obama took office, the troop level in Iraq was about 137,000. It has steadily declined to its current level of 96,000, said Maj. Shawn Turner, a spokesman for the Department of Defense. In a formal announcement of a new Iraq strategy at Camp Lejeune, a Marine Corps base in North Carolina, on Feb. 27, 2009, Obama said the United States will remove all combat troops from Iraq by Aug. 31, 2010. Obama said he planned to keep 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel in Iraq through 2011 for the purpose of ""training, equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain nonsectarian; conducting targeted counterterrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq."" Not only is the plan to remove combat troops on schedule, it's actually ahead of schedule, U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno said at a Pentagon press conference on Feb. 22, 2010. ""The original plan had us to be at about 115,000 today, and right now we're at 96(,000),"" Odierno said. ""So we're about 20,000 ahead of where we thought we would be when we originally built the plan, and that's based on what we've seen and what we think we need."" Michael O'Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said that with regard to Obama's stance on Iraq, he would ""tend to agree with Gov. Romney to an extent -- though even here, it must be acknowledged, the plan that Obama inherited (and yes we're still on target) reduces forces reasonably fast. So in that regard, President Bush adopted a plan at the end of his presidency that pushed for fairly fast troop reductions -- not as fast as Obama proposed, but faster than had been expected. In other words, while Obama did change his thinking, the situation also evolved and made Obama's plan appear less radical and less different from Bush's than it once had."" When Romney said Obama had changed positions from his campaign because he's ""left our troops in Iraq, and they're being more successful there,"" it presumes that Obama said in the campaign that he would immediately remove combat troops, or that he would remove them faster than he has. We don't think that's backed up in Obama's campaign statements. The repeated mantra of Obama's campaign regarding Iraq was largely that he would initiate a drawdown of combat forces in Iraq within about 16 months. The plan to remove forces by the end of August is a couple of months past that deadline, but it's awfully close. And now, Gen. Odierno says the withdrawal plan is even a little ahead of schedule. We think it's unfair to suggest that Obama's actions as president radically depart from his position during the campaign. Second: Boosting the effort in Afghanistan To back up Romney's claim that Obama has changed his view on Afghanistan, Romney's spokesman Fehrnstrom pointed to a quote Obama gave to McClatchy News Service on July 26, 2008. ""I'm not here to lay out a comprehensive military strategy,"" Obama said regarding Afghanistan. ""That's the job of our commanders on the ground. I can tell you what our strategic goals should be. They should be relatively modest. We shouldn't want to take over the country. We should want to get out of there as quickly as we can and help the Afghans govern themselves and provide for their own security."" We note that the quote continues: ""Our critical goal should be to make sure that the Taliban and al-Qaida are routed and that they cannot project threats against us from that region. And to do that, I think we need more troops."" As a candidate, Obama promised to send ""at least"" two additional brigades to Afghanistan. And he repeatedly said during the campaign that Afghanistan required more troops and attention than it was receiving from the Bush administration. He said the United States ""had taken our eye off the ball"" by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan. At one point, the Obama campaign even mocked the McCain campaign for following Obama's lead on increasing troop levels in Afghanistan. Shortly after becoming president, Obama did, indeed, order that two additional brigades be sent to Afghanistan. And then on Dec. 1, 2009, Obama ordered an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. In January 2009, the troop level in Afghanistan was 34,000. Today, it's 78,000. Yes, Obama once said that strategic goals in Afghanistan should be ""relatively modest,"" but to say that Obama's orders for more troops as president is a change in position from his campaign stance ignores Obama's many statements that more troops were needed and that greater focus needed to be placed on Afghanistan. ""Obama had always pledged to do more, and now he has tripled forces relative to what President Bush had in place at the end of 2008,"" O'Hanlon said. Third: Closing Guantanamo Here, Romney's spokesman Fehrnstrom pointed to an executive order Obama signed on his second day in office, directing the Central Intelligence Agency to shut what remains of its network of secret prisons and ordering the closing of the Guantánamo detention camp in Cuba within a year. Soon after, however, Obama's plan began to meet resistance, most notably from members of his own party who stripped millions of dollars to shutter the facility from a war funding bill. Finding a place to put the more than 200 detainees has remained an ongoing political struggle. The self-imposed year deadline came and went, and the facility is still very much open. So is this a departure from Obama's campaign stance, as Romney said? Actually no. During the campaign, Obama never talked about a one-year timeline. He only said he would close the facility. The one-year timeline surfaced after Obama was sworn in as president. And the Obama administration certainly has made progress toward its ultimate goal of closing Guantanamo. On Oct. 15, 2009, the House of Representatives voted to allow some prisoners there to be temporarily transferred to the United States for prosecution. And the Obama administration has identified a prison in Thomson, Ill., that it hopes to acquire and renovate for detainees now at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Officials are working out details for funding the plan. The Senate seems amenable to the idea; in November, the Senate rejected a measure to restrict funds for the facility. There's still a long way to go before the facility is closed, but we think Obama has made enough progress that we have rated his campaign promise to close the facility In the Works. So to sum up, while Romney offered backhanded praise for Obama's actions with regard to troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the failure to close Guantanamo, Romeny said those were all issues on which Obama changed his view from the campaign. We don't find that's accurate in any of the cases. In fact, Obama has not strayed very far from the views he expressed during the campaign. We rule Romney's statement False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/02/mitt-romney/romney-claims-obamas-actions-iraq-afghanistan-and-/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Greenspan gave approval to tax cuts only if deficits were tamed
","On the same day that President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., were talking about health care at the president's health care summit, two other former presidential candidates -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- faced off over government spending.The occasion was Clinton's testimony at a House committee hearing on the 2011 budget for the State Department on Feb. 25, 2010. Paul asked her about spending money to build a new embassy in London. Paul argued that the new embassy amounts to more debt spending.First, we should mention that Paul's foreign policy outlook is noninterventionist, generally opposing foreign spending and arguing that the United States should not intervene abroad. During the 2008 campaign for president, he spoke often about his opposition to the war in Iraq, to the point of drawing occasional boos from Republican audiences.At the hearing, Paul said, ""Here in the Congress, everybody justifies all their spending -- people here justify the domestic spending, people justify the overseas spending and the war spending, and they worry about a lack of bipartisanship. I worry about too much, because they get together and they enjoy spending both places, and nobody cares about the deficit,"" Paul said. Responding to Paul's concerns about the embassy project, Clinton said that the State Department was selling some its London properties, adding that the new embassy would be built with the proceeds of those sales.But she also aimed a zinger at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- someone Paul is no fan of.""I take very seriously your larger point, congressman,"" Clinton said. ""It breaks my heart that 10 years ago we had a balanced budget, that we were on the way to paying down the debt of the United States of America. I served on the Budget Committee in the Senate, and I remember as vividly as if it were yesterday, when we had a hearing in which Alan Greenspan came and justified increasing spending and cutting taxes, saying that we didn't really need to pay down the debt -- outrageous in my view."" We were interested in the accuracy of Clinton's recollection.We confirmed Clinton's claim that 10 years ago, the country had budget surpluses, and that various prognosticators, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, projected surpluses for years to come. (It's important to note that a budget surplus applies only to a single year. There was still significant public debt from previous years -- about $5.7 trillion.)At the time, Congress was considering a number of policy options. President George W. Bush, who had just been sworn into office, was proposing significant tax cuts.It was at this point that Greenspan testified about the budget outlook and Bush's proposed 2001 tax cuts before the Senate Budget Committee, which included Clinton, then a newly elected junior senator from New York.Greenspan talked at length in his central banker language, saying things like this: ""Continuing to run surpluses beyond the point at which we reach zero or near-zero federal debt brings to center stage the critical longer term fiscal policy issue of whether the federal government should accumulate large quantities of private -- more technically, nonfederal -- assets. At zero debt, the continuing unified budget surpluses currently projected imply a major accumulation of private assets by the federal government. ... This development should factor materially into the policies you and the administration choose to pursue.""In plain language, Greenspan was saying that the government shouldn't collect more taxes than it needs to run the government, and tax cuts might be a good idea. In fact, headlines the day after his testimony read, ""In Policy Change, Greenspan backs a broad tax cut,"" and ""Greenspan supports a tax cut; Fed chairman says surpluses changed his mind.""But at no point did Greenspan say that we didn't really need to pay down the debt. In fact, he went out of his way to say that tax cuts were only appropriate because the federal government appeared to be on its way to paying off all of the public debt. He also added a cautionary note: ""With today's euphoria surrounding the surpluses, it is not difficult to imagine the hard-earned fiscal restraint developed in recent years rapidly dissipating. We need to resist those policies that could readily resurrect the deficits of the past and the fiscal imbalances that followed in their wake.""Clinton appears to have held a contrary interpretation of Greenspan's testimony for some time. In 2005, at another committee hearing, Clinton confronted Greenspan about his previous remarks. At this point, the 2001 tax cuts had become law, as had a second round of cuts in 2003, and the United States was spending large sums on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I can remember serving on the Budget Committee four years ago, in the spring of 2001, when your testimony helped blow the lid off the lockboxes when it came to the size of the tax cut, the extent of the tax cut,"" Clinton said. ""In addition to the tax cuts, without the real opportunity to continue to pay down the debt and the deficit, we did away with the pay-go rule, so we essentially have, you know, been in a free fall ever since, and we are still in that free fall. And I think that your testimony today is a little nostalgic for me, and I regret that we're in the position we're in.""Greenspan, though, told her he never suggested that deficits were a good thing:""I actually went back and reviewed the testimony that I gave in January of 2001, and we were confronted at that time with an almost universal expectation amongst experts that we were dealing with a very large surplus for which there seemed to be no end. And that was true of the best analysts in OMB (Office of Budget and Management), in the Congressional Budget Office, in the Federal Reserve. ... I argued back then that excessive budget deficits and excessive on-budget surpluses distorted the private system, and we should try and eliminate that. I did indicate that we should have a scheduled tax cut. And the reason for that was in order to reduce the surplus. I also indicated that there was the possibility -- indeed the language is fairly strong in some cases -- that we may be fooling ourselves that in fact deficits are coming back. And I therefore recommended that we have some form of trigger to readjust if indeed that happens. And subsequently, I've been a very strong supporter of pay-go. So in all tax cuts and all expenditure increases, I have held the position that we have to pay for them one way or another, or we're creating serious problems.""In reviewing the record, we find that Clinton's statement contains a little bit of truth. Ten years ago, the country was on the way to paying down its debt. Clinton is correct that Greenspan, at a pivotal moment, testified that the 2001 tax cuts were acceptable. His testimony was widely perceived as an endorsement of the tax cuts and received significant press coverage. But Greenspan never suggested that ""we didn't really need to pay down the debt."" Rather, he clearly said that continuing deficits were not good and that the federal government should practice fiscal discipline. And he reiterated that view in 2005. So we rate Clinton's statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/02/hillary-clinton/greenspan-gave-approval-tax-cuts-only-if-deficits-/

GOP says Alan Grayson likens Dick Cheney to a vampire and U.S. health care system to the Holocaust
","U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, is a provocateur. He claimed Republicans' approach to health care was to urge people to ""die quickly."" Many Democrats love him because he's so blunt. And now, many Republicans love him -- because he's so blunt. On Feb. 26, 2010, the state Republican Party criticized a Grayson fundraiser that included Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank.The headline:""You Are Cordially Invited to a Night of Shameless Promotion, Crude Remarks and Drug Busts with Congressmen Alan Grayson and Barney Frank.""In the release, RPOF spokeswoman Katie Betta makes a series of claims against Grayson. For this fact-check, we'll examine two. Betta said Grayson ""compared a former vice president to a vampire ... and compared America's health care system to the Holocaust."" ""Over the last two years Alan Grayson has certainly made a name for himself in our nation’s capital, but instead of being recognized for his work for the people of Florida, he stands out as a quirky, irreverent embarrassment to his constituents and to the entire state of Florida,” Betta said. Let's take the vampire claim first. Betta is referencing an Oct. 22, 2009, interview Grayson had with Chris Matthews on MSNBC. At the end of the interview -- which is about health care -- Matthews brings up that former Vice President Dick Cheney had complained that President Barack Obama was dithering.That prompted this exchange (video attached here).GRAYSON: ""Well, my response is -- and, by the way, I have trouble listening to what he says sometimes because of the blood that drips from his teeth while he's talking. But my response is this. He's just angry because the president doesn't shoot old men in the face. By the way, when he was done speaking, did he just then turn into a bat and fly away?""MATTHEWS: ""Oh, God, we've got to keep it level here. Let me ask you this. Don't you have any Republican friends?""GRAYSON: ""Some of my best friends are Republicans.""While Grayson doesn't ever use the word ""vampire,"" he says that Cheney has ""blood that drips from his teeth,"" and that he can ""turn into a bat and fly away."" We've seen enough cheesy horror films to know what he was going for there.As for the claim that Grayson compared the health care system to the Holocaust, Florida Republicans point to remarks Grayson made on the House floor during the health care debate.You might recall, Republicans asked that Grayson apologize after accusing Republicans of wanting people to ""die quickly.""Here was part of that apology. (Video here.)""Well, I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize to the dead, and here's why. According to this study, 'Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults,' which was published two weeks ago, 44,789 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance. So I call upon the Democratic members of the House. I call upon the Republican members of the House. I call upon all of us to do our jobs for the sake of America, for the sake of those dying people and their families. I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.""By capitalizing the ""H"" in their press release, state Republicans are claiming Grayson compared America's health care system to the killing of European Jews and others during World War II. But, based on how he said it, Grayson is most likely using the word with a small ""h,"" which is not specific to the World War II genocide. In our view, the two uses have different meanings. The World War II ""Holocaust"" conveys a deliberate, horrific killing because of religion. While the uncapitalized ""holocaust"" is a broader term.  State Republicans got it right when they say Grayson has compared a former vice president to a vampire, but it's a stretch for their press release to liken American's health care system to the Holocaust of World War II.

"['Economy', 'Housing', 'Florida', 'Kendrick Meek']","
Florida home foreclosure rate among the worst in the U.S.
","It's become a common refrain for Florida candidates: The state has one of the nation's highest foreclosure rates. Kendrick Meek, a member of Congress from South Florida and a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, mentions the foreclosure problem on his campaign Web site. ""The housing crisis is one of the most critical issues facing Florida. Kendrick Meek believes more needs to be done to help Floridians in danger of losing their homes. Currently, one in five Florida families are one or more months behind in their mortgage payments, and the state has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the nation. Home values have dropped, leaving those who are able to keep their homes often owing more than their home is worth,"" writes Meek. We know the problem is more severe in Florida, but we wanted to know if Meek was right that the state has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the country. The campaign said it relied primarily on a January 2009 report issued by RealtyTrac, a company that keeps data on foreclosed properties. That report highlights Florida as having both the second-highest number of foreclosed homes and the second-highest foreclosure rate (a subtle but important difference). The campaign also pointed us to South Florida Sun Sentinel article from December 2009 and a January 2010 Bay News 9 report that both say the same thing.  We started by checking the RealtyTrac report, which was released Jan. 15, 2009, and covers foreclosure statistics for 2008. Indeed, it put Florida in second place in both total foreclosed homes and the foreclosure rate. But that report is now more than a year old.RealtyTrac's monthly reports since then have varied slightly, but Florida is always near the top. It was fourth for January 2009, third in April and second in November. For all of 2009, Florida ranked third.So Meek is either right or close to being right, depending what time period you use.

"['Stimulus', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Crist the only Republican to campaign with Obama for stimulus, Rubio claims
","We've noticed a pattern in Marco Rubio's charges about Gov. Charlie Crist. Sometimes he criticizes Crist for supporting the stimulus. Other times, he criticizes Crist for supporting the stimulus and mentions that Crist hugged a Democrat who supported the stimulus (the president). And sometimes, he criticizes Crist for supporting the stimulus, mentions that Crist hugged a Democrat who supported it, and says Crist took the legs out from under Republicans who were pushing for an alternative.We suspect Rubio might repeat the attack one or two more times before the August primary.Here's a typical Rubio claim, from his Feb. 17, 2010 appearance on Fox News.""Charlie Crist was the only prominent Republican in the country to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, on behalf of the stimulus,"" Rubio told interviewer Martha MacCallum.Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly called the stimulus, Feb. 13, 2009. The president signed the bill into law four days later at an event in Denver. (You can read PolitiFact's work about the stimulus here.)And as most everyone in Florida knows by now, Crist supported passing the stimulus, lobbied members of the state's congressional delegation to vote for it, and appeared at a town hall meeting with Obama in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009. Crist earned our Pants On Fire rating for claiming that he ""didn't endorse"" the stimulus.In the Fox interview, Rubio attempted to set some pretty specific boundaries to his claim. The key phrases for us are ""prominent Republican,"" ""campaign with,"" and ""before the stimulus passed.""So by Rubio's logic, while California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did support the stimulus, and continues to defend it, he never physically campaigned with Obama to drum up support for the bill. Connecticut Republican Gov. Jodi Rell also supported the stimulus -- she along with Schwarzenegger, Crist and Vermont Republican Gov. Jim Douglas signed a letter urging its passage -- but like Schwarzenegger, Rell did not appear at a rally with Obama.We're not sure if it's completely fair to exclude those Republicans, but as we chew on that, let's see what else is out there.Before the stimulus passed Congress on Feb. 13, Obama held five campaign-style events: We scoured the transcripts for each event looking for signs of Republican support. One of the Illinois events included Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman. But LaHood is Obama's transportation secretary, so he really doesn't count. That event also included Republican U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock. But Schock voted against the stimulus bill. Indiana's town hall included Michigan GOP Rep. Fred Upton, but like Schock, he voted against the stimulus. That leaves Crist's appearance with Obama in Fort Myers.""I want to give a special thanks to your Governor, Charlie Crist, for joining us here today,"" Obama said at the Fort Myers rally. ""The thing about governors is they understand our economic crisis in a way that maybe sometimes folks a little more removed don't understand. They're on the front lines dealing with the economy every single day. They're having to make choices about the budget every single day. They know what it means to balance a budget when revenues are short and more and more people are asking for help. And Governor Crist shares my conviction that creating jobs and turning this economy around is a mission that transcends party. And when the town is burning, you don't check party labels -- everybody needs to grab a hose. And that's what Charlie Crist is doing right here today.""But that's not the only campaigning Obama did.On Feb. 2, 2009, Obama hosted Vermont's Douglas at the White House to discuss the stimulus. Before the meeting, Douglas and Obama spoke briefly to reporters. Here's part of what Douglas had to say:""The House of Representatives has passed a bill, and we look forward to working with your administration, with the senators and members of the House to fashion a piece of legislation that fulfills the goals that we have articulated. ""I know there are some differences of opinion on some of the elements. And if I were writing it, it might be a little different. If you were writing it, it might be a little different. But the essence of a recovery package is essential to get our nation's economy moving.""Douglas' comments were carried on cable news channels and included in an Associated Press story and later were picked up by the New York Times in a front-page article. (You can watch the interaction here. Sorry, no hug.)Douglas recently talked about his support for the stimulus with CNN.""What I said then is what I think most governors believe, that we might like it a little different,"" he told CNN's Candy Crowley. ""Frankly, I was hoping there would be a little more for infrastructure, but -- but it was a package of relief that the states need urgently at a time when our state budgets were collapsing and we were facing the prospect of drastic cuts in state services or increases in taxes that wouldn't be fair or sustainable. So a recovery package was appropriate to stimulate the economy at that time last year.""That prompted Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was on the same same show with Douglas, to jump in. ""Jim (Douglas) was -- Jim was great on this,"" Patrick, a Democrat, said. ""As was Governor Crist -- very, very helpful.""And that brings us back to Rubio's boundaries.Is Douglas prominent? As one of 24 Republican governors, Douglas certainly qualifies. Did he campaign with Obama? They held a media availability that was broadcast on CNN and CNBC. Was it before the stimulus passed? No doubt about it.We should note that Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins , announced their support for the stimulus on Feb. 6, 2009, a week before the bill was passed. But they, like Schwarzenegger and Rell, did not attend any of the five campaign-style events.Yes, Republicans overwhelmingly opposed the federal stimulus bill. Not one House Republican voted for it. And at least five Republican governors -- including Sarah Palin of Alaska and Rick Perry of Texas -- urged the bill's defeat.But Rubio is stretching the truth by portraying Crist as a lone wolf.Four Republican governors announced their support of the stimulus, and three Republican senators (the third being then-Republican Arlen Specter) voted for the bill. The distinction with Crist is that Obama decided to hold a rally in Florida and not California. Rubio said Crist was the ""only prominent Republican in the country to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, on behalf of the stimulus."" But Obama met with Vermont's Republican governor who then promoted the stimulus in nationally televised remarks. So while Rubio is right that Crist was an unusual Republican leader in endorsing the stimulus at a public event, he is wrong to say Crist was the only one.

Wasserman Schultz says Republicans regularly say they agree with 80 percent of health care bill
","On the Feb. 28, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., urged congressional Republicans to join negotiations over a health care bill, citing what she said were their own past statements about the health care reform process.""The Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill,"" she said. ""And, at the end of the day, what we need to do is sit down and negotiate over the differences on the 20 percent. The Republicans right now are focused all about regaining power. They don't have any interest in us accomplishing comprehensive health care reform. That's been evident. There isn't anyone that is saying, 'Come on, let's just work this out.' What they're saying is, 'Start over.' 'Start over,' the American people understand, means, 'Do nothing.' ""The part that caught our eye was her claim that ""Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill.""We wish we could have tested whether there actually is 80 percent agreement between the parties on health care, but we couldn't think of a way to pull it off. So we'll do the next best thing and see whether Wasserman Schultz is correct that Republicans have made this argument repeatedly.Wasserman Schultz is in good Democratic company in making a claim of wide bipartisan agreement on health care. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., once put the level of agreement at 90 percent, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., put the figure at ""at least 80, 85 percent."" Most notably, President Barack Obama used the figure near the close of his Sept. 9, 2009, health care address to Congress, saying that ""there is agreement in this chamber on about 80 percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been.""We can see why Democrats seeking to pass a health care bill would like to play up the common ground they share with their political rivals. But what about Republicans? Using Lexis-Nexis and Google, we looked through news coverage, transcripts and news releases to see if Republicans had indeed invoked the 80 percent figure with any frequency.We'll start with a caveat. Wasserman Schultz referred to agreeing ""with 80 percent of what's in our bill."" To some, that suggests she's referring to the bill in her own chamber, the House. In the examples we found, it's sometimes hard to tell which of the various Democratic proposals a speaker is referring to. But we do think that Wasserman Schultz could just as easily have been speaking as a Democrat, rather than a House member, when she used the term ""our"" bill.So we'll note two instances -- the first two listed below -- that fit the strict definition of referring to the House bill after passage, as well as four others in which Republicans were talking about Democratic bills more generally.• Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La. Boustany -- a physician who was tapped by Republicans to deliver the response to President Barack Obama's Sep. 9, 2009, address to Congress on health care -- issued a news release on Feb. 25, 2010, after the conclusion of the president's Blair House health care summit, which Boustany attended as a delegate.In the statement, Boustany said, ""Most Democrats, Independents and Republicans do agree on 80 percent of the solutions to bring down health care costs, but these bills focus where we disagree. Rather, we should scrap these bills, like the American people want us to, and focus on bringing down health costs. As a doctor, I know people want to buy insurance across state lines, pool together to get a better price and limit frivolous lawsuits -- all of these will lower costs, and they can be done in a simple way. Unfortunately, Democrats' 2,000-plus page bills complicate health care instead of lowering costs when families struggle to make ends meet.""• Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio. On Jan. 21, 2010, LaTourette, an eight-term House member, took to the House floor and said, ""Let's get a bill. Let's get something done on the 80 percent that we can agree about. We can fight for the rest of the couple years on the 20 percent we don't. But let's get something done for the American people.""• Gov. Haley Barbour, R-Miss. On the Nov. 8, 2009, edition of Meet the Press, two politicians -- Barbour and Gov. Ed Rendell, D-Pa. -- both cited the 80 percent. Taking his cue from Rendell, who first cited the percentage, host David Gregory asked Barbour whether it's ""a problem, politically, for Republicans to be the party of 'No'"" on a health care bill.Barbour responded, ""Well, I think, first of all, most people in America don't want this. So to be the people that defeat it will be popular. But Ed said something very important -- 60 percent, 80 percent of the things that we talk about in health care could have passed the House last night 400 to 20. But instead the (Democratic) leadership chose not to stop there but to try to cram down the country's throat a government-run health care system that CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says it's going to drive up health insurance premiums. ... Yes, we could have a very good health care reform bill that will pass overwhelmingly, but about 10 things in here wouldn't be included.""• Wisconsin Republican Party. On Oct. 9, 2009, the Wisconsin Republican Party issued a press release titled, ""The Truth About Democrat's (sic) Health Care Experiment."" The release said in part, ""Both parties agree on 80 percent of these common-sense health care reforms and these ideas could quickly pass if Democrats began working with Republicans on these issues.""• Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Cornyn -- a member of the Senate Republican leadership -- said the following on the Sept. 13, 2009, edition of Meet the Press -- and then sent out a news release touting his comments. ""I would suggest,"" Cornyn said, ""that this is a case where the 80/20 rule applies -- that 80 percent of this we could probably agree with, as long as people would agree to leave the 20 percent we can't agree with out.""• Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. On June 11, 2009, several Republican senators held a news conference on health care. Enzi, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was asked by a reporter, ""Senator, you often speak of an 80-20 rule, that if people can agree on the 80 percent, then you -- (off mike). What's the 80 percent that you could see agreement on?"" Enzi acknowledged that the bill emerging from his committee was ""very complicated. ... So if I tried to point out what the 80 percent is, it would take me a real long time. But there is 80 percent there that we can have agreement on.""It's important to note that some think the notion that the parties agree on 80 percent is bunk.""I don't know what that number means. I have no idea how you'd calculate something like that,"" said Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., according to a McClatchy Newspapers column by David Lightman that was titled: ""80 percent agreement on health care? No way that's true.""Lightman also quoted Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, saying, ""I don't see it,"" and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, joking, ""Most of the 80 percent doesn't involve money.""Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., also pointed out a small but potentially significant difference in wording.""Republicans and Democrats probably agree on what 80 percent of the problems are with health care -- but those problems and various solutions are entirely different than agreeing on 80 percent of a bill, especially one to the size, scope and costs that Democrats keep trying to force,"" Dayspring said. He suggested, for instance, that both parties may agree on the need to address pre-existing conditions, to improve access to insurance for small businesses, and to reduce costs. ""Even though there are differences as to the precise remedy or method of the solution, these are issues that could probably be worked out,"" Dayspring said. ""Unfortunately, Democrats ... are fixated on the 20 percent where there will never be agreement, namely a much more expansive government role.""Wasserman Schultz is correct that Republicans have been using the ""80 percent"" talking point. We found at least six examples in which Republicans used it, several in high-profile settings, including two tapings of Meet the Press and a televised House floor speech. But it's unclear in many of those instances what precisely the Republicans are referring to.

Health care reform bill will expand Medicaid, increasing demands on doctors
","Little known fact: The health care bill will open up Medicaid to millions of Americans.The expansion has been overshadowed by debate over the public option, taxes on ""Cadillac"" health care plans, and a litany of other controversial items in the overhaul. But during the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit between President Barack Obama and members of Congress, Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, pointed to the provision as one of his biggest problems with the bill.""It dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients,"" Alexander told Obama in his opening remarks. ""So it's like giving someone a ticket to a bus line where the buses only run half the time.""No one likes to wait for the bus, so we decided to look into Alexander's claim.Currently, Medicaid is available to low-income individuals who are pregnant, disabled, elderly or have children 18 years old or younger; the program covers about 60 million patients. The Senate and House health care bills, and Obama's latest health care proposal, would open up the program to all people under 65 with a low income. The Obama proposal and the Senate bill would offer Medicaid benefits to those with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, while the House version would allow those with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level to enroll. All that would mean a major expansion of the program. Medicaid is funded jointly by the states and the federal government, but administered by the states. So, the proposed expansion has proven particularly controversial among state officials, who say local budgets are already strapped and can't handle additional enrollees. One of the biggest complaints among doctors is that Medicaid reimbursements are already too low. We asked Alexander's office for some information on the statement, and his spokesman, Ryan Loskarn, pointed us to two recent studies about impacts of the potential law change. The first, compiled by the Congressional Budget Office, was published on Dec. 19, 2009, and looked at the impact of the Senate bill's Medicaid expansion provision. The CBO estimated that the expansion would increase the number of enrollees in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program by about 15 million, costing states about $26 billion over 10 years. (CBO does not specify how many of those would be only Medicaid patients, but the experts we spoke with told us that they would make up the vast majority of new enrollees.)The second study was published on Jan. 8, 2010, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to the report, the Senate bill would put 18 million people on the Medicaid beneficiary list. An additional 2 million with employer-sponsored health insurance would enroll in Medicaid for supplemental coverage. So, if anything, Alexander is understating the high end of the overall estimate. Meanwhile, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy, estimated that Medicaid would enroll as many as 17.1 million new beneficiaries under the health care bill. So, by all accounts, Alexander is in the ballpark on how many people would be newly eligible for Medicaid.To back up the second part of Alexander's claim -- that 50 percent of doctors won't see new Medicaid patients -- Alexander's office pointed us to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article about access issues in Medicaid. The story mentioned a 2006 report from the Center for Studying Health System Change that estimated nearly half of doctors have stopped accepting or limited the number of Medicaid patients. According to that 2006 study, about 52 percent of doctors surveyed said they were accepting all new Medicaid patients, while only 21 percent said they were accepting no new patients. Presumably, the rest of the doctors surveyed were limiting to some degree the number of new Medicaid patients they were accepting. So, to say that 50 percent of doctors are accepting no new Medicaid patients based on that study is incorrect, said Alwyn Cassil, the group's director of public affairs. Furthermore, the Center for Studying Health System Change updated those figures in 2009 and provided more detail. Currently, 40.2 percent of doctors are accepting all new Medicaid patients, 12.4 percent are accepting most, 19.2 percent are accepting some, and 28.2 percent are accepting no new patients.Cassil did emphasize the fact that the 2006 study and the 2009 study are hard to compare because the group has changed its survey methods in the last few years. In 2006, for example, the group spoke with doctors over the phone. This time around, they administered a written survey. So, the group doesn't know if the most recent statistics are really worse than they were a few years ago or if patient rejection was simply underreported during the last survey.Nevertheless, Alexander raises a good point, Cassil said. ""It is a valid point to raise, physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients,"" she said. ""If you're going to be throwing another 15 million into the program, you've got to be thinking about that.""Joan Alker, executive director for the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, agreed that Alexander's statement is generally true, but glosses over some important details. ""I would say that certainly, access to physicians is a concern and that there's room for improvement,"" she said. ""But being on Medicaid provides more access to patients,"" than they would get if they had no insurance at all. Alexander's statement ""suggests that having Medicaid is meaningless, which is misleading.""Leighton Ku, a health policy professor at George Washington University, said that those statistics are more nuanced than they seem. First, he pointed out, Medicaid patients surveyed often don't report great difficulty in finding doctors. But more importantly, Medicaid patients tend to be concentrated; there are many doctors that see just a few Medicaid patients, and a handful of clinics that see a lot. So, it's reasonable to think that some doctors aren't seeing new Medicaid patients because there are not many in their area. Finally, he said, many primary care physicians aren't seeing new patients at all, whether they are on Medicaid or have private insurance. In the first part of his statement, Alexander is in the ballpark: Anywhere from 15 to 18 million new patients could enroll in Medicaid if the health care overhaul is put into law. We also found that Alexander's underlying point, that some Medicaid patients might have trouble finding doctors, is a valid concern. But he overstates the percentage of doctors that won't accept new Medicaid patients and based that claim on old data. As a result, we find Alexander's claim to be Half True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/01/lamar-alexander/health-care-reform-expand-Medicaid-doctors/

Hutchison says $1 million spent on lobbying, Perry home costing taxpayers $10,000 a month
","
The competition to be the most conservative Republican candidate for governor has played out on the stump, the Internet and on the airwaves.

In a radio ad that we heard Feb. 24, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison portrays Gov. Rick Perry as a hypocrite, guilty of betraying bedrock conservative principles.
 
Hutchison's ad makes claims about Perry on spending and taxes that we have already investigated. It was another statement that caught our eye: Perry ""spent over a million dollars on D.C. lobbyists asking for more federal money and lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month.""
 
""People who live in $10,000-a-month houses shouldn't throw stones,"" the ads says.

Has Perry spent that much on lobbying and his suburban digs? We decided to check, starting with the lobbying claim.
 
Hutchison's campaign pointed us to newspaper articles about state contracts with two Washington lobby firms that Perry canceled in 2007 after Democratic members of the Texas congressional delegation and others questioned the deals.

The contracts were procured by the state's Office of State-Federal Relations, which is overseen by the governor, lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker. Allison Castle, a spokeswoman for Perry, said the Washington firms were hired to help the Office of State-Federal Relations after its staff was cut almost 60 percent in 2003.

The governor's office estimates that terminating the lobbying contracts saved taxpayers $173,000. But how many state dollars actually went to the firms?

The governor's office told us how long the firms worked for the state and estimated how much they were paid. The Federalist Group, which was first hired by the state in 2003, received about $585,000. Cassidy & Associates, which got its contract in 2005, was paid about $350,000. Together, that's still shy of $1 million.

But Castle said a third D.C. firm, Piper-Rudnick, had a contract with the Office of State-Federal Relations for about six months starting in October 2003. The governor's office estimated that it was paid about $142,000, which brings our running total spent on Washington lobbying by private firms above $1 million.

And that doesn't include the money spent by the Texas Department of Transportation, whose governing commission is appointed by Perry. Chris Lippincott, a TxDOT spokesman, said that starting in 2005, the agency had two contracts that included Washington lobbying services. All told, Lippincott said, the amount of taxpayer money spent for TxDOT lobbying was $891,500.

So, Hutchison's statement about past spending on Washington lobbying is on the money. But what about that luxury house for the governor?

In fall 2007, Perry and his wife moved out of the Governor's Mansion and into a 4,600-square-foot house in the Barton Creek neighborhood that had been on the market for $1.8 million. The state rented the home for Perry so the mansion could be renovated.

The lease for the house at 8113 Hickory Creek Drive, which is valued by Travis County at $1.1 million, was initially for one year; the rent was $9,900. The Hutchison campaign based its statement on television news stories that quoted that figure and aired soon after the governor's relocation was announced.

Less than a year after the Perrys moved into the rental home, the Governor's Mansion was heavily damaged by arson. What had been expected to be an 18-month renovation became a vast reconstruction project, which is still under way.

Castle said the lease on the house now runs through October 2011. The monthly rent was lowered to $9,000 in November 2008.

We know there are additional costs to taxpayers related to Perry's stay in the rental house, which also accommodates the governor's security detail. Despite our inquiries, we haven't found out exactly what they are. John Sneed, executive director of the State Preservation Board, said the agency has been paying the utility bills for the governor's home away from home since Sept. 1, but he did not provide details.

According to Austin Energy spokesman Ed Clark, the utility doesn't release how much electricity any customer uses. But the average electric bill for a home of similar square footage would run about $250 a month, assuming the home is heated by gas.

The bottom line: Hutchison is correct that state offices controlled by Perry or his appointees spent more than $1 million on Washington lobbyists. As for the rental house that is currently Perry's home, Hutchison's claim that taxpayers are paying $10,000 a month is so close that she gets the cigar.

Based on available information, we rate Hutchison's statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/01/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-1-million-spent-lobbying-perry-home/
"['Florida', 'Maurice Ferre']","
Ferre says he left Miami with $43 million in the bank
","Maurice Ferre, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, wants to convince voters that he will be a good steward of their tax dollars. He served as Miami's mayor from 1973 until he lost in 1985 and says that he left the city in good financial shape. That's notable because, these days, the city is plagued with budget shortfalls and under a federal investigation about its finances. In an interview posted on Newsmax's Web site Jan. 14, 2010, Ferre said: ""I'm going to bring the common sense that I used when the city of Miami jumped from being a nothing type of city to being an important American city which is what it was when I left in 1985 and in those days I left the city of Miami with $43 million in the bank."" Ferre may have kept the city's financial house in order, but his campaign couldn't get us the right numbers when we asked for proof. Campaign spokeswoman Melissa Agudelo said Feb. 22, ""I am having difficulty finding the information from our sources. Maurice has them at a warehouse."" She suggested that we call the city of Miami's archives. Things got more confused. In a brief interview with us Feb. 22, Ferre said he was referring to the city's fund balance -- which is government-speak for reserves -- and got the number wrong. ""I think it was $34 million,'' Ferre said. ""I made a mistake and inverted the numbers."" We then got the ""combined balance sheet"" from the city which shows it ended the 1985 fiscal year with $14,371,267 in the general fund balance. We used that number because Diana Gomez, the city's current finance director, said that typically when people refer to reserves, they usually mean the general fund. ""That is the main operating accounts of the city where operations come from,"" she said. There are other pots of reserves that are designated for special purposes -- for capital projects, for example. By combining all the reserve pots, the city ended that year with $106,905,252 in reserves. When we told Ferre that the city of Miami's financial statement showed about $14 million in general fund reserves, he said his campaign would continue to research the matter. We interviewed him again on Feb. 23, and he said he wasn't only referring to the general fund reserves.""I obviously made a mistake, didn't I? It was not the fund balance, I am trying to figure out and get the exact figure for you. .... How do you expect me to remember numbers 30 years later? I have someone down at City Hall trying to figure out those numbers. I accept I probably made a mistake when I said $43 million, I think I meant $34 million. The issue is not whether it was 34, 43, or 23, the issue is I left the city of Miami solvent."" Ferre said that in the Newsmax interview he was referring to ""the sum amount of money left in various accounts in the city of Miami that make up cash in the bank."" We could do the math ourselves and combine various city accounts to get different sums, but given Ferre's conflicting explanations, we were as perplexed as he seemed to be.  And there's more: The night of Feb. 24, Ferre again called us to offer a new analysis after he tracked down the same financial statement we got. Ferre then concluded the amount was more than his original claim of $43 million. Ferre said that ""in the bank"" refers to the section on the city's financial statement about ""equity in pooled cash and investments."" That adds up to more than $53 million -- Ferre did not include the money strictly set aside for capital projects.  ""I don't know where the hell I got the $43 million,'' Ferre said. ""What I'm saying is banking and cash in hand funds were actually more than that."" So almost a week after our first inquiry, Ferre and his campaign aides seem as confused as we are. Was it $43 million, $34 million, or now $53 million? He keeps changing his definitions -- and effectively moving the goal posts. So we'll dock him for his repeated lack of precision but acknowledge that his underlying point is right that he left the city in the black. We find his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/mar/01/maurice-ferre/ferre-says-he-left-miami-43-million-bank/
"['Abortion', 'Education', 'Elections', 'LGBTQ', 'Texas', 'Ken Mercer']","
Ken Mercer, member of State Board of Education, says challenger gave more than $41,000 to Democrats who back abortion and same-sex marriage
","
Ken Mercer, a Republican on the State Board of Education facing a challenger in the March 2 primary, popped a double-edged audio ad online earlier this month.

The spot opens with Mercer’s two daughters calling him a rock-solid conservative. ""But what about Dad’s opponent?"" one says, without naming the foe, lobbyist Tim Tuggey.

The other replies: ""Dad’s opponent is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage.""

Mercer closes: ""You bet, I approve this message.""

But would the Texas Truth-O-Meter approve? We decided to appraise Tuggey’s donations and the viewpoints of Democrats who fielded his contributions.

Mercer shared with us a list indicating Tuggey has given nearly $43,000 to 19 Democratic candidates and three pro-Democratic political committees since 2001.

He's right. Our check of state and federal records shows that Tuggey's donations to Democrats amounted to $33,616 to nine candidates for federal office and three national political committees plus $9,100 donated to 10 Democratic candidates for state office.

Tuggey doesn’t deny he’s helped Democrats. But he also says that since 2004, he and his law firm have given about three times as much money to Republicans.

On his campaign Web site, he notes that his firm has represented the Bexar County Republican Party at no charge. The site says his firm also represented the state’s Republican U.S. House members in the last round of redistricting litigation and it represents only Republicans in campaign and ethics disputes.

Tuggey initially told us all his Democratic donations occurred because he was helping clients advance issues such as keeping taxes low or funding veterans’ care. He later conceded that in some cases, he pitched in for candidates simply because they asked for a donation.

Mercer said the second part of his blast—that the Tuggey-assisted Democrats ""support abortion and same-sex marriage"" is based on the Democratic Party platform.

""The Republican platform is clearly pro-life (and anti-abortion) and pro-traditional marriage,"" Mercer said. ""The Democrat Party platform is not.""

Mercer didn’t say so, but his ad's reference to Democrats supporting abortion was a shorthand stab that absurdly suggests Democrats want abortions to occur — a claim that's not the same as favoring a woman's right to have an abortion.

Besides, not all Democrats support abortion rights. ""We are a big-tent party,"" said Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the state Democrats. ""There are Democrats who support the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy and there are Democrats who don’t."" 
As for where Democrats stand on same-sex marriage, we didn't check with every Democrat who got a Tuggey donation. But one of them, state Sen. Carlos Uresti of San Antonio, said he’s never supported same-sex marriage.

""Absolutely not,"" Uresti said. ""I’m a Marine, damnit."" (Uresti said he voted in 2005 in favor of placing a proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage before voters, who later approved the proposal. In the official House record, however, Uresti is listed as absent from the floor vote that advanced the measure.)

Mercer's reasoning presumes that every Democrat who fielded a Tuggey donation hews to the party’s state and national platforms, statements of beliefs drafted and adopted by party convention delegates every two years at the state level and every four years at the national level. So we looked for language relating to abortion and same-sex marriage in the latest Democratic platforms.

What we found: The state party platform of 2008 states Texas Democrats ""trust the women of Texas to make personal and responsible decisions about when and whether to bear children, in consultation with their family, their physician, personal conscience or their God, rather than having these personal decisions made by politicians.""

Texas Democrats also ""support prevention measures which have proven effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, and which would reduce the rate of abortion when made affordable, accessible, and available as effective long-term programs,"" the platform states.

The national Democratic platform of 2008 states: ""The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade (the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.""

Same-sex marriage isn't mentioned in the state Democrats’ platform. But there is language indicating the party believes in protecting personal privacy and opposing discrimination in ""all forms.""

The national Democratic platform states: ""We support the full inclusion of all families, including same-sex couples, in the life of our nation, and support equal responsibility, benefits, and protections. We will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non-discrimination act. We oppose the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us.""

The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman for purposes of all federal laws, and provides that states need not recognize a marriage from another state if it is between persons of the same sex.

So does Mercer’s ad hold up?

Mercer got the math part right. Tuggey actually gave more than $42,000 to Democrats or Democratic committees, though Mercer's ad overlooks Tuggey's donations to Republicans and the history of Tuggey’s firm representing the Bexar County Republican Party and GOP candidates.

But the second part of Mercer's advertising statement doesn't add up.

For starters, Mercer doesn't back up his presumption that every Democrat hews to the party's platform. It also doesn't stand to reason that support for same-sex marriage amounts to non-support of traditional marriage, as Mercer said.

In Mercer's favor: Both the state and national Democratic Party platforms signal Democratic support for abortion rights. But the 2008 state platform doesn't address same-sex marriage while the national platform backs equal protections for same-sex couples with no reference to marriage.

Mercer accurately tallied Tuggey's donations to Democrats, but made sweeping judgments unsupported by facts.

We rate his statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/mar/01/ken-mercer/ken-mercer-member-state-board-education-says-chall/

Opposing Patterson in the March 2 Democratic primary is Austin lawyer Amy Clark Meachum, a partner in the law firm McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore.

Rangel says ethics report ""exonerates"" him
","Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has been under investigation for eight months, accused of violating congressional gift rules by letting corporations pay for Caribbean trips in 2007 and 2008. Soon after the House Ethics Committee released a report on Feb. 26, 2010, admonishing Rangel for making the trips, he defiantly insisted the report cleared him of wrongdoing. ""I'm glad for the wording of it because clearly the wording exonerates me,"" Rangel said. What? The ethics report found that Rangel's aides tried at least three times -- twice in memos and once in a letter to him -- to show him that his Caribbean trips had corporate sponsors, but he denied seeing any of them. And he says his staff never told him about them. The ethics committee concluded there was no evidence that he did see the correspondences sent to him. But the report did not clear him of responsibility. Here's what the letter accompanying the ethics report states: ""The Report further finds that Representative Charles B. Rangel violated the House gift rule by accepting payment or reimbursement for travel to the 2007 and 2008 conferences. The evidence shows that members of Representative Rangel's staff knew that corporations had contributed funds to Carib News specifically for the 2007 and 2008 conferences. This information was not provided to the Standards Committee when he sought and received approval from the Committee to accept these trips. The Committee does not find sufficient evidence to conclude, nor does it believe that it would discover additional evidence to alter its conclusion, that Representative Rangel had actual knowledge of the memoranda written by his staff. However, the report finds that Representative Rangel was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties. It is the intention of the Committee that the publication of this Report will serve as a public admonishment by the Standards Committee of Representative Rangel. The Committee will also require Representative Rangel to repay the costs of the trips to the respective entities that paid for his travel."" Rangel argues that the report did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that he had direct knowledge of the corporate sponsorship of his travel, so that means he was ""exonerated."" ""Members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoings or mistakes or errors of staff,"" Rangel said. The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines ""exonerate"" as: ""to relieve of a responsibility, obligation, or hardship; to clear from accusation or blame."" The ethics report did not do that. In fact, the report found that Rangel ""was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff."" And the report included a ""public admonishment"" of Rangel. The ethics panel did exonerate five other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who went on the same trips, multinational business conferences held in Antigua and Barbuda in November 2007 and St. Maarten in November 2008. The report concluded that their respective staff members didn't know about the corporations paying for the trips, so the members of Congress did not knowingly violate any rules and committed no wrongdoing because they were ""provided false information by others, and relied upon that information in seeking approval to accept the trips."" Nonetheless, the report states, the trips were ""impermissible gifts,"" and they must repay the cost of the travel. As for Rangel, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, a New York Times story on Feb. 26, 2010, notes that the ethics panel, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, ""is still examining more serious dealings involving Mr. Rangel, including campaign finance issues, failure to pay federal taxes on rental income from a Dominican villa and the use of rent-stabilized apartments."" At a news briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Rangel is entitled to ""have his day"" before the ethics committee on those allegations. ""They (the ethics committee members) have said he did not knowingly violate the rules,"" Pelosi said. ""And again, if this were the end of it, that would be one thing, but there's obviously more to come, and we'll see what happens with that. But every member has that right. ""I think it's quite a statement to hold members accountable for what their staffs knew,"" Pelosi said. ""I would be interested to see how that reverberates. But we have to place our confidence appropriately, and we’re held responsible for that."" You can agree with the ethics panel ruling or not, but the fact is it found that even if Rangel had no direct knowledge of the staff memos warning him about corporate sponsorship, Rangel ""was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties."" There's just no way to spin that into ""exoneration."" To the contrary, the ethics report included a public admonishment of Rangel.

Sewell says Workman contributed to Kirk Watson, among others, instead of Republicans
","
Among three Republicans from southwest Travis County running for a seat in the Texas House, lawyer David Sewell calls himself ""the true conservative.""

Need an indicator? In a campaign flier that hit mailboxes Feb. 22, he claims to ""never"" donate to Democrats while accusing his opponent, businessman Paul Workman, of padding Democratic warchests.

""Paul Workman contributes to Democrat Kirk Watson and other Democrats running against Republicans,"" the flier states.

Them's fighting words. Does Sewell have it right?

Let's start with the attack on Workman.

Chad Wilbanks, a consultant for the Sewell campaign, pointed us to the Texas Ethics Commission's campaign finance reports that show Workman made contributions to state Sen. Kirk Watson, former state comptroller and U.S. Senate candidate John Sharp, former Texas House Speaker Pete Laney, and state Reps. Patrick Rose and Dawnna Dukes — all Democrats.

Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign, said that in each instance, Workman gave to Democrats who had ""no or nominal Republican opposition.""

We looked at how much Workman donated to the aforementioned Democrats and which Republicans they were running against at the time.

Watson: According to campaign finance reports, Workman donated $350 to his campaign before the 2006 November election. Watson was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced Libertarian Robert ""Rock"" Howard in the general elections. No Republicans joined the race, which Watson won with 80 percent of the vote. Workman donated another $250 in 2007, less than a year into Watson's four-year term.

Sharp: Workman donated $200 to his campaign in 2002 before the former state comptroller lost a November bid for lieutenant governor to Republican David Dewhurst.

Rose: In 2006, Workman donated $100 to Rose's campaign. Rose won re-election to his House seat with 60 percent of the vote, swamping Republican Jim Neuhaus and Libertarian Tom Gleinser. In 2008, Workman gave $250 to Rose, who went on to beat Republican Matt Young and Gleinser with 59 percent of the vote.

Dukes: Workman gave $100 to her campaign in 2006. She won re-election to her House seat after winning 85 percent of the vote against Independent Richard Wedeikes.

Laney: Workman donated $250 to Laney's campaign in 2000 when Laney was unopposed in November for re-election to his House seat.

Clearly, Workman made donations to Democrats — Sharp and Rose — who ran against Republicans.

Next, let's check Sewell's claim that he never donated to Democrats.

Our search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission didn't find any donations to Democrats by Sewell. Yet we found that Stahl, Bernal & Davies, the law firm where Sewell is a partner, has contributed to Democrats, notably donating at least $5,000 to Democratic judges since Sewell started working at the firm as a clerk in 1998.

Among other contributions during the past decade, the firm gave $800 before the 2000 general election to Democrat Woodie Jones, who lost to Republican David Puryear for the Third Court of Appeals. Before the 2008 election, the firm gave $750 to Jones who wound up besting Republican incumbent Ken Law for a seat on the Third Court of Appeals.

Wilbanks said a portion of money that the firm's partners make each year is diverted to a company account from which each partner can independently spend money on political contributions in the firm's name.

""David does not support contributions to Democrats from the firm,"" said Wilbanks, his campaign consultant. We couldn't confirm Wilbanks' claim; the law firm declined to comment.

Where does that leave us with the declarations in Sewell's mailer?

Workman donated to Democratic candidates at least seven times leading up to general elections. Republicans were challenging the Workman-backed Democrats in three of the races. But Watson was never running against a Republican when he donated to Watson, as Sewell's claim implies. 
As for Sewell, we found no evidence that he has contributed to Democrats in his own name. Still, his firm has contributed to Democrats — running against Republicans — throughout Sewell's time there.

Turner says Workman voted in a Democratic primary
","
For the three Republicans running for a Texas House seat representing southwest Travis County, the campaign trail has turned into a trial over who's consorting with the enemy.

In that vein, transplanted Fort Worth lawyer Holly Turner has attacked opponent Paul Workman's voting history. In a radio ad that debuted Feb. 25, Turner accuses Workman of voting for Democrats.

""Official records show he voted in the Democrat primary, supporting Democrats with his vote,"" the narrator says.

Indeed?

Craig Murphy, Turner's spokesman, pointed to Travis County's voting records.

Our search shows that Workman voted in the 1994 Democratic primary, though he voted in the two previous GOP primaries and in eight Republican primaries from 1996 through 2010.

So over 20 years, Workman voted in every Republican primary except for one in '94.

What caused Workman to cross party lines and vote Democratic? We didn't find out; his campaign consultant, Eric Bearse, said Workman ""doesn't recall voting in that primary.""

The record shows he did.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Rubio claims 57 of his 100 ideas were made law by the Florida Legislature
","
Marco Rubio's two years as speaker of Florida's House of Representatives were marked by passionate speeches, promises of conservative principles and a book filled with 100 ways to transform state government.

100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future promised a sea change -- from lowering property taxes and insurance rates, to luring Hollywood productions to the state; from recalibrating Florida's schools, to building a better Web site for the state budget.

The ideas became the agenda of the Republican-led House in 2007 and 2008 and a personal report card for Rubio, now a candidate for the U.S. Senate.

In the end, Rubio gave himself A's.

""All 100 ideas were passed by the Florida House,"" Rubio's campaign Web site says. ""Fifty-seven of these ideas ultimately became law, including measures to crack down on gangs and sexual predators, promote energy efficient buildings, appliances and vehicles, and help small businesses obtain affordable health coverage.""

The St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald are launching PolitiFact Florida, accessed online at http://www.politifact.com/florida, with this examination of Rubio's claim. Fifty-seven fact-checks packed into one ruling.

At a recent campaign event in front of a room full of reporters, Rubio -- who has met our Truth-O-Meter before -- offered this introduction:

""I don't want to get PolitiFact-checked today,"" Rubio said.

Sorry. The Truth-O-Meter has come to Florida.

How we got started

Taking Rubio at his word on the 43 unsuccessful ideas, we began by asking Rubio's Senate campaign for evidence about the 57 he says became law. Spokesman Alex Burgos pointed us to a May 2008 Miami Herald article, which referenced a two-page report prepared by Rubio's then-legislative staff.

That report, like Rubio claims, says 57 of the 100 ideas have been ""completed.""

From there, we researched the validity of each claim, matching the idea from the book to a corresponding state law. Some of the ideas in Rubio's report listed specific House or Senate bills that we examined. For others, we searched the Legislature's online repository of bills from the 2007 and 2008 sessions, as well as newspaper articles and press releases from the time.

When we found an idea that matched a description in law, we crossed it off our list. When we couldn't, we consulted with the appropriate state agency, the House Majority Office and/or Rubio's U.S. Senate campaign.

In the end we created the chart that accompanies this story and shows our findings (at the bottom of this page). Overall, 24 of the 57 ideas Rubio takes credit for delivering we don't question. And we found 10 other ideas that are partially law, or were law under Rubio's watch, but are no longer in effect, or have some other type of asterisk.

What Rubio got done

When the House and Senate passed property insurance legislation during a special session in January 2007, just two months after Rubio became speaker, House Republicans celebrated with a press release titled ""Nine down: 100 ideas gets special start.""

We agree with Rubio on eight of these nine ideas being accomplished. The legislation created a uniform, statewide building code, allowed policyholders to increase or decrease hurricane deductibles depending on the circumstances, and created a ""Truth in Premium Billing"" statement for policyholders. But an idea for expanding a short-term, no-interest bridge loan program didn't happen.

Rubio can claim many other successes, though.

Florida's presidential primary came earlier in 2008 as Rubio promised. Floridians seeking health care coverage now have an online database to check. Drivers can purchase multiple-year vehicle registrations. And the state created an investment money pool for businesses and infrastructure projects.

""I think that Marco Rubio drove the agenda down to the last hour that he was speaker,"" said state Sen. Don Gaetz, who worked with Rubio on education reforms in 2008, including four ideas that are now totally or partially law. ""Literally, in the last two hours he was speaker, I was still negotiating issues with him on behalf of the Senate.""

One of Rubio's ideas led to a requirement that school districts create career academies -- where students can be training in high-demand/high-need vocations. Another pushed the FCAT to later in the school year. A third increased tax credits for companies that contribute to education scholarships.

Rubio supporter and former state Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, notes that the ideas aren't all Rubio's -- he collected them at meetings across the state called ""Idearaisers."" The meetings and then the book gave Floridians an opportunity to have their voices heard, Baxley said.

""The book framed a practical set of issues that the people had brought to us,"" said Baxley, who served as speaker pro tempore under Rubio. ""It gave us a platform to work from that was meaningful.""

Gaetz said Rubio's ideas still come up today.

""Marco's genius was in actually listening to people around the state and compiling the list of ideas,"" said Gaetz, who has endorsed Rubio's opponent Gov. Charlie Crist for Senate. ""He branded those ideas and that's the sign of a smart politician. Even still in 2010, as we put together health care and education bills, there will often be somebody, wryly or respectful, noting that what we're doing is in the 100 ideas book.""

What's not on the books

Quick math -- if 24 ideas are law, and 10 others are ""kind of"" law, that leaves 23 ideas that are something else.

In the case of five of the ideas, we find it's wrong to suggest they could be achieved in law. Rubio, for instance, wanted the state to commit to having a ""Top 10"" public university and to building a ""model transportation system."" These, and three others, are more appropriately called broad goals, but none are law. (Rubio's office, in response, points to increased university funding or the leasing of toll roads to private companies as evidence these ideas were fulfilled.)

That leaves 18 ideas that have not been enacted.

Here's an example:

Rubio says seven ideas dealing with the environment are now law thanks to a comprehensive energy bill that passed in 2008.

One of our favorites was to provide incentives for alternative-fueled cars, including ""discounted parking and free or reduced tolls."" We have a hybrid in the PolitiFact fleet, and the thought of free or reduced tolls sounded like a great idea.

But the bill has no parking or toll incentives for hybrid or other alternative-fuel cars. It does, however, offer lonely hybrid drivers the opportunity to use state High Occupancy Vehicle lanes. But:
  

Two other ideas concern Internet access for sexual offenders and minors, but neither is a law the way Rubio intended. One was to deny sex offenders access to ""popular Internet networking sites"" and to ""install tracking equipment on their computers.""

What passed in 2007 was a requirement that sex offenders register their e-mail and online instant message names with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The state could then forward that information to social networking sites, which could then choose to ban or block those users. During a presentation of the bill, the Web site MySpace.com agreed to receive the information from FDLE. But there is no tracking equipment, nor is there a requirement that MySpace.com or a Web site like Facebook delete the users FDLE finds.

The other idea would have required ""social networking sites to set up verification systems to require parental notification and consent for minors to use these sites."" There are no such requirements on sites like Facebook or MySpace.com.

In those cases, and others we found, Rubio's ideas got lost as part of compromises between the Senate and House, said Rubio's former House spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin. Rubio supporter Baxley agreed.

""I don't think that there was an expectation that every bill that would pass would reflect every idea in the book,"" said Chamberlin, who continues to work for House Republicans. ""The legislative process is about negotiation and compromise.""

Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos noted that Rubio himself described the 100 ideas book ""as much a process as it is a product.""

""The beauty of the 100 ideas project is that these were ideas presented by Floridians,"" Burgos said. ""They weren't put in the book as pieces of legislation or executive orders. They were put in there as a starting point to be inserted in the legislative process.""

Others are less forgiving.

""At the end of the day, sadly, everyone wants to take credit for it, especially if it's a good idea,"" said state Sen. Mike Fasano, who is supporting Crist. ""I think then-speaker Rubio, now candidate Rubio, exaggerates when he suggests he accomplished all of these things.""

Our ruling

Rubio's claim is that 57 of the ideas in his book 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future are now law. Based on our analysis, he has fallen short.

Using the most generous accounting, Rubio might be able to say that he got 34 ideas into state lawbooks (adding together those ideas that we marked ""law"" or ""kind of"" law).

Rubio's campaign had almost two weeks to review our findings, and responded Feb. 26, 2010, with five pages of explanations. In two cases, their information changed our decisions. We also offered Rubio the chance to address our findings. He chose, through a spokesman, not to.

That leaves us to make a Truth-O-Meter ruling based on the information you see here, and in the corresponding chart.

Based on our findings, 24 of Rubio's 100 ideas became law. Another 10 were partially enacted. That's not the kind of claim you're likely to hear in a TV ad, but it's what we found.

Rubio delivered on education and property insurance reforms, and his book and its ideas remain part of the lexicon of the Florida Legislature. But 23 of the ideas either aren't law or could not be law. We find his claim Half True. 
Kind of. Committee structure changed, but not by law. 
Broad goal; cannot be achieved in law. 
Kind of. Funding increased, but no recurring revenue source. Program now defunct. 
No. Legislature capped an affordable housing trust fund that lowered overall project funding. One specific program saw increased funding from 2006 to 2007. But it wasn’t funded in 2008.

Charlie Crist correct that Rubio supported gun restrictions
","It's going to be a long summer. It's only February and the barbs are already flying in the Republican campaign for U.S. Senate. (The primary isn't until Aug. 24.)In a recent press release, Gov. Charlie Crist fired off 10 claims about his opponent, former House Speaker Marco Rubio. One statement questioned Rubio's commitment to gun rights: ""Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.""A candidate's stance on gun issues can be critical in a Republican primary. Some gun rights groups oppose restrictions such as these. We thought the statement merited further research.The claim stems from a January 2000 Miami Herald article. Rubio, then 28, was running in a special election for his first term in the Florida House. The Herald article profiled Rubio and his opponent and recounted their positions on key issues. It said, ""Rubio supports 'reasonable restrictions' including background checks and waiting periods."" It quoted Rubio saying, ""However, I believe we should spend more time focusing on why people, especially children, are committing acts of violence.""Asked about the passage in the article, Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos confirmed that it accurately described Rubio's position and said, ""It's basically a restatement of his support for the current law.""In 1990, Florida voters passed a law requiring a three-day waiting period to buy handguns. When the Brady Bill was enacted into federal law in 1993, it called for a five-day waiting period, but Florida's earlier law took precedence. The three-day waiting period is still in effect, unless the buyer has a license to carry a concealed weapon.Burgos noted that throughout his time in the Legislature, Rubio had an ""A"" rating by the National Rifle Association. Rubio voted for major NRA priorities such as a 2005 ""castle doctrine"" law allowing people to use deadly force if attacked in their home or any place a person ""has a right to be."" Rubio also supported a 2008 law allowing most employees to bring guns to work, as long as they held a concealed weapons license and kept the gun in their cars.Marion Hammer, a lobbyist for the NRA who served as its national president and has donated money to Crist's campaign, told PolitiFact Florida that Rubio's rating would go down when new grades are released in May. That's a reflection of several compromises in the ""guns-at-work"" bill that occurred during Rubio's time as speaker, she said. Rubio's record on guns as a House member is clear -- he voted with major NRA priorities and got an ""A"" rating for each of his elections, at least until now. But Crist accurately claimed that Rubio supported laws that instituted waiting periods and background checks on gun owners.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says under Democratic health plan, family insurance premiums in the individual market would decrease 14 to 20 percent
","For many people, the health care issue boils down to this: Are my insurance rates going to go up or down? Not surprisingly then, one of the testiest exchanges at the health care summit on Feb. 25, 2010, came between President Barack Obama and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., over the issue of how the Democrats' health care plan would affect premiums. Interestingly, both cited an analysis of the Senate health care bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to make their case. ""The Congressional Budget Office report says that premiums will rise in the individual market as a result of the Senate bill,"" Alexander said. ""No, no, no, no,"" Obama retorted. ""This is an example of where we've got to get our facts straight."" ""Let me respond to what you just said, Lamar, because it's not factually accurate,"" Obama continued. ""Here's what the Congressional Budget Office says. The costs for families for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving would go down 14 percent to 20 percent. What the Congressional Budget Office says is that because now they've got a better deal, because policies are cheaper, they may choose to buy better coverage than they have right now, and that might be 10 percent to 13 percent more expensive than the bad insurance that they had previously. ""But they didn't say that the actual premiums would be going up. What they said was they'd be going down by 14 percent to 20 percent. And I promise you, I've gone through this carefully with the Congressional Budget Office, and I'll be happy to present this to the press and whoever's listening because this is an important issue."" Alexander later stood his ground, saying, ""With respect, you're wrong about -- your bill would increase premiums, I believe. You say it wouldn't. So rather than argue with you in public about it, I'd like to put my facts down, give them to you."" ""I think it's a great idea,"" Obama said. ""I'd like to get this issue settled about whether premiums are reduced before we leave today, because I'm pretty certain I'm not wrong."" This seemed like a good place for us to step in and referee. First, one of the key qualifiers that many people may have lost in this exchange is that they were debating the effects on premiums for people in the individual market. These are the people who do not get their insurance through an employer. This is only a fraction of the overall market. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the Democrats' plan were adopted, the individual market would grow to about 17 percent of the American population by 2016. The Democrats' plan calls for the creation of a health insurance exchange in which individuals could shop for insurance with private companies competing for their business. The idea is that it would allow individuals to purchase insurance at lower, group rates. Plans offered by companies participating in the exchange would have to meet government-mandated minimum coverage thresholds. The CBO estimated that the average premium for people in the individual market would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than under current law. Specifically, the CBO estimates the average cost of family policies purchased by individuals would be $15,200 in 2016, as opposed to $13,100 under current law. That's the backing for Alexander's comment. But Obama correctly notes that much of the added cost is tied to people getting better insurance. The CBO said there are three drivers that would cause premiums to rise or fall. And it broke them down as follows: • Average premiums would be 27 percent to 30 percent higher because a greater amount of coverage would be obtained. In particular, the average insurance policy would cover a substantially larger share of enrollees’ costs for health care and a slightly wider range of benefits. Those expansions would reflect both the minimum level of coverage (and related requirements) specified in the proposal and people’s decisions to purchase more extensive coverage in response to subsidies. • Average premiums would be 7 percent to 10 percent lower because of a net reduction in costs to insurers, mostly from the changes in the rules governing the individual market. • Average premiums would be 7 percent to 10 percent lower because of a shift in the types of people obtaining coverage. Most of that change is tied to an influx of healthier people with below-average spending for health care, who would purchase coverage because of subsidies and a new tax penalty for failing to purchase insurance. Obama gets to his figure by combining those last two cost reductions, but not including the cost increase tied to people essentially getting better insurance. Both Obama and Alexander cited figures independent of the effect of subsidies. But we think it bears noting that under the Senate health plan, about 57 percent of people on the individual market would receive federal subsidies, and those subsidies would cover nearly two-thirds of the total premium. One last point, the Democrats' plan would allow people who currently have individual policies to grandfather in their existing policy. According to the CBO, ""the premiums for those policies would probably not differ substantially from current-law levels."" In other words, if you were to opt to keep the exact same individual plan (an option the CBO doesn't believe many will take because, with subsidies, most could get a better plan cheaper), the CBO doesn't see the cost rising or falling substantially. And again, we are talking here only about premiums for people in the individual market. For most people, who get their insurance through their company, the CBO projects premiums to decline slightly from where they'd go if no health plan is passed. How slightly? In the 0 to 3 percent range, depending on whether you work at a large or small company. We think both Obama and Alexander have selectively chosen from the CBO report to suit their needs. Alexander insists the cost of premiums in the individual market will go up, without acknowledging that that's because most people will be getting better insurance coverage, either because of new government-mandated minimum coverage levels or because many will decide that subsidies will make upgrades to a better plan more cost-effective. Bottom line, people won't be paying more for the same thing. They'll be paying more for better plans. And on top of that, many will get federal subsidies, so they won't be paying the increased cost out of their own pockets. But we also think Obama has put on blinders when citing the CBO report. Yes, the CBO estimated 14 to 20 percent savings due to rule changes in the individual market, and because the plan is expected to infuse a large number of low-risk people into the insurance pool. But he ignores the estimated cost increases tied to more people getting better insurance. Obama tries to gloss over this by comparing costs ""for the same type of coverage that they're currently receiving."" But the fact is, most would not be getting the same kind of coverage. Some of the shift to better coverage would be due to personal choice -- with subsidies, many people would be able to get better coverage at the same cost or cheaper -- but some would be tied to new government-mandated minimum coverage and the threat of tax penalties if you decide not to get insurance. And for those who opt to grandfather in their current individual policies (even if they don't meet the new government minimum standards), the CBO doesn't see much of a change in premiums one way or the other. And so we rule Obama's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/feb/26/barack-obama/obama-says-under-democratic-health-plan-family-ins/
