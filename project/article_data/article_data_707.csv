Trump’s wrong claim that election observers were barred in Pennsylvania, Michigan
","President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that Republican election observers have been barred from watching ballot counts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, repeating a falsehood that has been contradicted by his own campaign lawyers in court hearings and lawsuits. ""Nobody wants to report that Pennsylvania and Michigan didn’t allow our Poll Watchers and/or Vote Observers to Watch or Observe,"" Trump wrote in a Nov. 11 tweet tagged as ""disputed"" by Twitter. ""This is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count. Therefore, I easily win both states.""  Nobody wants to report that Pennsylvania and Michigan didn’t allow our Poll Watchers and/or Vote Observers to Watch or Observe. This is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count. Therefore, I easily win both states. Report the News! Election observers representing the Republican Party and the Trump campaign have been allowed to observe the ballot-counting process alongside Democratic observers in both Pennsylvania and Michigan, despite the president’s repeated claims to the contrary. A Trump campaign attorney conceded in court that the campaign had a ""non-zero number"" of election observers in Philadelphia. Another federal lawsuit the campaign filed in Michigan includes hundreds of pages of affidavits from people who served as election observers. There also remains no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would invalidate ""hundreds of thousands of votes"" in those states. Independent decision desks for multiple news organizations have called the election for President-elect Joe Biden, who leads Trump by about 52,000 votes in Pennsylvania and 146,000 in Michigan, according to Decision Desk HQ.  ""President Trump’s claims about lack of observers have been tested and continue to be tested in court,"" said Rick Hasen, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. ""Importantly, there has been no proof of illegal votes in the election, and no pathway to go from complaints about inadequate access to overturning the results of the election."" PolitiFact has debunked false claims that GOP observers were denied access in Philadelphia and Detroit. Other fact-checkers who have looked at those cities and their surrounding states have also documented that observers were allowed. Litigation continues in both states as Trump refuses to concede defeat. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Trump’s focus in Pennsylvania has been on Philadelphia, where a Nov. 5 judge’s order allowed election observers from both parties to view the ballot-counting process from 6 feet away. Philadelphia appealed the order, arguing that the original arrangement let all observers ""see the entire set up"" in detail. The city said it has complied in the meantime by providing closer access to the observers, who were previously kept farther away due to the coronavirus.  Republican observers were never blocked from observing entirely, despite Trump’s claim. Under questioning from a federal judge in court, a Trump campaign attorney conceded that the campaign had several representatives monitoring the ballot counting. ""At all times, the city commissioners, who are a bipartisan organization, have followed the law,"" said Kevin Feeley, a spokesperson for the city commissioners. Feeley told PolitiFact Nov. 6 that he was ""staring at"" observers representing both parties in the city’s convention center. Ellen Lyon, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said Pennsylvania more broadly has ""had a free, fair and secure election"" with ""the highest degree of transparency,"" including livestreams of the process in Philadelphia and other counties. ""In all counties, all parties have canvass observers throughout the process,"" Lyon said, pointing to the commonwealth’s guidelines for observers. ""Any insinuation otherwise is a lie.""  Election observers watch as election workers process ballots at the Allegheny County elections returns warehouse in Pittsburgh on Nov. 6, 2020. (AP) ""Any laws around poll watchers apply equally to both major parties and any third parties,"" added Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. Trump’s tweet is also inaccurate as it relates to Michigan.  ""Absentee ballot counting (in Detroit) was observed by hundreds of Republicans and Democrats,"" the Michigan Department of State said in a Nov. 12 tweet. Some confusion over the access afforded to election observers in Detroit can be traced to a chaotic event on Nov. 4., when the convention hall used for canvassing reached the state’s legal limit for election observers and officials had to stop additional observers from entering. Michigan allows election observers called challengers appointed by political parties and interest groups, as well as poll watchers, to observe the election process. Over 100 Republican challengers remained inside throughout the counting, PolitiFact reported.   A Republican election observer watches over election inspectors as they examine a ballot on Nov. 4, 2020, at the central counting board in Detroit. (AP) Niraj Warikoo, a reporter with the Detroit Free Press, tweeted that Trump’s claim was a ""brazen lie."" He said he spent three days in the convention hall and saw many Republican observers.  Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of State, said she knew of no locations in Michigan that denied access to Republican observers. There is no evidence that would suggest ""hundreds of thousands of votes"" should be invalidated, she said. ""This is an utterly false and irresponsible claim by Trump,"" said Samuel Bagenstos, a professor of law at the University of Michigan. ""Republican challengers were permitted everywhere in Michigan."" As part of a recent lawsuit filed in Michigan, the Trump campaign presented hundreds of pages of affidavits from election observers alleging voting irregularities and fraud. The Washington Post reviewed them and reported that they made allegations about ballot-counting procedures that have been debunked and complaints that did not reveal wrongdoing. In one affidavit, for example, an observer said military ballots that were cast for Biden ""stuck out to me."" ""The allegations that there was any fraud, much less fraud that could in any conceivable way call into question Biden's nearly 150,000-vote margin, are really laughable when you look into them,"" Bagenstos said. ""There’s no there there."" According to Business Insider, more than a dozen of the affidavits featured complaints about the required 6 feet of space observers had to keep as a coronavirus precaution. Wimmer said the rules in Michigan apply to all observers regardless of party affiliation. Trump claimed that ""Pennsylvania and Michigan didn’t allow our poll watchers and/or vote observers to watch or observe."" That’s inaccurate. Republican election observers have been allowed to observe the canvassing of ballots in both Pennsylvania and Michigan, including in Philadelphia and Detroit, two of the cities heavily targeted by the Trump campaign’s litigation efforts. Even Trump campaign attorneys have acknowledged having observers present in court hearings and legal filings. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

Trump’s tweet about 2.7 million deleted votes is baseless
","Since Joe Biden was elected to be the next U.S. president, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that voter fraud affected the outcome of the race. Now, Trump says millions of votes cast for him were deleted. In a Nov. 12 tweet, Trump blamed Dominion Voting Systems, a company that makes voting machines. As evidence, he cited a report from One America News Network, a pro-Trump television network. ""Dominion deleted 2.7 million Trump votes nationwide,"" the president said in his tweet, quoting the OANN report. ""Data analysis finds 221,000 Pennsylvania votes switched from President Trump to Biden. 941,000 Trump votes deleted. States using Dominion Voting Systems switched 435,000 votes from Trump to Biden."" Since Election Day, Trump has refused to concede the presidential race to Biden and doubled down on unproven allegations of fraud. Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, has also fanned unproven allegations that Dominion changed votes for the president. Trump’s tweet about millions of deleted votes doesn’t stand up to scrutiny, either. (Screenshot from Twitter) The report Trump cited in his tweet aired on OANN on Nov. 12. The network cited an ""unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research."" We reached out to OANN for a copy of that analysis, but we haven’t heard back.  Edison Research is a company that contracts with the National Election Pool, a consortium of American news organizations, to provide exit polling data during election cycles. Edison Research also partners with several TV networks to provide vote tabulation data. The company said it has not found data that back up OANN’s report or Trump’s tweet. ""Edison Research has produced no such report, and we have no evidence of any voter fraud,"" said Larry Rosin, president of Edison Research. The ""unaudited analysis"" that OANN cited appears to stem from a thread on TheDonald.win, a pro-Trump website that has been a source of false information about COVID-19 and conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking. It was created in 2019 after Reddit banned a similar community from its platform.  The user whose work inspired the thread, and whose account was five days old on Nov. 12, claimed to find irregularities in votes tabulated by Dominion machines. There is no evidence to back that up. ""I am not aware of any credible evidence involving technology from Dominion Voting Systems that indicates that it has resulted in incorrect tabulations — and certainly not on the scale that the president has just stated,"" said Edward Perez, an election technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonprofit that studies voting infrastructure. Why the focus on Dominion? The company has become the subject of online disinformation that seeks to tie it to Democrats or blame it for clerical errors in the ballot-counting process. Twenty-eight states used Dominion’s voting technology for voting this year, according to a company webpage that addresses online rumors. Minor reporting problems in two of those states — Georgia and Michigan — have been misconstrued as evidence of fraud. In Antrim County, Mich., a clerk’s error led to an incorrect early tally that made it appear as if Biden was winning the state by about 3,000 votes. The voting equipment and software ""did not malfunction, and all ballots were properly tabulated,"" according to the Michigan secretary of state’s office. ""The software did not cause a misallocation of votes; it was a result of user human error,"" the office wrote. ""Even when human error occurs, it is caught during county canvasses."" In Georgia, early morning voting on Election Day was halted temporarily in Morgan and Spalding counties when Dominion machines were involved in a problem involving electronic poll books made by a subcontractor. Technicians resolved the issue, and Trump easily carried both counties. RELATED: Trump supporters falsely tie Nancy Pelosi to broader election misfire scheme ""No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,"" Dominion says on its website. ""While no election is without isolated issues, Dominion Voting Systems are reliably and accurately counting ballots. State and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process."" On its website, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency says bad actors would not be able to change vote counts undetected even if they tried. ""The systems and processes used by election officials to tabulate votes and certify official results are protected by various safeguards that help ensure the accuracy of election results,"" the agency says. ""These safeguards include measures that help ensure tabulation systems function as intended, protect against malicious software, and enable the identification and correction of any irregularities."" We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Trump said in a tweet that a voting technology company deleted millions of votes that were cast for him during the presidential election. That claim is not based in fact. The president’s tweet traces back to an unsubstantiated claim on a pro-Trump website that cited Edison Research. But Edison Research told us they have found no evidence of voter fraud. Dominion, state election officials and federal officials say there’s no evidence that millions of votes were miscounted. Trump’s claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Trump does not have more electoral votes than Biden
","President-elect Joe Biden has won the most votes in the U.S. presidential election, but a map published on Facebook claims to show President Donald Trump with a slight edge in the electoral college. The map, published in a Nov. 11 post, shows Trump with 232 electoral votes and Biden with 227. The map shows North Carolina in the Trump column, while other battleground states — Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania — are labeled as having ""incomplete or contested results."" ""The real electoral map...... before the lying media called it for Biden,"" the caption says. (Screenshot from Facebook) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have spread in groups dedicated to the Stop the Steal movement, which took off after Election Day and has spread misinformation about voter fraud. We’ve seen several inaccurate and misleading electoral maps that make it seem like Trump was leading Biden in electoral votes. This one is similarly wrong. The map in the Facebook post comes from the Epoch Times, a pro-Trump news outlet with a history of publishing misinformation. As of Nov. 11, the website said the election outcome is ""unclear"" and that it ""will not declare a winner of the election until all results are certified and any legal challenges are resolved."" States have until Dec. 8 to finalize their results. State electors cast their ballots Dec. 14, but the vote will not be made official until Jan. 6, when Congress tallies the electoral votes. But Biden is the clear winner, as he received more votes than Trump in battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which helped put him over the 270 electoral vote threshold for election. Every major TV network and the Associated Press has projected that Biden won the election. In Pennsylvania, the former vice president led by more than 50,000 votes. It’s unlikely that the Trump campaign’s legal challenges in the state will make up that gap. So where does the electoral map stand?  As of Nov. 12, Biden was projected to win 290 electoral votes — 20 more than he needs to win the White House — while Trump is expected to win 217. The AP hasn’t called North Carolina or Georgia for either candidate. The Facebook post is inaccurate.

President Trump Shares Misleading Video, Falsely Calls Into Question Ballot Collection In California
","President Donald Trump tweeted a misleading and previously fact-checked video on Wednesday, falsely calling into question ballot collection in Los Angeles.  The clip shows Los Angeles County election workers legally collecting ballots from an authorized drop box on Nov. 4, the day after Election Day, which county election officials said was standard procedure. They noted all drop boxes were closed and locked at 8 p.m. on Election night.  PolitiFact last week debunked a headline attached to the same video, which went viral on TikTok. The headline said the clip showed evidence of election ""cheating,"" in California. When Trump shared the video today, he suggested there was wrongdoing by adding: ""You are looking at BALLOTS! Is this what our Country has come to?""  Here’s PolitiFact’s analysis from its recent fact check. We’ll offer a rating on Trump’s sharing of the video at the end. A TikTok video on Nov. 4, the day after Election Day, suggested there was ""cheating"" for Joe Biden in California because some ballots weren’t collected until he had already been declared the winner in that state over President Donald Trump on Election Night. The viral video was headlined: ""This video was just taken (11/04) by a friend in California. The cheating is unreal!!!"" California did collect ballots on Nov. 4. But it was standard procedure, not any sign of cheating, to collect and then process ballots from drop boxes on that day.  Notably, California accepts mail-in ballots up to 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3.  The Video As shared on TikTok, the minute-long video shows two men loading hundreds of paper items from a box into satchels. The box is on a sidewalk on what appears to be a residential street. It’s not apparent where or when the video was recorded.  The woman then asks the men if they are ""official election guys,"" and one of them shows her a badge clipped to his shirt. What’s on the badge is not visible. There’s a sign on the box they’re collecting from, but what it says is not visible, either. Official Responses The day after the posting, the office of the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk responded to a posting of the video on Twitter, saying: ""All Drop Boxes were closed and locked at 8 p.m. on Election Night and ballots were collected the following day. These are valid ballots that will be processed and counted during the post-election canvass — like all outstanding vote-by-mail ballots."" A spokeswoman for the California Secretary of State told PolitiFact the video showed ballot collection in Reseda. The Associated Press and other media called California for Biden just after California polls closed Nov. 3. The AP said it declared Biden the winner of California as soon as polls closed in the state ""after results from AP VoteCast and an analysis of early voting statistics confirmed expectations that the state’s longstanding political trend in favor of Democratic presidential candidates will hold."" As of the morning of Nov. 6, Biden had more than 8.24 million votes in California — 65.1% of the vote — to Trump’s 4.17 million, according to the Secretary of State. As of Nov. 11, Biden’s total had grown to 10.27 million and Trump’s to 5.36 million.  Our Ruling A poster on TikTok claiming, ""The cheating is unreal,"" shared a video widely circulated on social media that appeared to show California ballots being collected the day after the election, after the state was called for Biden. In fact, it’s standard procedure in California to collect and process ballots from drop boxes after Election Day. A county official said the boxes were locked at 8 p.m. on election night. The video did not depict any cheating. PolitiFact rated that claim False last week.  President Trump shared the same debunked video this week, suggesting it was evidence of election fraud in California.  We rated that claim False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.","[('See original fact check for full source list.', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/tiktok-posts/it-wasnt-cheating-calif-collected-ballots-after-st/')]",/factchecks/2020/nov/11/donald-trump/president-trump-shares-misleading-video-falsely-ca/

No, the media didn’t call the 2016 election for Clinton
","Media organizations have called the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden. But they didn’t call the 2016 election for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to President Donald Trump.  ""The media got it wrong in 1948, 2000, 2016… and they are wrong in 2020,"" one Facebook post says. ""They do NOT pick the winner."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, it’s true that the media doesn’t pick the winner in presidential elections — voters do, and the candidate with the most electoral college votes prevails. As of Nov. 11, the Associated Press reported that Biden had 290 electoral votes to Trump’s 214 with the election outcome in three states still outstanding.  The media ""calls"" races for candidates, but it’s a projection based on available information about the ballots cast for each candidate. We wrote about what happens next, and you can read about it here. Now for some history.  In 1948, the first edition of the Chicago Daily Tribune — now known as the Chicago Tribune — wrongly (and infamously) called the election for presidential candidate Thomas Dewey. The headline read: ""Dewey defeats Truman,"" and there’s a photo of former President Harry Truman holding up the paper and laughing.  Recalling the error in a 2007 story, the Tribune reported that the paper had been ""lulled into a false sense of security by polls that repeatedly predicted a Dewey victory"" and a printers’ strike forced the Tribune to go to press hours before it normally would.  The paper changed the headline for the second edition after radio bulletins said that the race was close, according to the Tribune. The headline in the second edition said: ""Democrats make sweep of state offices.""  In 2000, some news outlets called Florida for then-Vice President Al Gore. They withdrew it later that night and by early morning the state was still too close to call. On Nov. 8, the Florida secretary of state announced that George W. Bush had won Florida by a narrow margin, which meant he also won the presidency. The Democrats sued to force a recount in several counties and lost at the Supreme Court.  In 2016, leading up to Election Day, national and state polls consistently showed Clinton beating Trump and forecasters guessed her chance of winning ranged from 70% to 99%. But media organizations didn’t call the election for Clinton, who lost. The Associated Press called the race for Trump at 2:29 a.m. Eastern Time on Nov. 9, and a few minutes later, TV networks started to report that Clinton had called Trump to concede.

No, Joe Biden’s leads haven’t disappeared in key battlegrounds
","Supporters of President Donald Trump in Washington and the media continue to entertain his unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud and his unprecedented refusal to concede the election he lost to President-elect Joe Biden. Some Facebook users are following suit. One Facebook post shared thousands of times, from conservative radio host Ben Ferguson, wrongly claimed that Biden’s leads have evaporated in four key battleground states. ""Liberal media get it wrong again as Biden lead disappears in NV, AZ, GA, PA,"" reads the text over the Nov. 10 post, which includes an audio clip from Ferguson’s podcast.  The post is inaccurate. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Ferguson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In reality, Biden has been projected as the winner of the election by major media outlets and decision desks, including the Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, Fox News and Decision Desk HQ.  Such calls were made because the data showed Biden received more votes than Trump and that Trump had run out of ways to win. The Associated Press, for example, says it only calls a race when it is ""fully confident"" the race has been won because the ""trailing candidate no longer has a path to victory."" The former vice president has been named the winner in Pennsylvania and Nevada by each of those 11 organizations. The Associated Press and Fox News have also called Arizona in his favor. And he is still leading in Georgia, where officials have announced a recount by hand. Biden’s advantages in those four battleground states vary, according to Decision Desk HQ. He is ahead by more than 36,000 votes in Nevada; by more than 12,000 in Arizona; by more than 14,000 in Georgia; and by more than 49,000 votes in Pennsylvania. But those leads have not disappeared, as the Facebook post claimed. Dave Wasserman, the House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, tweeted Nov. 10 that Biden’s leads in Georgia and Arizona — his two smallest margins to date — are ""quite robust.""  Biden doesn’t need to win all four of those states to capture the presidency, either. States have until Dec. 8 to finalize their results before members of the Electoral College cast their votes on Dec. 14 and Congress officially counts those votes on Jan. 6, 2021. Media organizations agree that Biden remains on track to win, and there is no evidence of any widespread fraud that would tip the election in Trump’s favor, as experts, international observers and state officials from both parties have said. The Biden team has begun preparing for the White House, even as the Trump administration works to thwart the transition. Trump accepted the media’s calls in 2016. A review of the Internet Archive shows he changed his Twitter biography to read ""President-elect of the United States"" on Nov. 9, one day after the 2016 election. He met with President Barack Obama in the White House on Nov. 10. We rate this Facebook post False.","[('Facebook post, Nov. 10, 2020', 'https://archive.is/FF1u8'), ('Decision Desk HQ, ""2020 General Elections,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('The New York Times, ""Presidential Election Results: Biden Wins,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/'), ('The Washington Post, accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('Reuters, ""U.S. Election Results,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html'), ('CNN, ""Presidential Results,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('ABC News, ""Election 2020 Results and Live Updates,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/RESULTS-LIVE-US/jbyprxelqpe/'), ('CBS News, ""Presidential Results,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('NBC News, ""U.S. Presidential Election Results 2020: Biden wins,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president'), ('Fox News, ""Presidential Election Results,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Associated Press, ""AP Explains: Election’s validity intact despite Trump claims,"" Nov. 11, 2020', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Elections/2020-us-presidential-election-results-live-map/'), ('The Associated Press, ""How We Call Races,"" accessed Nov. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('Dave Wasserman on Twitter, Nov. 10, 2020', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/election/2020/president/'), ('The New York Times, ""The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud,"" Nov. 10, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Wall Street Journal, ""No Evidence of Systematic Fraud in U.S. Elections, International Observer Mission Reports,"" Nov. 9, 2020', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/president-results'), ('The New York Times, ""Tracking Which News Outlets Have Called the Presidential Race in Each State,"" Nov. 7, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Associated Press, ""EXPLAINING RACE CALLS: How AP called the race for Biden,"" Nov. 7, 2020', 'https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results'), ('The Washington Post, ""First CNN, then within minutes, most other news organizations called the race for Biden,"" Nov. 7, 2020', 'No link'), ('Donald J.

No 'planned theft of the election' in Detroit
","A viral video shared by Big League Politics, an online news outlet that describes itself as a source for ""hard-hitting investigative political journalism,"" falsely claims that Detroit election workers were instructed to meddle in the election. For weeks, the website, which has promoted conspiracy theories before, published audio recordings it says are from Detroit election worker trainings as part of its #DetroitLeaks series. The video — which has been removed from YouTube but was preserved by Big League Politics on a video hosting site known for sharing conspiratorial content — stitches the audio together to claim that ""multiple Detroit pollworker trainings were audio-recorded, which reveal the mechanisms of the planned theft of the election."" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office confirmed that it sent a cease and desist letter to Big League Politics. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In an article that has since been removed from the Big League Politics website, reporter Shane Trejo wrote that the video detailed ""explosive evidence of election trainers in the city of Detroit telling poll workers how to lie to voters, destroy ballots, and disenfranchise poll challengers on election day."" But the audio recordings — the latest in a string of misinformation related to the election in Michigan — do not point to anything nefarious, despite the video’s ominous-sounding music. President Donald Trump received nearly 5,000 more votes from Detroit this most recent election compared to his 2016 performance, according to the city’s unofficial results. Meanwhile, president-elect Joe Biden underperformed in Detroit compared to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton who won nearly 1,000 more votes than Biden based on Detroit’s unofficial results. Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said the snippets in the video were misused. ""What was recorded and shared was taken out of context. All laws were followed in training of election workers, in full compliance,"" she said. Text appearing in the video describes what it alleges Detroit election workers were told to do followed by audio and transcripts of election worker trainings to support each claim. We looked at the supposed instructions one by one and found that taken together, they do not support the claim that Detroit election workers were trained to help steal the election: This is not the advice that the trainer imparted. In the audio, the trainer is heard telling poll workers that all challengers have to wear masks and practice social distancing. At one point the trainer joked that unless challengers have really good vision or brought binoculars, they would not be able to see what election workers are doing. However, even with social distancing, hundreds of challengers were able to monitor Detroit’s absentee ballot count and challenge voters’ eligibility to cast a ballot. In the video, an election worker is heard asking what steps should be taken if election challengers cause a scene. The trainer says to call the police. Challengers have to abide by conduct standards, the trainer explains. On the day before the election when Detroit election workers began processing absentee ballots, two election challengers were escorted out of the counting room by the police. One challenger was wearing a horror movie mask and caused a disruption while a Republican challenger refused to properly wear her face mask. Wednesday afternoon, police had to push back an angry crowd of Republican poll challengers who had been prohibited from entering the counting room after the number of Republican, Democratic and nonpartisan challengers reached the limit allowed under state law. Over 100 Republican challengers remained in the room to monitor the count.  In text that scrolls over the screen, the video claims that election workers were instructed to ""process challenged ballots as regular ballots to be counted."" That’s a mischaracterization. In an audio recording, a trainer is heard saying that in order to record a ballot as challenged, election workers should place the ballot in a secrecy sleeve and cover the ballot number with a Post-It. The trainer goes on to say that after election workers have taken these steps, a voter can go vote as normal. Voters whose eligibility is challenged on the basis of age, residency or citizenship can, in fact, receive a ballot and vote as normal after showing proof of eligibility or swearing under oath that they meet the requirements. Even after a challenged voter’s eligibility has been established, their ballot is specially marked — in ink below the barcode and covered with tape — and labeled in the electronic poll book.   That’s not the instruction. In the recording, the trainer lays out the process for handling a newly registered voter who is not listed in the electronic poll book used by inspectors to check registrations. Michigan allows registration right up to 8 p.m. on Election Day. The trainer explains that since the voter records are downloaded to the electronic poll book the Saturday before Election Day, newly registered voters would not yet be listed. Those voters are given a receipt to present to poll workers on Election Day as evidence that they registered. The receipt indicates whether the voter needs to present any additional ID to confirm their eligibility. Poll workers can then add the voter manually to the rolls. The video claims, ""Anyone with the know-how could generate thousands of fake late registration receipts."" Voters have to present ID when they vote or sign an affidavit affirming they are eligible. Falsifying a voter registration receipt is a crime. Meanwhile, voters manually added to the rolls are recorded separately in the poll book so they can be rechecked against records later. By law, 16- and 17-year-olds can work as election inspectors, but not as the precinct chairperson. In the audio recording, the trainer says that young people who can’t stay out late for the final duties on Election Day — returning the sealed ballot containers and other records and equipment to the local receiving board — should tell the chairperson, so another adult can help with that. The video seems to imply that this opens the door for someone to tamper with election materials. Election materials are safeguarded by election workers, and state rules require ballots and other election materials to be delivered — in sealed containers and envelopes — to the receiving board by one precinct inspector affiliated with the Democratic Party and another affiliated with the Republican Party. That’s wrong; troubleshooters are available. In the recording, a trainer explains that on Election Day, election workers will be able to call designated troubleshooters should any issues arise. The trainer says, ""Honestly speaking, it’s going to be hard to get ahold of someone, because there’s going to be ten people calling us at the same time."" This is typical since Election Day is a busy time for election officials who are often running around the city to make sure the voting process is running smoothly. It may be difficult to immediately get in touch with officials, but that does not mean that election workers did not or could not get help on Election Day. This is misleading. The trainer in the video is heard discussing what election workers should do if a voter shows up to vote in person on Election Day if the clerk has already received the voter’s absentee ballot. The trainer tells election workers, ""do not issue him a ballot."" The trainer explains that voters are only allowed to vote once and that if a voter already cast an absentee ballot, they cannot vote again in person on Election Day. If the voter insists that they did not already vote, the trainer explains that the chairperson can issue the voter a provisional ballot that will not go through the tabulator to be counted and will be destroyed if the voter already voted absentee. This is common practice for provisional ballots, which are kept out of the count pending confirmation that they were legally cast. Challenged voters, by contrast, receive ballots only after poll workers receive proof or sworn affirmation that the voter is eligible and registered. Their ballots are specially marked and recorded in the electronic poll book, then tabulated normally. A viral video claims that Detroit election worker trainings ""reveal the mechanisms of the planned theft of the election."" The trainings do not indicate any coordinated effort to meddle in the election. Rather they describe customary practices for handling voters and ballots in accordance with the state’s election rules. We rate the video’s claim False.","[('Big League Politics, Facebook About, accessed Nov. 9, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/BigLeaguePolitics/about/?ref=page_internal'), ('Big League Politics, Shane Trejo, ""BANNED BY GOOGLE: #DetroitLeaks Video Showing Evidence of Electoral Fraud is Removed From Youtube,"" Oct. 30, 2020', 'No link'), ('Bit Chute, ""#DETROITLEAKS: State Employees Train Poll Workers to Lie to Voters, Destroy Ballots, Stop Challenger,"" Oct. 30, 2020', 'https://bigleaguepolitics.com/banned-by-google-detroitleaks-video-showing-evidence-of-electoral-fraud-is-removed-from-youtube/'), ('The Detroit Free Press, Tresa Baldas, Kristen Jordan Shamus, Niraj Warikoo, M.L.

","Viral posts on social media falsely claim that conservative website Judicial Watch published a story called ""Quantum Blockchain System Recount of Votes,"" a piece that alleges without evidence that ""elite"" National Guard units were recounting votes and found that President Donald Trump won re-election. A screenshot of the supposed story on Instagram displays ""Judicial Watch"" at the top and says: ""A recount of voting ballots nationwide was being done by elite units of the National Guard by early Sun. morning 8 Nov. To prevent fraud official ballots had been printed with an invisible, unbreakable code watermark and registered on a Quantum Blockchain System. ""As of this writing, in five states 14 million ballots had been put through a laser scanner - 78% of which failed because there was no watermark to verify the ballot. Of those that failed 100% had checked for Biden. ""An initial test showed that according to water marks on validated ballots fed into the Quantum Computer, Trump won re-election by over 80% of the legal ballot cast. The final validated vote tallied in that test: Trump 73.5 million votes to Biden's 25.9 million - and that didn't even account for Trump votes that people observed being tossed and never accounted for.""

The National Guard recount story is a different version of a QAnon-related conspiracy theory that baselessly claimed the Trump administration, with the help of the Department of Homeland Security, secretly watermarked official ballots to set up Democrats (who allegedly aimed to cheat). The federal government has no role in designing, printing or auditing ballots — the responsibility lies with state and local governments — and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, said there is no truth to the rumor.

Video shows spoiled ballots that were legally destroyed and discarded
","A video that’s being shared widely on social media seems to support the unfounded claim that President Donald Trump’s re-election hopes were dashed by election fraud, but the facts don’t bear that out.  The video shows two men, one of whom describes himself as ""a huge Trump supporter,"" who say they discovered ballots for Trump while taking the trash out at a wedding held at what was formerly a polling place for the 2020 election.

Bells in France, fireworks in London weren’t celebrating Joe Biden
","After Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, social media users and even some American news organizations inaccurately characterized certain events overseas as celebrations of his victory. One post, shared on Facebook, reads: ""CHURCH BELLS ARE RINGING IN PARIS...FIREWORKS GOING OFF IN LONDON AS WORLD CELEBRATES...!!"" Another shared a Twitter screenshot that said, ""Love the other countries celebrating Trump losing like we defeated the mothership in Independence Day."" Some circulated the bells claim alongside a video from France that showed the Paris skyline with the sound of bells ringing in the background. Folks may have been celebrating in London and church bells may have been ringing in France, but neither were about the results of the U.S. presidential election. Fireworks in London had been going off for several days in celebration of the Nov. 5 British holiday Guy Fawkes Day. And the church bells in a Paris suburb were reportedly sounding out for mass. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A fact-check by French newspaper Libération concluded that the church bells rang not in Paris, but in Meudon, a suburb. The paper said the bells were automatically programmed to ring to announce 6 p.m. mass. The Paris Diocese and the Diocese of Nanterre, another Paris suburb, also confirmed to the Associated Press that their churches did not ring bells for Biden, saying any bells heard in greater Paris on Nov. 7 were likely calls to prayer. The French government recently banned most religious services amid rising COVID-19 cases, but some churches still had their bells programmed. ""This is the case for the bells of the Notre-Dame de l’Assomption church in Meudon, which can be seen and heard in a video shared on social media by a resident of the city,"" the Diocese of Nanterre said in a statement. ""As every Saturday evening at 5:45 p.m., bells of Notre-Dame de l’Assomption church in Meudon rang to announce the Mass at 6 p.m."" The announcement that Biden was projected to win came Nov. 7, at 11:25 a.m Eastern time in the U.S., which is 5:25 p.m. in France. As for the fireworks in London, each year in early November families across the United Kingdom gather to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day, also called Bonfire Night, commemorating the failure of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, an assassination plot against the royal family and British government. The official holiday falls on Nov. 5, but there are typically fireworks in the days before and after, especially when the date falls on a weekday. It’s unclear whether any of the fireworks heard in London were related to the U.S. election, but there’s no evidence they were primarily set off in response to Biden’s win. We rate this post False.

Matt Schlapp’s baseless claim that 9,000 Nevada mail ballots are illegitimate
","As supporters of President Donald Trump ramp up their efforts to delegitimize the election with unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud, one high-profile Republican ally claimed that 9,000 Nevada ballots were fraudulently cast by nonresidents. ""We have literally 9,000 people who voted in this election who don’t live in Nevada,"" American Conservative Union chair Matt Schlapp told Fox News on Nov. 8, wrongly claiming the election has seen widespread ""fraud"" and ""illegality"" but offering no proof to support his allegations. Schlapp also cited the 9,000 figure during a press conference the same day, telling a crowd of Trump supporters that many ""non-Nevadans"" had been caught illegally voting in the state.  Schlapp’s allegation earned a shoutout from Trump, who tweeted that Nevada was ""a cesspool of fake votes."" Schlapp has continued repeating the claim since.  Nevada is turning out to be a cesspool of Fake Votes. @mschlapp & @AdamLaxalt are finding things that, when released, will be absolutely shocking! But there is no proof that 9,000 people cast illegal ballots in Nevada after moving out of state, and there remains no evidence of any widespread voter fraud in Nevada or elsewhere. President-elect Joe Biden led Trump by more than 36,000 votes in Nevada as of this writing.  Schlapp’s 9,000 number derives in part from another unproven claim from the Trump campaign and Republicans in Nevada, who argued days earlier that there were 3,062 instances of voter fraud stemming from cases in which people moved out of Nevada but still voted in the state. Trump campaign attorneys sent U.S. Attorney General William Barr a list of 3,062 unnamed individuals who they claimed voted in Nevada after moving out of state. A recent lawsuit also referenced ""over 3,000 instances of ineligible individuals casting ballots."" The campaign’s list showed ZIP codes for voters’ current and previous addresses, but it left out other personally identifying information. The lawyers said they formed it by cross-referencing the list of general election voters in Nevada with publicly available change-of-address records. But the list alone did not prove that anyone had violated the law, as we reported. That’s because people who move within 30 days before an election can legally cast a ballot in their new state — or in their prior state of residence — in-person or via absentee ballot. Nevadans who leave the state to attend college or other reasons can also request a ballot.  The list from Trump’s lawyers also included addresses for Americans serving overseas in the military and their spouses, including some people who have since spoken out.  The ACLU of Nevada said the list showed changes of address for people who moved to military bases, including at least 129 Army or Air Post Office addresses, 13 Fleet Post Offices and 15 Diplomatic Post Offices, according to the Wall Street Journal. There are other addresses on the list, the Journal reported, that the ACLU said are located in cities near military hubs. ""This list they’re talking about has been debunked as having, for example, having military personnel on there who are serving overseas and have the right to vote,"" Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, said on Fox News Nov. 7. ""It could include Mormon missionaries on that list. It could also include college students on that list."" Any registered voter in Nevada could request to vote by mail in 2020, according to the website for the Nevada secretary of state. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and nearly 75% of Nevada’s population, has so far referred just three cases of potential fraud to the Nevada secretary of state’s office, said county spokesperson Dan Kulin. None of the three cases involved an ineligible voter from out of state.  A county election worker scans mail-in ballots at a tabulating area as an observer watches at the Clark County Election Department on Nov. 5, 2020, in Las Vegas. (AP) How did Schlapp get from the campaign’s list of 3,062 out-of-state voters to 9,000?  His number relies on back-of-the-envelope math and some major assumptions, including the assumption that everyone who mailed in a ballot was ineligible to do so. There are no signs of a new, bigger list that includes 9,000 changes of address or voter names. An American Conservative Union spokesperson said Schlapp had projected that the number of people who illegally voted from outside Nevada was actually three times as large as the 3,062 people originally alleged. The spokesperson said that’s because only one-third of people report changes of address to the national database maintained by the U.S. Postal Service. ""The 3,000 that we came up with, we believe that that is two-thirds shy of the actual number because most people don’t go to the post office to change their address,"" Schlapp said in a Nov. 9 interview with former White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But Martha Johnson, a spokesperson for the Postal Service, said the service was ""unable to confirm"" that only one-third of people report when they change their address. ""The USPS processed approximately 36 million change of addresses"" in 2020, Johnson said. Schlapp has not backed his claims up with any hard evidence. Even if 9,000 absentee voters did mail in ballots to Nevada from out of state, there’s no proof any of them did so illegally, as he claimed. A spokesperson for Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, declined to comment on Schlapp’s specific claims but pointed to a statement. It said Nevada is investigating all credible allegations of fraud but noted that ""many voter fraud complaints lack any evidence."" Nevada law does allow the residency of registered voters to be challenged, including for people who have moved, the Nevada Independent reported. But that law would have required that an affidavit be filed by the challenger with the county clerk in advance of the election. Schlapp claimed that as an example of voter fraud, ""we have literally 9,000 people who voted in this election (in Nevada) who don’t live in Nevada."" Schlapp has acknowledged that his 9,000 figure is not a literal count of illegal out-of-state voters. It is a speculative estimate he came up with based on a list of 3,062 individuals produced by the Trump campaign — a list that had its own problems.  The original list included military personnel in its count and did not establish that any of the people it identified were actually ineligible to vote in Nevada. The burden of proof is on the speaker, and Schlapp has provided no credible evidence to substantiate his claim.  We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

"['Abortion', 'North Carolina', 'Dean Arp']","
What does NC abortion bill require of doctors?
","A proposed North Carolina abortion law has critics concerned about how it might affect the doctor-patient relationship. House Bill 453 aims to stop people from having abortions because they’re unhappy with the child’s sex, race, or Down Syndrome diagnosis.  Bill supporters say it would help prevent discrimination. Meanwhile, critics worry that it could discourage patients from seeking abortions if they feel their motives will be subject to scrutiny.  Sex selection is already banned in North Carolina. This bill would not only ban abortions sought for race selection or for Down Syndrome, but would go a step further than the current law by requiring practitioners to ""confirm"" that the patient’s motives aren’t discriminatory. In a June 2 Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, state Sen. Natasha Marcus (D-Mecklenburg) asked bill sponsor Dean Arp (R-Union) a series of questions about how the bill might affect a doctor’s interactions with her patient. Arp suggested the bill isn’t designed to be intrusive, saying at different times: ""We’re not requiring the doctors to say or do anything here. … We’re not controlling the speech of the doctor. … Quite simply, this bill doesn’t compel doctor’s speech at all. … We don’t govern the conversation between the doctor and the patient."" Arp later corrected his statement about doctors not being required to ""say or do anything,"" since the bill would require practitioners to submit a report to the state’s health department. However, given the concerns of advocates, we wondered about his other statements.  Would the bill ""control"" or ""compel"" a doctor’s speech, or ""govern the conversation between the doctor and the patient?"" Put simply, the bill does not tell doctors specifically what to say. However, experts believe it puts doctors in the position of asking patients about their motives for seeking abortions, or else risk puttting their own professional careers on the line by making a judgement call about the patient’s motives without having asked. North Carolina’s bill is similar to others that have been introduced and even enacted that attempt to stop women from having abortions if they’re unhappy with their baby’s sex, race or medical diagnosis. PolitiFact partner WRAL has covered North Carolina’s bill as it moved through the legislature to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk, where it currently sits unsigned.  North Carolina’s bill falls in the middle of the abortion law strictness spectrum, with Arkansas on the stricter end and Ohio having more lenient language. The Arkansas law, which the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down, specifically required a practitioner to ""ask the pregnant woman if she is aware of any test results, prenatal diagnosis, or any other evidence that the unborn child may have Down Syndrome."" Ohio’s law, which is also working its way through the courts, blocks practitioners from performing abortions ""if the (practitioner) has knowledge"" that the patient is seeking an abortion for discriminatory reasons. It doesn’t instruct practitioners to question their patients or use the word ""confirm."" North Carolina’s bill is similar to an abortion law in Mississippi, which requires doctors to ""confirm"" a patient’s motives but doesn’t instruct them what to ask. We wanted to know how the bill affects Mississippi practitioners. So we called and emailed the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which is the only remaining abortion clinic left in Mississippi.  Nora Franco, a spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Mississippi’s bill has definitely prompted new conversations between practitioners and patients. ""The law has forced the Mississippi clinic to confirm with their patients they are not seeking abortions for prohibited reasons and to turn away some patients — which they would not have had to do absent this law, which, again, does nothing to address the discrimination politicians claims it addresses,"" she said. In a 25-minute telephone interview with PolitiFact, Arp said bill authors tried ""desperately"" not to dictate how medical practices should operate. He contrasted the bill to a previous North Carolina law known as the Woman’s Right to Know Act. That law, passed in 2011, required practitioners to show their patient an ultrasound and describe the images in detail before performing an abortion. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014 struck down the law on grounds that it ""compelled speech"" and violated the First Amendment. That ultrasound law ""forces physicians to say things they otherwise would not say,"" a judge wrote. The U.S. Supreme Court later declined to take up the case. Arp told PolitiFact that he doesn’t view North Carolina’s latest bill as compelled speech because it doesn’t specifically tell doctors to say anything. The bill instructs practitioners to find out the answer to the question: Did the patient seek an abortion for discriminatory reasons? But it doesn’t tell them how to answer the question. Where some see the bill’s vague directive as a negative, Arp sees it as a positive.  ""How they determine (the answer) totally lies within themselves and I imagine each doctor would be different in their comfort level in addressing that question,"" Arp said. ""Nothing in here stops a doctor from saying what a doctor wants and nothing in here compels the doctor to tell a patient anything."" ""I don't doubt that the doctor could ask (about a patient’s motives) if the doctor felt that that's what they needed to do to be accurate and conform to the reporting mechanism,"" he said.  Alternatively, he suggested a doctor could get around having the conversation with the patient if they presented the patient with, say, a paper questionnaire. ""It could be a form that they give on (patient) intake, where people go down through and they just say check, check, check, check, check,"" he said. Even if the patient were presented with such a form, that does not mean that the patient would answer it, which would leave the ball in the physician’s court to inquire through conversation. And a judge may not share Arp’s view that the bill doesn’t qualify as compelled speech, said Laurie Sobel, an attorney and associate director of women’s health policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation studies health and healthcare policies. ""The word ‘confirm’ could reasonably be interpreted to compel speech to ask,"" Sobel said. Unless a doctor asks about a patient’s motives, or the patient divulges them voluntarily, she said practitioners are left to make a judgement on their own. ""I don’t think the medical record does anything to show intent,"" Sobel said. Multiple experts told us they don’t see how a North Carolina practitioner would ""confirm"" a patient’s motives without asking them. Not only does the bill require practitioners to confirm that their patient doesn’t have discriminatory motives, it also requires practitioners record ""a statement"" saying that they have ""reason to believe that the woman did not seek the abortion"" for those specified reasons. Experts said the fact that a patient’s motives would be recorded by the state puts extra pressure on practitioners to accurately document them, and more likely to directly ask about them. ""If the outcome (of noncompliance with the law) is a penalty, and then there's other pieces of documentation that have to happen, you’re saying, ‘You have to talk to the patient about this,’"" said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate for the Guttmacher Institute. Dr. Jonas Swartz, an obstetrician who practices at Duke Health, pointed out that the bill changes the state’s expectations of doctors under the current law prohibiting certain abortions.  The current law says, ""Nothing in this section shall be construed as placing an affirmative duty on a physician to inquire as to whether the sex of the unborn child is a significant factor in the pregnant woman seeking the abortion."" The proposed law crosses out that part. ""As a clinician, my understanding of what (the bill) says is that I would have to ask the patient if she were having an abortion for any of these reasons and then document their response,"" Swartz said in a phone interview, speaking on his personal behalf and not of the hospital. A practitioner may feel even more pressure to record a patient’s exact reason for an abortion if the unborn child has multiple health issues in addition to Down Syndrome, said Mary Ziegler, a reproductive rights expert at Florida State University. ""Most physicians in that situation might feel like they have to ask to avoid potential legal liability,"" Ziegler said in a phone interview. Overall, the bill ""is not straightforward. It’s clearly not a situation where you can say firmly that it doesn’t require anyone to do anything and it isn’t compelled speech. It’s ambiguous,"" Ziegler said. ""Whether a bill like this compels speech is something lawyers would disagree about and courts will probably have to resolve."" Arp said North Carolina’s abortion bill would not ""control"" or ""compel"" the speech of the doctor and that the bill does not ""don’t govern the conversation between the doctor and the patient."" Arp has a point that the bill doesn’t tell abortion practitioners specifically what to say to patients about this law.  However, it’s misleading to say the bill doesn’t govern a conversation between a doctor and patient.

Did Biden ‘import’ Iranian oil? It was seized, not bought
","A blog post widely shared on Facebook claimed that President Joe Biden imported oil from Iran and called the deal ""pure evil."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""PURE EVIL: Biden Imports Oil from Iran After Shutting Down Keystone Pipeline and Putting US Oil Workers Out of Work,"" read the headline on an article from The Gateway Pundit written by Jim Hoft. Hoft’s @gatewaypundit Twitter account was permanently suspended in February for ""repeated violations"" of Twitter’s policies on election-related messages, according to news reports. But the headline misleads: The oil was seized, not purchased. The article refers to another Gateway Pundit article that links to a two-paragraph news story by Reuters in the Financial Post.  Reuters, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, reported that the U.S. in March imported 1 million barrels of Iranian crude, despite sanctions on Iran’s energy sector, in only the second such oil import since late 1991. Technically, the oil was imported to the U.S. But this was no ordinary transaction. A longer version of the story on Reuters’ website explained that the Iranian crude came from the Liberian-flagged tanker MT Achilleas. The oil landed in Texas a month after U.S. authorities seized the MT Achilleas, which ""was in line with tough economic sanctions imposed by Washington on Tehran over its nuclear program and the U.S. designation of a number of Iranian groups as terrorist organizations."" An Associated Press story added context. When the Energy Information Administration data was released May 28, it raised the eyebrows of commodities traders because of the sanctions, according to the story. But as the AP explained: ""The oil came from the MT Achilleas, a ship seized in February by the U.S. off the coast of the Emirati port city of Fujairah. U.S court documents allege the Achilleas was subject to forfeiture under American anti-terrorism statues as Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard tried to use it to sell crude oil to China. The U.S. has identified the Guard as a terrorist organization since the administration of former President Donald Trump. Prosecutors say shippers tried to disguise the shipment by labeling it as ‘Basra light crude’ from neighboring Iraq."" The U.S. brought the Achilleas to Houston, where it sold the oil, according to AP. Trump’s administration did a similar seizure. In August, it confiscated cargo in vessels allegedly loaded with Iranian fuel in violation of sanctions and sent them to Houston. Biden in January signed an executive order revoking the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, halting its construction in the U.S. TC Energy Corp., the Canadian company that owns the Keystone XL with the Alberta government, said at the time it would lay off 1,000 or more workers, and had previously estimated that the pipeline would employ 11,000 Americans in 2021.

No, New York didn’t lift COVID-19 restrictions because of a Cuomo wedding
","On Tuesday, June 15, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that state-mandated COVID-19 restrictions would be lifted immediately because New York had reached an important milestone: 70% of adults have received at least the first dose of a vaccine. But it didn’t take long for some social media users to start speculating that the governor had a more personal rationale for lifting the restrictions.  ""Cuomo opens New York 72 hours before his daughter's wedding SUCKERS,"" reads one Facebook post shared hours after Cuomo’s announcement. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is there any truth to the claim? No. Cuomo’s daughters aren’t getting married this weekend, and restrictions were lifted only because New York met its vaccination goal. None of Cuomo’s three daughters are getting married any time soon ""as far as we know,"" said Rich Azzopardi, director of communications and senior advisor to Cuomo. He explained that 70% of adults being vaccinated was a ""benchmark for opening,"" and said the administration was ""excited to reach that mark on Tuesday."" When making the announcement, Cuomo cited the Biden administration’s goal of giving 70% of adults nationwide at least the first dose of a vaccine by July 4.  ""It is the national goal and we hit it ahead of schedule,"" Cuomo said. ""What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it. [...] The state mandates that have proven right and correct and brought us through the pandemic are relaxed as of today, effective immediately."" Claims about a Cuomo wedding have been circulating on social media for weeks. Azzopardi, and journalists working to debunk the claims pointed out that they were based on a decades-old article. ""The source of all this is a Buffalo News clip,"" Azzopardi said, noting that the story was from 1993. The article, dated May 15, 1993, is titled, ""Cuomo daughter to wed judge’s son on June 12."" The story refers to Madeline Cuomo — Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s sister. At the time, Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo’s father, was the governor of New York. In other words, Azzopardi said, the article that prompted the social media posts was about ""the wrong Governor Cuomo."" A Facebook user claimed, ""Cuomo opens New York 72 hours before his daughter's wedding."" None of Cuomo’s daughters are getting married this weekend or plan to in the near future.

No sign spike proteins from COVID-19 vaccines, including Novavax, are dangerous
","Following news that a COVID-19 vaccine from drug maker Novavax has been found in a trial to be 90% effective, a widely shared social media post alleged that the vaccine is dangerous.  The post came from Jane Ruby in response to a tweet about a June 14 New York Times story about Novavax announcing the results of a 29,960-person clinical trial in the U.S. and Mexico.  The vaccine contains a ""dangerous spike protein,"" Ruby tweeted. ""Novavax injection just dumps millions of spike proteins right into your body."" Ruby adds: ""Can’t wait to see all the myocarditis from that."" There’s no evidence to support the claim that spike protein is dangerous. The spike proteins produced as a result of vaccination help stimulate the body’s defenses against COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls them ""harmless."" Ruby, whose Twitter account identifies her as ""Dr. Jane Ruby,"" is not a medical doctor. She describes herself as a health economist and ""New Right political pundit"" with a doctorate in psychology. Her LinkedIn profile shows he has a background in pharmaceutical research and nursing. We messaged Ruby via Twitter but didn’t get a reply. We have fact-checked other spike protein claims, finding that there is no evidence they present any serious health risk on their own.  We rated False a claim by Canadian viral immunologist Byram Bridle that the COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein means people are being inoculated ""with a toxin."" Experts said there is no evidence that the vaccines produce a toxin that could cause heart problems and neurological damage, as Bridle alleged. We also rated False a claim that COVID-19 vaccines’ ""spike protein is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic,"" which means toxic to cells. U.S. public health authorities and vaccine experts said there is no evidence that the vaccines’ spike protein is toxic or ""cytotoxic.""  Ruby’s mention of myocarditis alludes to reports of a higher-than-expected number of cases of heart inflammation developing in mostly young people after they received doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which use a different mechanism than the Novavax vaccine to induce an immune response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it will convene an emergency meeting on June 18 to discuss a possible link between the condition and the vaccines. Other health organizations, like the European Medicines Agency, are also investigating. So far, there’s no conclusive evidence that these cases are caused by the vaccines or the spike proteins. Novavax, which is seeking to become the fourth company with a vaccine approved for use in the U.S., said the trial showed its vaccine ""demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall."" The company said it plans to seek regulatory authorizations during the third quarter of 2021 and expects to be able to manufacture 100 million doses per month by the end of the quarter. A spokesperson for Novavax said its vaccine is derived from the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. ""It is a harmless protein that can neither replicate nor can it cause COVID-19,"" she said. ""It ‘teaches’ your immune system to recognize the virus so that when exposed to the real thing, your body is prepared to mount an effective immune response."" The protein-based Novavax vaccine is similar in its approach to the influenza vaccine Flublok, containing a single viral protein, the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee. ""This protein has not been shown to be dangerous,"" he said. ""It's just a single viral protein similar to the hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines, and are remarkably safe.""  ""The SARS-CoV-2 virus, on the other hand, reproduces itself thousands of times, and is incredibly dangerous."" The National Institutes of Health said data from the trial ""indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated.""

Fact-checking a claim on dandelion root extract as a cancer remedy
","Dandelion root extract is purported to hold many health benefits, such as supplying antioxidants and reducing cholesterol. But a sweeping claim on social media about its effectiveness as a cancer remedy calls for a dose of skepticism. ""Did you know? Dandelion root is able to kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours,"" an Instagram post reads. ""Not only that, but it acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory, immunity booster, antioxidant and organ detoxifier."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim about cancer cells appears to draw on real scientific studies of dandelion root extract as a natural aid in fighting cancer. But it leaves out important context about the nature of the research and its conclusions.  This isn’t the first time such a claim has circulated. In September 2016, Snopes rated ""mostly false"" a headline on an article from the website Health Eternally, which referenced a testimonial from John Di Carlo, a 72-year-old man in Canada, who told the Canadian broadcaster CBC that he had gone into remission from leukemia after drinking dandelion tea. The Health Eternally article said ""studies have shown"" the extract to kill cancer cells within 48 hours, but it didn’t cite specific research.  Health Eternally also referenced a 2012 CBC interview with Dr. Caroline Hamm, medical oncologist at the Windsor Cancer Research Group, in which she spoke about the promise of dandelion root extract.  Hamm studied the extract’s effects on cancer cells and published a case report about a patient who had used the root in a tea with favorable results. But she warned that the tea didn’t work for everyone and that taking the extract could interfere with regular chemotherapy.  Despite her warnings, false claims began circulating about the extract as a cancer fighter. In 2017, CBC reported that Hamm had received numerous emails and calls from cancer patients who believed that they should stop all medications and only use dandelion root extract.  ""It’s just very sad that people do this,"" Hamm told CBC. ""It’s really unfortunate for patients who believe it. It offers false hope."" The numbers in the Instagram post appear to align with findings of a November 2016 study by researchers at the University of Windsor in Ontario. They found that dandelion root extract ""induced program cell death (PCD) selectively in (more than) 95% of colon cancer cells ... by 48 hours of treatment."" The study was published in the journal Oncotarget. In an interview with USA Today, Siyaram Pandey, a chemistry and biochemistry professor who co-authored that study, pointed out that this finding was based on a study of cells in a petri dish, not cancer in the human body. A 2019 University of Windsor study published in an alternative-medicine journal from Hindawi found that both dandelion root and lemongrass extracts, when used with chemotherapy treatments, can help induce the death of prostate cancer cells in mice. This study, which also included Pandey as a co-author, warns that ""their efficacy on prostate cancer and their interactions with standard chemotherapeutics have not been studied to determine if they will be suitable for adjuvant therapies,"" meaning follow-up treatment to prevent recurrence of the cancer. Pandey’s LinkedIn profile and various other articles about his research identify him as chief scientific officer of a company called Windsor Botanical Therapeutics since 2014.   Pandey told PolitiFact that Canadian regulators approved clinical trials of dandelion root extract for cancer patients as far back as 2013, but researchers had trouble recruiting subjects, and funding dried up.  A University of Windsor study found that the extract killed over 95% of colon cancer cells in 48 hours, but this study was done on cells in a petri dish, not in the human body.  In 2019, a separate study found that both dandelion root and lemongrass extract can boost the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments in killing prostate cancer cells in mice, but the study didn’t look at whether they were effective in stopping the recurrence of tumors. Human clinical trials of dandelion root extract as a cancer treatment have been approved, but they haven’t been able to recruit enough patients.  The claim contains an element of truth, but leaves out important context that could give a different impression.

Six years ago today, Hunter lost his dad, and I lost my son."" Biden has a son named Hunter, but despite the impression the video might leave, Biden was referring in that speech to his grandson who goes by the name Hunter Biden, not to his son.. Biden was speaking in his home state of Delaware at a Memorial Day service on May 30, the day before the holiday. He opened his remarks with a reference to Hunter and noted that earlier in the day, a memorial Mass was held for his late son Beau who died from brain cancer in 2015.  Then he said: ""Folks, it’s also an important tradition in our family. As many of you know, this is a hard day for us. Six years ago today, Hunter lost his dad, and I lost my son."" A USA Today story said Joe Biden’s reference was to his grandson Hunter, and a New York Post story said the grandson accompanied Biden at the service. A Reuters news photo shows Biden’s grandson seated beside him at the service.

Are more people leaving Virginia for other states than moving in?
","Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin says recent Democratic governors have pushed Virginia into economic decline and people are moving out. ""Over the last few years, more Virginians are moving away from Virginia than are moving to Virginia from the other 49 states,"" he said during a May 21 interview on WRVA radio in Richmond.  Youngkin holds two Democrats responsible: Current Gov. Ralph Northam and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who led the state from 2014-2018 and is Youngkin’s opponent this year. Virginia is the only state that bars governors from serving successive terms. We fact-checked Youngkin’s talking-point claim that more people are leaving Virginia than coming in and found it to be correct, although the reasons for the outward migration go far beyond any governor’s control. The numbers The Internal Revenue Service publishes annual statistics on the number of households that moved and filed federal tax returns from a different state than the one in which they lived the previous year. Demographers and economists use these figures to track the ""net migration"" of families in the U.S. from year to year. The data show that from 1991 through 2012, Virginia always had more households coming in than going out. That changed in 2013, when there was a net loss of 4,270 households. Virginia had fewer filing households in each of the next five years - an average annual loss of 5,600 families. In 2018, the last year for which figures are available, Virginia lost a net of 4,707 households. This doesn’t mean there’s been a massive flow out of Virginia. To give some perspective, about 4 million Virginia households annually file federal taxes. The net losses to other states in 2018 came to less than one-eighth of 1% of households.  The U.S. Census Bureau also tracks net migration. It estimates that Virginia lost a net 11,994 people through domestic migration during the 12-month period that ended July 1, 2019.  The reasons Jobs were the main reason people left Virginia for other states at the start of the last decade. That switched to the rising cost of living at the end of the decade, according to economic and demographic studies.  Virginia is home to large military bases, and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers that drive the state’s economic engine in Northern Virginia. The region was hurt by sequestration programs beginning in 2013 that automatically cut defense and domestic spending when Congress could not agree on a budget. The result was that many Virginians whose paychecks were dependent on federal spending, particularly for defense, left the state to find new jobs, according to a 2016 report by Old Dominion University.  More recently, the migration has been mainly triggered by people escaping the high cost of living in Northern Virginia, according to Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. They are largely young professionals seeking to buy first homes and raise families. Many are heading South to growing regions in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas. Lombard also said that Virginia is losing retirees, mostly to Southern states. Youngkin blames the migration losses on McAuliffe and Northam.He prefaced his claim by saying he is ""frustrated with what the Democratic leadership had done to Virginia over eight years."" But Lombard said the governors have had little control over the economic trends that have caused losses. ""Think of the cost of housing; the state has little control of that,"" he said. ""If you could point to anything that could have been done on the state level over the years, maybe it could have focused on making more of Virginia (economically) competitive outside Northern Virginia,"" Lombard said. Our ruling Youngkin said, ""Over the last few years, more Virginians are moving away from Virginia than are moving to Virginia from the other 49 states."" IRS data backs him up. But Youngkin wraps the data in a questionable political context. He blames the last two Democratic governors for the net migration loss when research shows most of the drop has been caused by problems largely beyond any governor's control: federal budget cuts and high prices for buying a home in Northern Virginia. Youngkin’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. So, we rate it Mostly True.  ","[('Glenn Youngkin, WRVA interview, May 24, 2021 (4:40 mark).', 'https://www.audacy.com/newsradiowrva/podcasts/richmonds-morning-news-20797/glenn-youngkin-may-21-2021-381636395'), ('Youngkin, WINA interview, May 13, 2021 (3:55 mark).', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Virginia, ""Nikki Haley: \'More people today are leaving Virginia than moving in,\'"" May 17, 2016.', 'https://wina.com/podcasts/glenn-youngkin-is-running-for-virginia-governor/'), ('Interview with Hamilton Lombard, research specialist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, June 11, 2021.', 'No link'), ('Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, ""Out-migration from Virginia continues for a fourth consecutive year,"" Dec. 7, 2017.', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/may/31/nikki-haley/nikki-haley-more-people-today-are-leaving-virginia/'), ('Internal Revenue Service, ""SOI Tax Stats - Migration Data,"" accessed June 9, 2021.', 'No link'), ('IRS, ""Returns Filed, Taxes Collected & Refunds Issued,"" accessed June 11, 2021.', 'https://statchatva.org/2017/12/07/out-migration-from-virginia-continues-for-a-fourth-consecutive-year/'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, State to State Migration Flows, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Old Dominion University, ""State of the Commonwealth Report,"" 2016 and 2020.', 'https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jun/17/glenn-youngkin/are-more-people-leaving-virginia-other-states-movi/

No sign that the COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein is toxic or ‘cytotoxic’
","The headline on a YouTube video and a person who speaks in it make a troubling claim about the way the COVID-19 vaccines work.  ""Spike protein is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic,"" they say, referring to the molecule that triggers the body’s immune system to produce antibodies against COVID-19 infection.  It’s one of a number of widely shared social media posts alleging  that the vaccines are toxic or ""cytotoxic,"" which means toxic to cells.  The YouTube post, which was shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Experts say there is no evidence that the spike proteins produced by the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, or the spike protein created by genetic material in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, are toxic. The 15-minute video, posted June 13, shows three people speaking on a podcast. Bret Weinstein, who is identified in the video as an evolutionary biologist, is the one who says the spike protein in the vaccines ""is very dangerous, it’s cytotoxic.""  Dr. Robert Malone, identified in the video as the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, said he sent ""manuscripts"" months ago to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration claiming the spike protein posed a health risk. ""And their determination was that they didn’t think that that was sufficient documentation of the risk that the spike was biologically active,"" he said. The third person in the video is identified as ""serial entrepreneur"" Steve Kirsch, who said he is an engineer. He cited a claim by Canadian viral immunologist Byram Bridle that the vaccine doesn’t stay in the shoulder, where it’s injected, but ""goes throughout your entire body, it goes to your brain to your heart.""  We rated False Bridle’s claim that the COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein means people are being inoculated ""with a toxin.""  Experts told PolitiFact there is no evidence to back his allegation that the spike protein produces a toxin that could cause serious health problems.  COVID-19 vaccines work by triggering the human body’s natural immune response, without introducing a form of the COVID-19 virus itself.  The actual COVID-19 virus uses the spike protein to bind to cells, causing infection. But the mRNA vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, contain neither the virus nor the spike protein — just the genetic instructions for the body to make the spike protein associated with the coronavirus.  Once the cell receives these instructions, it creates the protein and displays it on its surface. The immune system then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to protect against the virus.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine contains a modified adenovirus — not the COVID-19 virus — with a gene that induces cells to produce the spike protein, said vaccine expert Dr. Walter Orenstein at Emory University. As with the mRNA vaccines, this leads the immune system to recognize the spike protein as foreign and make an immune response against it, he said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which calls the spike protein harmless, explains: ""Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection."" An FDA spokesperson told PolitiFact: ""There is no scientific data to indicate that the spike protein in mRNA vaccines is toxic or that it lingers at any toxic level in the body after vaccination."" Responding to the claim made in the video, Emory’s Orenstein and vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said they are not aware of any major dangers from the spike protein.   ""Where is the evidence?"" said Offit. ""No one is saying that vaccines are risk free. The minute there’s any reasonable signal that things are occurring in a vaccinated group and not in an unvaccinated group, then the FDA takes a closer look."" Offit noted as an example the federal response following reports of a small but higher-than-expected number of cases of heart inflammation — called myocarditis and pericarditis — developing in mostly young people after they received doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC announced June 10 that it will convene an emergency meeting on June 18 to discuss a possible link between the condition and the vaccines.  The headline of a widely circulated YouTube post, and a person speaking in the video, say the COVID-19 vaccines’ spike protein ""is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic."" U.S. public health authorities and vaccine experts say there is no evidence that the spike protein is toxic or cytotoxic. We rate the post False.

Fauci isn’t making millions off upcoming National Geographic book about the pandemic. He wasn’t paid
","Dr. Anthony Fauci has an upcoming book about the lessons he’s learned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The book, ""Expect the Unexpected: Ten Lessons on Truth, Service, and the Way Forward,"" was developed by National Geographic Books and is scheduled to be released on Nov. 2, 2021. Some online have criticized Fauci over the book, claiming that he’s cashing in on it while Americans continue to suffer.  ""Tony Fauci will make millions off of a new book about ‘Truth’ while Americans continue to suffer because of his endless stream of lies over the past year,"" reads a June 1 tweet by Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. ""The highest paid employee of the federal government is set to profit even more off this pandemic. What a disgrace."" Kirk got one thing right — as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, Fauci is the highest paid employee of the federal government.  But he isn’t going to profit from the book.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) National Geographic Books developed the 80-page book in connection with an upcoming National Geographic documentary film about Fauci. National Geographic spokesperson Chris Albert told PolitiFact that, although Fauci is listed as the author, he didn’t write anything specifically for the book. Instead, National Geographic drew from interviews and speeches delivered by Fauci for the book. ""He was not paid and will not earn any royalties from its publication or from the upcoming documentary,"" Albert said. The earnings will go to the National Geographic Society, as well as being re-invested in content. The nonprofit conservation and education group has a joint venture with Walt Disney Co. that manages the National Geographic portfolio of media operations, including TV channels, magazines and book publishing. The claim comes after the release of thousands of emails to and from Fauci during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. The emails, which were obtained legally through Freedom of Information Requests, have fueled several misleading posts online. On June 1, the book was posted for pre-sale online on Amazon and Barnes & Noble before it was quickly taken down. The move prompted some to claim it was fallout over Fauci’s emails, but Albert said it was because the pre-sale was prematurely posted.

A 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report does not show that the COVID-19 was planned
","A Facebook post claims that a 2010 report by the Rockefeller Foundation shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and the international response, with lockdowns and other restrictions, were ""meticulously planned"" at least a decade before they occurred.  The post includes video from a far-right legislator in the Netherlands reading from the report and drawing connections to the pandemic.  ""The house of cards is collapsing,"" the caption on the post says. ""This Dutch politician reads excerpts from the 2010 Rockefeller report and shows us clearly that this entire shit-show was meticulously planned AT LEAST 10 years ago. So what now? Are the tell-a-vision worshippers going to stick to the media drip-fed lies purely out of pride and ego? Is it too late now that so many are playing Russian Roulette by taking the mystery shot?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post mischaracterizes the content of the Rockefeller report. The report from the New York-based philanthropy, ""Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development,"" was not a plan for creating the COVID-19 pandemic. It envisioned four ways in which the world might evolve, including one that involved an influenza pandemic and tighter government controls in response to it.  The foundation’s president wrote that the foundation uses scenario planning, ""a process of creating narratives about the future based on factors likely to affect a particular set of challenges and opportunities,"" for use in philanthropy to ""identify unique interventions, simulate and rehearse important decisions that could have profound implications, and highlight previously undiscovered areas of connection and intersection."" Foundation staff and others worked with the Global Business Network consulting firm, which does scenario planning, according to the report. The video shows remarks by Thierry Baudet, a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands and leader of the far-right Forum for Democracy party.  In March, Twitter marked as misleading a tweet in which Baudet said he would not receive a COVID-19 vaccination, that the virus risk to him ""is completely negligible"" and the vaccine’s side effects ""severe.""  In the five-minute video, posted June 4, Baudet reads excerpts from the report, drawing connections to the COVID-19 pandemic. He closed his remarks by saying ""that the locking down of the entire country, half the world for 1.5 years because of a flu variety is insane…. This COVID phase has been a practice to train obedience.""  The 54-page report explores ""the role of technology and the future of globalization,"" and considers ""the multiple, divergent ways in which our world could evolve"" in four possible scenarios: ""LOCK STEP: A world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback. ""CLEVER TOGETHER: A world in which highly coordinated and successful strategies emerge for addressing both urgent and entrenched worldwide issues. ""HACK ATTACK: An economically unstable and shock-prone world in which governments weaken, criminals thrive and dangerous innovations emerge. ""SMART SCRAMBLE: An economically depressed world in which individuals and communities develop localized, makeshift solutions to a growing set of problems."" The scenarios, the report’s introduction says, ""are not predictions. Rather they are thoughtful hypotheses that allow us to imagine, and then to rehearse, different strategies for how to be more prepared for the future."" The ""Lock Step"" scenario, which is what Baudet read from, goes like this: In 2012, a pandemic of a new influenza originating from wild geese infected nearly 20% of the global population and killed 8 million in seven months, most of them healthy young adults. Economies were devastated. China fared better than the United States and other nations by imposing a quarantine on all citizens and sealing all borders.  Countries imposed measures such as mask requirements and, ""even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified,"" with developing countries ordering biometric IDs for all citizens.  ""Virulent nationalism created new hazards: spectators at the 2018 World Cup, for example, wore bulletproof vests that sported a patch of their national flag.""  In the developed world, ""scientists and innovators were often told by governments what research lines to pursue and were guided mostly toward projects that would make money.""  By 2025, ""people seemed to be growing weary of so much top-down control,"" and ""disaffected youth and people who had seen their status and opportunities slip away — largely in developing countries — incited civil unrest."" The report indicates that some of the events of the past year may have been conceivable or predictable a decade ago, but not that they were ""meticulously planned."" A widely shared Facebook post says a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report shows the COVID-19 pandemic and the international response were ""meticulously planned at least 10 years ago.""

"['Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Pocan']","
Pocan has voted from D.C. regularly since getting vaccinated. Before that, he employed proxy system
","The COVID-19 outbreak set work schedules aflame all over the world -- including in Washington D.C. And in Congress.  In May 2020, U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., allowed members to vote by proxy. That meant they could designate a colleague to record their votes for them, subject to the direct instructions of the person not able to vote from Washington D.C.  Since then, Pelosi has extended the ability to vote by proxy through July 3, 2021, according to a May 21, 2021 report from the left-leaning Brookings Institution, even though Congress is under pressure to return to normal as more staffers and politicians get vaccinated.  While  proxy voting was offered to to keep House members safe during the pandemic, some critics have called out out politicians for ""missing"" votes. In a May 19, 2021 piece for the MacIver Institute, conservative talk radio host Dan O’Donnell of WISN-AM, called it ""laziness by proxy"" and slammed various Democrats for, in his view, using proxy voting too frequently. He especially called out U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, who took to Twitter to slam O’Donnell and defend himself.  In a tweeted retort, Pocan said he has been ""in D.C. voting regularly.""  We typically prefer to check politicians than pundits, so let’s look at Pocan and his defense. Is it true he’s been ""in D.C. voting regularly""?  When we reached out to Pocan’s office, Communications Director Usamah Andrabi told us Pocan has used the proxy system several times since the COVID outbreak -- but only three times so far during 2021, missing three votes out of the 156 votes this year.  ""He missed votes on two instances,"" Andrabi said in an email. ""The first was a single vote that occurred during the Inauguration, which he did not attend due to limited seating and COVID restrictions. Second, on April 19, he missed the first two votes due to a flight that got him into D.C. later than when the votes started.""  But looking back to 2020, voting records show Pocan voted by proxy many more times.  Records show that Pocan used a proxy from May 22, 2020 through June 24, for two days of voting. He again employed a proxy from July 25 through Aug. 21, 2020, during which he voted by proxy for four days. The final proxy notification in 2020 came on Sept. 11, and didn’t end until the following January. During that time, Pocan voted by proxy for 29 days.  Out of the 292 roll call votes Congress took during the 116th session in 2020, Pocan voted by proxy for nearly 90 of them, voting records show.  For context, according to online records, U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, employed the proxy system for 25 days, between June 2020 and May 2021. And U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, used the proxy system more than 70 days between May 2020 and May 2021. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, and U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R- Clyman, Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-De Pere, and Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Janesville, did not employ the proxy system, according to records. U.S. Tom Tiffany, R-Minocqua, submitted a proxy letter on March 5, 2021, but has not used the proxy voting system. Pocan’s office acknowledged the votes by proxy in October, November and December, noting that Pocan had a reason for not voting in person.  ""Given the Congressman’s prior diagnosed heart disease, Congressman Pocan followed his physician’s advice to avoid contact with people who weren’t practicing safe COVID protocol,"" Andrabi said in an email.  Since getting vaccinated in January, he said, Pocan has not regularly missed meetings. But focusing only on the most recent months is a bit disingenuous. The opinion piece that prompted Pocan’s claim that he had been voting in-person regularly clearly was about a broader time period. So, Pocan is polishing his apple by highlighting a narrower window.  In a tweet that responded to criticism from a conservative talk radio host, Pocan claimed he had been in Washington, D.C., ""voting regularly,"" not using a proxy.  In 2021, Pocan has regularly been in D.C. for votes, voting by proxy only on inauguration day when access to the U.S. Capitol was limited, and two votes he missed after a flight got him into town after votes had started.  But looking back to 2020, Pocan utilized the proxy system much more often, using it for 39 votes in October, November and December, and several other times from May through September. An aide said Pocan was following the advice of his doctor, because of a diagnosed heart disease.  Whatever the reason, Pocan picked a narrow period to respond to much broader criticism. We rate this claim as Half True, which means the statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.   ","[('Brookings Institution, ""Proxy voting turns one: The past, present and future of remote voting in the House,"" May 21, 2021', 'https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/05/21/proxy-voting-turns-one-the-past-present-and-future-of-remote-voting-in-the-house/'), ('Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, Proxy letters, June 1, 2021', 'No link'), ('Senate.gov, ""Roll call votes 116th Congress - 2nd session,"" June 1, 2021', 'https://clerk.house.gov/ProxyLetter#AllProxies'), ('Email conversations with Usamah Andrabi, Communications director for Mark Pocan, May 26 and June 1, 2021', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jun/15/mark-pocan/pocan-has-voted-dc-regularly-getting-vaccinated-he/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Nikki Fried']","
Fact-checking Nikki Fried’s attack on Ron DeSantis about taxes
","Democrat Nikki Fried said Florida has had a history of Republican governors who pass legislation that hurts people’s pocketbooks. Gov. Ron DeSantis recently ""signed a $1 billion tax increase on the people of our state, on our consumers, yet gave a $500 million tax break to our corporations,"" Fried told WINK TV. ""That's not how government is supposed to work. Government is supposed to work for the people."" Fried’s statement criticizing DeSantis for the tax increase has been a familiar talking point. In a video in April, Fried said, ""Last night Ron DeSants raised your taxes by over $1 billion. And he did it right before midnight, with no cameras, no one watching."" (His press office announced the bill signing  in an email at 11:23 p.m.) The state estimated that its new law changing online sales taxes will generate an extra $1 billion per year, bringing Florida in line with the rest of the country.  Technically, the online sales tax in Florida isn’t new. But practically speaking, it means that Florida online consumers will pay taxes on some purchases they previously didn’t. The Florida Legislature passed SB 50 along party lines with Republican support. The new law requires out-of-state retailers and marketplace providers with no physical presence in Florida to collect Florida’s sales tax on items delivered to customers in Florida. The rule applies to sellers who generate more than $100,000 in sales in Florida. The bill takes effect July 1. Florida levies a 6% sales and use tax on the sale of goods. Customers are required to pay the state for the tax owed on their purchase of an untaxed item. But hardly any did, according to a legislative staff analysis. A 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision — South Dakota v. Wayfair — paved the way for more states to collect sales taxes on online purchases. The court eliminated the requirement that a seller have a physical presence in a state to collect and remit sales taxes to that state. Following the ruling, states passed new laws to collect taxes on online purchases. Among states that levy statewide sales taxes, Florida was one of the last few states to pass such a law.  ""In the vast majority of states, the process of updating sales tax statutes post-Wayfair was noncontroversial, in large part because the tax that is being collected is not a new tax; it’s a tax that was already owed,"" said Katherine E. Loughead, an analyst at the Tax Foundation. Business groups including Florida TaxWatch and the Florida Retail Federation had urged state legislators to pass such a law so that it applied equally to businesses operating inside and outside Florida that sell to Florida customers. The money from the tax will initially go to replenish the state’s unemployment trust fund and then later will go toward reducing the commercial rent tax. Jared Walczak, a researcher at the Tax Foundation, estimated that the law will cost online shoppers an added $40 to $50 a year, on average.  In 2018 — when Rick Scott was governor — the Florida Legislature set in motion a corporate tax refund following the 2017 passage of the federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act signed by President Donald Trump. That federal law broadened the corporate income tax base by expanding the definition of corporate income while it reduced the corporate income tax rate. Since Florida uses the federal definition of corporate income as the starting point for the state corporate income tax, the federal changes resulted in additional corporate income flowing through to Florida’s tax base, Loughead said. If Florida had adopted all the changes in the federal tax bill, it would have increased corporations’ state tax liabilities.  In 2018, the Legislature passed a bill that would lower the corporate income tax rate for one year if net collections in 2018-19 exceeded forecasts by 7%. The bill required that any excess collections be refunded to eligible corporate taxpayers in the spring of 2020. Only about 1% of businesses pay Florida’s corporate income tax.  Back in 2018, the state didn’t know how much money that would add up to — or that Florida would face the economic downturn in 2020 when businesses closed because of the pandemic. So why does Fried imply that the corporate tax refund is the fault of DeSantis, who took office in 2019? In the spring of 2020 amid the pandemic, Democrats asked DeSantis to cancel the refunds, estimated at about $543 million, to save the state money.  ""Refunding $543 million to corporations is a spending decision, and it’s a bad one at this time,"" said state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando. ""It should not be a priority of the leaders of a state that is worrying about how to pay for teachers, health care and transportation needs as our tax collections disappear."" But DeSantis remained committed to the corporate refund.  ""The corporate taxpayers who are entitled to receive these automatic tax refunds under the law have anticipated these refunds and have likely made business decisions around them,"" DeSantis spokesman Ryan Ash told the Orlando Sentinel in March 2020. The refunds, issued in April 2020, benefited 19,546 taxpayers, according to a state Department of Revenue spokesperson. The average benefit was $27,793.49. Fried said DeSantis ""signed a $1 billion tax increase on the people of our state, on our consumers, yet gave a $500 million tax break to our corporations.""  In April, DeSantis signed an online sales tax law that the state predicts will generate an extra $1 billion a year. Online shoppers were supposed to be paying these taxes if they were not charged, but hardly any did. Florida’s new law puts it in line with other states that have statewide sales taxes. The tax break refers to a bill the state Legislature passed in 2018, before DeSantis was governor, in response to the federal tax law. The bill resulted in refunding corporate taxes above a certain threshold so that their payments would remain roughly the same. Democrats called for DeSantis to cancel the refund, a request he denied. Fried’s claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

"['State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
Terry McAuliffe keeps repeating bogus budget claim
","Former and possibly future Gov. Terry McAuliffe keeps telling it wrong.  ""I inherited the largest budget deficit in the history of the state from the Republicans,"" McAuliffe, a Democrat who led the state from 2014-2018, tweeted on June 10. We gave False ratings to this repeated claim twice in 2015 and once in 2019. McAuliffe did not inherit a deficit when he took office. His Republican predecessor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, left behind balanced budgets as required by Virginia’s constitution. Virginia is the only state that bars its governor from serving successive terms. After sitting out four years, McAuliffe won this year’s Democratic nomination in a June 8 primary and is running against Republican Glenn Youngkin, a retired private equity executive. In addition to his tweet, McAuliffe made his bogus deficit claim at least two other times after the primary. With little effort, we found four additional instances of McAuliffe making the claim this year while he was campaigning for the nomination: Let’s examine the facts. Again. The inheritance Why does McAuliffe keep saying he inherited a deficit? ""At the beginning of his time as governor, Terry McAuliffe faced a state budget prepared by his Republican predecessor that did not end up having enough revenue to cover the operating expenses,"" Renzo Olivari, McAuliffe’s campaign spokesman, said in a prepared statement. ""Not having enough revenues to cover expenses is the definition of a deficit."" In fact, McAuliffe inherited two balanced budgets bills, but then was faced with economic problems that — while not his fault — caused revenues to crash. The first bill left by McDonnell put his finishing touches on the outgoing two-year budget, set to expire June 30, 2014. The proposal anticipated $35.4 billion in general fund revenues and $34.9 billion in expenses. The second bill was McDonnell’s proposal for the coming two-year budget, which began July 1, 2014. He anticipated $37.8 billion in general revenues and proposed $37.7 billion in spending. McAuliffe took note of the falling revenues shortly after taking office in January 2014. Economists tied the slowdown to two factors: McAuliffe sensed the problems shortly after taking office, but initially underestimated their severity. On Feb. 12, 2014, he cut the revenue estimate in the coming two-year budget McDonnell proposed by $140 million. ""Although our underlying economic forecast has not changed,"" McAuliffe said, ""it is clear that the current revenue receipts warrant attention."" The takeaway: One month into office, McAuliffe said McDonnell’s revenue estimate was $140 million high, but retained ""the underlying economic forecast"" McDonnell’s budget was built on.   In May, the shortfall caved to an estimated $1.5 billion. The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by cutting $800 million in spending and drawing $700 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Seven months into his term, on Aug.15, 2014, McAuliffe estimated the shortfall at $2.4 billion and ordered additional cuts to keep the new two-year budget balanced. In a speech to the General Assembly’s money committees, the governor said that out of caution, his forecast was deliberately ""pessimistic."" Turns out McAuliffe did overestimate the shortfall and, after all the spending cuts, the state ended the fiscal year with a $550 million surplus. Another falsehood McAuliffe’s tweet also says that the $2.4 billion budget gap he faced was the ""largest budget deficit in the history of the state."" We rated this statement False in a 2015 fact check. A McAuliffe spokesman told us at the time that the governor ""misspoke."" Records show the state faced a far greater crisis at the start of 2010, when McDonnell took office and Virginia was suffering the full effects of the Great Recession. Two reports by the General Assembly’s budget committees at that time identified a shortfall of almost $4.5 billion for the two-year budget that would begin July 1, 2010. We should note that The Washington Post, in a June 14, 2021 fact check, gave McAuliffe’s tweet ""Four Pinocchios,"" its lowest rating. Our ruling McAuliffe tweeted, ""I inherited the largest budget deficit in the history of the state from the Republicans.""  In fact, he inherited two balanced budgets from his predecessor and then, in the first months of his governorship, saw state revenues shrink because of federal policies. In addition, the revenue shortfalls that ensued were not the largest budget gaps in state history. After repeatedly being called out by fact-checking on this claim over several years, McAuliffe should know better. Yet he keeps repeating it in his current campaign.

But days before he released his June 12 statement on his website, news of a study surfaced that triggered more claims about the drug. ""Study: hydroxychloroquine can boost COVID-19 survival chances by nearly 200%,"" read the headline of a widely shared post on Instagram. The post was from One America News, the conservative cable network that Trump has often praised. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post exaggerates the significance of the study, which promotes hydroxychloroquine as helping only certain COVID-19 patients. The study says a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was effective in certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but the study has not been fully vetted. It was posted on a website that publishes ""preprints"" — studies the website says are not yet peer reviewed by other scholars and that ""should not be used to guide clinical practice."" Experts told PolitiFact the study is poorly designed and cautioned against using it to draw conclusions. Hydroxychloroquine, which is an immunosuppressive and anti-parasitic drug used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to malaria, carries a particular risk for people with heart problems, plus other possible side effects. Interest in the drug emerged early in the pandemic, in early 2020, from two small trials, including one that used hydroxychloroquine along with the antibiotic azithromycin (brand name Zithromax) and reported that the virus was essentially gone in five days. The research society that published that article later renounced it, saying it didn’t meet its standards. In March 2020, as Trump touted hydroxychloroquine, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine for certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But the FDA revoked its authorization less than three months later, after determining ""it is no longer reasonable"" to believe that it may be effective in treating COVID-19, ""nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks.""  The study cited by OAN was done by three researchers from the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases & Urban Health in East Orange, N.J., and one from the Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. The study says the researchers reviewed the medical records of 255 COVID-19 patients at Saint Barnabas who required invasive mechanical ventilation during the first two months of the U.S. pandemic. Its conclusion: Dosing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin above a certain level ""improves survival by nearly 200% in this population."" The study was posted May 31 on medRxiv, a website that publishes studies that have not been fully vetted. This note is posted with the study: ""This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.""  The website also says about its ""preprint"" or ""unrefereed"" articles: ""Before formal publication in a scholarly journal, scientific and medical articles are traditionally certified by ‘peer review.’ In this process, the journal’s editors take advice from various experts — called ‘referees’ — who have assessed the paper and may identify weaknesses in its assumptions, methods and conclusions … Readers should therefore be aware that articles on medRxiv have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors, and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community."" Three experts who spoke to PolitiFact were critical of the study. Joel Farley, a University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy professor, noted that the study was designed not to test the effectiveness of the two drugs, but rather as an observational study that basically looks at survival and then models what things might have predicted survival.  ""The concern is that this poorly designed study might influence"" prescribing of the two drugs ""when the overwhelming body of evidence has shown it has no benefit for treating COVID,"" Farley said. Dr. Neil Schluger, chairman of the Department of Medicine at New York Medical College, said that to conclude cause-and-effect ""is an obvious error,"" calling the study very small with little hard data. ""It’s likely that patients who died rapidly received less total (of the two drugs) because they were dead; one can’t conclude from these data that they died because they got fewer doses. It’s also likely that if they received lower doses on a daily basis, it’s because they were sicker to begin with,"" he said. Ally Dering-Anderson, a professor at the University of Nebraska College of Pharmacy, said pairing hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin to treat a virus raises serious questions because azithromycin is a traditional antibacterial drug that doesn’t treat viruses and hydroxychloroquine has no known benefit in treating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. ""There is no pharmacologically sound reason to believe that combining two drugs that don’t work will suddenly result in therapy that does work,"" she said. Hydroxychloroquine is not approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. The FDA recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treating COVID-19 patients. The World Health Organization recommends against using hydroxychloroquine to prevent or to treat COVID-19 infection. A widely shared social media post stated: ""Study: hydroxychloroquine can boost COVID-19 survival chances by nearly 200%."" A study says a certain dosing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ""improves survival by nearly 200%"" among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, but the post exaggerates the finding’s significance. The study is posted on a website that publishes studies that ""have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community."" Experts told PolitiFact the study is poorly designed and that no conclusion about cause and effect should be drawn from it. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.","[('Instagram, post, June 9, 2021', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CP4i5E_tKFt/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=6d11b6b7-259c-415c-a5fe-7eedf45e1d4b'), ('Lead Stories, ""Fact Check: Draft Research About Hydroxychloroquine As COVID-19 Drug Does NOT Yet Warrant Calling It A Cure,"" June 10, 2021', 'No link'), ('medRxiv, ""Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the Beginning of the USA Pandemic,"" May 31, 2021', 'https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/06/fact-check-draft-research-about-hydroxychloroquine-as-covid-19-drug-does-not-yet-warrant-calling-it-a-cure.html'), ('medRxiv, ""What is an unrefereed preprint?"", accessed June 11, 2021', 'No link'), ('International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, ""Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Christian Eriksen, Danish soccer player who collapsed, didn’t receive the Pfizer vaccine
","Christian Eriksen, a 29-year-old Danish soccer player, suddenly collapsed on the pitch during a June 12 European Championship match between the Denmark and Finland national teams. Tournament organizers and Denmark’s soccer federation later reported that Eriksen suffered cardiac arrest and was awake and responsive at the hospital. It didn’t take long after Eriksen’s collapse for misinformation about his COVID-19 vaccination status to start circulating online. An Instagram post shows a screenshot of a tweet that says: ""Christian Eriksen, the Danish player who suddenly collapsed on the pitch, plays for Inter Milan. The chief medic and cardiologist of that Italian team confirmed on an Italian radio station that Eriksen has received the Pfizer vaccine on May 31."" The tweet, now deleted, came from Luboš Motl, a Czech physicist and blogger who has shared false information about COVID-19 and vaccines. Other tweets claimed that the station the chief medic spoke to was Radio Sportiva.  
The post isn’t accurate. Inter Milan’s director said Eriksen hadn’t received any COVID-19 vaccine prior to his collapse, or contracted the disease in the past. Radio Sportiva denied that it made any such report. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Eriksen collapsed suddenly in the 43rd minute of the Group B opener between Denmark and Finland while he was running near the left touchline after a Denmark throw-in. His teammates gathered around him before he was carried off on a stretcher. The game was paused for over an hour. A young athlete experiencing cardiac arrest is not common, but it’s also not unprecedented. The rumor about Eriksen came amid reports of a small but higher-than-expected number of cases of heart inflammation — called myocarditis and pericarditis — developing in mostly young people after they received doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced June 10 that it will convene an emergency meeting on June 18 to discuss a possible link between the condition and the vaccines. Other health organizations, like the European Medicines Agency, are also investigating. But Eriksen’s collapse appears unrelated. Motl had to take down his tweet after Inter Milan’s director Giuseppe Marotta told Italian sports TV channel Rai Sport that Eriksen hadn’t received any COVID-19 vaccine. Radio Sportiva, meanwhile, denied that anyone on the team’s medical staff said otherwise. ""The information reported in the tweet mentioned is false,"" the radio station wrote in a June 13 tweet. We have never reported any opinion from the Inter medical staff regarding Christian Eriksen's condition."" The Inter Milan team doctor, Piero Volpi, told Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport that Eriksen will undergo thorough examinations over the next few days. ""But there has never been an episode that even remotely hinted at a problem,"" Volpi added.  Sanjay Sharma, Eriksen’s cardiologist while he played for former club Tottenham Hotspur, said that some players may have had mild or asymptomatic coronavirus infections, which could have resulted in ""scarring"" of the heart, but that Eriksen had no prior heart issues during his time with the Premier League. Eriksen signed with Inter Milan in January 2020. Social media posts claim that Eriksen collapsed on the field from cardiac arrest days after receiving Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The director of Inter Milan, the Italian professional team Eriksen plays for, said the footballer hadn’t received any of the vaccines. He is currently undergoing testing to pinpoint the cause. We rate this claim False.","[('Instagram post, June 13, 2021', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CQCSzq0suPw/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=05ec248c-d463-4447-b40e-aa0efa6bad35'), ('New York Times, Denmark’s Christian Eriksen collapsed on the field.
