Sarah Palin says that, like Donald Trump, Justin Bieber once supported abortion
","What do Donald Trump and Justin Bieber have in common? Humongous hair? Big bucks? How about a case of abortion contortion? Sarah Palin compared their abortion stances during the Feb. 1 edition of CNN's The Lead. Jake Tapper asked the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter about Trump's turnabout on the issue of abortion. ""Donald Trump is somebody who has clearly had different positions on issues that he has today,"" said Tapper. ""He called himself very pro-choice. Now he says he's very pro-life."" ""I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light,"" Palin responded, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated. She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber. Tapper didn't quite understand and, in essence, asked her, what do you mean? Bieber ""has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him,"" Palin said. ""He’s just one example."" We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone overboard. Trump's change of position on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC's Meet the Press that although he hated the concept of abortion, ""I am pro-choice in every respect."" By mid February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, ""I am pro-life."" Whether the Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear. We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun. We didn't hear back from either. So we decided to try to find out for ourselves. No pressure. The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was Bieber's interview with Rolling Stone, published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time. ""I really don't believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human,"" Bieber told the magazine. ""It's like killing a baby."" When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, ""Um. Well, I think that's really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don't know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that."" The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue. He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar. The Chicago Sun-Times said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed ""longtime Bieber associate"" who claimed, ""I don't believe he agrees with his mom on this issue."" Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion — which would signal a new position on abortion that, sorry, does not fit Palin’s point. However, PolitiFact has a policy of not relying on unnamed or secondhand sources to speak for what others believe. Our ruling Palin said Bieber ""has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him."" At PolitiFact, we believe it's the responsibility of the person making a claim to provide the evidence to back it up. Palin didn't respond to our query. The only reasonable conclusion at this point is that Bieber hasn’t changed his position on abortion like Trump. Nonetheless, we never say never: If on-the-record evidence of Bieber supporting abortion prior to his Rolling Stone interview turns up, we'll consider a different ruling. Until then, Palin’s claim is not substantiated. We rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2016/feb/05/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-donald-trump-justin-bieber-once-s/

Heavy with presidential campaign IOUs, is Scott Walker foisting expenses onto Wisconsin taxpayers?
","Gov. Scott Walker, once an early favorite among the 2016 Republican candidates for president, doubtless wishes he were canvassing the Granite State, soliciting votes ahead of the New Hampshire primaries. Instead, the news lately about his bid, which ended in September 2015, is his campaign’s red ink. On Jan. 29, 2016 it was reported that despite raising $500,000 in the last three months of 2015, Walker’s presidential campaign was still in debt -- by more than $1 million. The governor announced the same day that his campaign would no longer pay for the travel costs of his state-provided security team when he leaves Wisconsin for political events. Instead, those future travel costs for the security team for political events would once again be the responsibility of state taxpayers. Cueing off those two news items, a top state Assembly Democrat lambasted Walker the same day. ""Faced with $1 million in campaign debt, Governor Walker is trying to cut corners in any way he can,"" Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland of Stevens Point said in a news release. ""In this case, he is unloading his campaign security costs onto the backs of Wisconsin taxpayers."" Walker is putting travel expenses for his security team for future political trips back onto taxpayers -- as they long have been under him and previous governors -- but Shankland’s claim mixes apples and oranges. Walker is not unloading such expenses from his presidential campaign, or any of his presidential campaign debt, onto taxpayers. The security detail backdrop Wisconsin taxpayers have long paid for security officers to give around-the-clock protection to their governors. But the costs have made more news since shortly after Walker took office in January 2011. Almost immediately, Walker launched legislation that resulted in Act 10, a law that sharply curtails the collective bargaining powers of both state and local government employees. Thousands upon thousands of people demonstrated daily in Madison. Walker beefed up security. Costs mounted. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, for example, that in 2013 taxpayers spent $2.23 million for the 10 state troopers who protect Walker and his family, GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, and dignitaries from other states and countries who visit Wisconsin. That was up from $657,457 paid out by Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, during his last year in office in 2010. Walker’s security bill inched higher in 2014, to $2.3 million. A large part of the increase came because Walker had added five members to what is officially known as the Dignitary Protection Unit in the wake of the Act 10 protests. Both Walker and Kleefisch were the target of death threats during the frenzied debate over the bill. (The security unit did not provide services for lieutenant governors until Kleefisch came into office in 2011.) Another factor, though, was an increase in travel costs due to out-of-state trips made by Walker as he was increasingly seen as a possible 2016 presidential contender. Walker made political trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and other states. Taxpayers have routinely covered security costs for governors, on official business in Wisconsin and on political trips out of state. But Doyle, as one example, didn't travel outside Wisconsin on political jaunts nearly as often as Walker did as he pursued his White House run. The presidential campaign In March 2015, Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb, who oversees the security team, told the Legislature’s budget committee that taxpayers would foot the bill for providing security for Walker as he traveled around the country for what was then his budding presidential campaign. ""The governor is the governor 24/7,"" he said, noting that taxpayers paid for security for previous governors on their political travels. In April 2015, Our American Revival, which was then Walker’s presidential campaign-in-waiting, announced it would pick up the security officers' travel costs when Walker attended political rallies, fundraisers and other events related to what eventually would become his official bid for the White House. So, that was a change from past practice, when taxpayers would cover all security expenses for a governor, even for political travel. By early January 2016, Walker’s campaign had reimbursed taxpayers about $260,000 to cover airfare, hotels and other expenses for his security team while Walker ran for president. The most recent payment covered costs from July, August and September 2015. According to Walker’s Department of Administration, Walker’s campaign has reimbursed the state for the travel expenses in full. Our rating Shankland said: ""Faced with $1 million in campaign debt,"" Scott Walker ""is unloading his campaign security costs onto the backs of Wisconsin taxpayers."" For future political trips, Walker is returning to the practice of taxpayers paying for travel expenses for his state security team. But Walker is not unloading any of his presidential campaign debt onto taxpayers, including travel expenses for the security team. His campaign has already reimbursed the state for those expenses. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/feb/05/katrina-shankland/heavy-presidential-campaign-ious-scott-walker-fois/

Hillary Clinton says she didn't endorse the TPP trade deal until it was actually negotiated
","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal became an issue during her Feb. 4 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders at the University of New Hampshire. She says she now opposes it. MSNBC debate moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that Clinton supported the deal while secretary of state, then asked her whether she might support such agreements again if she were elected. Clinton said she had voted against a previous trade deal as a U.S. senator and, regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, ""I said that I was holding out the hope that (TPP) would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for. ""I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the (Obama) administration,"" she said. ""Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it."" Did Clinton really withhold her support until the terms of the proposal had been finalized? PolitiFact has looked at the issue before. We found Clinton made plenty of strongly supportive comments about the deal while negotiations were still ongoing. Speaking in Australia in 2012, Clinton hailed the deal as ""setting the gold standard."" ""This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,"" Clinton said. ""And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."" Strong words for a deal that hadn't been completed yet. But it wasn’t just on that one occasion that Clinton was more than just hopeful about the deal’s impact. She declared in November 2012 remarks in Singapore that it would ""lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. ""It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy."" As PolitiFact reported in October, she also used words such as  ""exciting,"" ""innovative,"" ""ambitious,"" ""groundbreaking,"" ""cutting-edge,"" ""high-quality"" and ""high-standard"" in describing the partnership before she left the State Department in 2013. The partners finalized the deal in 2015. Why the change of heart? In Thursday’s debate, Clinton said she opposes the trade deal because, ""We have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""I waited until (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) had actually been negotiated"" before deciding whether to endorse it. As secretary of state and a member of the Obama administration, it was Clinton's job to promote the deal, even if it wasn't finalized. Nonetheless, her comments at the time were so positive and so definitive, it becomes disingenuous to argue, as she's doing now, that she didn't endorse the deal before it was finalized.

Clinton says Sanders proposed Iranian troops in Syria
","In a heated debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sharpened the contrasts between them. Appearing on a stage at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Clinton targeted Sanders’ relative lack of national security experience. ""A group of national security experts issued a very concerning statement about Sen. Sanders views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues,"" Clinton said. ""Such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try and resolve the conflict there. Putting them right on the doorstep of Israel."" Last month, the Clinton campaign posted a critique of Sanders on precisely this point. The campaign said Sanders ""has put forth proposals that indicate a lack of engagement and fundamental misunderstandings about the challenges before us."" It cited Sanders’ own words. We found them on his Senate website and in the transcript of a November 2015 Democratic debate. In September 2014, Sanders issued a news release. It rejected any thought of sending American ground troops into Syria to fight ISIS. That level of fighting in Syria, he said, should be left to the Muslim nations. ""The war against ISIS, a brutal and dangerous organization, cannot be won unless the Muslim nations which are most threatened -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Turkey, Iran and Jordan -- become fully engaged, including the use of ground troops,"" Sanders said. ""The U.S. and the international community should be fully supportive, but the leadership in this war must come from the Muslim world."" During the Democratic debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Nov. 11, 2015, Sanders echoed that point. ""Here's something that I believe we have to do as we put together an international coalition, and that is we have to understand that the Muslim nations in the region -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Jordan -- all of these nations, they're going to have to get their hands dirty, their boots on the ground. They are going to have to take on ISIS."" Warren Gunnels, policy adviser for the Sanders campaign, told us Sanders was promoting the idea of a broad Muslim coalition. ""He has never advocated specifically for Iranian troops in Syria, but that there must be a coalition of nations with U.S. troops providing support,"" Gunnels said. ""He certainly never advocated for Iranian troops on the Israeli border."" It’s true that Sanders envisioned that the Iranian troops would be part of a much larger Muslim coalition that included Jordan and Turkey. While both nations might have significant disagreements with Israel, neither is an enemy of the Jewish state. Still, we can take it that Sanders did promote the presence of Iranian troops in Syria. Whether those troops themselves would be on the border with Israel is unknowable, but Syria of course shares a border with Israel. And Iran is no friend of Israel. Our ruling Clinton said Sanders suggested that Iranian troops should fight on the ground in Syria. Sanders did advance that idea on two occasions. But Sanders’ comments were in the context of a multi-national Muslim fighting force that included nations largely friendly toward Israel. The statement is accurate but lacks some useful details.

Bernie Sanders mistaken about whether his campaign's ad had cited a nonexistent endorsement
","MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pressed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders about a few controversies surrounding his staff during the Feb. 4, 2016, New Hampshire presidential debate. One that had emerged in the previous 24 hours concerned an ad Sanders’ campaign had run in advance of the New Hampshire primary. Maddow asked Sanders about the Nashua Telegraph complaining recently ""that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not."" Sanders responded, ""We did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper."" Maddow then said, ""Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was ‘Endorsement.’ "" Sanders responded, ""But that was only for -- that was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us."" As it happens, Maddow had referred specifically to one of two newspapers cited in the ad, and her choice might have allowed Sanders an out -- the ad in question did not explicitly say the Telegraph had endorsed him. But in his answer, Sanders broadened his response to include ""those newspapers,"" which is a problem because the initial version of the ad did explicitly include text that said the Valley News had endorsed him when it had not. This version was later tweaked for subsequent use. The ad was first posted online Wednesday, Feb. 3 and touts endorsements from unions, an environmental group and The Nation magazine. ""From postal workers to nurses, he’s been endorsed for real change,"" a narrator says in the ad. The narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers, The Telegraph, of Nashua, and the Valley News, which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon, N.H. Up to that point in the 30-second ad, every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words ""endorsed by."" Those words disappear when the Telegraph’s logo appears, along with the quote: ""He’s not beholden to Wall Street Money."" The words ""endorsed by"" then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News, which appears along with the quote: ""Sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can remember."" Neither the Valley News  nor the Telegraph endorsed Sanders. Telegraph executive editor Roger Carroll posted on Twitter the afternoon of Feb. 3: ""For the record, despite @BernieSanders deceptive ad to the contrary,@NashuaTelegraph has not endorsed any Dem prez candidate #nhpolitics"" More problematic for Sanders’ claim in the debate  is how the original ad handled the Valley News. Valley News editor Martin Frank said Feb. 4 that his newspaper had likewise not endorsed a Democrat in the primary, PolitiFact New Hampshire reported. As news of the spot’s issues spread, the Sanders campaign ended up revising the ad. It removed the word ""endorsed"" by the Valley News logo, although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched. That’s the version of the ad that was on the campaign’s official YouTube channel immediately before the debate, and the ad is still titled ""Endorsed."" After the debate, Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels told PolitiFact that the incorrect version of the ad never aired on television. ""A YouTube version of this ad mistakenly used this word, but it was never aired on television. As soon as we discovered this mistake it was taken down,"" Gunnels said. However, during the debate Sanders didn't draw a distinction between the campaign buying air time on TV and posting a publicly viewable ad on the Internet.  The Valley News editorial quoted in the ad – from Dec. 31, 2014 -- encouraged Sanders to enter the presidential race. ""A presidential candidate who vigorously espoused populism from a progressive point of view could help restore much-needed balance to American political life, which has tilted sharply to the right in recent decades,"" the paper wrote. However, it was published far too early in the campaign cycle to be considered an endorsement. Our ruling In the debate, Sanders said one of his campaign ads ""never said ... a newspaper endorsed us that did not."" Sanders is glossing over the initial version of his campaign ad. It originally included text that said Sanders had been ""endorsed"" by the Valley News, a word that was later removed after it became clear that the newspaper had made no such endorsement.

Bernie Sanders exaggerates concentration of wealth, income for top 1 percent
","Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated his ongoing theme that the rich have gotten richer and the United States needs to reverse income inequality during the Democratic president debate on Feb. 4 at the University of New Hampshire. ""Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged,"" Sanders said. ""They are working longer hours for low wages. They are worried about the future of their kids. And yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent,"" he said. ""(That's) not what America is supposed to be about."" PolitiFact has looked a couple of variations on his claims about wages, hours and income distribution. In the past, Sanders has said wages have gone down. He didn't make that claim Thursday night, perhaps because when we looked at data, we found that most reports concluded that wages have been flat since the 1970s. Instead, he characterized wages as low, a value judgement we won't quibble with. On the question of hours, we found mixed evidence that Americans are working longer during the week. The best data, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, show average weekly hours for production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector have actually declined a bit since the 1960s. The trend flattened out at the beginning of this century and took a temporary dip during the Great Recession, but broadly speaking the numbers don't support the longer hours claim. Gallup surveys have found that workers report working longer hours than what the BLS numbers show. However, historical data from those Gallup surveys reveal that there hasn't really been a change in the number of hours that full-time employees report working between 2001 to 2014. On the other hand, when the Brookings Institution looked at a small slice of the middle class -- the middle 10 percent of families -- they found an increase in hours worked among mothers who were toiling longer to maintain their family's standard of living. Finally, there are plenty of data showing that new income is becoming concentrated in the richest Americans, which is Sanders' overarching theme. The question is to what degree. Sanders said Thursday night and during recent interviews that it's ""almost all"" new income. A year ago, he was saying it was 99 percent. There's no handy-dandy, universally agreed-upon formula to calculate an exact amount, but the economist that Sanders has been relying on concluded in 2015 that the top 1 percent had accumulated 91 percent of the income gains made from 2009 to 2012. That would be ""almost all."" But when the analysis was updated in 2015, the estimate dropped to 58 percent, a ratio Sanders has publicly acknowledged. That may be just over most of the new income, but it’s far from ""almost all."" One important caveat: One economist we consulted told us that the calculation Sanders relies on, which looks at pre-tax income minus all government payments, uses a method that tends to make the rich look richer. Our ruling Sanders said Americans ""are working longer hours for low wages ... and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent."" The issues are whether Americans are working longer hours -- on average, they're not -- and whether ""almost all"" new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. A lot of it has, but not ""almost all."" If Sanders were to argue that a disproportionate amount of income and wealth is going to the very richest Americans, he'd be right on the money. But he's over-exaggerating. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-exaggerates-concentration-wealth-in/

Is Arizona the worst in higher education funding?
","Arizona State University President Michael M. Crow said Arizona is the worst per-capita in terms of investing in higher education.  He made these remarks as he lobbied for more state dollars in front of a state Senate Appropriations Committee Jan. 26. ""We need to think seriously what it is about us that has put us in a position where we are now investing, not just a little bit less than other places, (but) markedly less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education,"" said Crow. The Legislature is currently finalizing a budget for fiscal year 2017, which runs from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017.  Crow’s statement intrigued us, especially as he laid out the university’s strategic plan in front of the Arizona Board of Regents Thursday, so we put it to a fact-check.  Makes the grade The basis of Crow’s remarks is a Jan. 25 survey done by the Center for the Study of Education Policy at Illinois State University and the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, a Colorado-based group of education executives.  In the study, which ranks all 50 states, Arizona is ranked 49th per capita in state higher education funding for fiscal year 2016, second to New Hampshire. Arizona spent $136.72 per resident on higher education in fiscal year 2015 and is expected to spend $115.83 per resident in the current fiscal year. New Hampshire spent $92.74 in fiscal year 2015 and is expected to spend $92.50 in the current fiscal year.  Wyoming gives the most state funding to higher education. They spent $645.19 per resident in fiscal year 2015 and will spend $715.14 in the current fiscal year. The survey leaves out fiscal year 2016 data for Illinois and Pennsylvania, noting that these states haven’t finalized their budgets. In our map, we used fiscal year 2015 data for these states, with Pennsylvania and Illinois ranking as 48th and 7th, respectively.  Crow said he used conservative states ""with conservative legislatures and conservative executives"" as his basis for comparison. ASU spokesman Mark Johnson told us the same thing, noting that the comparison group was not every state.  Nonetheless, Arizona is not the worst when it comes to higher education funding per-capita -- New Hampshire is.  Whether or not New Hampshire can be considered a ""conservative"" state is debatable given its Republican-led Legislature and Democratic governor.  However, Arizona is at the bottom of several other higher education funding categories.  The survey shows that Arizona has the biggest year to year drop in state higher education funding at 14 percent. In March, the Grand Canyon State also cut $99 million in funding to universities, which pales in comparison to the $8 million in new funding Gov. Doug Ducey has pitched for the state’s fiscal year 2017 budget. ""Our data is pretty straightforward,"" Grapevine editor Jim Palmer said, noting that the survey uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Commerce. ""Arizona did experience the biggest decrease in funding from ‘15 to ‘16.""  Arizona also had the steepest decline, 47 percent, in state higher education spending per student from 2008 to 2015. But the state isn’t alone, either.  A December 2014 Government Accountability Office report found that ""state funding for all public colleges decreased"" between fiscal years 2003 and 2012. Eileen Klein is president of the Arizona Board of Regents. She said the additional $8 million in state higher education funding is an encouraging first start.  However, the objective isn’t to ""catapult"" through the rankings.  ""The point is to make sure that we have sufficient dollars to support Arizona students,"" Klein said. ""Today, our universities operate at a loss for every Arizona resident student because the state is only committing, at this point, 34 percent towards the cost of educating our Arizona students."" Our ruling Crow said, ""We are now investing, not just a little bit less than other places, (but) markedly less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education."" Arizona is not the worst, they’re 49th, for the current fiscal year in funding higher education. Crow said he made his comparison among conservative states, but New Hampshire, the worst for higher education funding based on the study he cited, appears to be in the middle of the political spectrum. Nevertheless, Arizona has endured the sharpest decline in state higher education funding from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016. Even on a per student basis, their spending dropped 47 percent, more than any other state, from 2008 to 2015.  Given the context, we rate Crow’s claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/05/michael-m-crow/arizona-worst-higher-education-funding/

Marco Rubio says China is 'practicing how to blow up our satellites'
","The 2016 presidential campaign has inspired discussion of plenty of scary foreign-policy scenarios, from ISIS attacks to cyber warfare. But at a Feb. 3 town hall in Manchester, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio offered one we hadn’t heard much about – the possibility that China could blow an American satellite out of the sky. China, Rubio said, is ""practicing how to blow up our satellites."" Experts told PolitiFact that Rubio is basically right. ""Regrettably true,"" Michael Krepon, a space-policy expert and co-founder of the Stimson Center, said of the claim. Most spectacular was an incident on Jan. 11, 2007, when a six-foot-long Chinese weather satellite flew over China and was blasted to smithereens by an 18,000-mile-per-hour missile launched by China. ""And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft,"" as Popular Mechanics magazine put it. China’s destruction of its own missile inspired ""a great deal of international rebuke,"" said Laura Grego, a senior scientist with the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition to bringing up the touchy notion of the militarization of space, the satellite destruction created a sizable debris field in its heavily trafficked band around the earth, potentially causing secondhand damage to other nations’ satellites for the foreseeable future. There are about 1,300 active satellites, according to Scientific American. The technology China used, known as ""hit-to-kill,"" doesn’t technically ""blow up"" the satellite, as Rubio had said. No explosives are involved, only the force of impact of a missile-launched ""kill vehicle.""   ""This is the same technology that the U.S. missile defense systems are based on,"" Grego said. ""In fact, the U.S. used the Aegis ship-based missile defense system to destroy the USA 193 satellite just over a year after the Chinese test."" Which brings up a point worth noting: China isn’t the only one playing this game. Russia and the United States have been testing anti-satellite technology since the 1960s. In fact, when the United States, a year after China destroyed its satellite, destroyed one of its own, cables released by Wikileaks suggest was a mission with military significance. ""Russia and the United States either have experimented with or deployed similar technologies"" as China, said Theresa Hitchens, a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland. ""Indeed, the Chinese are actually behind both Russia and the United States regarding development of these technologies. Nothing China has tested is anything that the U.S. has not tested before."" A further complication: Technologies that can be used to destroy satellites can also be used for benign purposes. Ballistic missiles can destroy satellites – or they can be used legitimately for missile defense. And satellites themselves can be maneuvered to damage or destroy nearby satellites – or they can be maneuvered for repair or refueling, Hitchens said. This is known as ""dual-use"" technology. This makes it hard to discern motives. In fact, China has ""officially said its tests are not aimed at any other country, and it has been a longtime proponent of trying to manage this issue using space arms control,"" Grego said. But it’s difficult to prove a purely defensive motive when dealing with such dual-use technologies, Hitchens said. ""We see them doing dual-use experiments and assume it’s for nefarious purposes, and they see us doing dual-use experiments and assume nefarious purposes,"" she said. This kind of thinking can produce an arms race. Still, experts said it was fair for Rubio to point out China’s development of technologies that can be used to attack satellites, since it’s a threat to national security even if we’re working on much the same thing. ""The reality is that satellites are increasingly valuable to civil, economic, scientific, and military operations, yet they are physically quite vulnerable, since launch mass is at a premium and no one armors their satellites, and satellite positions are predictable,"" Grego said.

Bernie Sanders ad claims or implies endorsements from New Hampshire newspapers
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been searching for high-profile newspaper endorsements in the New Hampshire primary. His main rival, Hillary Clinton, has been officially backed by the Concord Monitor, Portsmouth Herald, Keene Sentinel and the Boston Globe. But a campaign ad titled ""Endorsed,"" might have given people a different impression. The ad, which was first posted online Wednesday Feb. 3, touts endorsements from unions, an environmental group and The Nation magazine. ""From postal workers to nurses, he’s been endorsed for real change,"" a narrator says in the ad. The narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers, The Telegraph, of Nashua, and the Valley News, which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon, N.H. Up to that point in the 30-second ad, every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words ""endorsed by."" Those words disappear when the Telegraph’s logo appears, along with the quote: ""He’s not beholden to Wall Street Money."" The words ""endorsed by"" then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News, which appears along with the quote: ""Sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can remember."" So did the Valley News or the Telegraph endorse Sanders? According to their editors, no. Telegraph executive editor Roger Carroll posted on Twitter the afternoon of Feb. 3 that ""For the record, despite @BernieSanders deceptive ad to the contrary, @NashuaTelegraph has not endorsed any Dem prez candidate #nhpolitics"" And Valley News editor Martin Frank said Feb. 4 that his newspaper had likewise not endorsed a Democrat in the primary. As news of the spot’s issues spread, the Sanders campaign ended up revising the ad. It removed the word ""endorsed"" by the Valley News logo, although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched. That’s the version of the ad now on the campaign’s official YouTube channel, which is still titled ""Endorsed."". The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. It’s worth noting that the editorials cited in the ad -- from each newspaper -- were indeed laudatory. The Telegraph editorial, which is behind a paywall but accessible through a Google cache, includes this passage: ""He is not tainted by scandal. ""He hasn’t erased a cache of emails. ""Nobody questions whether Sanders has sold his political soul in exchange for donations to his family foundation. He doesn’t have a foundation. But that piece was published in May, far before the traditional season for newspaper endorsements. It gave Sanders little chance of winning the primary, also noting that the independent senator was ""not even a real Democrat."" As for the Valley News, the paper’s Dec. 31, 2014, editorial simply encouraged Sanders to enter the presidential race. ""A presidential candidate who vigorously espoused populism from a progressive point of view could help restore much-needed balance to American political life, which has tilted sharply to the right in recent decades,"" the paper noted. Our ruling A Bernie Sanders political ad said he had been endorsed by the Valley News newspaper and implied he had been endorsed by The Telegraph of Nashua. While each paper published laudatory editorials about the Vermont senator, neither one has so far offered him an official endorsement. In the context of an ad titled ""Endorsed,"" full of unions and other organizations that have in fact endorsed Sanders, the spotlighting of quotes from New Hampshire newspapers would suggest that the papers had made the same decision. The campaign’s decision to alter the ad improves its technical accuracy, but the misleading impression remains.

Scott says state revenues are growing after tax cuts
","Gov. Rick Scott’s $1 billion tax-cut request is giving the Florida Legislature plenty to chew on, especially after state economists warned that revenues won’t be as high as once thought. Scott wants a range of cuts, including a reduction in the sales tax on commercial rents and a $770 million break for manufacturers and retailers by getting rid of their corporate income tax. Despite concerns over how the size of his request will affect the budget, Scott was confident the math makes it an easy decision for lawmakers. ""We have plenty of money to be able to do tax cuts,"" Scott said Jan. 20, 2016, after state economists warned tax revenues would be less than previously estimated. ""Let's look at history. We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown."" Scott has used this line repeatedly in recent weeks. We wondered whether revenues have continued to grow even as Tallahassee has passed tax changes over recent years. Revenue roundup Scott’s line about 50 tax cuts is a talking point that just keeps on growing. We have rated claims about him cutting 24 tax cuts, 40 tax cuts, and more than 40 tax cuts, Half True, because Scott counted many small tax changes for specific industries as overall tax cuts. What’s new this time around, in a nutshell, are 16 provisions passed in 2015, most of which were part of a $429 million tax-cut package. The full list is largely comprised of esoteric tax credits (mostly for businesses), changes in unemployment compensation and sales tax holidays. There also was a rate reduction on the Communications Services Tax on cellphone and cable service that amounts to about $21 per $100 on a bill and a $60,000 cap on taxes for boat repairs. Several of those may help businesses, but really don’t often do much for everyday Floridians, especially if they needed to collect unemployment. Many times, local governments may raise taxes to make up for their own lost revenue. In short, it’s arguable whether all of those qualify as tax cuts, but they did have an impact on how many tax dollars the state brought in. Economists told us, however, that while you can project how much year-over-year revenues may be changed from cuts, it’s tough to attribute any concrete economic growth to those changes. Because of overall economic growth, tax revenues have been rising since Scott became governor as the state was climbing out of the Great Recession. We surveyed several years of general revenue, which is funded by taxes and fees and can be used by the Legislature for any purpose, alongside the state's rate of economic growth. Fiscal year General revenue Growth rate 2008-09 $21 billion -12.8 percent 2009-10 $21.5 billion 2.4 percent 2010-11 $22.55 billion 4.8 percent 2011-12* $23.6 billion 4.7 percent 2012-13 $25.3 billion 7.2 percent 2013-14 $26.2 billion 3.5 percent 2014-15 $27.7 billion 5.7 percent 2015-16 $28.4 billion 2.1 percent State economist Amy Baker noted that even with Florida’s economy growing, that growth rate is currently below the state’s historical average, and the cumulative effects of prior tax changes are eating into revenues more than expected. State budget forecasters have announced that tax revenues will come in at $400 million less than previously expected. Scott’s office has rejected those figures in pursuit of his biggest round of tax cuts, saying the Legislature has plenty of money to play with.   But while it’s apparent that revenues have gone up even as Scott’s tax changes have been implemented, experts said it’s tough to directly link them. They said there are three main reasons Florida’s revenues have grown during the nationwide recovery: Population growth, rising property values and overall inflation. More than 1 million people have moved to Florida since 2010, property values are recovering from the housing bust, and inflation makes tax collections go up as costs go up. Basically, more people are paying more taxes on things that cost more. Norton Francis, senior research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said that despite being the third-largest state, the growth rate for Florida’s tax revenues has started to lag behind the national average. ""What you need to look at is, are (tax revenues) growing more than they used to?"" Norton asked. ""It could be that it’s come back as a whole, but it’s hard to pin that to a tax cut."" Our ruling Scott said, ""We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown."" Scott has a debatable definition of tax cuts, but the state’s tax revenues have increased since he took office. Economists told us it would be difficult to attribute growth specifically to tax changes. The national economic recovery, population growth, higher property values and inflation are the major factors for the state’s growth. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/04/rick-scott/scott-credits-tax-cuts-floridas-growing-tax-revenu/

Jeb Bush says Americans consume vast majority of addictive painkillers
","Editor's note (May 10, 2017): Since the publication of this fact-check, PolitiFact Missouri has found additional information and analysis about this topic. To read the latest, see this fact-check.  As New Hampshire officials work to contain the state’s opioid crisis, presidential candidates have been called upon to address the problem and offer solutions. At an editorial board meeting with Monitor staff, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush outlined his plan -- and dropped an interesting statistic. Bush said Americans have a tendency to overmedicate in general, but addictive painkillers are even worse. ""I read this, I believe, that 90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States in the world,"" Bush said. Could this be true? Are so many of the world’s pain medications dispensed in this country alone? We decided to check out the number and its origins. Bush’s New Hampshire campaign staff said the candidate misspoke; he meant to say 80 percent, not 90. The article Bush was referring to was by Dr. Sanjay Gupta and published last year on CNN.com. ""We were stunned to learn 80 percent of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United States,"" Gupta writes. That number doesn’t just appear in CNN’s reporting, though. ABC News cited it in 2011. The BBC mentioned it in coverage a year later. As noted by the Bush campaign -- and independently verified by PolitiFact New Hampshire -- the statistic originates with the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, a group based in Kentucky with some 4,500 members. The group reports in a fact sheet that the United States, with ""only 4.6 percent of the world’s population, has been consuming 80 percent of the global opioid supply, and 99 percent of the global hydrocodone supply, as well as two-thirds of the world’s illegal drugs."" Papers published in Pain Physician -- ASIPP’s quarterly journal --  are the source of those numbers. That 80 percent figure appeared in a paper published in 2008, and has been repeated in the organization’s literature, including testimony to the U.S. Senate. But while these numbers were the source of Bush’s statement, they date from 2008. Out of curiosity, we decided to search for another, more recent version of the information. Luckily, there’s a separate source for such data, and it’s the United Nations. The group’s International Narcotics Control Board issues yearly papers about narcotic drug use around the world. While it publishes a general report, it also puts out technical reports, which detail the actual use of such substances globally. And according to the group’s 2014 report, its most recent, the United States consumes 78 percent of the world’s oxycodone (known as Oxycontin). It’s also reported to use 99 percent of the world’s hydrocodone (it’s Vicodin when combined with acetaminophen) and used 51 percent of the world’s hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Earlier versions of this set of statistics appear in a 2012 Newsday piece, a 2013 New Yorker article and a 2014 New York Times blog post. And Bush’s larger point that Americans generally over-medicate is supported, too. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the United States uses 75 percent of all of the world’s prescription drugs, period. Again, the United States has just under 5 percent of the world population. Our ruling Bush said that, globally, ""90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States."" In the context of the conversation, it was clear that Bush was referring to opioid painkillers. The most up-to-date information suggests that the United States uses the majority of the world’s supply of popular versions of such drugs. And statistics from a few years ago put that overall percentage at 80 percent. The exact number Bush used isn’t far off from commonly available statistics, and his campaign acknowledged that he misspoke. His overall point, however, was correct. We rank his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/feb/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-americans-consume-vast-majority-addi/

Fetterman says he's the only senate candidate backing Sanders in PA
","Who’s got love for Bernie? Braddock Mayor and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman boasts that he’s the only Pennsylvania candidate to endorse Bernie Sanders so far. In a Reddit AMA Tuesday, one user praised Fetterman and fellow Democratic senate candidate Joe Sestak, retired Navy admiral and former U.S. congressman, for campaigns resembling Sanders’ grassroots feel. ""I'm a fan of yours, but also a long time supporter of Admiral Joe. I see you as two Bernies against the one corporate party machine candidate. I wish you could team up somehow,"" wrote the Redditor. ""We already have teamed up, as I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for President,"" Fetterman replied. "" In PA, I've got Bernie's back.""                     A Fetterman spokesperson furthered this in email, adding that his endorsement was unique not just for the state, but nationally: A January Philadelphia Inquirer article named the Braddock mayor as ""the only statewide candidate nationally to endorse the Vermont senator."" Was that so? We were intrigued and decided to check it out. Among Pennsylvania Democratic candidates for U.S. Senator, four people have declared for the April primary so far, and only Fetterman has endorsed Sanders. Katie McGinty, Gov. Tom Wolf’s former chief of staff, is endorsing Hillary Clinton. Sestak has declined to throw support officially behind Sanders or Clinton. In response to our inquiry, a Sestak spokesman repeated a statement previously given to other press: ""Joe just focuses on the people of Pennsylvania so that he can continue to serve them."" Wire and springs manufacturer Joseph Vodvarka from Clinton, Pa., told PolitiFact Pennsylvania that he’s yet to endorse anyone. We looked for other Pennsylvania statewide candidates who endorsed Sanders and were unable to find any. So Fetterman’s comments on Reddit are accurate. His spokesperson added that there are no other statewide candidates nationally who support Sanders, but we were able to find a few. In Sanders’ home state of Vermont, for example, he has at least three such endorsers: former State Senator Matt Dunne, a gubernatorial candidate; State Senator David Zuckerman, a candidate for lieutenant governor, and State Auditor Doug Hoffer, who is running to keep his office. In Iowa, Sanders supporter Tom Fiegen is running for U.S. Senate. Still, Sanders has a notably low number of endorsements. Only two representatives in the U.S. Congress have endorsed Sanders, according to FiveThirtyEight, and no U.S. senators or governors have. Bertram Johnson, a political science professor at Middlebury College and expert in Vermont politics, said people endorse based on three factors: probability to win, their constituents’ leanings and political connections. ""Endorsers are interested in someone who can support them and has supported them in the past, who’s been an insider for decades,"" Johnson explained. ""This is obviously something that Bernie Sanders hasn’t done, because he hasn’t really been a Democrat until he entered this race."" ""I don’t know that he has a longstanding national network among politicians,"" he continued. ""I think what he’s done a good job of is using national media, like MSNBC, to cultivate support among liberal activists."" Sanders’ high tally of small contributions and a long list of Hollywood endorsements reflects this, Johnson said. Our ruling What answering questions about the Pennsylvania senate race, Fetterman said, ""I am the only candidate that has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. In PA, I've got Bernie's back."" We found he is the only statewide candidate in Pennsylvania who has endorsed Sanders. His office later claimed he was the only statewide candidate anywhere to endorse Sanders. That’s an exaggeration; statewide candidates in Vermont and Iowa have also endorsed Sanders. We’re fact-checking Fetterman’s original claim, however, and that statement is accurate.

Sen. Ron Johnson claims Russ Feingold is a career politician
","A rematch awaits voters this fall in the race for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Ron Johnson. As with such contests, we’ll hear some of the same issues that were raised when the two squared off in 2010. That’s when Johnson, a first-time candidate, ousted U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, who had served three terms in the Senate. In a Dec. 17, 2015 appearance on ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" on WISN-TV, Johnson raised what is certain to be a central theme of his campaign. ""I’ll be running against a career politician,"" he said -- twice -- in the interview. We asked Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger to explain the senator’s statement. After all, Feingold’s been out of office for about five years and passed up opportunities to run for governor in 2014 and, before that, Wisconsin’s other Senate seat, which was open in 2012. ""Senator Feingold is obviously a career politician – one who has pursued his profession for decades,"" Reisinger said in an email. ""Anyone who doesn’t believe it should do the math and listen to his own words."" Fair enough. Let’s take a look at the Feingold file. Feingold, 62, served 10 years in the Wisconsin state Senate, until 1992 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. That means he was an elected official for about 64 percent of his adult life. But what about before he won his first election? Feingold graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1975, then was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1979 when he was 26. He then worked at a law firm until he won the state Senate seat, at age 29. So, at the start of his working life that’s about three years when he was not in office or in school. Then there’s the five years following the 2010 loss to Johnson. Shortly after leaving office, Feingold set up a political action committee, Progressives United Inc., and was paid by that group a total of $59,500 from 2011 to 2013. Feingold then served from 2013-15 as a U.S. State Department diplomat to the Great Lakes Region of Africa. Not long after leaving that post, he announced in May 2015 that he would challenge Johnson. So for at least part of the past five years -- some would argue virtually all of it -- Feingold was involved in politics. (He also taught several college courses, at Marquette University, Lawrence University and later Stanford University, and wrote a book.) In summary: In the 36 years since he finished law school, he was in office for 28 and engaged in political or diplomatic work for another 5. That’s about 92 percent of his career spent in politics. An additional note: Feingold is currently receiving both his state and federal pensions. ""Should the people of Wisconsin elect him to the U.S. Senate, he would stop taking his federal pension or take a corresponding reduction in salary,"" Michael Tyler, his campaign spokesman, told us. Feingold addressed the ""career politician"" charge in a 2010 appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club. He said he had chosen public service as a career and was proud of it. ""I make no apologies for it,"" he said. We asked Feingold’s campaign for their take on the career politician charge this time around. ""While he has a breadth of experience working as an attorney, an author, a teacher, and serving our nation as a diplomat, Russ is proud to have served the people of Wisconsin,"" Tyler said. Our rating Setting the stage for his 2016 election rematch, Johnson said he would face a ""career politician"" in Feingold. Other than a short stretches, it’s clear the lion’s share of Feingold’s career has been in politics or government. He’s got the pensions to show for it, and makes no apologies for it.

Viral post claims precinct in Allen West race had 900 ballots cast but only 7 registered voters
","
Election night found U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, in unfamiliar territory: He hadn’t won, but he wasn’t convinced that he had lost either.

West clearly lost his first bid for Congress against U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, in 2008. And two years later, he clearly thumped Klein.

But on the night of Nov. 6, 2012, state results showed Democrat Patrick Murphy narrowly ahead but outside of recount territory in one of the most expensive and high-profile U.S. House contests in the country. (West beat Klein in Congressional District 22 but then moved due to redistricting. You can read our full West fact-check file here.)

By the morning, West demanded a closer look at results in Congressional District 18, which spans parts of Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Martin counties. Most of the controversy centered on St. Lucie, which had trouble counting ballots.

That led to a whirlwind two weeks of court hearings, partial recounts, a visit by state election officials to monitor the mayhem, scrutiny of St. Lucie County election supervisor Gertrude Walker and around-the-clock news coverage. Every morsel was put under the microscope, including Murphy’s false claim that West had never shaken his hand, prompting the West campaign to point to a photo of the two candidates shaking hands at a debate.

A Nov. 18 article in the Palm Beach Post paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson raising questions about St. Lucie’s ballot counting. ""Among them: Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered, Edson said.""  The claim that about 900 voters casting ballots in a precinct with only 7 voters went viral and was repeated on a CBS news website and on a West fan page on Facebook.

""#AllenWestRecount - A Pct had - 7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!! - THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL YET - The commissioner has NOT announced ANYONE the winner or the numbers yet. They are STILL behind closed doors.""

On Nov. 20, West conceded, though he continued to raise questions about St. Lucie County results. On the same day, a PolitiFact reader asked us about a claim he found on Facebook about Precinct 93. He asked us ""Is this true and newsworthy? Or is it just conservatives whining that they lost?""

So we went in search of what went down in Precinct 93 -- otherwise known as Golden Ponds Recreation Center in St. Lucie County.

St. Lucie County and the ‘bungled’ count

First, some more background on the West-Murphy postelection battle in St. Lucie County, which started election night when the county had trouble reading ballots on tabulation machines.

You can read blow-by-blow accounts from the Palm Beach Post or the Associated Press.

As the door on West’s chances appeared to be closing, the Palm Beach Post wrote Nov. 18: ""The St. Lucie County Canvassing Board missed a noon Nov. 18th deadline to file results to the state Division of Elections so that left previously submitted certified unofficial results standing: Murphy was ahead of West by about .58 percent.""

The root of the confusion about Precinct 93

Part of the West campaign claim isn’t in dispute. The St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections website shows seven active voters in Precinct 93 -- three Democrats, three Republicans and one ""other,"" as of September 2012.

Unofficial results dated Nov. 11 on the supervisor’s website showed that in Precinct 93, three ballots were cast for West and three for Murphy.

We spoke to Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a volunteer attorney for the West campaign, on Nov. 20. He said that volunteers watching the recount during the Nov. 18th weekend saw a ballot-counting machine with a yellow Precinct 93 sign on it and the tabulation tape showed 1,552 ballots. That equaled about 776 votes because there are two different ballot cards per voter.

Voters were watching the recount behind cones and tape as sheriff’s deputies were nearby. The machine with the Precinct 93 sign was on the corner of the boundary, so it was one of the few machines where observers could see the tabulation tape, Shapiro said.
.
""There were a lot of volunteers who saw it and reported it to us,"" Shapiro said.

The West campaign asked St. Lucie County canvassing board member Tod Mowery -- a county commissioner -- about the machine.

""They told us Sunday that they used the Precinct 93 machine  to run half of the ballots from  Precinct 85 because it was such a large precinct,"" Shapiro said. ""It still had the Precinct 93 sign on it. ... Because they didn’t change the sign it confused a lot of people.""

Mowery ""took us over to the machine to show the tabulation tape. It did say Precinct 85 on it. It was Sunday at about 3 o’clock. I was standing right there and I was talking to him.""

Edson gave us this account in an email: ""There was a machine that was mislabeled at the recount. When we looked at the tape for what we were told was Precinct 93, there were over 900 votes cast. It turned out that another precinct that had been counted on the same machine as 93. The matter was cleared up.""  

We also interviewed Mowery, a registered Republican.

Precinct 93 only had one early vote cast in this race, Mowery said. That’s why during the retabulation on Sunday, elections officials used the Precinct 93 machine to count a chunk of the ballots from Precinct 85, a much larger precinct.

Mowery said that after a news conference on Nov. 18, the West campaign asked him about Precinct 93. Mowery said he printed out the long form from the machine, which showed that the machine was counting results from Precinct 85.

""I took them over to the machine,"" Mowery said. ""I showed them the actual receipt for the Precinct 85 tabulation data. They all agreed that was in fact the case.""

Mowery said he asked the West campaign if they had additional questions about the Precinct 93 machine and they didn’t.

Before we give our ruling on this claim, we will wax nostalgic about our Allen West fact-checks. He claimed that about 80 of House Democrats are Communists and that he had higher security clearance than the president which we rated Pants on Fire. He also got a True rating for a claim about the number of people on Social Security Disability and a Mostly True for a claim about the cost of a missile.

For those who follow West on PolitiFact, there could be more to come. The Georgia GOP is ready to welcome their native son with open arms, which could mean our sister site PolitiFact Georgia could land some West fact-checks.

Our ruling

A Palm Beach Post article paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson saying that, ""Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered."" The same claim was picked up by people on Facebook. 
It's not true. 
A machine that had the label of Precinct 93 was actually counting votes from another precinct. In the end, only six people voted in Precinct 93, which has seven total voters.

Did Portland's bag ban only target a 'modest share' of single-use plastic bags?
","
Last week, the Portland City Council voted to significantly expand its year-old ban on single-use plastic bags. By October of next year, the ban, which currently targets big-box stores and supermarkets, will affect ""all retail establishments and food providers.""

The initial rule, passed last year, targeted fewer than 200 businesses. The new rule will reach an estimated 5,000 restaurants and retailers, including food carts, farmers markets and corner stores.

In a draft ordinance, released by the mayor’s office before the vote, his office outlined some of the council’s findings on the matter. Among them was this interesting bit about the initial ordinance: ""Portland City Council adopted Ordinance 184759 as a first step to promote the use of reusable checkout bags. The policy reduced single-use plastic shopping bag consumption,
but this initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use.""

We know, of course, that modest is a somewhat subjective term, but even so, we found its usage odd given that we remember the initial ordinance being touted as a significant victory.

We called the mayor’s office and asked: What percentage of single-use plastic bags did the initial ordinance target and what percentage does this new ordinance target?

We got this response in an email back from Sam Adams’ spokeswoman Caryn Brooks:

So, you’re fact checking the phrase ""While Portland’s initial ordinance addresses the large grocery store and pharmacy users of single-use plastic bags, the initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use"" that was in our blog post with a focus on the term ""modest share."" The term ""modest share"" is referring to the number of outlets required to ban single use bag usage in the original scope, which was 167 outlets. The next two phases will include some 5,000 outlets. Comparatively, we consider 167 outlets modest.""

Certainly, 167 outlets compared to some 5,000 is modest. But when we read the draft ordinance, we didn’t take this section to be talking about outlets at all -- we read it to be about the share of plastic bags banned. Let’s go back to the statement in the draft ordinance: ""(T)his initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use.""

It’s clearly discussing bag usage -- not the number of outlets. So, we reiterated our interest in any information regarding the way the initial ban affected usage and any projections on how the subsequent ban might.

When Brooks got back to us, she said, ""It is a number that we do not have access to and was never an element of the policy creation ...

""We never set out to reduce a particular percentage, because ultimately even a small percentage is too many. Obviously as you decrease the number of outlets that use plastic bags, the number of bags being used will decrease.""

When it comes to fact checking for PolitiFact Oregon, the onus is always on the speakers -- in this case, the mayor’s office -- to back up the statements they are making. So, we followed up one last time in a phone call to be absolutely sure the office had no information on the initial reduction in single-use plastic bag usage.

Brooks reiterated that we had misread the ordinance -- though she conceded it could have been clearer -- and that it was referring to outlets not usage. She also made the case that the second ordinance was not predicated on how successful the first ordinance was. It was always the intention, she said, to re-evaluate and push the ban further.

That is all fine and good, but ultimately we can only work with what is before us. The fact is that in trying to communicate with the public regarding furthering the city’s plastic bag ban, the mayor’s office made it sound as though the initial ban really only took a small chunk of single-use plastic bags out of circulation, even though they have nothing to base such a statement on.

(For what it’s worth, we made a call to Joe Gilliam, the president of the Northwest Grocery Association. He didn’t have any hard numbers on the bans either. He said it was probably safe to say that the initial ordinance targeted ""a third of the volume --- but again, I caution the numbers."")

We understand that the mayor’s office may not have intended to mean plastic bag usage, but it read that way to us -- and likely many others. Words matter.

Group claims New Jersey’s classrooms received $930 million from the state’s lottery
","
Budget woes abound in storm-battered and cash-strapped New Jersey, and now one group claims the state is rolling the dice on its fourth largest revenue source: the lottery.

The Communication Workers of America, a union that represents lottery workers, and the Asian American Retailers Association, a group representing convenience and liquor stores and gas stations, has launched a campaign -- called Big Gamble NJ -- to oppose the state’s plan to contract with a private company to manage the lottery’s sales and marketing.

Last week Big Gamble NJ started promoting a website that argues such a move would hurt small businesses and taxpayers.

On Nov. 13, one slide on the group’s homepage read: ""In 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million."" Another slide read: ""New Jersey businesses earned nearly $150 million from lottery sales last year alone.""

Under those slides, the website states, ""tell Governor Christie and your state legislators not to gamble with New Jersey's lottery revenues"" and provides a link to sign a petition.

Here PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether the lottery handed out more than $900 million to schools in 2011.

We learned that’s not quite the case.

A good chunk of the $930 million helped fund education in New Jersey, but not all of it.

The constitutional amendment voters passed in 1969 that authorized the establishment of the state lottery dictated that its ""entire net proceeds"" must go toward state institutions and education aid.  

The state lottery doled out $930 million to such causes in fiscal year 2011.

Nearly three-quarters of that money went toward education-related initiatives, according to the state lottery’s annual report.

More than $105 million funded programs in the state education department, including about $53 million for school construction and renovation.

The majority of the money -- more than $580 million -- benefited higher education.  More than half of that $580 million was dedicated to operating costs for public colleges.

Still, about a quarter of the the $930 million paid for other social services.

Roughly $156 million helped fund state psychiatric hospitals and centers for the developmentally disabled received nearly $47 million.

More than $36 million in lottery proceeds bulked up operating support for homes for disabled soldiers.

So education-related initiatives received a large majority, but not all, of the $930 million in contributions from the lottery in 2011.  

Seth Hahn, the New Jersey legislative and political director for Communications Workers of America, acknowledged the error on Wednesday afternoon. The website was updated that evening. It now reads: ""In 2011, our public lottery funded classrooms & other services by over $930 million.""

Still, Hahn said that didn’t change the fundamental issue that the proposal is bad for businesses and taxpayers.

The history of privatization in New Jersey is a ""story of graft, fraud and cronyism leading to taxpayers being on the hook for political indiscretion,"" he said. ""We believe that when it comes to funding education, care for the developmentally disabled, and services for our veterans, New Jerseyans deserve better.""

Bill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said the implication that the state is selling the lottery is false. He said a state agency ""will still have an oversight function"" and ""the state is going to continue to get the money from the lottery.""

Our ruling

Big Gamble NJ -- an advocacy group that opposes privatizing management of the state lottery -- said on its website that  ""in 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million.""

The lottery funneled $930 million into education and other social services in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three quarters of that amount funded education-related initiatives.

So New Jersey’s classroom didn’t receive the full $930 million from the state lottery, but education aid comprised a significant majority of that money.

Online petition claims Obama got more votes in one Ohio county than there are registered voters
","
""We the People: Your Voice of Government"" is a feature on the White House website, whitehouse.gov, that has the goal of ""giving all Americans a way to engage their government on the issues that matter to them.""

Users of the site can find or start petitions about these issues. ""If a petition meets the signature threshold,"" the site says, ""it will be reviewed by the Administration and we will issue a response.""

One of the fastest-drawing and most-signed petitions, of 137 posted on Nov. 14, is a call to ""recount the election."" 
Created on Nov. 10, the petition says: ""It has become blatantly obvious the voter fraud that was committed during the 2012 Presidential elections. In one county alone in Ohio, which was a battleground state, President Obama received 106,258 votes. But there were only 98,213 eligible voters. It's not humanly possible to get 108 percent of the vote!""

That drew the interest of PolitiFact Ohio.

We had heard a radio host in Youngstown make the same unattributed statement, that Obama ""received 108 percent of the vote"" in one Ohio county. We wondered about the basis and source of the claim.

Election returns posted on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted showed no county in which Obama received 106,258 votes, or similar number. Less surprisingly, it showed that the vote for Obama nowhere exceeded the number of voters.

PolitiFact Ohio did a search on Google hoping to find the origin of the claim and discovered it was a twist on numerous blog postings, many of them worded identically, making the odd assertion that Obama ""won the majority of Wood County's 108 percent of registered voters.""

A number of those postings cited as their source a Nov. 9 posting on the right-leaning blog frontpagemag.com.

Its headline reads: ""Voter Fraud: Obama Won %108 [sic] of Registered Voters in Ohio County.""

The text says: ""Mr. Obama won Wood County in Ohio this year. That’s right, Mr. Obama won the majority of Wood County’s 108 percent of registered voters. That’s not a typo.

""In 2012, 106,258 people in Wood County are registered to vote out of an eligible 98,213. ... Mr. Obama did indeed win Wood County, along with its 108 percent of voters.""

The stated conclusion is ""voter fraud.""

But the posting, once you untangle the meaning of its numbers, actually touches on a situation well known to election officials and observers: outdated registration rolls that include inactive and ineligible voters.

Purging the rolls

""Inactive"" voters generally are those who have gone more than four years without voting, have moved to another jurisdiction or have died.

Under federal law, voters can't be removed from the rolls until it is confirmed they have moved, until there is confirmation of a death or if they have gone without voting for more than four years, or two federal election cycles.

Problems with inaccurate or invalid records plague voter registration rolls nationwide, according to a report issued last February by the non-partisan Pew Center on the States. No evidence of voter fraud was found -- just record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray.

In Ohio, flaws in maintaining the voter database were cited as a prime reason the state has one of the highest rates of provisional voting in the country. Provisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility, which happens most often because of a change of address. Ohio law requires voters to provide proof of identity and current address at polling places.

An analysis by The Columbus Dispatch in September found that more than one out of every five registered Ohio voters is probably ineligible to vote.

A look at the numbers

The blog posting's count of people eligible to vote in Wood County -- 98,213 -- is the 2010 census count of the population age 18 and over.

The posting's count of registered voters, 106,258, matches a Plain Dealer tally of Sept. 17. The latest number of registered voters in Wood County is 108,014, Board of Elections director Terry Burton told PolitiFact Ohio.

Of those, only 80,433 are active voters, he said -- ""and the difference between those numbers is the inactive voters.""

Why such a large gap?

The presence of Bowling Green State University in ""is one of the big things that does play into it,"" Burton said, and the majority of inactive voters are in the Bowling Green area. The big reason is students who register to vote there and then move without notifying the elections board.

""Most students typically don't contact us and let us know when they're leaving,"" Burton said. ""We do carry a significant portion of students. And there is the transient nature of the administration and faculty as well.""

The university also can skew the voting-age population, he said, since out-of-county students who register to vote there are not necessarily included in the county's census count.

Meanwhile, Burton said, the ""community-minded"" rural areas that make up much of Wood County have high levels of active voter registration.

""The actual voting numbers are what you would expect,"" he said.

Wood County's total on Nov. 6 was 62,338 votes, he said, for a turnout of about 57 percent of registered voters.

Not only is that far below 108 percent -- it's well below the statewide turnout of about 68 percent reported by the secretary of state.

Obama's total in Wood County -- 31,596 votes, or about 51 percent of those cast -- was lower than his 2008 tally, according election night totals from the secretary of state. Mitt Romney received 28,997 votes, or about 47 percent -- less than John McCain's 2008 total.

""Now that we've gotten by Nov. 6, we can go back and recheck the database for voters who missed two consecutive federal elections,"" Burton said. ""This issue is something the secretary of state's office has been working on with us. It isn't a hidden issue.""

Voter registration nationally averages about 70 percent of the eligible population. The Dispatch analysis found that Wood County is one of two in Ohio where the number of registered voters actually exceeds the voting-age population. The other is Lawrence County, where Romney won about 57 percent of the vote to Obama's 41 percent.

Both counties topped what The Columbus Dispatch called the ""dirty dozen voter rolls"" -- a list of a dozen counties where voter registration equals at least 95 percent of the voting-age population.

Romney won all of them except Wood County.

What's our tally?

The much-cited blog post referring to ""108 percent of registered voters"" is muddled and misleading. It makes a claim of fraud using a registration figure that is known to include inactive and ineligible voters -- who would be identified at the polls -- while ignoring the actual vote.

But the ""We the People"" petition, which gathered more than 53,000 signatures in four days, is even worse. Posted to a public forum on the White House’s web site, it more forcefully takes up the cause, making a claim that voter fraud is ""blatantly obvious"" and that Obama received 106,258 votes in Wood County.

That quoted figure isn’t even a figure for votes. It’s a total for registered voters in that county. The actual votes cast for both Obama and Romney combined amount to about 57 percent of that number, a figure easily checked.

The petition's claim that Obama somehow managed to collect that many votes is not only demonstrably false, it's ridiculous.

Freedom From Religion Foundation says secular Americans fastest growing group
","
In terms of religious identification, are ""secular"" people the fastest-growing segment of American society?

That’s the argument made by the Madison-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, a national group that includes atheists, agnostics and ""skeptics.""

As we often say at PolitiFact, words matter. And as we’ll see, terms such as secular and non-religious are key in evaluating this claim.

With an ""action alert"" sent Nov. 9, 2012, the Freedom From Religion Foundation asked its members to call on President Barack Obama not to utter ""so help me God"" when he takes the presidential oath for the second time.

The alert included this assertion:

""Secular Americans are the fastest-growing religious identification demographic in this country.""

Secular is defined as ""not overtly or specifically religious"" and as ""pertaining to worldly things or to things that are not regarded as religious."" But scholars differ on who should be classified as secular.

With the January 2013 inauguration approaching, let’s see whether secular Americans, as the foundation flatly states, are the fastest-growing religious identification demographic.

The foundation

The Freedom From Religion Foundation describes itself as a nonprofit with more than 18,000 members that ""works to educate the public on matters relating to non-theism and to promote the constitutional principle of separation between church and state.""

Formed in 1978, the group has an ""honorary"" board that includes media commentator Ron Reagan, former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Julia Sweeney and Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker.

The foundation is among groups that call for the elimination of ""so help me God"" in presidential inaugurations. ""So help me God"" is, in fact, not part of the presidential oath of office, and historian debate about whether George Washington used it. But the phrase has been added to the end of the oath by modern-day presidents, including by Obama during his first swearing-in in 2009.

In a letter to Obama, the Freedom From Religion Foundation amplified its claim, using non-religious in place of secular in telling the president:

""In 1990, 8 percent of Americans were non-religious. When you were elected in 2008, 15 percent of Americans identified as non-religious. Now that number is 20 percent.""

Annie Laurie Gaylor, the foundation’s co-president, told us the foundation’s claim is  based on two studies -- one by Trinity College, a Hartford, Conn. school founded by Episcopalians and known for religious freedom; and another by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, which conducts surveys and other social science research.

We’ll review the studies and consult some other sources.

The studies

The Trinity College study was produced by the college’s Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture in March 2009.

The study utilizes the term nones -- Americans who identify themselves as atheist, agnostic, or having no religious preference.

Here’s some of the Trinity College data: 
Barry Kosmin, one of the study’s co-authors, said the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s claim is ""not controversial"" if secular is taken to mean not identifying with a particular religion.

Kosmin also estimated that the current nones figure is 15 to 17 percent, not the 20 percent that the foundation cited.

The higher figure comes from the Pew study, released in October 2012, which utilizes the term unaffiliated. The study found that nearly 20 percent of Americans do not identify with any religion -- up from 15 percent five years earlier -- even though more than two-thirds of the 20 percent say they believe in God.

Here’s some of the Pew data: 

So, like the Trinity College study, Pew found a decline in the percentage of Americans identified as Christian, an increase in those with a non-Christian designation and a larger increase in the unaffiliated category.

But there are some caveats from people involved in both studies.

Kosmin noted his study is different from Pew’s in that Pew’s unaffiliated definition includes some people who are regular churchgoers.

And Pew spokeswoman Jemila Woodson told us Pew does not state that any particular group is the fastest growing, partly because defining growth isn’t easy.

A wave of immigrants from Brazil, for example, could cause a significant increase in the U.S. Catholic population, while another group could experience a significant decline due to religious conversion, Woodson said. Growth ""at a higher rate than all other groups doesn’t necessarily mean that people are joining this particular faith at a faster rate than all others,"" she said.

Other views

Two experts, Robert Glenn Howard of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Patrick Carey of Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the terminology used by Pew more accurately reflects where Americans are.

Howard, a specialist in contemporary religious belief, said the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s statement is basically on target in the sense that ""people are increasingly moving away from claiming a specific religious affiliation for themselves.

""However, the majority of those are not ‘secular’ but instead see religion as important and describe themselves as either ‘religious’ or ‘spiritual,’"" he said.

Carey, chairman of Catholic theology at Marquette, said that from the Pew study and others he follows, unaffiliated Americans are the fastest-growing segment in terms of religious identification.

But aside from atheists and agnostics, who make up a small portion of that group, it’s not correct to say that segment is secular or non-religious, he said.

We'll also note a news story about the Pew study, in which  the national religion writer for Associated Press observed:

""Scholars have long debated whether people who say they no longer belong to a religious group should be considered secular. While the category as defined by Pew researchers includes atheists, it also encompasses majorities of people who say they believe in God, and a notable minority who pray daily or consider themselves ‘spiritual’ but not ‘religious.’

""Still, Pew found overall that most of the unaffiliated aren't actively seeking another religious home, indicating that their ties with organized religion are permanently broken.""

Our rating

The Freedom From Religion Foundation said: ""Secular Americans are the fastest growing religious identification demographic in this country."" It also used the term non-religious in place of secular.

The statement is partially accurate, in that surveys identify unaffiliated Americans as the fastest-growing group. But the statement leaves out important details, namely that many Americans not affiliated with a particular religion are still religious.

"['New Jersey', 'States', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says New Jersey receives the smallest return of any state on the federal taxes it pays
","
New Jersey doesn’t just need a lot of federal aid to rebuild a coastline ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, the state also deserves it, according to Gov. Chris Christie.

NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams asked Christie recently if it’s fair for people who have no interests in the Jersey Shore to ask, ""Why the money? Why the effort, if this is the new normal?""

""Well, listen, it's fair to ask it but I have the answer,"" Christie said during the Oct. 30 interview. ""The answer is that for New Jersey, which gives so much to this country -- by the way, 50th in return of our federal tax dollars. So New Jerseyans send more than any other state in America in federal taxes, getting back less. When that's done and you see that our state is a state that needs this to contribute to our economy and also to the soul and the vibrancy of our state, I think we have very good answers and arguments to make. And you count on one thing: you're looking at the guy who is going to make those arguments.""

With Christie building part of his case for federal assistance around the state’s return on federal tax dollars, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his premise is true.

Add ""Donor State"" to the list of New Jersey’s monikers.

Depending on the year -- and whether adjustments are made to federal data -- New Jersey ranks at or near the bottom nationwide in this category.

The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, tracked how much the federal government collected through taxes and returned through expenditures to states every year from 1981 to 2005.

The Washington, D.C.-based foundation calculated the federal tax burden -- a measurement meant to account for taxes that are assessed in one state, but impact taxpayers elsewhere -- to conduct its analysis.

In 17 of those 25 years, New Jersey came in last place, receiving 70 cents or less for every dollar it sent to the federal government.

In 2005 -- the most recent year analyzed by the Tax Foundation -- the federal government gave New Jersey 61 cents for every dollar it took. That was the smallest return of any state.

But that was seven years ago. Though the Tax Foundation hasn’t updated its findings, other studies show New Jersey still ranks near the bottom.

The Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes 18 states in the region, released a May 2011 report on federal spending and taxation patterns that focused on New Jersey.

New Jersey ranked 48th in the nation. Only Minnesota and Delaware received smaller returns on their federal tax dollars in 2009, according to the report, which relied on raw, unadjusted data.

PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of federal data from 2010 also put New Jersey in 48th place. So even the raw data put New Jersey near the bottom in this category.

But Colleen Cain, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute who prepared the 2011 report, said in an e-mail, that ""the news behind this is not all bad.""

In the report, Cain attributes the low ranking to New Jersey’s ""relatively high income levels and greater-than-average business income tax contribution, coupled with a relatively low need for federal aid.

It does, however, underscore the importance of states like New Jersey in supporting the fiscal health of the nation generally.""

Our ruling

Christie said that New Jersey is ""50th in return of our federal tax dollars.""

The Tax Foundation’s analysis of 2005 data, which was adjusted to reflect each state’s overall federal tax burden, ranked New Jersey 50th in the nation in this category.

The state received 61 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, D.C. that year.

Though that research is outdated, more recent analysis of raw data shows New Jersey still ranks near the bottom.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Christie’s statement registers as Mostly True.

"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'County Line']","
County Line restaurant chain says full- and part-time workers will be required to buy insurance costing $375 to $1,000 a month, starting in 2014
","
Just before the November 2012 elections, employees of an Austin-based restaurant chain were warned the 2010 federal health care overhaul will cost them.

An open letter; headlined ""Health Insurance -- Starting in 2014,"" was tucked in with paychecks for employees of the County Line restaurants, according to an Austin Chronicle news article posted online Nov. 2.

As of January 2014, the letter says, ""YOU will be required to get and pay for health insurance. Your employer may help you but YOU will be legally required to buy health insurance.""

The letter continues: ""How much will I have to pay? The best estimate from the Congressional Budget Office for the minimum level of health insurance coverage"" when the law takes effect is $4,500 a year, or $375 a month, for individual coverage, and $12,000 a year, or $1,000 a month, for family coverage.

Reader Sally Villarreal of Austin wrote us asking if the declared costs hold water.

Under the law, many Americans will be required to have coverage as of 2014 or pay an income-tax penalty.

But not every resident will directly pay the full costs.

The law provides tax credits subsidizing purchases by people with lower incomes. Also, many full-time workers will not face the full tab.

The County Line letter, for instance, says employees considered full time, or working more than 30 hours a week, would have half their individual premium costs covered by the chain. Under the law, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees must offer those employees an affordable plan or pay a penalty for not doing so.  

The letter does not say if the chain plans to offer part-time workers health-plan help, though it says such workers will have to get insured, regardless. As a result of the law, the letter says, ""many of our employees will be restricted to working less than 30 hours a week.""

By telephone, Glen Garey, general counsel of the Texas Restaurant Association, who said he reviewed the letter before its distribution, told us he expects the law to cause restaurants to strive for a lid on full-time workers.

The letter closes: ""THIS IS THE LAW. It’s not a maybe. It is already happening."" After noting that the Supreme Court has upheld the insurance mandate, the letter says: ""The law could be repealed, but that would require a Republican president, and Republican majorities in the Senate and House... At this point, ‘Hope’ is not a strategy.""

That portion could have been read as a timely appeal to vote against President Barack Obama and Democrats who supported the law, which is often called Obamacare.

Not so, County Line co-owner Skeeter Miller told us by telephone. Miller said the County Line, whose restaurants employ up to 1,000 people each year, distributed the notice because some workers incorrectly believed they were going to be getting free health care.

So, will premiums cost $350 to $1,000 a month as the County Line says?

Miller said he based the employee notice on a Jan. 11, 2010, letter from Douglas Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, to Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who had requested information on likely premiums for policies fulfilling the requirement that Americans get insured.

The budget office letter says the agency’s cost estimates — for 2016, not 2014 — address Snowe’s question about the likely costs to obtain what are designated as minimal ""Bronze"" health plans, as opposed to more costly ""Silver"" plans providing greater coverage. ""Overall, CBO estimates that premiums for Bronze plans purchased individually in 2016 would probably average between $4,500 and $5,000 for single policies and between $12,000 and $12,500 for family policies,"" Elmendorf wrote.

Sure enough, those figures boil out to monthly costs of $375 to $417 for single policies and $1,000 to $1,042 for family policies, close to what the County Line told its workers.

But the budget office figures were laid out with caveats, including that they do not reflect the subsidies available to lower-income Americans, the budget office letter says, and also ""represent national averages; premiums for specific individuals would differ on the basis of their age, average spending on health care in their area of the country, and the specific plan they chose.""

By email, budget office spokeswoman Deborah Kilroe advised us the figures have not been updated.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, a health insurer, replied to our inquiries about the expected costs of coverage without specific forecasts. Blue Cross spokesman Ross Blackstone said by email: ""We don't forecast costs like that because there are just too many variables that determine a person's premiums (type of policy, geographic region, utilization in that area, state reporting requirements, etc.).""

For an insurance industry perspective, Jennifer Cawley of the Texas Association of Life and Health Insurers guided us to Robert Zirkelbach of the America’s Health Insurance Plans, a national trade association representing the health insurance industry. By telephone, Zirkelbach said the 2010 estimate remains the best available national forecast, but averages also don’t tell the full story. He said several factors--including the law’s minimum coverage requirement--to drive up premiums.

""How much an individual or small business’s premiums will go up depends entirely on the amount of coverage someone has today,"" Zirkelbach said, meaning that if current coverage is especially minimal, the 2014 increase will likely be more substantial. Another variable, he said, would be the number of beneficiaries placed under each policy.

Next, we noticed the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has widely studied U.S. health care, cites the budget office figures on its web page outlining the law’s mandate. Kaiser’s summary says premiums would vary by the age of people being insured. In 2010, it says, employees paid $899 on average toward the cost of individual coverage in an employer-based insurance plan and $3,997 for a family of four.

That’s a lot less than the budget office cost estimates for 2016, but also solely reflects employee shares of premiums.

Meantime, premium costs have gone up. According to a 2012 Kaiser survey of employer health benefits, annual premiums for family coverage cost $15,745 of late, with workers on average paying $4,316 toward those costs. Premiums for worker-only health coverage reached $5,615 annually, Kaiser said, with workers on average paying $951. Kaiser said the survey was conducted between January and May 2012 and included 3,326 randomly selected, non-federal public and private firms with three or more employees, 2,121 of which responded to the full survey.

We asked Kaiser’s Gary Claxton, who oversaw the survey, to speak to the cost claim in the County Line’s notice. By telephone, Claxton suggested several flaws, including, he said, the implication that workers would be burdened with the full premium costs whereas employers would partially fund costs for full-time workers. Also, Claxton said, part-time workers might qualify for subsidies.

Either way, he said, ""the employee is not paying the whole thing.""

Carter Hobbs, a County Line employee who helped draft the employee notice, agreed by phone that the 2010 projections reflect full premium costs, not costs to employees alone. ""How that cost is covered is a whole ‘nother discussion,"" Hobbs said.

Our ruling

The County Line letter to workers says full- and part-time workers will be required to buy health insurance in 2014 costing $375 to $1,000 a month.

Those figures align with the budget office’s 2010 letter on what it would cost to purchase health insurance in 2016--not 2014. Also, those estimates did not attempt to calculate the effect of premium subsidies and were clearly presented as ballpark forecasts.

Broadly, too, the County Line notice risks the misimpression that insurance costs would be borne by workers alone when results will not be that simple.

Lamar Alexander says more Tennesseeans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote
","In what was a busy post-election week for Sen. Lamar Alexander -- holding hearings on the meningitis outbreaks and passing the bipartisan PREEMIE Act to prevent infant mortality -- the office of Tennessee’s senior Republican issued a news release to announce a vote ""to support S. 3525, the Sportsmen’s bill."" A lot of Tennesseans love to hunt and fish, and the release noted that Alexander supported the bill because it ""increases hunting and fishing access to federal lands while reauthorizing several conservation programs.""

The news release’s headline put it another way: ""Keep hunting and fishing without burdensome regulations, while protecting our wetlands and wildlife.""

Those claims fall into the category of opinion, but the quote provided from Alexander asserted a statement of fact -- and one he’s used before: ""More Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote.""

We know hunting and fishing are popular, but, fresh off the 2012 election, we were aware that more than 2.4 million votes were cast in Tennessee on Nov. 6. Given that Tennessee has a population of 6.4 million, that would mean that some one-third of all Tennesseans -- just fewer than half of whom are men -- have hunting and fishing licenses.

The senator’s office said it was basing the Tennesseans who vote number on the Nov. 2, 2010, midterm election, in which 1,620,542 votes were cast, because that was the most recent election for which official certified results were available. For the hunting and fishing licenses, Alexander’s office pointed to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services reports from 2004, in which it added 727,525 from the hunting license report of 2003 numbers to the 992,727 from the fishing license report of 2003 numbers to come up with 1,720,252.

When we contacted the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, we discovered that hunting and fishing licenses are renewable on a yearly basis. Another key point -- most of the Tennessee licenses are what as known as Type 1: Hunting and Fishing Combo. That allows for fishing and hunting of small game, and TWRA press officer Lee Wilmot said that, for 2012, there had been 373,562 such licenses issued.

Those hunting larger game, like deer, purchase a Type 4: Annual Sportsman, and 61,284 have been issued for 2012. Throw in the 32,205 Type 2: Youth licenses, the 18,146 Type 166: Permanent Senior Citizen licenses and Type 167: Resident Annual Senior Citizen licenses and you get to  486,416 hunting and fishing licenses issued in Tennessee for 2012.

That number is well short of even the 1,620,542 votes cast in November of 2010 in Tennessee, and it’s even further away from the unofficial, non-certified count of 2,454,470 votes in the recent Nov. 6 election and the 2,599,749 votes cast in the 2008 presidential election in Tennessee. More than 2.4 million voted in the 2004 presidential election.  Sen. Alexander reached out to us directly and acknowledged that he should have qualified the quote more carefully to make it clear that he was referring to the number votes cast in the 2010 election.  

The discrepancy in numbers between actual licenses issued from 2012 and the 2003 numbers shown in that federal report appear to be related to how states are allowed to report to the federal agency. A note on the state site, for instance, says Tennessee issues the dual hunting and fishing ""combo"" license in part to maximize statistics used to receive federal funding.

We did find a more recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife report, from 2012, that looked closely at numbers of sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts in 2011. It did not list licenses, but instead relied on the U.S. Bureau of Census to help make scientific estimates. In its ""Table 4: Anglers and Hunters by Sportsperson’s State of Residence for 2011,"" the report’s number for Tennessee is 923,000.

Again, well short of votes cast by Tennesseans in the 2010 midterm elections, and nowhere close to the number of votes cast in any of the three most recent presidential elections.

Our ruling

We do not disagree with Sen. Alexander’s point that hunting and fishing remain popular in Tennessee, but his statement that more Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote is not supported by the most recent and most reliable numbers. There are more voters in Tennessee than sportsmen, so we rule this statement False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/18/lamar-alexander/lamar-alexander-says-more-tennesseeans-have-huntin/

Leader of Alliance for Safe Communities says 3,000 felons voted in Rhode Island in 2008
","
Usually after an election, the biggest arguments are over who won or lost. But on WHJJ’s ""The Helen Glover Show"" last week,  the big beef was over who was allowed to vote.

Glover’s guest was Carolyn Medeiros, executive director of  the Alliance for Safe Communities, an organization that, among other things, monitors criminal justice issues and acts as an advocate for victims of crimes, that ""they all be vindicated rather than further victimized.""

In a segment billed as the ""Outrage of the Week,""  Medeiros cited the fact that 3,001 felons on probation or parole had been allowed to vote in Rhode Island during the 2008 election, and she said that a larger but unknown number had probably voted in this month’s election.

""Our question is, are politicians going to pander to this new voter base,"" she asked.

Whether allowing felons to vote is an ""outrage"" is a matter of opinion, not a question for the Truth-O-Meter. But we decided to check whether Medeiros’ number is accurate.

We put in a call to Medeiros. While we awaited a response, we went to the Alliance’s website, where we found a blurb about the ""outrage,"" with a link to the website of OpenDoors, a Rhode Island nonprofit organization that provides job training and other services to help released inmates from the Adult Correctional Institutions adapt to living outside prison.

The OpenDoors website describes the group’s efforts to help released inmates become voters, and includes this passage:

""The 2008 election cycle was [the] first in which RI felons on probation/parole could vote since [the] 19th century. Of 17,606 probationers and parolees re-enfranchised since 2006:
*6,330 registered to vote in time for the general election on November 4, 2008;
*3,001 voted in one or more of the three statewide elections in 2008.""

So Medeiros accurately cited the OpenDoors number. But where did the number come from? First, a little background.

In 2006, OpenDoors -- then known as the Family Life Center -- was one of a number of organizations that pushed for a referendum to change the state Constitution to make it easier for convicted felons to become eligible to vote.

Under state law at the time, felons couldn’t register to vote until they had finished not only their prison terms but any probation or parole as well.

The referendum question asked voters to amend the Constitution to allow felons to register to vote after their release from incarceration, regardless of how long they might be on probation or parole.

Supporters said that would help released inmates feel more connected to the law-abiding community and help reduce the odds of them committing new crimes. Opponents argued that those who committed serious crimes had to earn the right to vote by completing their whole sentence, including probation or parole.

The probation issue was particularly relevant in Rhode Island because the state tends to resort to probation more often than imprisonment. A 2007 Pew Center on the States study found that Rhode Island’s imprisonment rate of 1 out of every 187 residents ranked 46th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

But Rhode Island’s probation rate of 1 out of 31 residents was in the top five nationally.

Voters approved the change, 51.5 percent to 48.5 percent. It affected only the right to vote; felons still have to serve out their full sentences of probation or parole if they want to run for public office.

After the vote, OpenDoors worked with the Department of Corrections and the secretary of state’s office to help released felons register and kept track of the results, yielding the numbers cited on its website.

OpenDoors Executive Director Sol Rodriguez said the organization only has numbers for the 2008 election.

Medeiros ultimately called us back and confirmed that OpenDoors was the source for her number.

Our ruling

Medeiros said 3,001 felons voted in Rhode Island in 2008. She accurately cited a number compiled by OpenDoors, which helps released inmates register and kept track of how many voted in 2008.

We find her statement True.

Note: In the beginning of her talk-show appearance, Medeiros said there were ""17,606 re-enfranchised voters … that have begun voting since the 2008 election,"" mixing the numbers of felons eligible to register to vote with those who actually voted. But as she worked through her presentation, she cited the correct number.

New Hampshire's new governor Maggie Hassan claims link between low unemployment and taxes
","
Throughout her campaign, Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire’s new governor-elect, vowed repeatedly to veto any statewide income or sales tax that crossed her desk. But, even as she celebrated her victory, Hassan was asked to address the matter one more time last week, this time before a national audience.

Interviewing Hassan the morning after the election on MSNBC’s Daily Rundown, anchor Chuck Todd asked the newly elected governor about the prospects of a broad-based tax.

""I served in the state Senate for six years with retiring Gov. John Lynch. During that time, we had the fourth lowest unemployment rate in the country,"" Hassan told Todd during the November 7 interview. ""Our economy works really well without an income or a sales tax.""

Throughout campaign season and beyond, candidates commonly refer to New Hampshire’s unemployment rate as one of the country’s lowest. But, was it really fourth best in the country during Hassan’s time in office? We decided to check the books.

Federal counts show that the numbers fluctuated slightly during Hassan’s time in the Senate. She she served three terms between 2004-10 before running for governor this year. Amid the changes, New Hampshire’s rate remained among the lowest.

Here’s a year-by-year review.

2005: 3.6 percent unemployment, tied with Montana for fourth lowest.
2006: 3.5 percent, tied with Alabama, Delaware for seventh lowest.
2007: 3.5 percent, tied with Delaware, New Mexico for eighth lowest.
2008: 3.9 percent, sixth lowest
2009: 6.2 percent, tied with Iowa for fifth lowest
2010: 6.1 percent, fourth lowest

(As a side note, New Hampshire retained its spot as the fourth-lowest unemployment rate, 5.4 percent, in 2011, the year after Hassan left office.)

So, the numbers show Hassan’s claim to be in the ballpark. The state’s unemployment rate ranked fourth lowest in both her first year in office and her last, and even when it rose, it remained among the country’s lowest.

But, Hassan cited the state’s unemployment rate as evidence the state doesn’t need an income or sales tax. For purposes of this check, we wanted to look at the connection between taxes and unemployment rates to see if there’s a link as Hassan suggests.

Analysts say there’s no direct correlation.

Across the country, tax policy may contribute to a strong jobs environment, but a variety of other, more local factors likely weigh heavier in determining the unemployment rate, according to Scott Drenkard, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation.

""New Hampshire fits with the pattern of having low unemployment and having a good tax system, but there are lots of contributing factors,"" Drenkard said. ""I can't say there's a very robust correlation (with the tax structure).""

Among the other states that rank among the lowest unemployment rates, for instance, Idaho, Vermont and Virginia all have both income and sales taxes. Hawaii, which had the nation’s lowest unemployment rate, had the nation’s highest income tax rate in 2005 and 2006, Hassan’s first two years in office, according to the Tax Foundation.

In New Hampshire, factors such as the state’s small population, its lack of big population centers and its demographics -- older and educated -- contribute heavily to its strong employment, according to Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies.

""For an older population, they're more likely to have jobs and hold on to jobs than the younger population is,"" Delay said.

Further, New Hampshire features strong manufacturing and health care sectors, among others, that keep employment strong, even in economic downturns, said Annette Nielsen, an economist for the state Employment Security office.

""It’s a whole mix of things. We have fairly strong high-tech manufacturing, and that combined with not a huge population, it doesn’t take a whole lot to create (good employment numbers),"" Nielsen said.

Put more succinctly, ""There’s no real connection between unemployment and tax structure,"" said Jon Shure, director of state fiscal strategies at the national Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. ""The key thing to creating jobs in any state is to make sure that you're investing in infrastructure, transportation, health care, all the components of a strong economy. … It’s not necessarily taxes.""


Our ruling:

New Hampshire’s unemployment rate fluctuated a little through Hassan’s tenure. But, even as it reached No. 7 among states in 2006 and No. 8 in 2007, New Hampshire’s rate remained among the country’s lowest. And, by the time Hassan left office in 2010, New Hampshire’s rate had returned to fourth, where it stood in her first year.

We’ll give the new governor credit for getting her numbers right (mostly). But, her stated connection between the unemployment rate and New Hampshire’s tax structure doesn’t hold up. Analysts in New Hampshire and around the country suggest that other factors --  including states’ size, demographics and work base -- drive unemployment more than taxes.

"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Libraries Yes! Committee']","
Is the Multnomah County Library system the second busiest in the nation?
","
Just over a week ago, voters approved a new library taxing district, securing funding for the Multnomah County Library well into the future. During the campaign to persuade voters to mark ""yes"" on their ballots, the Library Yes! Committee made a number of arguments in the district’s favor.

One of the most ubiquitous was the oft-repeated fact that the Multnomah County Library was the ""second busiest in the nation."" Given that Portland doesn’t even crack the 25 largest cities in the nation (by population), this fact has always struck us as pretty interesting.

During the campaign season, we were a bit distracted with various other claims, but now that things are bit quieter, we thought we’d come back to this one -- if only for curiosity’s sake.

We e-mailed Liz Kaufman, who handled media requests for the library district campaign, and she quickly followed up with a handy breakdown of statistics about the Multnomah County Library and its peer institutions, compiled by the American Library Association.

The association doesn’t track how ""busy"" a system is per se, but it does check the circulation -- or the total number of items issued in a given year. By that measure, the Multnomah County system is, indeed, the second busiest with 23,946,498.

We followed up with a phone call to the association for good measure and spoke with Macey Morales, their media point-person. She cautioned that their figures came from the Public Library Associations’ survey. ""A total of 1,300 libraries from the U.S. and Canada voluntarily complete the survey, so the report reflects a sample of public libraries in North America,"" she wrote in a follow-up e-mail.

That said, the Multnomah County system does have the second highest circulation in the most recent survey. The New York Public Library comes in first -- although to be fair, that system has some 87 branches compared to Multnomah’s 18. A quick aside: We also have the second highest circulation per capita. In that category, we were edged out -- 33 to 34 per person a year -- by Ohio’s Cuyahoga County Public Library.

Morales did point us to one other source, the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The institute does a more complete library census, looking at some 9,000 systems. The catch there is that their figures take a while to get published. They’re currently waiting on 2010 figures.

A report released by the institute in December 2009, said Multnomah County Library boasted the third highest circulation rate in the country -- there’s no mention of who is first or second. Those figures, of course, would be somewhat dated compared to the other survey -- though potentially more complete.

It’s often said that the Multnomah County Library system is the nation’s second busiest. The most recent available statistics from a survey used widely in the industry backs up the claim.

"['Civil Rights', 'Elections', 'Texas', 'Terral Smith']","
Terral Smith says that 40 years ago, U.S. placed Texas under Voting Rights act for failing to print ballots in Spanish
","
Texas carries a legal burden that most other states don’t, an Austin lawyer says, because of how its ballots appeared in the 1970s.

""About 40 years ago, the federal government placed Texas under the Voting Rights Act because Texas failed to print ballots in both English and Spanish,"" wrote Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, in an opinion column for the Sept. 9, 2012, Austin American-Statesman.

Most states under Section 5 of the act are there because of their history of discrimination against black voters. The Justice Department’s website says Congress passed the law ""at the height of the civil rights movement in the South, a movement committed to securing equal voting rights for African Americans.""

It’s far from being old news, though. Texas is contesting two high-profile applications of the act, and the Supreme Court agreed Nov. 9, 2012, to rule on an Alabama case challenging Section 5’s constitutionality.

We decided to look at the history.

The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which has been renewed and amended over the years, took aim at several methods being used to prevent African Americans from voting. These included literacy tests that white election officials could administer as they saw fit, the Justice Department site says. Though the 15th Amendment made such practices illegal in 1870, in reality they were widespread.

The 1965 act specified that no ""tests or devices"" could be placed between citizens and their ballots, spelling out examples such as the literacy tests and providing for oversight by ""examiners"" and the U.S. attorney general.

Section 5 required that certain jurisdictions -- states or smaller political entities that had recently employed such methods and had less than 50 percent voter participation or registration in the last presidential election -- must get federal preclearance for any changes in their election laws.

The same day that President Lyndon Johnson signed the act, according to a November 1965 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, seven states and parts of two others were flagged by the U.S. Census Bureau and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach because they had used literacy tests and fell below the halfway mark in voter registration/participation.

Texas had never put a literacy test into its laws, according to the online education Texas Politics project at the University of Texas.

Katzenbach told the Rotary Club of Houston in a Sept. 30, 1965, address, ""Voting discrimination is of general national concern, but it is not, by and large, a problem here. The use of federal examiners in Texas is neither needed nor contemplated.""

So how did Texas get on the list?

Smith told us he drew his information from a ruling in one of the state’s current voting rights battles over election changes that were denied preclearance: the 2011 maps drawn for Texas’ congressional and state legislative districts and the 2011 Texas law requiring voters to show government-issued photo ID.

In the voter ID case, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an Aug. 30, 2012, ruling which, in its historical background, said the 1965 act’s preclearance criteria were drawn up carefully to net the Southern states with the worst history of discrimination. ""In 1975,"" it said, ""Congress expanded the coverage formula to include jurisdictions that had substantial non-English-speaking populations but provided English-only voting materials at the polls.

""It was this change that brought Texas within the scope of Section 5’s coverage.""

And it was proposed by a Texan: U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, D-Houston, the first black congresswoman elected from the South.

According to a Congressional Research Service history of the act, the final form of the legislation in 1975 said that a jurisdiction would be subject to preclearance if it had low voter turnout/registration and also met both of these qualifications: 5 percent or more of its population spoke a language other than English, as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the jurisdiction had conducted its Nov. 1, 1972 elections solely in English.

If that group of non-English speakers also had lower-than-average literacy in English, the jurisdiction would have to conduct bilingual elections, including ballots in both languages.

Other states were affected, and Spanish was not the only language involved. Alaska and Arizona in their entirety, plus individual counties in California, New York and elsewhere, were now covered. As the U.S. population evolves and the act is amended or reconstrued, these continue to change; Houston’s Harris County, for example, was required to provide election materials in Vietnamese as of 2004. The Census Bureau annually publishes a list of the jurisdictions falling afoul of the language requirements.

So that’s what the 1975 amendment did. To learn whether Texas was drawn in because it didn’t print ballots in English and Spanish, we sought the motivation behind the amendment -- and heard a range of reasons.

Former Texas Gov. Mark White, who in 1975 was Texas’ secretary of state, told us by phone, ""It was all done to capture Texas."" National advocacy groups such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund wanted to maximize Hispanic voters’ power, he said.

White argued the case for Texas in December 1975 when the state sued claiming it had improperly been subjected to Section 5. ""We passed in 1975 a Texas voting rights act which was stronger than the federal act,"" he said. ""I think we did everything we could do to let everybody in America know that Texas was not part of the Old South, which would exclude minorities from voting.""

MALDEF’s vice president for litigation, Nina Perales, told us by email that Congress reached its decision after much testimony about discrimination against non-English speakers.

The testimony, some from MALDEF, described a range of discrimination, Perales said: refusing to register voters, throwing away their ballots, intimidation and harassment that included firing Spanish-speaking employees who got involved in politics. On a broader scale, districts were redrawn or positions elected at-large to prevent Spanish speakers from winning office, she said.

One view we came across several times in our research was that Texas only escaped the preclearance terms in 1965 by the grace of Texas native President Lyndon Johnson, at whose direction the act was drafted.

University of Houston political science professor Richard Murray has voiced this view: ""It is not surprising that LBJ left his home state off the ‘bad conduct’ list,"" Murray wrote in a June 26, 2009, blog post for Houston’s KTRK-TV.  By 1975, he wrote, U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas was eyeing a White House run and was persuaded by Jordan that extending the act to Texas and to Hispanic voters would earn him needed support from liberal and minority voters.

The archivist of Jordan’s papers at Texas Southern University, Gary Chaffee, emailed us documents from a May 2011 exhibit he put together focusing on Jordan’s Voting Rights Act work.

In a Feb. 26, 1975, press release headlined ""Representative Barbara Jordan Asks Congress to Extend Voting Rights Act to Texas,"" Jordan said: 
""I know firsthand the difficulty minorities have in participating in the political process as equals. The same discriminatory practices which moved the Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and renew it in 1970, are practiced in Texas today."" 
  
Separately, we found Jordan’s Feb. 26, 1975, statement introducing the bill in a Congressional subcommittee hearing, in which she described instances of voter intimidation and harassment as well as language barriers. 
Bilingual ballots wouldn’t fix everything, she said, but they were a start -- and offered a clear way to measure discrimination: 
""Printing of Spanish registration forms and Spanish baIlots will not cure voting discrimination in the Southwest. I have incorporated the use of an English-only ballot as a ‘test or device’ because it is a readily identifiable, objective criterion the Justice Department can easily apply nationally."" 
  
Ultimately, was Texas brought under the act because it failed to print Spanish ballots?

White and Perales both told us that was not entirely accurate because of the 1975 amendment’s three preclearance ""triggers"": 5 percent non-English speakers, less than 50 percent turnout/registration and failure to print bilingual ballots.


Our ruling

Smith said that ""about 40 years ago, the federal government placed Texas under the Voting Rights Act because Texas failed to print ballots in both English and Spanish.""

The amendment made 37 years ago was intended to -- and did -- bring Texas elections under the Voting Rights Act. English-only ballots were a ""trigger"" alongside other conditions.

Chris Redfern says Obama the first Dem in 75 years to get two majority wins for president in Ohio
","
As the kids like to say nowadays, Chris Redfern had swag.

A mere 12 or so hours removed from Barack’s Obama’s crowning win in the pivotal Buckeye state, the head of the Ohio Democratic Party was basking in the glow of the Democratic victory during a Nov. 7 news conference.

While Obama’s victory in Ohio was a big win for Democrats, Republicans had won their share of down ballot races maintaining overwhelming majorities among Ohio’s congressional delegation, at the Statehouse as well as on the Ohio Supreme Court.

But Redfern would hear none of it, saying he laughs when he hears his Republican counterpart, GOP Chief Bob Bennett, call Ohio a ""centrist-right"" state as he is frequently quoted as saying.

""Ohio today is not a centrist-right state,"" said Redfern. ""Barack Obama won this state for the second time and becomes, I believe, only the second Democrat in the last 75 years to win Ohio twice with more than 50 percent of the vote. There is nothing center-right about that.""

Setting aside the debatable question of whether Ohio is center-right or not, Redfern’s statement about the historic majority of Obama’s back-to-back wins in Ohio was intriguing. Did it really place Obama in such rarified Democratic air?

While the digging for Politifact usually involves asking the source for citations to back it up, we knew right where to find the official record for this—the Ohio Secretary of State’s office where historical data on elections is kept.

The records on Secretary of State Jon Husted’s website show that Obama unofficially has been credited with receiving 50.2 percent of the vote against Mitt Romney, and received 51.5 percent of the vote in 2008 against Republican John McCain. So as Redfern has crowed, Obama did achieve a majority in two elections in a row.

Before Obama this year, the last Democrat to win Ohio twice in a run for president was Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. But while winning Ohio twice on his way to eight years in the White House, Clinton only managed 47.4 percent of the vote in 1996 and 40.2 percent in 1992.

As you may recall, the 1992 election was a spirited three-way race with George Bush Sr. getting 38.3 percent of the vote and independent H. Ross Perot grabbing 21 percent in Ohio.

Democratic president Jimmy Carter narrowly carried Ohio in 1976 by 11,000 votes on his way to a victory over Gerald Ford but lost it in 1980 by a landslide to Ronald Reagan. Democratic president Lyndon Johnson won Ohio in 1968, but was only on the ballot once as the presidential candidate as was the case with Democrat Harry Truman in 1948.

In 1944, Democrat Franklin Roosevelt lost Ohio to Thomas Dewey by 12,000 but still won the presidency, but in 1940 Roosevelt did knock off Wendell Willkie in Ohio by a healthy margin. That was 72 years ago and the last time prior to Obama’s victory Nov. 6 that a Democrat got a second presidential win in Ohio by a majority..

Roosevelt’s first win with more than 50 percent came in 1936, 76 years ago. That’s when he beat Kansas Gov. Alf Landon by roughly 600,000 votes, easily a majority in Ohio. (He carried Ohio in 1932 but didn't quite reach 50 percent of the vote.)

So what are we left with here as we turn back from the history books?

Following Obama’s win in Ohio on Nov. 6, Democratic Party Chief Chris Redfern argued that Ohio was not a ""centrist-right"" state despite that characterization by Ohio Republican Party Chairman Bob Bennett.

To make his argument, Redfern said Obama was only the Democrat to twice carry Ohio with a majority in the last 75 years.

It turns out Redfern is right. Franklin Roosevelt was the last Democrat to carry Ohio twice with a majority, which he did in 1936 and 1940. And his second win did fall within the last 75 years.

Will more than half of new Sellwood Bridge accommodate just 2 percent of travelers?
","
There are people who think it fiscally irresponsible to spend road dollars on bicyclists and pedestrians when most people still use cars to get around. Case in point: The libertarian-minded Cascade Policy Institute think tank based in Portland and the proposed $299 million project to replace the Sellwood Bridge in Multnomah County. 

Analysts at Cascade posted a short essay on their website, pointing out that most of the new bridge will be dedicated to two percent of bridge users, ""even though cars carry nearly 98 percent of all passenger-trips during the peak hours. Only about 40 percent of the new bridge will be allocated to vehicular travel, with the other 60 percent dedicated to non-motorized transportation in the form of bikeways and mega-sidewalks.""

The essay acknowledges a need for more space for walkers and cyclists, but adds this: ""However, there is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers.""

Cascade is certainly entitled to its opinion, but we wanted to know if the numbers are correct. Is it true that more than half of the new bridge will be dedicated to a small percentage of users?

To back up, Multnomah County is replacing the Willamette River bridge because it is failing. According to the county’s website, the Sellwood Bridge carries 30,000 vehicles a day, making it Oregon’s busiest two-lane bridge. The current bridge, built in 1925, has one 4-foot wide sidewalk that is so narrow that bicyclists have to squeeze past walkers, use the auto lanes or avoid the bridge.

The new bridge will include wider sidewalks and lanes for bikes that double as emergency shoulder space for vehicles. Cars will still have two lanes. At its narrowest, the new bridge will double to a width of 64 feet, of which 24 feet will be forautos, pretty much the same as now.

Looked at that way, it’s fair to say that roughly 60 percent of the new space will be for non-motorized vehicles, although that calculation doesn’t account for extra driving lanes at both ends to accommodate auto traffic or shoulder space to accommodate auto troubles. (The county reports that by square footage, the breakdown is 49 percent for vehicles and 51 percent for bicyclists and pedestrians; that backs up the gist of Cascade's statement.)

Next, we asked John Charles, president and CEO of Cascade, how he derived the 2 percent figure. The answer? Field work!

We love field work at PolitiFact Oregon. Here’s what they did:

Charles and an aide visited the bridge on July 19, a sunny Thursday, and counted vehicle passengers, pedestrians and bicyclists. They counted 3,184 vehicles carrying 3,584 passengers over 90 minutes starting shortly after 7 a.m. Seventy-four crossed on foot or by bike. That breaks down to 98 percent by vehicle and 2 percent by other means.

His numbers are solid. The project’s own environmental impact study puts daily volume of walkers and riders at 530 on a weekday -- 1.7 percent of total trips if daily vehicle traffic is 30,000.

But here’s the rub: Part of the point of a new Sellwood Bridge is to grant more space to pedestrians and bicyclists, so we’re not sure it’s entirely fair to use current numbers, which are low because the bridge in its current condition is decidedly unfriendly to non-motorists.

In fact, Rob Sadowsky, executive director of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance, isn’t surprised by the 2 percent statistic. Riders, he said, will ""go over the Sellwood Bridge if they’re brave.""

The Oregonian’s commuting columnist even took a question last year from a rider who had been yelled at by a runner while crossing the Sellwood. Apparently, the sidewalk in question is so tight that the county has posted signs directing bicyclists to walk their bikes.    

Let’s look at projections for the Sellwood Bridge, which we acknowledge, are just that. The environmental impact study for the bridge projects 9,350 trips by bike or on foot every weekday by 2035, with motor traffic estimated at 39,000 a day. That would put non-motorized trips at 19 percent.

We asked Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute for his response to the projection.

""One, I don’t believe it. This city is famous for wild projections,"" he said. ""They can project whatever they want, that’s the world they live in, it’s computer-generated fantasies. It’s not reasonable, and even if you got it, it doesn’t negate my prior point: There’s no reason to allocate that much space for that mode. They function quite well with narrower space.""

Charles agrees there should be a minimum amount of space for non-drivers, but says the new Sellwood is overkill. He points to the Hawthorne, Broadway and Burnside as stellar examples of bridges with abundant use by cyclists, walkers and drivers. Hawthorne, we should point out, has four driving lanes and two 10-foot wide sidewalks; one-fifth to one-quarter of its daily traffic is by non-motorists.

Charles has a right to his opinion about whether the county is going overboard. And he could be right that the new Sellwood Bridge will never see the increase in non-motorized traffic projected by the planners.

But the bridge of today is apples to the oranges of the bridge of tomorrow -- making the statistic he’s citing an inappropriate indicator of future use. Non-drivers make robust use of Hawthorne because of the space given them. Present bike traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is so low today because the current bridge is outright hostile and dangerous to pedalers, walkers and runners, with one skinny sidewalk close to a bunch of cars. That’s a significant detail missing from the statement.

With Obama's re-election, federal and state rates in Wisconsin will hit 65 percent, international manufacturing exec says
","
Two weeks before the presidential election, the owner of a Milwaukee-based international manufacturer warned his employees of ""personal consequences"" if Barack Obama were re-elected.

The Oct. 23, 2012 email from Rite-Hite owner Mike White spurred state and national news coverage, a complaint with the state election board and even a review by local prosecutors.

The election is over, but some of White’s claims remain relevant.

He began the email by saying:

""Every Rite-­Hite employee in America should understand the personal consequences to them of having our tax rates increase dramatically if President Obama is re-elected, forcing taxpayers to fund President Obama's future deficits and social programs (including Obamacare), which require bigger government.

""Rite-­Hite is a Subchapter S corporation for taxes, meaning that our corporate tax rate is the highest personal tax rate. So what? Well, our RSP (retirement savings program) contributions are based on after-tax profits. The tax rate we pay is not 17 percent, as Warren Buffett would have you believe; with state taxes it is roughly
45 percent.""

He continued by stating:

""President Obama has announced that our planned tax rate would increase to roughly 65 percent, reducing our after tax income by 36 percent and dramatically reducing, if not eliminating, your and my RSP contributions.""

Obama, of course, was re-elected.

Does that mean state and federal income tax rates are on their way up to a promised combined 65 percent for some taxpayers?

Background

Rite-Hite, which employs some 1,400 people in North and South America, Asia and Europe, specializes in the manufacture and sale of loading dock and industrial door safety products. White, the company’s chairman as well as owner, is active civically, serving on the boards of Milwaukee’s Summerfest, which is billed as the world’s largest music festival; the Village of River Hills, an upscale Milwaukee suburb; and the foundation of Concordia University Wisconsin. He’s also a contributor to Republican candidates.

We’re leaving aside the question of whether White’s email amounted to voter intimidation, which the local district attorney’s office is still reviewing. White said in the e-mail that neither he nor his company ""will ever prejudice any employee for their political views."" There are also lingering questions about the company’s plans in the wake of Obama’s re-election.

Neither White nor his company's attorney responded to our requests for information about the claim of tax rates rising to 65 percent. But we can break it down.

White’s e-mail said RiteHite is an ""S corporation"" and that ""our corporate tax rate is the highest personal tax rate.""

Shareholders of an S corporation report the business’ income on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The highest individual tax rate is 35 percent, which is for people with an income above $388,350. So, White’s claim focuses on these high-income taxpayers.

Increasing rates

Obama has proposed eliminating what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush, for individuals earning more than $200,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000. That would raise the top federal rate to 39.6 percent.

As for Wisconsin, its highest income tax rate is 7.75 percent. It is not slated to increase; in fact, Gov. Scott Walker has pledged to cut income taxes, perhaps in his 2013-15 budget.

Add the top state rate of 7.75 percent to the highest federal rate proposed by Obama, 39.6 percent, and you get just over 47 percent -- slightly more than the 45 percent White said Rite-Hite is paying.

To further analyze White’s claim, we contacted several experts, including Milwaukee tax attorney John Vitek; Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance research director Dale Knapp; and Jack Norman, director of Tax Fairness WI, a joint project of two left-leaning Wisconsin organizations.

Each said the new combined state-federal rate that Rite-Hite will pay as a result of Obama's re-election could exceed 50 percent:

39.6 percent -- new top federal rate proposed by Obama
7.75 percent -- top Wisconsin rate (unchanged)
3.8 percent -- tax hike, starting in 2013, as part of ""Obamacare"" (the hike is on capital gains, dividend and interest income of high-income earners)
2.35 percent -- Medicare tax (includes an increase of 0.9 percent under Obamacare)
53.5 percent -- total combined rate

So, that’s a significant increase. But it’s also well short of 65 percent.

Two final notes: 
Vitek, the tax lawyer, said Rite-Hite doesn’t actually pay the taxes to the government; rather, it pays dividends to its shareholders to cover the taxes they are assessed as shareholders of Rite-Hite. 
Norman, the tax fairness group director (who wrote an analysis of White's e-mail), notes that tax rates are progressive -- you pay lower rates on the first portions of your income and higher rates on the higher portions. 
For example, the federal tax rate is 10 percent on income up to $17,400; the rate is 15 percent on income between $17,400 and $70,700; and so on. Norman's point is that high-earners like White pay the highest rate, currently 35 percent, only on the portion of income above $388,340.

Our rating

The owner of Milwaukee-based manufacturer Rite-Hite said that with Obama's re-election, the combined state and federal tax rate paid by his company would rise to about 65 percent.

Experts say the rate might exceed 50 percent, but they see no way of it reaching 65 percent.

We don't have the benefit of White's math to consider, but barring any other evidence, we rate his claim False.  ",/factchecks/2012/nov/15/mike-white/obamas-re-election-federal-and-state-rates-wiscons/

Caroline Casagrande says every American owes federal government $51,000
","

Pity the poor children of the United States – they, along with their parents, are already in hock to the federal government for thousands of dollars.

Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth) made that claim Oct. 26 during an interview with Michael Aron on NJTV’s ""On The Record.""

""Every American now is $51,000 in debt,"" Casagrande told Aron. ""That’s money I owe, that’s money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, that’s their check to the federal government right now.""

Casagrande’s number is solid, but she doesn’t have to worry about whipping out her checkbook or debit card any time soon, some federal budget experts say.

Let’s start by reviewing the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.

Debt held by the public is money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

Now let’s look at the numbers in Casagrande’s claim.

The U.S. Government Debt website on Nov. 6 – the date we started looking into Casagrande’s clam -- listed the national debt at $16,295,297,196,000. If that’s divided by 314,719,484 -- the total U.S. population, according to the Census Bureau, each American owes the federal government $51,777.21.

So, Casagrande’s number is accurate. But should Americans actually expect to pay that bill? Not necessarily.

Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution who has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties, explained that what the nation owes each year on the national debt is annual interest and principal payments.

""Do grandma and the grandkids have to pay off the national debt, as Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande seems to suggest?  No, they do not,"" Burtless wrote. ""Our grandkids’ great grandparents did not pay off the federal debt; neither did their parents or grandparents. There is no rule that the national debt has to be paid off in one generation, three generations, or even ten generations. Taxpayers do not face the possibility that they will receive a $51,000 bill in the mail anytime soon.""  

An invoice might not be in the mail but Casagrande’s statement is fair, according to spokespeople for the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute.

""We’re not even going to pay off the debt, we’re going to pay down the interest,"" said Matt Jensen, a research associate in Economic Policy Studies at the AEI. "" Under no proposal that I’ve seen is someone paying down the debt in real dollars. What we’re really talking about is paying the interest on the debt, forever. You’ll pay the interest, your children will pay the interest.""

Our PolitiFact colleagues in Virginia and New Hampshire also looked into similar claims in their states and found that the amount of debt cited by their lawmakers was largely accurate.

Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes in January said the national debt amounted to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. Household. Our colleagues rated the claim True.

In August, PolitiFact New Hampshire rated Mostly True a claim by Rep. Frank Guinta that every child in the United States has a $50,000 share in the national debt. Guinta  received a Mostly True because that would mean each of the nation’s nearly 74 million children would owe $216,102. Guinta’s figure was accurate, however, when the debt was spread across the entire population.

Our ruling

Casagrande said in a television interview, ""Every American now is $51,000 in debt. That’s money I owe, that’s money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, that’s their check to the federal government right now.""

A simple mathematical calculation confirms that every American technically owes the government $51,777.21 toward the national debt. But will youngsters have to suddenly start handing over their allowances to pay down the federal deficit? Not likely. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Rob Portman says CBO warns trip over fiscal cliff would lead to recession, kill jobs
","
Here’s how you might explain Congress and tax cuts to a third grader:

Congress cuts taxes, but it doesn’t necessarily make the cuts permanent. They last only as long as lawmakers can justify from a budgetary standpoint (more than a third grader needs to understand). Then the tax cuts expire, just as Congress mandated.

And then Congress goes: OMG, taxes are about to rise.

The same thing happens with scheduled spending cuts, or what lawmakers currently call sequestration. Congress in 2011 wrote a law mandating about $100 billion of them a year over a decade, starting in January 2013 and spread them across discretionary programs. These were supposed to be a poison pill as congressional negotiators tried to find some other way to stem  the rising federal debt. But Congress failed, so the pill must be swallowed.
The result of these spending and tax policies kicking in simultaneously is described as the looming ""fiscal cliff."" And one of last year’s negotiators, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, recently described the consequences of going over that cliff.

In an interview with the Dallas Morning News, Portman said, ""The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has just told us that these massive tax increases and defense cuts, and other aspects of so-called sequestration, will take us into a recession and kill jobs.""

Did Portman accurately cite the CBO’s analysis? Could the cliff be that bad?

According to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the answer is yes -- for a while.

On Nov. 8, the CBO posted a synopsis of a new report on its website, saying, ""Significant tax increases and spending cuts are slated to take effect in January 2013, sharply reducing the federal budget deficit and causing, by CBO’s estimates, a decline in the nation’s economic output and an increase in unemployment. ""

How awful might these be?

Allowing all of the scheduled tax hikes and spending cuts to take place would cut the gross domestic product, a measure of the nation’s economy, by 0.5 percent in 2013, says the full CBO report.

Economic growth is already less than robust -- the third quarter GDP growth was 2.0 percent, below the historic average since 1947 of 3.25 percent but higher than the 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. A contraction in the economy would cost jobs, with the unemployment rate rising to 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, the CBO said. That compares with today’s national unemployment rate of 7.9. (The rate in Ohio is 7.0.)

There are ways to temper the pain, however, which is why the CBO conducted its analysis. Congress could allow some but not all the tax cuts to expire. It could limit the immediate spending cuts. Each of these might soften the harsher consequences.

So why not just stop the whole thing, extend all the tax cuts and keep spending money?

Because the resulting national debt -- a result of tax revenue being inadequate to keep up with spending (the political parties disagree on which of these bears the most blame) -- would continue to drag down the economy.

In fact, the CBO says that if the pending spending cuts and tax hikes are allowed to kick in as scheduled,  ""after next year, by the agency’s estimates, economic growth will pick up, and the labor market will strengthen."" The unemployment rate would shrink to 5.5 percent by 2018, the CBO says.

In other words, next year’s pain would lead to eventual gain.

Conversely, the CBO says, if none of the tax cuts were to expire and government spending went on and on uninterrupted, ""the economy would remain below its potential and the unemployment rate would remain higher than usual for some time.""

And if this continued indefinitely. the federal debt would keep surging, raising the risk of a crisis ""in which the government would lose the ability to borrow money at affordable interest rates.""

So something must be done, or so you could assume from the CBO’s analysis. Congress just has to decide what and when. But with the economy still struggling and millions of Americans already looking for work, few lawmakers -- even the majority who agreed to the poison pill -- advocate tough fiscal medicine immediately.

The CBO provided Congress with some economic assumptions as it weighs its options, including phasing in some changes and delaying others.

And while Portman chose words with somewhat more rhetorical flair, his description of the consequences laid out in the CBO report is accurate.

The CBO did not use the word ""recession,"" as Portman did, but a recession is generally defined as an economic contraction in two consecutive quarters. That fits the CBO’s technical explanation -- a decline in GDP in the first half of 2013 -- and ""recession"" has been used in media reports as the shorthand..

Portman also is accurate when describing the potential for higher unemployment, based on the CBO report.

It is important to note that Portman was not delivering a thesis on the CBO report. Rather, he was telling a newspaper interviewer about the desire to avoid the short-term pain while addressing the long-term problems.

Whether his solutions, which include corporate tax reform, would work is immaterial here. His claim about the immediate consequences of going over the cliff, based on the CBO’s analysis, is True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/15/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-cbo-warns-trip-over-fiscal-cliff-/
