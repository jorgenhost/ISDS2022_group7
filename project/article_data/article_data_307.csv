Occupy Democrats graphic oversimplifies Trump's inheritance
","Donald Trump is a billionaire and he plays it up big in his bid to be president. What he did in business, he argues, he can do for the country. Republican and Democratic critics aim to shoot holes in that assumption. One tack is that Trump hasn’t been the super savvy investor he purports to be. The liberal group Occupy Democrats posted an image on its Facebook page on Dec. 2, 2015, to bring Trump down a notch or 10. Under a smiling photo of Trump, the image has these words: ""Bloomberg puts Trump’s current net worth at $2.9 billion. ... If Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he’d have $8 billion."" The source, included in the post, is Deborah Friedell with the London Review of Books. As it turns out, the graphic from Occupy Democrats did a fine job of quoting Friedell, but Friedell did a less than stellar job of quoting the source for her claim. Friedell’s words come from her review of a new biography of Donald Trump, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success by Michael D’Antonio. Here’s the full text relevant to this fact-check: ""Bloomberg puts Trump’s current net worth at $2.9 billion, Forbes at $4.1 billion. The National Journal has worked out that if Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he’d have $8 billion."" But if you read the National Journal story, it doesn’t directly tie whatever money Trump got from his father to an eventual $8 billion today. Here’s the key paragraph from a Sept. 2, 2015, article headlined ""The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing."" ""Had the celebrity busi­ness­man and Re­pub­lic­an pres­id­en­tial can­did­ate in­ves­ted his even­tu­al share of his fath­er’s real-es­tate com­pany in­to a mu­tu­al fund of S&P 500 stocks in 1974, it would be worth nearly $3 bil­lion today, thanks to the mar­ket’s per­form­ance over the past four dec­ades. If he’d in­ves­ted the $200 mil­lion that For­bes magazine de­term­ined he was worth in 1982 in­to that in­dex fund, it would have grown to more than $8 bil­lion today."" There’s a bit of informed guesswork behind these numbers because outsiders can only know so much about Trump’s finances. The National Journal writer, S.V. Dáte, figured Trump started with $40 million in 1974. That’s the year he became president of his father’s real estate company. By one estimate, the firm was worth about $200 million and divided among Donald Trump and his four siblings, each would have received $40 million. But it’s not as though the company was liquidated that year. Trump’s father lived until 1999, so whatever happened, it’s more complicated than Trump receiving a cash inheritance in 1974 and deciding what he would do with it. We’re left with a question of how much money Trump got from his father and, most important, at what point those assets morphed from being his father’s to being his. In 1982, after running his father’s firm for eight years, Forbes magazine estimated Trump’s worth at $200 million. Since he was in charge of the company, then those dollars are more his than his father’s. The Journal article tiptoed around this uncertainty with careful phrasing. The author talked about Trump investing ""his eventual share of his father’s real estate company."" An eventual share is not cash in hand. Similarly, the article did not say that the estimated $200 million in 1982 was from Trump’s father. Dáte told us in his view, that truly was Trump's money because the real estate company was worth more than that. Dáte said he didn't really care what the status of the assets was. ""I just wanted to get to the point of saying that given the amount of money he started with, to be a billionaire — it's not too hard,"" Dáte said. ""I worded it as carefully as I did because there are a lot of uncertainties."" Importantly, if the $200 million did not come from Trump's father, then you can't say that the father's money could have been worth $8 billion today. But the Occupy Democrats’ Facebook post took a paraphrase of the National Journal piece and then edited the paraphrase down to the text on the image. Occupy Democrats editor Omar Rivero didn’t defend the graphic he shared. Rivero said his group occasionally shares graphics made by others. ""As you can see in the post description and in the watermark, this graphic was made by Santa Pegatina, a political graphics maker,"" Rivero said. The best summary of the National Journal article is that it presents a hypothetical investment scenario using numbers that have some basis in the value of the Trump holdings, but aren’t necessarily what Trump got directly from his father. Running the numbers Even if the underlying assumptions are dodgy, the math at least is in the ballpark. We used $40 million as the starting point for 1974. Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance at the University of Central Florida, told us the account would have grown to $3.94 billion by November 2015 if the money had followed the S&P 500 index and all dividends had been reinvested. This is a rough calculation that ignores taxes owed on dividends, but it’s on the same scale as what the National Journal reported. Chen said it’s trickier to calculate the value of $200 million invested in 1982. ""Because the stock market in 1982 was quite volatile, the current value of $200 million investment in 1982 would depend on the time at which it was initially invested,"" Chen said. If it went in right at the end of 1981, it would be worth $6.7 billion. Invested in June 1982, the value today would be $8.3 billion. Invested at the end of 1982, it would be worth $9 billion. Again, in the neighborhood of what the Journal said. There is a huge debate over Trump’s current net worth. Estimates from outsiders, such as Bloomberg and Forbes, range from about $3 billion to about $4 billion. Trump says he has closer to $9 billion. Our ruling Occupy Democrats shared an image that said if Trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the S&P 500, he’d have $8 billion today. While it's true that Trump got a leg up from his father on the order of many tens of millions of dollars, this specific claim suffers from a key flaw. The only way to hit the $8 billion mark is to start with $200 million in 1982, and it's wrong to say that was Trump's father's money. While the father's business put Trump on the path to have $200 million in 1982, Trump himself had been running the company for eight years.  We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097051280>],/factchecks/2015/dec/09/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-say-simple-investment-trumps-fath/

Abbott's claims on ISIS incidents in Texas leave out critical facts
","After the recent terrorist attacks in France, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on ""The Real Story,"" a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. ""We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris,"" Abbott said, ""Texas is saying 'no more.’ "" We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: ""The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS."" The letter went on to say that ""in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS."" To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed he’d been ""involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS."" We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbott’s statement also relied on a broad definition of ""terrorist"" and ""ISIS member."" A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didn’t confirm he’d become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbott’s second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the ""Iraqi-born man in North Texas."" Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, ""on or about"" April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Abood’s computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making ""a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."" Abbott’s letter mischaracterizes the nature of Abood’s offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with ""lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS,"" not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage ""aspirational"" attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda. He was arrested by the FBI in 2010 after discussing jihad and potential travel to Somalia with an informant the previous year. Allison Mahan, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, told us via email, ""The Garland attackers were ISIS-inspired and the investigation is ongoing."" ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks are much more common than attacks directly ordered by members of the group, according to an analysis published in the October 2015 issue of the Terrorism Research Initiative’s Perspectives on Terrorism. The TRI is an international consortium of scholars founded in 2007 to facilitate security studies research. Our ruling In his opposition to resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said he was concerned about potential terrorism from devotees to the Islamic State. In Texas, Abbott said, ""we've had three ISIS-related incidents already."" Abbott is on solid ground with one Islamic State-related incident — the Garland shooting plot. In other Texas arrests related to the group, he uses the term ""incident"" to cover things including lying about a tweet and trying to travel to Syria. We rate this statement Half True.

U.S. incarcerates more people than China or Russia, state Supreme Court candidate Joe Donald says
","China has nearly 1.4 billion people -- four times as many as the United States’ 321 million. So, does the U.S. really incarcerate more people than China (and Russia, too)? That is the claim from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, who is challenging recently appointed state Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley in the spring 2016 election. State appeals court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who was a candidate for the high court in 2011, and Madison attorney Claude Covelli are also running. In a Dec. 2, 2015 interview on ""The Devil’s Advocates,"" a liberal radio talk show in Madison, Donald was asked about racial justice being part of his platform. Donald, who would be the first African-American elected to the state’s high court (former Justice Louis Butler was appointed, then lost an election), said he supports alternatives to jail and prison. ""It isn't all about simply retribution and punishment,"" he said. ""That if you treat the underlying issues, then in essence you transform that person's life, you rehabilitate them, they are able to be productive citizens and they're able to be strong advocates for their families.

""And by strengthening families, in my opinion, you actually reduce crime. And so I'm a huge proponent of trying to address that issue. You know, we lock up close to 2.4 million in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia."" We'll see from a recent fact check that Donald's statement is essentially on target, though available figures for China are to some extent understated. The numbers In October 2015, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. He said: ""Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth."" The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics’ latest figures showed there were more than 2.22 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons in 2013. We found that other estimates -- which can vary based on the time they were made and the definition of incarceration -- are similar. The University of London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research also uses 2.22 million. And an estimate from the Massachusetts-based Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, was slightly higher, at 2.4 million. Those figures put the United States at No. 1 in the world in terms of incarcerating people. (A key reason, Prison Policy Initiative legal director Aleks Kajstura told us, is that U.S. policies were changed in the 1980s to put more offenders in prison or jail, partly because of the war on drugs.) It’s a little harder to get rock-solid numbers internationally. China is second, with 1.66 million prisoners, and Russia is third, with 642,470, according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. But China’s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid-2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China. In terms of rate -- the number of people incarcerated compared to the entire population -- the United States is also well above Russia and China. The U.S. incarceration rate is 698 per 100,000 people, far outpacing Russia (445) and China (119), according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. That is second in the world behind tiny Seychelles (799), an Indian Ocean nation of 115 islands. Our rating Donald said: ""We lock up close to 2.4 million people in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia."" The best estimates are that the United States incarcerates 2.2 million to 2.4 people, far ahead of available figures for both China and Russia. But it’s possible the China numbers are under counted. We rate Donald’s statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Homeland Security', 'Terrorism', 'Rand Paul']","
Rand Paul largely correct that French electronic surveillance law is stronger than what U.S. has
","Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul argued against excessive surveillance and the bulk collection of electronic communication data, saying the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., show it isn’t successful. ""The Paris tragedy ... happened while we were still doing bulk collection,"" Paul said on the Dec. 6, 2015, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. ""All bulk collection. Also in France, they have a program a thousandfold more invasive collecting all of the data of all the French. Yet they still weren't able to see this coming."" We wanted to gauge whether the French system is far more invasive than the one in the United States. Mass surveillance 101 The key U.S. surveillance laws include the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed in 1978, and the USA Patriot Act, which was passed in 2002 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Portions of these laws have been variously reauthorized and revised, but the most relevant parts for analyzing Paul’s claim have to do with two broad topics: the process for eavesdropping on specific targets, and the collection of ""bulk"" metadata, which is information about the timing and frequency of electronic communications but not the content. France had already been engaged in bulk data collection on a scale similar to or even more expansive than the United States, according a 2013 report by leading French newspaper Le Monde. But this year -- between the Jan. 7 terrorist attack on magazine Charlie Hebdo and the Nov. 13 attacks across Paris -- France clarified its policy with the passage of a new law on surveillance. The controversial law was initially passed in June and upheld in August by France’s Constitutional Council with some limited revisions. Where the two countries’ surveillance programs are similar The French approach mirrors that of the U.S. approach in several ways. The French law requires Internet and telecommunications companies to install ""black boxes"" that vacuum up raw data about users that can be searched by computerized algorithm. This is broadly similar to the once-secret data-collection program known as PRISM, which came to light due to revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden. (The current status of the bulk data collection program is somewhat murky; authorization for bulk data collection expired on June 1, 2015, and then was extended by lawmakers for six months on an interim basis to facilitate transition to a new system. That period has just ended.) In addition, French law enforcement can seek permission to eavesdrop on specific targets, and that means that people who interact with those approved targets can have their communications scrutinized in that process as well, whether or not they themselves are suspected of being involved in illegal activities. This mechanism is broadly similar to the one in the United States. And French law enforcement, like U.S. law enforcement, has the ability under the law to conduct ""warrantless"" wiretaps that sidestep prior judicial approval, at least in some cases. Finally, critics of both countries’ laws have said they both contain inadequate provisions for transparency and whistleblower activities. Snowden has previously said that weak whistleblower protections helped convince him to go public about the National Security Agency’s activities rather than following official protest channels. These similarities aside, there are at least five ways in which France’s system is arguably more muscular than the one in the United States. Where the French system goes further than the United States’ system • Judicial review. Under the United States’ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, law enforcement officials must go to a special judicial court to receive permission to conduct electronic surveillance of American citizens. Historically, law enforcement officials have generally gotten what they’ve wanted from the court, leading critics to question how much of a hurdle this is. Still, the fact that members of the judiciary are passing judgment on the government’s requests does provide at least a modicum of independent oversight. By contrast, under the French system’s analogous body, only a minority of members of the National Commission for the Control of Intelligence Techniques -- six of 13 -- are judges. Another six are legislators and the last is a technical expert. The panel can be overruled by the prime minister. ""Because there is no opportunity for independent and neutral judges to decide whether surveillance of a particular target is justified (in the French system), there is a heightened risk that government officials might engage in improper monitoring,"" wrote Nathan A. Sales, a Syracuse University law professor in an analysis commissioned by the bar association of Paris while the law was being debated. Sales held senior positions in the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and was involved in the drafting of the Patriot Act. • Lack of ""minimization."" The United States’ system takes steps, albeit imperfect ones, to focus intelligence collection on suspicious behavior, thereby ""minimizing"" the amount of unrelated data swept up. These can involve restricting who can see the information, how long it may be retained, and whether or how it can be disseminated, Sales wrote. By contrast, the French system has few if any such protections, Sales wrote. He suggested an area of particular concern is a ""lack (of) any limits on the monitoring of privileged communications between attorneys and their clients."" • Search and seizure. One of the more contentious parts of the Patriot Act has involved delayed-notification searches -- that is, searches of properties in which the target not only isn’t present but is not even notified about the search until well after it takes place. These are sometimes called ""sneak and peek"" searches, or ""sneak and steal"" when it involves seizing and removing items from the location. These types of searches existed before the Patriot Act, but their use was tightly constrained; the Patriot Act loosened the rules. The French system, meanwhile, permits even more expansive action for tracking data and communications during such searches than the United States does, critics say. Under the French law, bugs, cameras and keystroke loggers could be planted during such searches, according to multiple media reports. • Location-based surveillance. The French law allows the use of devices variously known as ""proximity sensors,"" ""cell site simulators,"" ""IMSI catchers"" or ""Stingrays."" Rather than targeting surveillance on a specific person, these devices allow surveillance of cellphone calls and text messages at a given location. Privacy advocates say this technology is likely to capture communications by uninvolved bystanders. In the United States, it is Justice Department policy to seek a FISA probable-cause warrant before using such techniques. On paper, at least, that appears to be a tougher hurdle than what the French law includes. • Going beyond terrorism. The Patriot Act includes terrorism in its title (it’s the final ""t"" in the acronym ""patriot""), and at the FISA court, the government must show that the target is an ""agent of a foreign power,"" which has generally been interpreted to mean a spy or a terrorist. By contrast, the French law includes some broader justifications for action, including protecting France’s ""economic, industrial and scientific interests"" and prevention of ""organized delinquency."" ""In general, I think it’s accurate to say that French surveillance law is more permissive than U.S. surveillance law,"" Sales said in an interview. Bob Turner, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Center for National Security Law, agreed. ""Our system is far more respectful of individual rights,"" Turner said. ""The French have no equivalent to the Fourth Amendment (protection against search and seizure), and both law enforcement and intelligence services routinely collect data that would require a warrant here."" Our ruling Paul said that ""in France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive"" than the United States.’ "" The term ""a thousandfold"" is impossible to measure and is presumably a rhetorical flourish on Paul’s part. Still, we found five notable areas in which the French system offers law enforcement and government officials more unfettered tools than American officials have the ability to use. We rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E24600>],/factchecks/2015/dec/08/rand-paul/rand-paul-largely-correct-french-electronic-survei/
"['National', 'Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Alan Grayson']","
Grayson wrongly says Cruz not an American
","If Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wins the Republican presidential nomination, don’t expect Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., to send flowers. Grayson, a U.S. Senate candidate, has threatened to file a lawsuit the minute Cruz’s nomination is confirmed, saying Cruz can’t hold the office of president because he’s not an American.   Here’s the key exchange on Nov. 25, 2015, about Cruz between Grayson and Fox Radio host Alan Colmes. Grayson: ""Technically, he’s not even an American."" Colmes: ""Well, his mother was born here, so I guess like Obama, though it’s interesting to me that the people who had a problem with Obama’s birth certificate don’t have a problem with Ted Cruz, who literally was born in another country and renounced his Canadian citizenry."" Grayson: ""I don’t know. The Constitution says natural-born Americans, so now we’re counting Canadians as natural-born Americans? How does that work? I’m waiting for the moment that he gets the nomination and then I will file that beautiful lawsuit saying that he’s unqualified for the job because he’s ineligible."" Colmes: ""So you’re saying should he get the nomination, Alan Grayson will file a lawsuit against his candidacy?"" Grayson: ""Absolutely! Call me crazy, but I think the president of America should be an American."" Well, congressman, Cruz is an American by any definition. He travels on a U.S. passport. He's a member of the U.S. Senate, which requires him to be a citizen for nine years. There is no gray area on whether he is an American. We pressed Grayson on whether he actually meant that Cruz is not an American and he raised the idea that his very citizenship, gained through his mother, is flawed. Cruz’s citizenship Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970, to his Delaware-born mother Eleanor Darragh and Cuban-born father. If Darragh was an American, then under American law, Cruz was an American at birth. Not so fast, warns Grayson. He challenges the premise that Darragh was an American when Cruz was born. ""Cruz’s father says that Cruz’s mother became a naturalized Canadian citizen,"" Grayson said through his spokesman Kevin Franck. Grayson argues that under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, there are two ways to lose your citizenship. You can become a naturalized citizen in another country or declare your allegiance to another nation. ""If Cruz’s mother did either of these two things before his birth, then she lost her nationality, and Cruz could not rely upon her nationality to claim U.S. citizenship,"" Grayson said. The law isn't what Grayson says it is, which we'll get into in a moment. We asked Grayson to document that Darragh became a naturalized Canadian and he pointed us to a Web page that quotes an interview Cruz’s father gave to NPR. That interview actually does not support Grayson’s point. While Cruz’s father said he became a Canadian citizen, nowhere does he say that Darragh followed suit, much less that she did so before Cruz’s birth. So there is no evidence to support the allegation. We asked Grayson if he had anything else, and his spokesman said he did not. We asked the Cruz campaign to provide proof that Darragh remained an American citizen throughout her time in Canada, such as a residency document that she would need only if she were not a Canadian. They did not get back to us. But according to several immigration lawyers we reached, even if she had taken the Canadian oath, her American citizenship might have been at risk, but she would not have lost it automatically. In a pivotal 1967 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Afroyim vs. Rusk that a person only loses their citizenship if they specifically intend to give it up. Taking an oath of citizenship elsewhere doesn't qualify. ""Our holding does no more than to give to this citizen that which is his own, a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship,"" the justices wrote. But there's a kicker when it comes to Canada. Henry Chang, an immigration lawyer and partner in the law firm of Blaney McMurtry in Toronto, told us that in 1970, the Canadian oath had this strong language: ""I hereby renounce all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign sovereign or state of whom or which I may at this time be a subject or citizen."" A 1973 case in Canada led the country to drop that line. But until then, Chang said the original oath had the potential to impact Americans who adopted Canadian citizenship. ""If someone took the old form of the Canadian oath of naturalization prior to April 3, 1973, which included the renunciatory language, it is much easier for the U.S. government to prove that they committed the expatriating act with the intention of renouncing their U.S. citizenship,"" Chang said. But that still wouldn’t automatically cost Darragh her citizenship. Chang and Lenni Benson, an immigration law professor at New York Law School, said that it’s up to the U.S. government to press the point. ""If the government never challenged Sen. Cruz’s mother, it is very unlikely that the act of naturalizing in Canada formally would have caused her to lose her citizenship,"" Benson said. Chang amplified this point in an article on loss of citizenship. Chang noted that a 1980 Supreme Court ruling (Vance vs. Terrazas), and amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1986 declared that intent could not be assumed. The ruling and the law put the onus squarely on the government to prove that the person truly intended to renounce his or her citizenship. In legal parlance, giving up your citizenship is called an expatriating act. In 1990, the U.S. State Department issued this policy: ""The Department has adopted an administrative presumption that a person intends to retain U.S. citizenship when he or she commits a potentially expatriating act."" (An example of a potentially expatriating act would be becoming a citizen of another country.) In short, as a matter of law and policy, in the eyes of the law, taking an oath elsewhere does not automatically cost you your American citizenship. In 1988, Congress essentially shut the door on anyone who might want to go back and challenge someone’s citizenship before all these changes took effect. In a set of technical corrections to the 1986 amendments, it said the new law applied to actions that took place before 1986. The facts on the ground speak for themselves. When Cruz was about four, his parents moved to Texas. There is no evidence that the U.S. government ever challenged Darragh’s citizenship. It has always accepted Cruz as an American, based on his mother’s status. To go back and revisit Darragh’s status would put the government in the position of arguing a weak case that runs against a 25-year-old policy. A final note: Technically, Cruz was a dual-national, but to put the issue to rest, he formally renounced any claim to Canadian citizenship in May 2014. What it takes to be president Grayson also spoke about the constitutional requirement for a president to be a ""natural-born citizen."" We’ve looked at this before and the evidence falls heavily against Grayson’s position. The only sliver of uncertainty? There’s no Supreme Court ruling on this question. Most legal experts contend a ""natural born citizen"" means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn’t have to go through a naturalization process to become a citizen. Cruz has said he never went through that process. The Congressional Research Service, the agency tasked with providing authoritative research to all members of Congress, published a report after the 2008 election supporting the thinking that ""natural born"" citizenship means citizenship held ""at birth."" There are many legal and historical precedents to strongly back up this argument. Two former solicitor generals of opposing parties, Neal Katyal and Paul Clement, who worked for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, laid this out in an op-ed in the Harvard Law Review. In general, a child born with at least one American parent can claim citizenship regardless of where the birth took place. Grayson questions this, but that challenge has been rebuffed before. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., faced questions about his eligibility because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was stationed there. That did not prevent him from running as the GOP nominee in 2008. Despite this legal consensus, the fact remains that Supreme Court has never ruled on this matter and until it does, Cruz’s eligibility remains -- theoretically -- a slightly open question. Several citizens filed lawsuits asking the court to rule on whether McCain was a natural born citizen early in 2008, but the legal challenges didn’t go anywhere. Judges ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue, a problem that Grayson would also face if he tried. Sarah Duggin, a professor of law at Catholic University who has researched this issue extensively, has said the courts would likely see this as a political matter over which they have no jurisdiction. Our ruling Grayson said that Cruz is ineligible to be president because ""technically"" he’s not American. The suggestion that Cruz isn’t an American is patently wrong. He gained his citizenship through his American mother the moment he was born. Cruz holds a U.S. passport and is a duly elected member of the U.S. Senate. While Grayson alleges that Cruz’s mother had lost her American citizenship while in Canada, the source he cited provided no evidence.  Grayson provided no proof that Cruz’s mother had become a Canadian citizen. Even if she had, under current law and policy she would still be an American. And so, too, would Cruz.

Joe Scarborough says in days after Paris attack, White House ruled out possibility of attack at home
","President Barack Obama seems ""clueless"" on the threat of the Islamic State, said MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. ""First of all he won’t even call it Islamic radicalism,"" Scarborough said on Morning Joe Dec. 4, the day after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. ""His White House said, the weekend of Paris, that this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here."" It’s accurate that Obama doesn’t call ISIS ""Islamic radicalism"" or ""Islamic extremism."" A reader asked us to look into the second part of Scarborough’s statement: that in the days following the Friday, Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris, the Obama administration said an ISIS attack couldn’t happen in the United States. An MSNBC spokesperson directed us to comments made by Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 15. But they don’t back up Scarborough’s claim in the least. In the interview, Rhodes said there was no known credible threat to the United States at that moment. He did not say there wasn’t any possibility of ISIS-backed terrorism on U.S. soil whatsoever. Rhodes immediately followed up by pointing out that ISIS has ""aspirations to attack the United States."" Host George Stephanopoulos: ""And is there any intelligence suggesting a specific and credible threat to the homeland? I know yesterday there was none. Has anything new developed there?"" Rhodes: ""No, George, the president had a meeting yesterday that included the secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the FBI. Our determination is there's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time. But we're going to be very vigilant because we know ISIL has the aspirations to attack the United States as well as our European and other allies and partners."" Rhodes added later that one focus of Obama’s meetings with foreign leaders that weekend was ""how we can seal that border with Turkey to prevent that flow of foreign fighters and share intelligence to disrupt and prevent attacks in our European allies' countries and, of course, in the United States."" So this Rhodes interview doesn’t support Scarborough’s point; rather, Rhodes plainly admits that there is a threat of an ISIS attack in the United States. We looked at other White House statements from around that time and didn’t find anything else to back Scarborough up. Obama delivered a brief statement on Nov. 13 about the terrorist attack in Paris, but he did not address the possibility of terrorist attacks in the United States. At that time, ISIS’s involvement was unclear. In Nov. 15 remarks in Ankara, Turkey, Obama expressed solidarity with France and spoke about the fight against ISIS in the Middle East but did not discuss the potential for attacks in the United States. In a Nov. 16 press conference, also in Turkey, Obama delivered a similar message, but he also explicitly addressed ""the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil."" ""There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. We’ve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. ""But, having said that, we’ve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward."" So in the weekend immediately following the Paris attacks, it doesn’t seem that any White House official dismissed the possibility of an ISIS attack on U.S. soil. Our ruling Scarborough said that in the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said ""this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here."" Obama and Rhodes, an adviser, both spoke of the Islamic State’s aspirations to attack the United States in the two or three days following the Paris attacks. They talked about what the government is doing to prevent the group from carrying out its plans. Neither ruled out the possibility that ISIS could stage an attack on U.S. soil, nor did any other White House official. We rate Scarborough’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A326A00>],/factchecks/2015/dec/08/joe-scarborough/joe-scarborough-says-days-after-paris-attack-white/

McAuliffe says 5,000 school jobs have been cut since 2008
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe is making it clear that helping public schools will be the ""top priority"" in a two-year budget he’ll propose to the General Assembly this month. ""Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions"" in state public schools, he said Dec. 3 to journalists attending an annual AP Day at the Capital seminar hosted by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. McAuliffe, a Democrat, made a similar claim Nov. 24 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington. We wondered whether the governor is correct. So we turned to the official source for Virginia school statistics:  the Superintendent's Annual Report, a database kept by the state Department of Education. Brian Coy, McAuliffe’s director of communications, said the start date for the governor’s claim refers to the state budget year that began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. We accept that, because it’s bureaucratic parlance to refer to budgets by the latter year they were in effect. The 2007-08 budget is significant, because it was one of the last spending plans to be carried out before the last recession gripped the state and forced deep cuts in programs. Public education employment was at an all-time high in Virginia that school year, with 191,013 full-time equivalent workers. That fell to 186,202 employees during the 2013-14 school year, the latest figures available. That’s a drop of 4,811 full-time equivalent jobs. Almost one-fourth of those lost jobs belonged to instructors - a group that includes teachers, principals, assistant principals, librarians and guidance counselors. The number of full-time instructors dropped from 103,303 in 2007-08 to 102,140 in 2013-14 - a decline of 1,163. We should note that enrollment increased slightly during that time span. As a result, the average number of students per instructor rose from 11.5 to almost 12.1. About 70 percent of the job cuts went to ""administrative, service and support personnel."" This group includes school secretaries, nurses, bus drivers, janitors and computer technicians. The support staff shrank from 59,384 full-time equivalent jobs in 2007-08 to 55,912 in 2013-14 - a loss of 3,472. About three-quarters of those jobs were in school transportation and maintenance. We should note that while school jobs still are down from 2007-08, they do appear to be rebounding. As we’ve said, there were 186,202 full-time equivalent jobs in 2013-14, the latest year available. That’s slightly higher than the previous school year, when there were 185,944 positions. And a final note: McAuliffe, at this writing, has declined to reveal details about his education budget, other than to pledge significant new funding. He’s scheduled to present his budget proposals to the General Assembly’s money committees Dec. 17. Our ruling McAuliffe told journalists, ""Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions"" in state public schools. The actual number is 4,811, but we won’t carp with the rounding up. In a similar statement on a radio show, the governor said ""about 5,000 jobs."" It should be noted that about one-fourth of the positions belonged to instructors and that the vast majority of lost jobs affected support staff. That said, we rate McAuliffe’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DEE200>],/factchecks/2015/dec/08/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-5000-school-jobs-cut-2008/

YouTube video says Michigan Muslims can list multiple wives as 'extended family' for welfare
","A widely shared YouTube video makes outrageous claims about Muslims, multiple wives and welfare. The year-old video, which is based on a chain email, says polygamous Muslim men who live in Michigan can receive welfare benefits for up to four wives through a loophole. ""It's official. The camel's nose is in the governmental bureaucratic tent in Michigan, feeding on our hard-earned money we pay in taxes!"" the video says. ""Muslim men are allowed four wives. So when they immigrate to America, they simply list wife number two, three and four as ‘extended family,’ to qualify for welfare and a myriad of other taxpayer-funded government programs."" A few readers wanted to know if the video has any truth to it. Are Michigan taxpayers actually paying for Muslims to rake in welfare benefits for up to four wives? Why Michigan? Why Muslims? The video seems to have originated from cleantv.com, which claims to offer ""family-friendly television broadcasting and Video On Demand services…[and] Internet-ready television sets."" The site’s YouTube channel features dozens of politically charged videos. (Check out Snopes for an in-depth look at the video’s entire narrative.) We can’t be sure why the video focuses on Michigan. The state does have one of the largest Arab populations in the country, and various Michigan state government agencies offer Arabic versions of documents to accommodate those residents. But there’s nothing unique about Michigan’s applications for welfare compared to other states. As for polygamy, it is illegal in the United States. The U.S. government only recognizes one legal spouse. There are no reliable estimates for the number of American Muslims living in polygamous families, though NPR quoted experts putting it between 50,000 and 100,000. Still, the idea that a Muslim man could simply bring himself and multiple wives through the American immigration system is off-base. The immigration process for spouses is lengthy and complicated. Even if a man successfully sponsors his wife for an immigrant visa, the State Department specifically outlines that ""in cases of polygamy, only the first spouse may qualify as a spouse for immigration."" Any other wives would have to apply for an immigrant visa on their own. When the immigrants legally settle in the United States, they can apply for welfare programs, such as cash through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps or Medicaid, provided they meet requirements for residency, expenses and assets. A man could only claim one wife for purposes of welfare benefits, because multiple wives is a no-no. The video suggests that a Muslim man could register his second, third or fourth wives as ""extended family"" for extended benefits. Is that really how it’s done? It wouldn’t exactly work like that, experts said. ""For cash assistance and Medicaid, as per federal rules, only one spouse can be included in a group for determining eligibility,"" said Bob Wheaton, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. ""Any other non-related members of the household can’t be included."" In a polygamous home, the other wives would not be recognized as legal family members. Food stamps However, a family doesn’t face those same requirements when applying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. Federal rules for SNAP eligibility depend on the number of household members. So it’s theoretically possible for a Muslim man, or any man, to collect food assistance for multiple wives. ""Whether those household members are related or not does not matter under federal rules,"" Wheaton said. ""What matters is whether they live in the same household and prepare food together."" Of course, that would apply to any polygamous family, not just Muslim ones. A 2008 CBS report showed how fundamentalist, polygamist families in Colorado City, Ariz., receive big welfare checks: The man marries one wife legally and then weds and has kids with multiple other wives recognized by the church. Then, the other wives register for benefits as single women with children. (For reference, the maximum monthly allotment for food stamps is $1,169 for a family of eight. Each additional person in the household brings in an extra $146.) Michael Wiseman, a research professor at George Washington University, said this is legal under SNAP rules. ""The SNAP benefit formula recognizes ‘economies of scale,’ so that breaking the subfamilies apart increases total benefits paid,"" he said. ""Thus it is not fraud, as long as any contributions to the second family from the first are reported by the second family and included in benefits calculation."" The states could theoretically crack down on these loopholes in the system, but Wiseman said it might not be worth the trouble. ""The problem is, of course, deciding how to write rules that prevent this and yet ensure that some groups are subject to more intense investigation than others,"" he said. ""My guess is the fiscal impact is minimal."" Our ruling A viral YouTube video said that in Michigan, a Muslim man ""lists one wife as his, and signs the other two or three up as extended family on welfare."" The video and the chain email its based off of is highly misleading and ignores important realities of the U.S. immigration and welfare system in an attempt to drum up anti-Muslim sentiment. For one, the rules of the immigration system make it very hard for immigrants who may have multiple wives to enter the country, as the United States does not recognize polygamy. There is also no evidence that Michigan or any other state would allow or encourage Muslims to sign up extra wives as ""extended family."" For most welfare programs, it would not be possible for additional wives to qualify for assistance. However, a Muslim man with multiple wives (and meets the right income and residency requirements) could theoretically benefit through food stamps because it is based on the number of people in the household, not just legally recognized family members. But this would be true for any polygamist family, not just Muslims in Michigan. Flaws in the system don’t exactly mean the government is subsidizing polygamy. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BE9FC0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/07/chain-email/youtube-video-says-michigan-muslims-can-list-multi/

Kevin Russell of Shinyribs says singers not paid when songs air on the radio
","A singer records a song, a radio station plays the song and the singer gets a little extra money for that, yes? Not in this country, Kevin Russell of Austin said in an opinion column in the Oct. 28, 2015, Austin American-Statesman. Russell, who leads the band Shinyribs, said U.S. radio stations ""don’t compensate the artists and musicians who make the music played by those stations. That needs to change. In almost every other country in the world, artists and musicians are paid when their music is played on the radio. In fact, the only countries besides the U.S. who do not have a radio-performance right are China, Iran and North Korea."" We wondered if the U.S. shares this distinction with just those countries. U.S. law has long provided for composers to be paid for over-the-air radio play, we learned, but the actual performers have never gotten money for radio play, the industry premise being that each time a song airs, the performer could get a lift in record sales. Significantly, federal law was revised in 1995 to require services that stream music to pay performers for what goes out over the Internet, though on-the-air or terrestrial radio stations were exempted, according to a February 2015 report by the U.S. Copyright Office pointed out to us by Melissa England, a California public relations executive who responded when we asked Russell how he reached his list of countries. The report, which calls for the exemption to be removed, says that internationally, the U.S. is an outlier; a footnote says: ""Only a handful of countries lack"" what’s called a radio performance right. In ""addition to the United States, the list includes China, North Korea, and Iran,"" the footnote says. A secondary impact, according to the report, is that other countries do not compensate U.S. performers whose works air on their stations, costing record companies and artists an estimated $70 million to $100 million in annual royalties. England put us in touch with her client, the Recording Academy, which oversees the GRAMMY awards, and Daryl Friedman, a Washington, D.C.-based officer for the group, told us by email that Russell was correct about four countries that don’t provide radio-performance rights. according to research compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group for recording companies, and verified by industry groups including SoundExchange, Inc. However, Friedman said, other smaller countries take similar approaches. He said the countries that, like the U.S., don’t pay radio performance rights include Bangladesh, Congo, Gabon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Micronesia, Niger, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe. "" I think you get the point the writer was making,"" Friedman said. ""The U.S. stands out."" Friedman further said the ""U.S. is the only country that is a member of the OECD (Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development—modern, free-market nations), that does not provide a performance right on terrestrial radio. All of the other countries included in this organization that do provide performance rights are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom."" We emailed and called the recording association in hopes of learning how its list was compiled and didn’t get an answer to that. Separately, a Washington, D.C.-based advocate called Russell’s claim ""essentially correct."" Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, a nonprofit that says it supports a ""musical ecosystem where artists flourish and are compensated fairly and transparently for their work,"" added by email: ""For a variety of reasons, it can be difficult to get complete information on which countries pay for the performance right. Iran and North Korea do not currently pay. China is a bit more ambiguous right now; there may have been a deal struck. We've also gotten some conflicting information on Afghanistan and Rwanda."" Following up, Erickson said China still doesn’t pay radio performance royalties and that holds too for the other countries named by Russell. Afghanistan, he said, passed a copyright law in 2008 and might be paying performance royalties and Rwanda appears to be doing so. Erickson said it’s hard to proceed in some countries partly because an infrastructure doesn’t exist to collect and distribute payments. ""The U.S. is certainly unique among western industrialized countries"" in not paying performers for radio play, Erickson said. Another view Supporters of the existing law say changing it would be a bad move. An undated post on the National Association of Broadcasters website calls radio ""the number-one promotional tool for record labels and performers. Free radio airplay provides the record industry increased popularity, visibility and record sales for both established and upcoming artists."" If the law were changed, resulting in what the association calls a ""performance tax,"" local stations would be slammed, risking jobs, the post says. Notably, it also says, ""numerous radio companies and record labels have negotiated private deals of their own that compensate copyright owners and performers, demonstrating the ability of the marketplace to best address the issue."" To our inquiry, an association spokesman, Dennis Wharton, agreed by email that most countries pay radio performance royalties. Then again, he said by email, ""most of those countries have state-run broadcasting"" and aren’t ""nearly as successful as the U.S. We believe the reason the music business and the radio business in the U.S. are wildly successful is because local radio stations are not required to pay onerous fees to record labels and performers."" Wharton suggested many performers get money from songs played on radio stations thanks to having or sharing a writing credit on the material. ""Local radio stations pay $350 million a year to songwriters when music is played on ‘terrestrial’ (or local) radio stations,"" he said. ""We pay another $80 million to performing artists, record labels and songwriters when a local radio station streams music over the Internet. $350 million plus $80 million equals $430 million that local radio stations are paying every year for the privilege of playing music,"" he said. Our ruling Russell said: ""In almost every other country in the world, artists and musicians are paid when their music is played on the radio. In fact, the only countries besides the U.S. who do not have a radio-performance right are China, Iran and North Korea."" He’s right about the four countries, though more than a dozen smaller countries similarly don’t require performers to be compensated when their singing or playing airs over the radio. It’s also worth noting that  performers who help compose songs or pieces do get compensated for radio play. We rate this statement Mostly True.

Rubio says he prevented a $2.5 billion taxpayer bailout for Obamacare
","Presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is taking credit for potentially sounding the death knell for Obamacare, claiming legislation he introduced eventually prevented Washington from giving billions of tax dollars to insurance companies. ""Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion,"" Rubio said in a Dec. 1, 2015, tweet. It linked to a Fox News story giving Rubio credit for dealing a blow to President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation. Declaring he saved heaps of tax money and prevented a government bailout linked to a divisive law is a campaign coup for Rubio, who has risen to second among GOP candidates in the latest national Quinnipiac poll. But can he truly claim he kept billions from being used for a so-called bailout? Risk corridors rundown To set the table, we need to take a deep breath and go over a provision of the Affordable Care Act known as ""risk corridors."" The ACA upended the traditional health insurance model of selling mostly to healthy people, mandating that insurers must provide policies to everyone, regardless of health or pre-existing conditions. That presented a problem for the companies, which didn’t know how much they would need to charge in premiums in order to cover their expenses for all the new policies.   To help companies stay solvent as they adjusted their rates to proper levels, the law provided a three-year period in which the government would spread the risk among all insurers in ACA marketplaces. This program, set to last between 2014-16, is known as risk corridors. If some insurers are successful in setting their marketplace rates properly and make more than a certain amount, Washington gets some of that extra money, referred to as user fees. Companies that don’t do well have a portion of their losses covered by the government. Rubio has opposed the risk corridors since 2013, introducing legislation in the Senate to repeal the program. His bill didn’t go anywhere, but Rubio continued to speak out against the provision, referring to the program as a ""bailout"" for unsuccessful insurance companies. But is it really a bailout?  Several experts told us no, stressing that a bailout usually refers to a program used to save a company after the fact, not a mechanism in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan through Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage set up during George W. Bush’s presidency. The Part D program is a bit different than the ACA’s version, but it was still designed to spread risk among insurers. ""Then, no one called it a bailout, when a new private insurance market was being created for Medicare drug benefits,"" said Mark Hall, a law and public health professor at Wake Forest University. But the problem with Obamacare’s risk corridors is really about how it’s funded. And that’s the heart of Rubio’s claim of saving taxpayer money. Funding fight The ACA did not specify where it was getting the money to cover any risk corridor payments. To get around this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they would keep the program budget-neutral by making payments strictly from the user fees successful insurers sent to the government. Rubio’s concern has been that CMS promised in 2013 that ""regardless of the balance of payments and receipts"" in the program, insurers who said they needed money would get it. His point is that if there wasn’t enough money to cover the payments, the Obama administration would ask Congress for money. But CMS said in April 2014 that it didn’t plan to ask Congress for an appropriation. If they didn’t take in enough money the first year, they would make it up in later years, when marketplaces hopefully stabilized enough to cover losses. To make sure CMS didn’t ask for cash, Rubio wanted to cut off other sources of funding that could be used to pay off those companies. He urged then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential appropriations for risk corridor payments. When Congress passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included a sentence, or a ""rider"" in legislative speak, that said the CMS’ parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not move money around in its budget to pay extra risk corridor expenses. Other legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language. Rubio has since reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors. Everyone had to wait until insurance companies turned in their results to see how the risk corridors were working. The first year didn’t go as well as CMS and the Obama administration had hoped. In October 2015, CMS announced the risk corridors program took in $362 million for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion. That left a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can’t pay. CMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014 this year, leading some insurers to leave the marketplaces or even collapse altogether. Rubio now is on the campaign trail trumpeting the move as potentially being ""a big part of ending Obamacare for good."" Some legal observers, however, doubt whether Rubio’s efforts had any long-term effects. ""All the rider did is say, ‘If you’re going to go scrape the couch cushions for money to pay for this, don’t,’ "" Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, told PolitiFact Florida. ""The Rubio rider is preventing the administration from coming up with a workaround to a problem the law already had."" There are still two years left in the risk corridors program, which the Congressional Budget Office said will likely eventually break even. If the program is in the red after 2016, CMS will either have to somehow find the money or ask Congress to decide whether to approve cash to pay the bill. Otherwise insurers could potentially sue to get what the law says they’re owed. ""What he did is throw a wrench in the process,"" Bagley said of Rubio, who is trying to include the same kind of roadblock in the current spending bill. The deadline for that bill is Dec. 11. ""It’s perfectly reasonable to assume those insurance companies are going to eventually want the money that was promised to them."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion."" He’s referring to a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors, which faced a $2.5 billion shortfall for 2014. Rubio, whose efforts to repeal risk corridors have so far failed, helped persuade Congress last year to prevent Health and Human Services from being able to cover the difference with money from its own budget. But experts said calling the program a bailout is not accurate. They also noted CMS has said they want the risk corridors to pay for themselves through fees from insurers. Most importantly, experts also said Rubio did not necessarily save that money in the long run. His best argument is he temporarily limited one way CMS could have tried to pay for insurance companies' losses. The program has two more years to cover its expenses. If any bills are due after that time, CMS or Congress will have to find a way to pay them because they are obligated to do so.  Rubio oversimplified a complex process that is still largely unresolved. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967DC8C0>],/factchecks/2015/dec/07/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-prevented-25-billion-obamacare-bailo/

Ignoring inflation, Scott Walker says incomes rose in Wisconsin from 2010 to 2014
","On the morning of Dec. 3, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker tweeted this from his official Twitter account: ""From 2010-2014, median household income has actually gone up 7.4 percent."" The word actually seemed to allude to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article from the front page of that morning’s newspaper. The headline was: ""Household income takes sharp downturn in most of Wisconsin."" So, which is it? Have incomes in the Badger State gone up? Or down? Previous claim In July 2015, while pursuing his presidential bid, Walker used his personal Twitter account to say that under his leadership, Wisconsin median household income was up 2.7 percent, while it was down 1.3 percent nationally under President Barack Obama. Our rating was Mostly False. Walker had cited U.S. Census data, usually a gold-standard source. But the data was from the census’ Current Population Survey. That set is good for the national income picture, but less accurate at the state level. The better data is from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a rolling collection of household and demographic statistics from 3.5 million addresses. Those figures revealed a much different picture than Walker had painted: An income drop nationally, yes -- of 1.72 percent. But also an income drop -- not an increase, as Walker stated -- in Wisconsin of 1.62 percent. So, what about the governor’s claim this time? The news story The Journal Sentinel’s article reported on newly released data from the American Community Survey covering two periods: 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014. Median household income fell by a significant margin in two-thirds of Wisconsin counties during the period. Importantly, the article reported figures that are adjusted for inflation. By the way, think of median household income as the midpoint: Half of Wisconsin households have an income higher than the median, and half have an income that is lower. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick emailed the Journal Sentinel about the article, saying it was distorted because it did not include the 7.4 percent figure Walker cited in his tweet. The Journal Sentinel asked her for the data that produced that figure. What the newspaper found was that Walker used American Community Survey data -- but didn’t properly adjust for inflation. That means he compared 2010 dollars to 2014 dollars, an economic no-no. Whenever you are looking at income, ""you should be looking at real income instead of nominal income, which means you adjust for changes,"" said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee and former chief economist of the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe. Otherwise, he said, you’re looking at apples and oranges. ""$100 today is not the same as $100 last year,"" Chowdhury said. ""If you adjust for price, what you get is the real change in your buying power."" For the news article and for this analysis, the Journal Sentinel used the Consumer Price Index from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust for inflation. Here’s what the adjusted data show: Walker’s method: 2010 Wisconsin median household income -- unadjusted 2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars) Difference $49,001 $52,622 7.4% increase 2010 Wisconsin median household income -- adjusted for inflation 2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars) Difference $53,198 $52,622 1.1% decrease ""What you are doing is the right approach, looking at real income instead of nominal income,"" Chowdhury said. ""The real reason they (Walker) use nominal income is because it looks better."" Our rating Walker said that from 2010-2014, median household income in Wisconsin ""has actually gone up 7.4 percent."" In the best light, median household income in Wisconsin rose by 7.4 percent from 2010 to 2014. But the better figures account for inflation. And by that measure, income dropped by 1.1 percent during that period. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

Senator claims California grows jobs faster than ""rest of the nation""
"," Top California Democrats like State Senate leader Kevin de León often claim that the state’s economy is humming right along — and not weighed down by their ambitious new clean energy requirements. Critics, particularly the oil industry, consider the state’s clean energy push detrimental to California’s economy and job outlook. So, it’s not a surprise that De León, author of the state’s most recent clean energy law, touted California’s strong job growth during a recent speech abroad about climate change. De León, D-Los Angeles, spoke about California’s role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He told them California has ""robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe,"" according to a November press release from the senator’s office. California’s employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lost more than a million jobs from 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the state’s healthier employment figures. But, we wondered, is the state seeing job growth that truly ""outpaces the rest of the nation,"" as the senator claimed? Or did his statement exaggerate the state’s good job news? We set out on a fact check limited to this question. We did not evaluate the additional question of how the state’s clean energy rules have affected California’s job growth. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Our research Economists we spoke with said De León’s statement, on its face, is correct. They said they took his statement to mean California’s job growth rate was higher than the country’s overall job growth rate. And it is. In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman University’s Center for Economic Research. ""Overall, the statement is accurate,"" said Professor Esmael Adibi, the center’s director. ""We are outperforming the U.S."" And that’s not a new trend, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University. ""The state has actually outperformed the country as a whole for 44 consecutive months, which amounts to almost four years,"" Reaser said. Still, there’s more to the nation’s job picture. Fourteen other states in 2014 had a higher job growth rate than the country overall, according to data provided by the economists. California’s accomplishment was hardly unique. Another interpretation of De León’s claim is that California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in ""the rest of the nation."" Asked to clarify the senator’s statement, De León’s office pointed to recent news articles that describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall. Still, the phrase ""rest of the nation"" is open to different readings, Abibi said. ""Is he talking about the U.S. as a whole or is he talking about Texas or North Dakota or Michigan?"" the professor asked. That’s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than California’s 3 percent last year. They were North Dakota at 3.8 percent; Nevada at 3.5 percent; Colorado at 3.3 percent; Florida at 3.2 percent and Texas with 3.1 percent, according to state and federal data.  Senator Kevin De León addresses members of the U.K. Parliament in London. Photo courtesy De León's office. Our ruling State Senator Kevin de León said earlier this month that California has ""robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe."" We limited our fact check to whether California has grown jobs faster than ""the rest of the nation."" We did not evaluate the impact the state’s clean energy policies have had on job growth, a question raised by the second part of De León’s statement.   Economists we spoke with agree that California’s job growth rate has been higher than the nation’s overall average — for several years. Last year, the state’s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s. But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that’s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat. And there is another way to read the senator’s statement. One could assume the senator meant California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of ""the rest of the nation,"" and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success.

A crime to transport dentures across state lines? Goodlatte's claim has teeth
","Our jaws dropped when U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte called for the repeal of a federal law banning the transport of dentures across state lines. Does such a law really exist? Goodlatte, R-6th, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, made the statement during a Nov. 24 radio interview on ""The John Fredericks Show"" in Portsmouth. He was touting a bill his committee passed Nov. 18 that would strike a number of what he considers to be superfluous laws. ""There is a federal criminal law that says it’s a crime to transport dentures across state lines,"" he said. ""So we’re getting rid of that."" Seeking more information, we contacted Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s communications director. She pointed us to a section of the U.S. code called the Federal Denture Act of 1942. It’s a murky law, and we had trouble finding experts who know about it. It turns out that some states have laws that only dentures provided by licensed dentists can be sold within their borders, and other states don’t have that mandate. The federal law says its purpose is to protect the integrity of state laws requiring dentist-made false teeth and to promote good oral health. Those who violate the law can be charged criminally or reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We wondered how often people have been charged with the federal crime. Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, told us his department looked back over the past decade, starting in 2004, and could not find records of any charges being filed under the provision. If no one is being prosecuted, is there still any value in having the law? The answer depends on who makes the dentures. Maria Lopez Howell, a consumer adviser with the American Dental Association, said the law protects people by making sure their dentures are provided by someone ""who has been trained to do this very customized work."" On the other side of the fence are denturists - technicians who have been trained in making dentures but do not have medical degrees.  Paul M. Levasseur, secretary of the National Denturist Association, called the restriction on interstate transport of false teeth ""a strange law."" ""While I've never heard of anyone being prosecuted, it is probably a case of protectionism by organized dentistry,"" Levasseur said in an email. The New York Times documented the dispute between dentists and denturists in 2007. Denturists said they were highly trained and sometimes work under the supervision of a dentist.  The ADA said the technicians aren’t trained to diagnose mouth diseases or to spot broken roots of teeth, which can cause harm if not corrected before dentures are inserted. All of this debate, however, ignores a more basic question: Can grandpa wear his false teeth across state lines without the risk of prosecution? The answer is yes. ""If you have a family member who has dentures, they can still travel across the United States without any consequences,"" Howell said. Levasseur told us, ""I believe this deals with commerce not individuals."" Our ruling Goodlatte said it’s a federal crime ""to transport dentures across state lines."" He made the statement while promoting a bill that would repeal what he considers to be unnecessary laws. A 73-year-old federal law does make it a crime for non-dentists who make false teeth to ship their wares out of state. But it doesn’t restrict citizens from wearing their dentures wherever they go. The congressman didn’t mention that. So Goodlatte’s claim is accurate but needs a clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D27780>],/factchecks/2015/dec/07/bob-goodlatte/goodlattes-says-clim/

Hales hasn't completely reversed course on his 'system development charges' moratorium
","
In a city as blue as Portland, it’s sometimes hard for mayoral candidates to draw sharp policy differences. Even so, a few emerge. Take for instance, Charlie Hales and Jefferson Smith’s difference over the very intriguing ""system development charges.""

System development charges are fees paid by developers to help finance the infrastructure need to support their projects -- everything from roads and water to sewers and parks.

During the primary campaign, Hales called for a two-year moratorium on the charges. They were a deterrent to new development, he said, at a time when the city needed all the economic activity it could get.

(In a recent conversation he illustrated his point: A movie theater on Northwest 21st Avenue recently expanded and had to pay transportation development fees. But, he said, the transportation infrastructure up there is already strong -- what’s the point?)

Jefferson Smith, for his part, disagreed, saying during an April debate: ""I don’t agree with Mr. Hales that we should give a sweeping break to the developers to allow them to build that infill housing without paying for those very basics. So before we talk about spending new money, or even spending old money, let’s make sure we don’t give away the money we already have.""

In fact, PolitiFact Oregon at the time thought it was interesting enough that we did a short fact check on the issue.

All of this might not matter anymore, however, given a recent story in The Willamette Week reporting that Hales has done a 180 on the issue. ""He tells WW he’s backed away from his proposal to waive development fees across the board,"" the July 18 article reads. ""He says his plan all along was to help jump-start affordable housing and small businesses, which often pay onerous fees when they open, expand or remodel.""

So, has Charlie Hales done a flip flop? We wanted to find out.

The surest way to settle this was to call Hales directly. He said he had abandoned the idea of a two-year moratorium -- at least for now. That said, he’s still interested in having a discussion about the fees. The change of heart happened for a couple reasons, according to Hales.

First, a report on these charges is due to be given to the City Council early next year, right after he’d assume office if he wins in November. Hales says he’s hoping the report will answer for him the questions ""Are our STCs too high? Are they just right? Are they too low -- I suspect that is probably not the case.""

Second, Hales says he’s noticed more development in recent months -- pushing him to rethink whether a moratorium is necessary for spurring future growth. ""A full moratorium doesn't appear to be needed anymore,"" he said, but he would consider a partial one, particularly to support smaller businesses. ""There still may be some need.""

We also checked with Ross Caron, the spokesman for Portland’s Bureau of Development Services, who backed up Hales in part, noting that ""development has been more active this summer than it has been for the last few years,"" for both commercial and residential projects.

Of course, news of a development rebound has been around for some time now. Still, Hales’ motivation in changing his position is not the subject we’re interested so much as the change itself.

We’re ruling his change of heart a Half Flip. At one point, Hales called for a full moratorium on system development charges. Now, he’s taking a wait-and-see approach with the idea that a partial, more-targeted moratorium might be necessary down the road.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097177400>],/factchecks/2012/jul/20/charlie-hales/hales-hasnt-completely-reversed-course-his-system-/
"['National', 'Stimulus', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says stimulus money for solar and energy was ""outsourced"" to overseas companies
","
Faced with criticism that he sent American jobs overseas, Mitt Romney tried to turn the tables on President Barack Obama by calling him the ""outsourcer-in-chief"" and highlighting foreign spending from the economic stimulus.

At a town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colo., Romney said, ""this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States.""

The Romney campaign backed up the claim by citing a report from the Investigative Reporting Workshop that found about 65 percent of the wind turbines on stimulus-funded projects came from foreign manufacturers.

PolitiFact has examined a number of claims about stimulus dollars going overseas, especially in the area of alternative energy. We have found an element of truth to these statements but that generally the numbers are exaggerated. Critics of the stimulus have tallied government loans, grants and tax credits going to a foreign firm but they often ignore that most of the money goes to domestic subsidiaries, and most of the work takes place on U.S. soil. In this case, though, Romney is less specific -- and more accurate.

Indeed, many foreign companies benefited from American tax credits and Energy Department grants, and those programs created some jobs in foreign countries. A study by the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent of wind power spending goes overseas. Another federal study put the number at about 40 percent. That's because many components for wind turbines are not manufactured in the United States.

In fact, it is extremely difficult to know exactly where everything is made. Some foreign companies have American subsidiaries. Some American firms import many parts. The Romney campaign cited the 65 percent figure from investigative reporter Russ Choma, but right after Choma gave that number he wrote, ""I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas, and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here.""

For solar power, the dependence on foreign components could well be greater than for wind. The Earth Policy Institute reports that the U.S. produces only about 4 percent of the total world output of photovoltaic cells. According to a government study, many American manufacturers import most of their components for final assembly in the U.S.

Overall, when the federal government supports the use of wind and solar power, it is virtually certain that some if not most of the materials will come from overseas. That is more true for solar than it is for wind.

However, it is one thing for federal stimulus dollars to be spent overseas; it is another to label this as outsourcing. In many cases, the reason the products come from foreign makers is that no one makes them here.

Choma wrote on his blog that his work has been taken out of context. 
""I found nobody wanted to talk about how battered our industry was from past mistakes,"" Choma wrote. ""Maybe before we promise hundreds of thousands of jobs, we should deal with the fact there isn’t an industry to create those jobs in.""

Given the nuances of the industry -- and its recent growth in the U.S. -- it's important to examine the claims about outsourcing. The Republican National Committee put up a website on this theme called ""Obamanomics Outsourced"". As one example, the site claims that subsidiaries of the Danish wind turbine maker Vestas received tax credits worth nearly $52 million.

What it didn’t say was that the subsidiaries, Vestas Nacelles, Vestas Blades, and Vestas Towers, are all based in Colorado. The tax credits, under a program called 48C, were created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aka the stimulus.The Vesta American operation got the tax credits in exchange for building manufacturing plants that would hire American workers. While Vesta recently announced layoffs, work continues at the plants.

""I would call this the opposite of outsourcing,"" said Peter Kelley, spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group.  

""This is insourcing.  It’s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S.""

The RNC website says the wind power industry overall lost 10,000 jobs after 2009, but Kelley notes most of those were in construction, which had peaked that year. He says those newly constructed wind facilities have led to a workforce of 75,000 wind-related jobs. Some are tied directly to running the wind farms, but about 30,000 are in manufacturing.  

""These are better than construction jobs,"" said Kelley, ""because they pay good wages and they last longer.""

We found further evidence that the wind power industry is expanding. A 2011 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission notes that three foreign companies opened their first U.S. manufacturing plants in 2010. Internal Revenue Service data shows that all three of the firms received those energy tax credits under the federal stimulus. The trade commission analyst says the expansion of American production contributed to a decrease in imports of wind energy components and an increase in American exports.

And the share of American-made parts is growing. The wind association estimates the value of the American-made content went from 25 percent in 2004 to over 60 percent in 2011.

Still, foreign suppliers have remained the largest beneficiaries of the spending on wind power. Imports may have declined but at about $1.2 billion in 2010, they were still about ten times larger than exports.

Domestic production of solar energy components have struggled more.  According to the Congressional Research Service, these manufacturing plants ""appear to have relatively short life spans.""  Eight plants closed in 2011 alone.

It has been a goal of the Obama administration to expand domestic renewable energy manufacturing. Both the wind and solar industries depend enormously on federal policy.  Wind, and to a lesser degree, solar, grew during the last decade thanks to the high price of oil and high demand, but especially thanks to the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit and other incentive. That credit expires this year and the industry predicts major job losses if that happens.

Government policy dating back to 2005 spurred the growth of the alternative energy sector but the state of the industry in the United States remains precarious.

Our Ruling

Romney said, ""This president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States.""

There is some truth to Romney's statement because stimulus dollars did go to foreign companies, largely because there was a shortage of American firms producing key components for generating wind and solar power. But given that situation, it is inaccurate to call it ""outsourcing"" because there is not a source domestically.

Also, it's important to note that domestic manufacturing tied to wind power benefited considerably from the stimulus. Thanks to the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit, the domestic sector was growing before Obama took office and accelerated during his first three years. However, federal policy has been less effective in the area of solar power.

We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D03B80>],/factchecks/2012/jul/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-stimulus-money-solar-and-energy-was-ou/

Romney ad says stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters
","
In the presidential battle over who sent more jobs overseas, Mitt Romney and his supporters are fond of citing the example of Fisker Automotive, the maker of a high-end plug-in electric sedan.

In an ad called ""Where did all the money go,"" the Romney campaign suggests President Obama has a lot of explaining to do.

""Where did all the Obama stimulus money go?
Friends, donors, campaign supporters, special interest groups.
Where did the Obama stimulus money go?
Solyndra. $500 million taxpayer dollars. Bankrupt.
So where did the Obama stimulus money go?
Windmills from China. Electric cars from Finland.""

The day after that ad launched, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus expanded on the attack in Philadelphia.

""President Obama took half a billion dollars of your taxpayer money and gave it to Fisker Automotive because they promised to create jobs at their Wilmington plant.... "" Priebus said. ""But they didn't create jobs for you. Their factory in Delaware... was supposed to be open today, but instead it's closed. And Fisker is still building their cars in Finland.""

There’s a few things to check here. 
PolitiFact tackled many of these questions in some detail last April. Back then, an ad from the conservative group, Americans for Prosperity asserted ""The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas ... Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.""

What Fisker got

In 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive, won a total of $528 million in loan guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic (originally named Nina). The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on the Atlantic is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open.

The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far.

Not stimulus dollars

The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects.

First, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating.

That money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it’s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.

The only reference to this loan program in the stimulus is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses.

The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.

Not half a billion dollars

Even as a loan, Fisker Automotive has not received anywhere close to half a billion dollars.

So far, Fisker has drawn down about $193 million, and the Energy Department won’t release any more until the company completes more work. The government loan package came in two parts. An initial $170 million was for design and engineering to complete the Karma using at least 65 percent American-made parts. A second $360 million loan would be to open an American plant to build the Atlantic. Just about all of that second part is still in government hands.

For those who would say that money is fungible and there’s no guarantee that some of the federal dollars were not used to pay Finnish workers, the company has an answer.

It says it raised much more money from private investors; Ornisher told us the total is now over $1 billion. While Ornisher won’t say how much Fisker spent in Finland, he says it was ""easily within"" the amount of that private money.

Fisker Automotive also says that the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the U.S.

The jobs

Ornisher says the Karma and Atlantic projects support some 500 Fisker employees in the United States. He says it’s much harder to estimate the number of jobs associated with the supply of parts -- 65 percent of which are supposed to come from American companies. Ornishers also says the company has sold about 1,000 cars in the U.S. and that provides work at some 45 retailers across the country.

Political connections

The ad hints darkly that a lot of this is tied to political friends of the president. During a campaign briefing, senior campaign adviser Ed Gillespie singled out the Fisker Automotive deal and one of its investors, John Doerr.

""You know you have John Doerr, who raised a lot of money for President Obama (and) got appointed to an economic recovery advisory board.

""And then, his firm had a big investment in Fisker Automotive, which got over half a billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy, which did not result in jobs being created in America, but actually jobs being created overseas in Finland. But Kleiner Perkins (Doerr’s firm) did quite well.""

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Doerr is a big Democratic donor -- over $175,000 since 2008. And Ornisher described Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as ""one of the major investors"" in Fisker.

But as the Washington Post noted, Kleiner has many partners, and some of them are hefty donors on the Republican side. One, Ray Lane, backed John McCain in 2008.

Our ruling

The Romney campaign ad said that stimulus dollars paid for jobs in Finland. There is nothing accurate in this claim. The federal loan guarantees the company received were not part of the stimulus, and there is no evidence that any government dollars paid for work done by Finnish workers.

Ornisher, the company spokesman, told us the contract to produce the cars in Finland had been signed before the federal loan was approved. Also, measures were put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars only went for work done in America.

Fisker Automotive has yet to open the factory in Delaware but it also hasn’t received the large government loan needed to do that.

The ad’s suggestion that the Fisker loan was a reward to a political supporter also falls flat. The program was approved initially by the Bush administration.

"['Housing', 'Florida', 'Committee to Protect Florida']","
Group says Jeff Brandes supports moving Citizens policyholders to unregulated companies
","
A mailer circulating in Tampa Bay targets St. Petersburg Rep. Jeff Brandes over a vote he took on Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-run company that covers more Floridians than any property insurer.

Brandes is running in the Republican primary for Senate District 22 against Rep. Jim Frishe, a 12-year House member who is backed by the electioneering group that sponsored the mailer, the Committee to Protect Florida. The GOP in District 22 is one of the most closely watched in the state.

The piece features an exasperated, white-haired man at his kitchen table, his palm to his forehead, distraught over a letter he received from Citizens. Text wrapped around the image reads:

Jeff Brandes would let Citizens dump some policies...and sell out homeowners who trusted him.
Hurricanes. Sinkholes. Higher costs, weaker coverage and rejected claims.

Every Bay-area homeowner is facing big, expensive risks in today’s volatile insurance market.
Jeff Brandes wants to add another risk we can’t afford.

He voted to allow Citizens -- the state’s largest property insurer -- to dump policies onto out-of-state, unregulated private companies. Policy holders would be stuck with no control... and all the cost!

For us?

Brandes votes in Tallahassee for them. He fights for big insurance and sides with special Interests.

The fact is, with a voting record like his, Jeff Brandes is the biggest risk of all.

At hand is one of the diciest issues of the 2012 legislative session. The measure (HB 245) would have allowed ""surplus lines"" companies to take over Citizens policies in an effort to shrink the company. These companies, which Democrats likened to vultures, are not overseen by the state Office of Insurance Regulation and usually have higher premiums.

Many Republicans, including Gov. Rick Scott, say Citizens would be overexposed should a calamitous storm hit the state. (Read this PolitiFact Florida story for more information about the company’s financial health.)

Basically, many Republicans believe that Citizens does not have the ability to pay out claims in the event of the storm, which would leave the state in a disastrous position. So it’s better to move policyholders to other more stable companies, they say, even if it means higher premiums. They also note that Citizens was created as an insurer of last resort but has grown to be the state’s largest property insurer.

Supporters of the bill pointed to a few consumer-minded safeguards, such as requiring companies to have at least $50 million in surplus and the financial strength to withstand two hurricanes. Opponents said homeowners would be out of luck should such a company became insolvent, though, because it would not be covered by the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association.

The version that passed a full vote of the House on Feb. 3, 2012, would have automatically moved policyholders to a surplus lines company if they did not opt out within 30 days notice. (Dissatisfied customers could return to Citizens later.)

The House approved the measure 66-48. Frishe voted No; Brandes voted Yes.

That’s key to this fact-check, but there’s a little more to the story.

When the Florida Senate considered the proposal, it altered the bill be more consumer-friendly. The Senate made the measure ""opt-in,"" meaning a consumer had to proactively approve the switch with a signature.

Supporters of the original proposal argued that the change would gut the intent of the bill: to reduce the number of policies held by Citizens. And when the amended bill bounced back to the House, Republican House members proposed to reject the opt-in provision and kick the bill back to the Senate. 
But that idea failed in the the closest House vote of the session. 
Both Brandes and Frishe voted against blocking the Senate’s opt-in amendment.

With the opt-in provision now part of the bill, the House sponsor said the proposal ""might as well be dead"" and decided not to bring it for a full vote.

Brandes, reached by phone, said he voted for the original version because ""we have to take serious measures in order to reduce the exposure literally to the citizens of the state.""

However, he said he was ""happier"" with an opt-in requirement -- which explains his vote when the bill resurfaced.

That point doesn’t matter to Roger ""Rockie"" Pennington, chairman of the Committee to Protect Florida, the group behind the mailer.

""When he had a chance to stand up for consumers, he stood with citizens and out-of-state, unregulated insurers,"" Pennington said.

Our ruling 
As the ad claims, Brandes voted for a measure that would have allowed out-of-state companies to pluck Citizens policyholders in an effort to lessen Citizens’ liability in the event of a big storm.

A month later, after the Senate included a provision that would require policyholders to opt-in to the program, House members made a motion to reject that change, and Brandes voted not to reject the opt-in provision.

With the opt-in provision part of the bill, the House decided to scuttle the proposal for 2012.

"['Congress', 'Redistricting', 'Texas', 'Daniel Rodriguez']","
Seguin resident says Austin the only city of its size or smaller broken into four or five U.S. House districts
","
Daniel Rodriguez of Seguin emailed us asking us to check, uh, his self.

We typically scrutinize statements by officeholders, candidates and individuals and groups in the public square, so to speak. But we were intrigued by Rodriguez's claim: ""No city of comparable size (or smaller) has as many congressional representatives as does Austin, due to the Republican-made 2012 districts for the city."" His email says Austin was left with four or five U.S. House members, each one representing only part of Austin.

Was no city comparable to Austin or smaller cut up so much?

In a telephone interview, Rodriguez said he meant to refer to how congressional districts were drawn in an interim plan imposed for the 2012 elections by a San Antonio panel of federal judges. Their Austin-area districts align with how those districts were drawn by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature.

Rodriguez told us he initially drew on results from the 2010 U.S. census -- which played into how legislatures across the country redrew districts -- to identify cities with about the same number of residents as Austin including, he said, Las Vegas, Detroit, Baltimore and San Francisco.

Most of the other cities have two House districts, he said, though Las Vegas appears to have three.

We took a similar tack, starting from a 2010 census breakdown of the nation’s most populous cities that listed Austin as the 14th-largest city.

Next, we were surprised to see that on the interim map, Austin takes in portions of six districts -- the 10th, 17th, 21st, 25th, 31st and 35th, according to figures posted online Feb. 27, 2012, by the Texas Legislative Council, which provides legal advice and technical assistance to legislators. That total was jarring because news accounts including a February 28, 2012 Austin American-Statesman news article pegged the number of districts in Travis County, which includes most of Austin, at five, compared to three districts much of the past decade.

Explanation: The 31st District, which takes in two counties to the north, sweeps in 4.5 percent of Austin’s population. Those 36,000 residents live in Williamson County.

Four of the other Austin-tied districts rope in 19 to 24 percent of the city’s population as of 2010 -- 153,000 to 188,000 Austin residents each, according to the council’s breakdown. The 17th District, which extends north to Waco and northeast to Freestone County, takes in 7 percent of Austin’s residents, 56,000 people.

Each Texas congressional district contains about 698,488 residents, according to the council, which means Austin residents comprise as little as 8 percent up to 27 percent of the populace in the Austin-tied districts.

Among the other like-sized Texas cities, El Paso takes in the 16th and part of the 23rd congressional districts, according to the council information, while Fort Worth takes in all or part of five districts -- the 6th, 12th, 24th, 26th and 33rd, up from four districts before redistricting. (The 25th District takes in part of surrounding Tarrant County, though none of Fort Worth.)

So, Rodriguez slightly understates how many districts take in at least a smidge of Austin. Also, Fort Worth lays claim to nearly the same number, or portions, of districts.

Sidelight: Parts of the largest Texas cities, Houston and Dallas, are absorbed into nine and seven House districts, respectively. And San Antonio, also larger, has portions of five districts. But Rodriguez limited his claim to cities Austin’s size or smaller.

To gauge the impact of congressional redistricting on out-of-state cities comparable to Austin, we considered the four cities the census shows as bigger than Austin plus the next seven smaller cities, which enabled us to include Rodriguez’s choice of Baltimore but not Las Vegas, which was the nation’s 30th largest city.

The cities more populous than Austin, which had 790,390 residents, were San Jose, Calif., with 945,942 residents, Jacksonville, Fla., Indianapolis and San Francisco, with 805,235 residents. The less populous cities were Columbus, Ohio, with 787,033 residents, Charlotte, Detroit, Memphis and Baltimore, with 620,961 residents, plus Fort Worth and El Paso.

Next, we looked into each state’s congressional districts starting from a redistricting website overseen by Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Among the non-Texas cities, San Jose, Charlotte, Baltimore  and Columbus appear to be represented by all or part of three districts.

Memphis has parts of two districts, Doug Himes, a legislative attorney with the state of Tennessee, told us by email. Indianapolis, in Marion County, is represented by the state’s 7th District and a portion of the 5th District, according to a map of all the state’s House districts posted online by the Hoosier State. Similarly, Detroit residents are split between two districts, Michigan state demographer Kenneth Darga told us by email. And Florida’s Duval County, home to Jacksonville, and San Francisco each has two congressional districts, though information from the California Citizens Redistricting Commission indicates a third district stretches into San Francisco without taking in a sizable share of residents.

So, every like-sized city except Fort Worth appears to have two or three House districts.

In an email, Levitt agreed that Austin is cut up under the interim map. Still, he speculated, that might not be bad politically if Austin voters end up controlling who gets elected within most of the districts.

The impact of voters everywhere remains to be seen given that the first general elections using the redrawn districts will occur in November 2012. That said, all but one of the Austin-tied districts were initially designed to elect a Republican, though much of the city that has long leaned Democratic.

Barring unforeseen turns, voters in the 10th District, which stretches east, seem likely to re-elect Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin, though the district is home to more Harris County than Travis County residents. 
Voters in the 35th District extending south into Bexar County will likely favor Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin. But he made it to the general election only after defeating two San Antonio primary foes in May 2012 despite the district sweeping in 329,000 Bexar County residents compared to nearly 216,000 Travis County residents, according to population analyses of the Texas districts posted by the legislative council. Nearly 317,000 San Antonio residents live in the district, outnumbering its 187,000 Austinites, according to the council.

The 25th District, which extends north from Austin, is Republican-leaning; former Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams and Wes Riddle are vying for the Republican nomination in a July 31, 2012, primary runoff. About 22 percent of the 13-county district’s residents live in Austin, according to the council.

In the same vein, the Republican-leaning 21st District seems likely to re-elect GOP Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio; Bexar County accounts for about 36 percent of the district’s population. And the 17th district, dominated by McLennan and Brazos counties, and the 31st District, which takes in all of Williamson County, seem stable for GOP Reps. Bill Flores of Bryan and John Carter of Round Rock.

Next, we took a close look at Fort Worth. Do its residents have less sway than Austin counterparts?

The GOP-leaning 12th District, represented by Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth, appears solidly in the control of city voters, who account for about half the district’s residents. Also, the incumbent-free 33rd District could end up with a Fort Worth House member, depending on results of the July 2012 Democratic runoff between candidates from Dallas and Fort Worth and the November election. About 30 percent of the district’s residents live in Fort Worth.

The other three districts with Fort Worth elements, each represented by a non-Fort Worth Republican seeking re-election, take in 9 percent of the city’s residents or less.

In a telephone interview, we asked Matt Angle, director of the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project, a political group, for his opinion on whether residents of Austin or Fort Worth were hit hardest by how the districts were drawn. Angle replied that Austin is worse off because the city has no districts from which, by itself, the majority of its voters are likely to fill a House seat. 
Finally, we asked Levitt, the law professor who tracks redistricting, if it's possible that a smaller city somewhere ended up, like Austin, being inked into six congressional districts -- or more. Possible, but unlikely, Levitt replied by email, adding that he is unaware of any researchers who have broken down how every little city was affected by congressional redistricting.

Our ruling

Among 11 cities of comparable size to Austin or smaller, only Fort Worth -- with five House districts -- comes close to experiencing the slice-up of the Texas capital, whose residents are spread among six districts. 
But Fort Worth voters appear to control one district and might control another. Austin’s Democratic majority will likely preserve Doggett, but he is running in a district where San Antonio residents outnumber those from Austin.

Broadly, both Texas cities were cut up more than like-sized cities nationally. We rate the claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097083440>],/factchecks/2012/jul/20/daniel-rodriguez/seguin-activist-says-austin-only-city-country-b/
"['Ohio', 'Financial Regulation', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Josh Mandel']","
Josh Mandel says Obamacare will ultimately be the 'biggest tax increase in history""
","
The Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act settled the question of its constitutionality, but only seemed to intensify debate over the law.

Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel joined other Republicans in calling for its repeal, saying the decision ""sets the stage for the November election."" He identified the law as a pivotal issue in his campaign to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown.

Mandel issued a statement on the day of the decision asserting that Brown had voted ""for what will likely go down as the biggest tax increase in history.""

That claim about the health care legislation has been a talking point opponents of the law, repeated many times since the ruling. But PolitiFact first examined it after Florida Gov. Rick Scott made the statement more than a year earlier.

The claim is wrong. Here’s why:

The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, gave members a detailed breakdown of the tax impact of the health care law from 2010-2019.

• A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services that started in 2011 is expected to bring in $2.7 billion over 10 years.

• A new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that started in 2011 is expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years.

• Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with annual incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion.

• Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion.

• Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years.

• Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion.

• Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax kicks in on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans"" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families). That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.

There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. And there is a tax cut for some small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees.

Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019.

Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history?

There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that to compare the costs today with other years you have to adjust for inflation to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted.

For our comparison, PolitiFact used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP.

For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: ""The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent.""

As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski:

1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP;
2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP;
3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP;
4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;
5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP;

And here are the top five tax increases from the ""modern"" era of 1968-2006:

1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP;
2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: 0.8 percent of GDP;
3 (tie). Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: 0.5 percent of GDP
3 (tie). Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; 0.5 percent of GDP;
5. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; 0.49 percent of GDP.

The list does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury said it hasn't been updated. So PolitiFact calculated its own figure for percent of GDP. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion.

That $104 billion includes the penalty or tax that individuals might pay if they do not purchase health insurance -- a figure estimated to be $14 billion for 2019.

We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to 0.49 percent of total GDP.

That would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.

The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961.

We asked Mandel's campaign how his claim is supported. The most relevant source they cited was an editorial from the Wall Street Journal asserting that Obama ""has imposed the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.""

The Journal cited Congressional Budget Office projections that 76 percent of the people who will have to pay an annual penalty tax (because they do not have health insurance and are not exempt for, say, cases of hardship or religious belief) will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. For a family of four, that comes to about $120,000.

But who pays the tax is a different question than whether it is the largest tax increase in history.

Mandel's camp also cited sources saying that the Affordable Care Act contains ""the largest tax increase since 1993,"" which we noted earlier and which was not his statement.

And they cited a chart from FactCheck.org showing the Affordable Care Act producing the largest tax increase since 1968 in raw dollars. In the article the chart accompanied, however, FactCheck.org called raw dollars a ""rather useless yardstick"" and ""a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase,"" because it makes no adjustment for inflation and takes no account of a population that is steadily rising.

The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States.

It would have to grow more than 10 fold to match the wartime tax increase from 1942. It would have to nearly double just to match the 1982 increase under Reagan. And that still wouldn’t crack the top 5 since 1940.

They are so far from the largest that it is not now possible, much less ""likely,"" that they will ""go down as the biggest tax increase in history.""

"['Georgia', 'Transportation', 'John Watson']","
Will T-SPLOST add up to $112 a year for consumers?
","
The poor penny. Some politicians want to get rid of it. It often gets lost in the living room sofa or underneath the car seat.

Pennies, though, can add up.

Supporters of the July 31 transportation referendum say a penny-per-dollar sales tax would pay for scores of mass transit and road projects that would ease congestion in the Atlanta region.

One referendum proponent recently said the extra penny added on to items that may cost a buck is well worth it in exchange for the transportation improvements it would fund. In fact, he said the annual cost would be less than how much it costs the average Atlanta-area resident to be stuck in traffic a year -- $924. PolitiFact Georgia previously rated the $924 claim Mostly True.

PolitiFact Georgia saw the following statement and wondered how close to the truth was this claim.

""An additional penny will cost the average consumer an estimated $112 annually. In exchange, they’ll get traffic relief, more income-producing time at work and more leisure time at home,"" John Watson wrote in The Marietta Daily Journal.

Watson is a senior adviser to Citizens for Transportation Mobility, an organization leading the push to get the hotly debated referendum passed. He served as a chief of staff to Sonny Perdue when he was governor..

The Atlanta Regional Commission, which has provided technical and research assistance to local and state officials involved in the referendum, compiled a report on the sales tax impact of the referendum. One chart contained an estimated final resident cost for each year of the referendum. The average per resident, ARC calculated, was $112 a year.

Referendum supporters estimate the tax would, when taking inflation into account, raise as much as $8.5 billion over the 10 years it would be in effect. That estimate came from state tax revenue forecasts. The 10 metro Atlanta counties that would collect the tax are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. 

ARC’s first step in coming up with the estimate was to determine what percentage of the funds would come from metro Atlanta residents as opposed to tourists and businesses. Its estimate is 65 percent of the revenue would come from residents.

ARC officials then estimated the population in the 10-county area that will vote on the referendum and projected the region’s growth over the 10-year period. ARC believes the region’s population will be about 4.3 million residents in 2013. In 2022, the ARC projection is 4.86 million.

ARC estimates an average population growth of nearly 56,000 people a year. Population in the 10-county region rose by an average of 69,000 a year between 2000 and 2010, U.S. Census figures show.

""It’s a pretty conservative population forecast,"" ARC planner Jim Skinner said.

Divide the estimated sales tax revenue by the number of residents and the math equals ARC’s estimate of $112 a year per person, as Watson said in the op-ed.

PolitiFact Georgia, however, had a question about the numbers. The population estimate is for all residents, including those under age 18. The percentage of residents under age 18 in the region ranges from a low of nearly 24 percent in Fulton County to a high of 29 percent in Clayton County.

We know many children like to play with pennies, but they spend less than their parents. Should they be included in the estimate?

Skinner said ARC was not asked to do a breakdown by age. He also said some agencies conduct research on taxes and use the entire state population.

Bert Brantley, who is assisting Citizens for Transportation Mobility with media relations and public outreach in support of the referendum, said the larger point is still the amount of money people could pay in sales taxes for transportation is much less than the estimated annual cost to be stuck in traffic.

""Now obviously, not every resident in the region is a commuter, but we all already pay a congestion tax in wasted time and fuel, so this is not a tax vs. no tax argument,"" said Brantley, a former communications director for Perdue.

PolitiFact Georgia calculated how much each resident would pay a year in additional sales tax, excluding people under age 18. Our estimate: $132.37 a year.

The total comes close to ARC’s estimate. With this bit of context that ARC’s estimate includes all residents in the 10-county area, we rate Watson’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EDF740>],/factchecks/2012/jul/20/john-watson/will-t-splost-add-112-year-consumers/

Did Barack Obama hold 100-plus fundraisers while his jobs council never met?
","
In a video and an infographic, the Republican National Committee amplified a charge first raised by Mitt Romney on the stump the day before -- that President Barack Obama has held more than 100 fundraisers in the past six months, yet his jobs council didn’t meet once.

""In the last six months, he has held 100 fundraisers, and guess how many meetings he has had with his jobs council?"" Romney said in a July 18, 2012, campaign event in Bowling Green, Ohio. ""None. Zero. Zero in the last six months. So it makes it very clear where his priorities are.""

The following day, the RNC released a graphic that provided some additional specifics. Over the last six months, the graphic said, Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, but his jobs council has never met. The RNC supplemented this with a video that added a goofy soundtrack as well as audio and video of an exchange on this topic between reporters and White House press secretary Jay Carney.

Several readers asked us to check this statistic. We won’t pass judgment on how Obama should spend his time, but we will check the accuracy of the numbers.

The jobs council

Let’s start by explaining what the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness actually is. Its website explains that the panel was established ""to provide nonpartisan advice to the President"" on strengthening the economy and creating jobs.

The council is chaired by the chairman and CEO of General Electric, Jeffrey Immelt, and is populated by a variety of other business figures, such as former AOL chairman Steve Case, venture capitalist John Doerr, former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman Richard D. Parsons, as well as economist Laura D’Andrea Tyson and AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.

Checking the lack of recent meetings was straightforward. The council’s own web page cites four meetings of the council so far -- Feb. 24, 2011, at the White House, June 13, 2011, in Durham, N.C., October 11, 2011, in Pittsburgh, and Jan. 17, 2012, at the White House.

The Web page does add that the council has also conducted ""18 listening and action sessions in communities around the country with businesses and local leaders"" and that it plans to hold more in the coming months. However, the Web page doesn’t appear to consider these to be ""meetings,"" and since the most recent was just slightly over six months ago, the RNC’s claim is correct.

Asked about the lack of meetings in a July 18, 2012, press briefing, Carney said ""the president solicits and receives input and advice from members of his jobs council and others about economic initiatives all the time. … There’s no specific reason (why they haven’t met) except the president has obviously got a lot on his plate.""

Golf and fundraising

For statistics on Obama’s golf and fundraising activities, we turned to the RNC, which provided us with an Excel spreadsheet they had compiled internally. We then double-checked the RNC’s work.

There is no official tally of the president’s daily activities. There is one tally that’s unofficial but widely respected -- one compiled by longtime CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller.

Knoller tweeted on June 12, 2012, that ""today's six events will bring to 160 the number of fundraisers Pres Obama has done since filing for re-election with the FEC last year."" He also wrote in a story on June 17, 2012, that Obama had just played his 100th round of golf since taking office.

However, because Knoller did not return an inquiry for this story, we could not match these numbers to the RNC’s claim.

The RNC offered links to news accounts to back up Obama’s 10 golf outings in the past six months, and they confirmed golf outings on the dates cited by the RNC count.

As for fundraising events, the RNC only provided dates and locations. However, we were able to check this list using two sources.

The White House’s archive of presidential speeches and remarks offers chronological links to transcripts of the president’s comments at every public appearance he makes. Many, though not all, fundraising events are included in this archive.

Meanwhile, to track events that were closed to the press -- and thus wouldn’t be included in the archive of speeches and remarks -- we relied on our personal archive of White House pool reports, which are the dispatches written by journalists covering the White House several times a day and distributed to all members of the White House press corps. These pool reports will typically mention that the president is attending a fundraiser even if the event is closed to the press.

Using these two sources, we were able to confirm virtually all of the fundraisers cited by the RNC. In only three cases were we unable to verify fundraisers cited by the RNC using these sources. This doesn’t mean that these three events didn’t happen; we just couldn’t find pool reports that specifically backed them up. However, even if the actual number of fundraisers in the last six months turned out to be 103 rather than 106, we won’t quibble -- the number would be close enough for us to consider it accurate.

Our ruling

The RNC said that over the last six months, Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers even as his jobs council didn’t meet once. The RNC’s tally is on target. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B03480>],/factchecks/2012/jul/19/republican-national-committee-republican/did-barack-obama-hold-100-plus-fundraisers-while-h/
"['Debt', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Paul Sadler']","
Paul Sadler says national debt doubled under George W. Bush
","
Former Texas state Rep. Paul Sadler answered a debate question June 26, 2012, with a call to stop expanding government programs until the federal debt is under control.

Squaring off in Dallas with retired teacher Grady Yarbrough, his opponent in the July 31, 2012, runoff for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, Sadler said, ""Until we get our financial house in order, we cannot continue to spend money. We just can’t.""

The U.S. has ""never seen national debt like this,"" Sadler said. ""It doubled during the Bush administration.""

We decided to see if Sadler’s claim about debt under President George W. Bush holds up.

Sadler sent us an email with several presidents’ names linked to numbers, such as ""Bill Clinton 1.4,"" and told us the numbers’ sources were the U.S. Treasury, Financial Management Service, Bureau of the Public Debt, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Office of Management and Budget.

The same figures and sources, listed in the same order, appear on a July 28, 2011, New York Times chart illustrating how much of the federal debt accumulated under each president since 1981.

According to the chart, the Bush administration began with a $5.8 trillion gross federal debt, which grew by $6.1 trillion to reach $11.9 trillion --  an increase of 105 percent, or slightly more than double. The Times ascribed the increase in debt to ""tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, (the) economic downturn in 2001 and recession starting in 2007.""

Following a suggestion from Treasury spokesman Matthew Anderson, we found that plugging the fiscal years of Bush’s presidency -- October 2001 through September 2009 -- into the Treasury’s online calculator gives debt figures that tally with the Times graphic. While that period begins nearly nine months into Bush’s presidency, it also aligns with the years over which he held budgetary sway.

Gross federal debt, though, is only one measure of how much the government owes. Because Sadler’s numbers match the Times chart, we started with that statistic, which includes money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare, in addition to public debt.

Public debt itself is another commonly used measure. Debt held by the public is money borrowed from investors outside the federal government, in the form of Treasury notes and other securities.

Which to use? We consulted Oregon State University political scientist Robert Sahr, who studies U.S. debt, policy, presidents and inflation.

Sahr suggested we use public debt, and emailed us part of a textbook’s explanation of why net public debt, rather than gross debt, is seen as a better measure of how much government is borrowing:
  
We returned to the Treasury calculator and found that during Bush’s fiscal years, public debt rose from $3.3 trillion to $7.6 trillion -- up 130 percent, clearly more than double.  

Also, we asked Sahr whether he agreed that debt doubled under Bush.

Adjusted for inflation, he said, public debt did not double, though it came close.

Sahr produced a spreadsheet for us with fiscal year-end debt numbers from the federal Office of Management and Budget. Among the results: As with the Treasury calculator, 2001-2009 public debt in non-inflation-adjusted dollars went up 130 percent. Adjusted for inflation (to 2011 dollars), though, the increase was 88 percent.

Returning to gross federal debt, which was Sadler’s basis: Sahr’s spreadsheet showed the same 105-percent increase in non-inflation-adjusted dollars as the New York Times chart. In 2011 dollars, though, the increase was 70 percent.  

Some news analyses have compared changes in debt using inauguration dates. We checked those with the Treasury calculator, finding that from Bush’s first inauguration, January 20, 2001, to the day President Barack Obama took office, January 20, 2009, gross federal debt in non-inflation-adjusted dollars rose from $5.7 trillion to $10.6 trillion, up 86 percent. The calculator didn’t have an amount for public debt January 20, 2001, but says the non-adjusted figure was $6.3 trillion January 20, 2009.

When we checked back in with Sadler, he objected to adjusting the debt changes for inflation, saying by email: ""I seriously doubt any holder of the debt or your bank would allow you to adjust your debt for inflation.  The amount owed is the amount owed - you don't get to adjust it for inflation.""

Sahr said later: ""Sure, you’re paying in current dollars. But if you’re looking at the change in debt over eight years, part of the change is the change in the value of the dollar over those years.""

A final note: Such accounting and tallies can be read as blaming Bush alone for the increases. As PolitiFact has noted numerous times, such assumptions are overly sweeping. Many factors are at play, including Congress, which votes on many spending decisions affecting the debt.

Our ruling

We see how Sadler reached his conclusion. In raw terms, both the public debt and gross federal debt more than doubled during the fiscal years corresponding to Bush’s presidency. However, adjusting for inflation, gross debt increased 70 percent over those years, while public debt increased 88 percent. That’s not quite doubling.

We rate Sadler’s claim Mostly True.

Has unemployment among Oregon high school graduates 18-20 grown 200 percent?
","
PolitiFact Oregon was easing into a new week, excited about the warm weather, when this tweet came over to shatter our calm: #Unemployment for #Oregon HS grads 18-20 jumps 300% compared to 30% nationally.

It was a tweet from the Cascade Policy Institute, a think tank in Portland that advocates limited government. A research associate there had written a post called ""Oregon’s Minimum Wage Prices Teens Out."" Here’s a fuller explanation from the website:

""Oregon’s unemployment among high school graduates aged 18 to 20 tops the national charts, with a rise of more than 300% from 2008 to 2011. This gigantic leap dwarfs the U.S. unemployment rate for the same demographic, which only shows an increase of around 30%."" (Cascade later revised the claim to reflect a 200 percent increase.)

How could we find out if this was all true? Does Oregon top the national charts? Was the increase in Oregon really that much worse than the national increase? And what about the underlying point: That Oregon’s minimum wage was to blame? The original post contained no links and -- more significantly -- no unemployment numbers, so we had little to go on. We put in a call to Cascade.

A little background here for those unfamiliar with opposition to Oregon’s minimum wage. Oregon has the second highest-minimum wage among states, $8.80 this year, second only to Washington, at $9.04. What really annoys critics is that the wage automatically goes up every Jan. 1, as it is indexed to inflation. Voters approved the automatic indexing in 2002. Restaurants and small businesses hate it and argue that a high minimum wage hurts teen employment.

So it makes sense that Cascade, which sides with free market principles, is among those critics. We spoke with Steve Buckstein, the group’s senior policy analyst. In doing so, Buckstein corrected the original write-up to reflect a 219 percent increase, and not a 300 percent increase, in Oregon’s 18-20 unemployment rate. He said the general argument still stands.

""We have a very high minimum wage, and it makes it harder for teens and unskilled workers to get jobs,"" Buckstein said.

Basic starting point: What are his numbers and where did he get them? Cascade turned to the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed Washington, D.C., group that also dislikes the minimum wage. The institute even runs a website called MinimumWage.com.

Michael Saltsman, a research fellow there, used Current Population Survey figures (which are compiled by the U.S. Census and used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to figure out unemployment for high school graduates 18 to 20.

Here are the numbers: In 2008, unemployment in Oregon was 11.1 percent. By 2011, it was 35.4 percent. That is a 219 percent increase. The U.S average was 18.3 percent in 2008 and 24.5 percent in 2011. That is a 34 percent increase.

We were struck by two things in the data: The high 35 percent rate in Oregon in 2011, but also the low 11 percent rate in 2008. We were doing better than the national average five years ago. Obviously if we go from lower-than-average to higher-than-average, we’re going to get a larger-than-usual increase. That made us see the 200 percent increase in a new light.

We then checked with the Oregon Center for Public Policy, another local think tank, but on the other side of the issue. Executive director Chuck Sheketoff suggested we try the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, which, unlike the Employment Policies Institute, supports raising the minimum wage.

Economic analyst David Cooper shared his unemployment rates for the same age group, also using Current Population Survey figures. And you know what we found? The unemployment figures were different -- lower, generally, all around -- but the rates of increase were about the same.

In 2008, unemployment for high school graduates 18-20 years old in Oregon was 8.3 percent, compared with 13.4 percent nationally. In 2011, Oregon unemployment had grown to 25.4 percent, compared with 18.4 percent nationally. Those figures correspond with a 206 percent increase in Oregon, and 37 percent nationally.

Again, Oregon was doing better than the national average, before we did worse in 2011.

(Cooper also argues youth unemployment jumped dramatically ""across the entire country, and particularly in the Pacific Northwest"" between 2008 and 2011. The increase in Washington was 85 percent and in Idaho, 83 percent. Again, Oregon had lower unemployment than both states in 2008 but ended with slightly higher rates in 2011, which made the increase more dramatic.)

We checked with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provides the official unemployment figures, and Oregon’s Employment Department. We’ll spare you more numbers. Both agencies showed the same trend, albeit for slightly different age groups, education levels and years.

Clearly, the numbers went up. Is any of this tied to Oregon’s indexed minimum wage? People disagree on this. Obviously when employers are shedding jobs, they’re not hiring. And when they do start hiring, they often hire more experienced adults. There’s no question the recession has hit teens and other young workers hard.

But Nick Beleiciks, state employment economist, offers a different take on how unemployment intersects with a high minimum wage. Data show that teens in Oregon are more likely to look for work than teens across the country, he said. That’s called a participation rate.

""Oregon has a higher participation rate and that could have to do with the higher minimum wage and because of that higher participation rate, we do have a higher unemployment rate among teenagers,"" he said.

Buckstein argues that the high unemployment rate has to do with younger workers looking for jobs in a limited market, and not getting those jobs because they’re losing out to more experienced workers. Of course, neither explanation addresses why our rates were lower than the U.S. average in 2008, which was after Oregon voters approved indexing the minimum wage to inflation in 2002.

We won’t rule on that argument. We’re sticking to the numbers. In case you’ve forgotten them, here’s a nifty table for easy review: 

The rates of increase cited by Cascade Policy are correct, as measured by its numbers and the numbers of an ideologically different institute. We will give Cascade a pass on the original increase cited because, in this context, the difference between 219 percent and 300 percent doesn’t really matter.

The problem we have is we don’t think it’s fair to use the national average to highlight the apparently horrible nature of Oregon unemployment, without noting the actual unemployment figures. In every data set we checked, Oregon’s youth unemployment in 2008 was lower than the national average. Of course, the rate of increase will be higher when the starting point is lower.

We think the actual unemployment rates are an important missing detail that should be considered when looking at increases. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C70B00>],/factchecks/2012/jul/19/cascade-policy-institute/has-unemployment-among-oregon-high-school-graduate/

“Tax shift”? Lou Greenwald sets Truth-O-Meter ablaze with ridiculous description of tax increase proposal
","
As much as Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald would like to call it something else, a tax increase is still a tax increase.

A Democrat from Camden County, Greenwald has proposed raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million, and then using that new revenue to offset property taxes for people earning up to $250,000.

But that’s not a tax increase, Greenwald claimed in a recent TV interview.

""First of all, it’s not a tax increase. A tax increase is when you increase a tax that brings in more revenue that you spend in government,"" Greenwald said during a July 15 interview on ""Inside Story"" on Philadelphia-based 6abc.

""What we’ve offered is to take 16,000 people and have every penny that comes in from them offset property taxes up to 20 percent for 2.6 million filers, the other 8.8 million. So, it’s not a tax increase. It’s a tax shift.""

Greenwald’s claim doesn’t make any sense, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

For the last few months, Greenwald has been leading the charge to raise taxes on millionaires in order to provide property tax relief for residents with annual incomes up to $250,000.

The tax hike was initially tied to a proposed income tax credit based on the amount of property taxes paid. More recently, the increase has been linked to providing roughly $800 million in additional property tax relief payments through the state’s Homestead Benefit Program.

Legislation sponsored by Greenwald -- Assembly Bill A-3201 -- increases the tax rate on taxable income greater than $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Through a separate piece of legislation sponsored by Greenwald -- Assembly Bill A-3202 -- that additional tax revenue would go toward the higher property tax relief payments.

The Democrat-led Legislature passed both bills last month, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed A-3202 outright and conditionally vetoed A-3201. Instead, the Republican governor called on legislators to amend that legislation to implement an income tax credit for homeowners earning up to $400,000 in taxable income.

In the TV interview, Greenwald offered a definition of a ""tax increase"" to explain how his proposal is not one.

But that definition -- ""A tax increase is when you increase a tax that brings in more revenue that you spend in government"" -- matches exactly what those two bills would do. One bill would ""increase a tax,"" and the second bill would ""spend"" that extra revenue.

Brian McGinnis, communications director for Greenwald, maintained in an e-mail that the assemblyman’s proposal is a ""tax shift"" that would benefit millionaires as well.

""When our plan is taking every additional income tax dollar to reduce a local property tax expenditure for 95% of families, it’s a tax shift that ultimately accrues benefits to every family in our state through a lower property tax burden, stabilized property values and increased economic competitiveness,"" McGinnis told us.

The spokesman added: ""The Majority Leader has frequently talked about the hidden tax on all New Jerseyans being the hit a family’s property values take because property taxes are so high. In providing significant property tax relief to 95% of New Jersey families, our plan would have addressed this problem—helping to stabilize property values and benefiting people throughout the state, including millionaires.

""Furthermore, as the Majority Leader said in the interview, lower property taxes for the middle-class makes our state a more attractive place to live, meaning millionaires (whom the Governor calls job creators) can attract more talented employees."" 
We gave Greenwald a False for a related claim from the same interview in this fact-check.

Our ruling

During a TV interview, Greenwald offered this description of his proposal to raise the state income tax rate on millionaires and use the extra money to offset property taxes for people earning up to $250,000:

""It’s not a tax increase. It’s a tax shift.""

But despite how the money would be spent, raising any tax rates is clearly a tax increase. Calling such a measure a ""tax shift"" doesn’t make any sense, and Greenwald should know better. So, here’s three more words to add to his vocabulary:

Ohio GOP claims Sherrod Brown, special interest allies will spend more than $13 million against Josh Mandel
","
The funding sources of television ads in the U.S. Senate race between Josh Mandel and Sherrod Brown have grabbed the attention of both campaigns, which each side blasting the other for allowing special interest groups to pump millions of dollars into the race.

The dispute revolves around the concept of ""outside spending"" – money poured into elections by groups that are not directly tied to a candidate. These groups often are unbound by campaign finance restrictions, and can accept contributions from anonymous donors.

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern recently highlighted outside money spent to attack Brown. At a July 10 news conference, Redfern claimed that $10.5 million in outside money has been spent against Brown, the Democratic incumbent, often with misleading ads.

The Ohio Republican Party fought back of behalf of Mandel, the Ohio treasurer. Spokeswoman Izzy Santa emailed the following:

""Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million, with no end in sight.""

The feisty exchange prompted PolitiFact Ohio to dig deeper, since outside spending has been an issue in this Senate race.

We note here that the context in which the GOP claim was made was a discussion about money from outside special interest groups and Redfern’s criticism that more than $10.5 million had flowed into the state on behalf of Mandel.

Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Brown’s campaign, said the GOP’s comparison included more than $10 million worth of ad buys purchased by Brown’s campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, both of which must publicly report their donors and do not qualify as ""outside spending.""

So before further analyzing the Ohio GOP’s claim, we should provide a more clear definition of outside spending.

Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia Law School professor who specializes in campaign finance, said there are two schools of thought.

""Some people divide the campaign finance world into parts – candidate spending and everything else (‘outside spending’),"" Briffault wrote in an e-mail. ""Other people divide the campaign finance world into three parts – campaign spending, party spending in support of that party’s candidates, and spending by all other groups (‘outside spending’).

""I put myself in the second group,"" Briffault continued. ""Political parties are officially a part of the electoral process. Legislatures are organized by party, candidates are nominated by political parties and they run on party lines… in addition, federal campaign finance law permits party campaign committees to officially coordinate a certain amount of spending with candidates.""

To sum up, Briffault’s definition of outside spending would exclude candidate committees and party campaign committees, which must disclose their donors. Organizations such as super PACs and unions, however, would be considered outside spending. Those groups are not covered by the same regulations and do not face the same requirements for disclosure.

With that established, let’s move back to the Ohio GOP’s claim.

We asked Santa for evidence, and she provided the following list of expenditures or planned expenditures: $5.9 million by Brown’s campaign; $5.1 million by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; $1.1 million by Majority PAC; $775,167 by Service Employees International Union; and $500,000 by the League of Conservation Voters. Santa also mentioned two outside groups that bought radio airtime to thank Brown, but she did not have any exact figures for those buys.

Those figures total $13.4 million, meaning the Ohio GOP has identified enough funding sources to support the amount of spending it claimed. Brown’s campaign confirmed the figures are accurate.

But the GOP’s list also supports the counterclaim from Brown’s camp that most of the spending was done by his campaign and the DSCC, and not by outside groups or special interests. Of the more than $13 million, Brown’s campaign and the DSCC accounted for about $11 million.

Briffault, the Columbia law professor, said he would not consider spending by the DSCC or Brown’s campaign as outside spending.

That would leave about $2.4 million in outside spending on Brown’s behalf, a figure Brown’s campaign does not dispute.

So where does that leave us with the Ohio GOP’s statement?

Santa, the Ohio GOP spokeswoman, said ""Brown and his special interest allies"" were planning to spend more than $13 million to defeat Mandel.

The claim is literally true because it includes both Brown and his allies. But the context in which it was made is important, too. The dispute between the campaigns revolved around outside money, and Santa’s email, in fact, focused on outside money:

""Redfern is the least credible person to be commenting on outside spending when it comes to Ohio’s U.S. Senate race. Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million, with no end in sight. It’s clear that Brown and his supporters are having to spend this type of money because Brown’s out-of-touch record has exposed him to Ohioans as a 38-year politician and Washington insider who puts politics over people.""

Santa said her $13 million figure is accurate because it was meant to include spending from all the players contributing to Brown’s re-election, not just outside money. But the conversation, which began with Redfern’s criticism of $10.5 million in outside spending tied to Mandel, was clearly focused on outside spending and not overall spending.

(To keep Redfern honest, we asked the Ohio Democratic Party for the funding sources Redfern was talking about. The list included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and other groups. Neither Mandel’s campaign nor the National Republican Senatorial Committee – the GOP equivalent of the DSCC – were on the list.)

Those details are important to know to be able to put the Ohio Republican Party’s claim in context.

Rush Limbaugh claims link between Batman’s Bane and Romney’s Bain
","What’s behind the mask of the snarling, hulking, steroid-crazed villain who wants to take down Batman and rule Gotham City?

A plot to swing the presidential election!

This week on his popular radio show, conservative host Rush Limbaugh casually tossed out the theory that it’s no accident that the evil genius in The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, bears the same name as the much-maligned private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney.

Bane is the very, very bad guy out to kill Batman. Bain Capital is Romney’s former company, which has been the target of accusations that it outsourced jobs, closed factories and reaped huge profits for itself.

""Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire-breathing, four-eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane?"" Limbaugh suggested to his listeners.

You can see our serious fact checks about Bain Capital here. For now, we thought we’d take a pop-culture diversion from politics to the comic book underworld to see if Limbaugh has really uncovered an evil plot.

What he said

From the transcript of Limbaugh’s July 17, 2012, show:

""This evil villain in the new Batman movie is named Bane. And there's now a discussion out there as to whether or not this is purposeful and whether or not it will influence voters. It's gonna have a lot of people. This movie, the audience is gonna be huge. A lot of people are gonna see the movie, and it's a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they're gonna hear Bane in the movie and they're gonna associate Bain. The thought is that when they start paying attention to the campaign later in the year, and Obama and the Democrats keep talking about Bain, Romney and Bain, that these people will think back to the Batman movie, ‘Oh, yeah, I know who that is.’ There are some people who think it'll work. Others think you're really underestimating the American people to think that will work.""

He wrapped up:

""You may think it's ridiculous, I'm just telling you this is the kind of stuff the Obama team is lining up. The kind of people who would draw this comparison are the kind of people that they are campaigning to. These are the kind of people that they are attempting to appeal to.""

A short history of Bane

So listen up, brain-dead people. To learn more about this villain, we consulted scholarly sources such as The Essential Batman Encyclopedia, and io9, a site that covers science, science fiction and the future.

Bane, the encyclopedia tells us, was born in the fictional South American country of Santa Prisca and grew up in prison, forced to serve a sentence for the crimes of his father. He grows into a violent genius, who commits murder at age 8 and acquires superhuman strength after surviving experiments with a drug called Venom, which left him impossibly virile but forever reliant on the drug. The tentacled mask he wears connects to pumps that deliver regular doses. He eventually breaks out of prison, bound for Gotham City, where he plans to overpower Batman and assume power.

A compelling personal history, to be sure. But the bottom line is this: Bane entered the Batman storyline in 1993. That’s more than a decade before Romney first ran for president in 2007.

Think Bane creator Chuck Dixon had that much foresight? He doesn’t.

""Ridiculous,"" is what Dixon called suggestions of a connection between his character and Romney’s company.

Dixon responded on his message board to the notion, first raised by a Democrat, that the two story lines are linked.

""I saw it on FB like two hours ago,"" Dixon wrote. ""Ridiculous. Tho' I got a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach that Rush may pick up on this. And (that) would be the second time he pegged me and (co-creator) Graham (Nolan) as liberals on his show.""

Limbaugh hadn’t yet weighed in, but Dixon showed his crafty knack for foreshadowing. He’s no liberal -- he identifies as a conservative.

Not that he minds the publicity.

""Overgrasping Dems? Hey, if it gets Obama supporters into theaters. Maybe they'll buy thousands of Bane toys to throw at Romney. It all adds to MY Bane capital. I wonder if the Romney campaign will contact me?"" Dixon wrote.

We’ve also read several commentaries that find a more obvious parallel between the wealthy Romney and the Bruce Wayne character, a proverbial 1-percenter. In one trailer, Catwoman echoes the Occupy Wall Street movement, telling Wayne, ""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.""

Dixon too saw more parallels between Batman and Romney, telling a call-in radio show, ""Bane is a force for evil and the destruction of the status quo. He's far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street-type if you're looking to cast him politically. And if there ever was a Bruce Wayne running for the White House it would have to be Romney.""

Our ruling

Limbaugh suggested it’s no accident that in a movie coming out four months before the presidential election, the villain bears the same name as the company formerly run by Romney and now being attacked by Democrats.

In politics, conspiracies are everywhere if you look hard enough. But Limbaugh’s superpowers of persuasion can’t make this theory stand up. The villainous Bane first appeared in Batman comic books in 1993, long before Romney entered presidential politics. Even the character’s creator called a suggested link ""ridiculous.""

Club for Growth says every major Texas newspaper calls David Dewhurst a moderate
","
A Washington-based political action committee, Club for Growth Action, calls Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz a ""champion fighter"" in a radio ad titled ""Time"" while saying his July 2012 runoff foe, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, has advocated a wage tax and more spending.

The super-PAC ad’s narrator says: ""It’s no wonder every major newspaper in Texas calls Dewhurst a moderate."" (Listen to the ad to the right.)

We’ve poked into various tax-and-spending claims about Dewhurst. Dewhurst once supported a payroll tax though none made it into law. Contrary to Cruz claims, Dewhurst has never advocated a state income tax and has presided over cuts in state budgets.

For this foray, we wondered if every major Texas newspaper ""calls Dewhurst a moderate.""

On the hustings, Cruz has hammered his contention that Dewhurst is a moderate, perhaps mindful that runoff voters are likely to be conservative-leaning. In this vein, a February 4, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article quotes Rice University political science professor Mark Jones as saying that conservative Republican officeholders face a conundrum. ""Either they govern effectively and at times don't follow conservative principles to the letter, or they follow conservative principles and they don't get things done,"" Jones said. ""For many Republican Party activists, compromise is a dirty word.""

The Statesman story goes on to say that the Texas Senate, over which Dewhurst presides, runs on compromise: ""For a bill to be considered, two-thirds of the 31 senators must agree, and Republicans are two seats shy of the votes needed to muscle legislation through without compromising with Democrats."" The Republicans have not held a two-thirds’ Senate majority in modern times.

Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller offered as initial backup to the group’s claim headlines from articles printed in the two biggest Texas daily newspapers in 2007 and 2009 plus an October 2010 piece in the liberal Texas Observer political journal, which we set aside; the Observer is not a newspaper. Keller said he considers only the two papers with the most circulation in each state to be its ""major"" papers.

Using the Nexis search service, we fetched the newspaper stories, which turned out not to be straight news accounts. One was a reporter’s commentary, in which the writer floats personal ideas or analysis, and the other was an editorial, the form of writing by which newspapers stake out positions on pages devoted to expressions of opinion. 
Let’s recap them.

The January 29, 2007, news commentary by Clay Robison, then Austin bureau chief for the Houston Chronicle, opens: ""Around the state Capitol, (Dewhurst) is generally considered a more ‘moderate’ Republican than the other two members of the top leadership trio — Gov. Rick Perry and (House) Speaker Tom Craddick. But — shhh — don't talk about that too loudly, lest you spoil Dewhurst's effort to polish his image among the many Texas Republicans who are decidedly more conservative and who may hold the key to his political future.""

Robison’s commentary also says that for ""all the convenience they afford political writers, labels can be dicey, and people at different ends of the political spectrum often don't agree on characterizations. There is little argument, though, that Dewhurst is part of a Republican leadership that is more conservative than the Democratic leaders of just a few years ago.""

His column suggests that unlike Republicans, Democrats would not have closed a revenue shortfall in 2003 solely with budget cuts and higher tuition and likely would have raised taxes to minimize disruptions to public services. ""But Dewhurst and the Senate helped soften some of the spending cuts in 2003,"" the column says, ""and during last spring's special session on school finance, they led the way to securing a modest teacher pay raise.""

Finally, the commentary says Dewhurst ""has to seek consensus or compromise in the Senate because the body's operating rules give clout to the Democratic minority. According to friends and associates, the article says, he also is more moderate philosophically than many of the conservative voters and activists in his party,"" though Dewhurst also ""has to cultivate the votes"" of conservatives who dominate the Texas Republican primary.

The Jan. 14, 2009, Dallas Morning News editorial, headlined ""Dewhurst should avoid playing partisan hand,"" airs concern that Dewhurst’s ambition for higher office could cause him to court ""hard-core conservatives"" while negotiating differences with House Speaker Joe Straus. ""Dewhurst often has served as a moderate Republican in his six years as the Texas Senate's leader,"" the editorial says, ""so chances are he will like having a pragmatic conservative like Straus across the Capitol. They should work better than Dewhurst did with former Speaker Tom Craddick, an ironclad conservative who quarreled with Dewhurst on issues such as school funding.""

""So which Dewhurst will lead the Senate?"" the editorial says. ""The moderate conservative who has tried to rein in his party from becoming extreme on issues like budget cuts? Or the Dewhurst who's trying to win over staunch conservatives for another office?""

Keller, asked if he had other examples of major papers calling Dewhurst a moderate, passed along headlines for what turned out to be commentaries published in smaller newspapers in 2003, 2005 and 2007.

In the September 21, 2003, San Antonio Express-News, editorial writer Bruce Davidson said in his column that Dewhurst had described himself as a ""pro-growth conservative populist."" The commentary continues: ""His earlier performance"" as lieutenant governor ""provided evidence to back up that description. The lieutenant governor's approach to vital budget issues was refreshing in a legislative session marked by the rest of the GOP leadership's stubborn stampede toward cuts that hurt the state's poorest residents. Dewhurst led the charge to find non-tax revenues to balance the budget with fewer cuts in the Children's Health Insurance Program than those advocated by other Republican leaders. He showed a willingness to tackle tough issues by proposing increased sales taxes to solve the public school funding crisis. The plan wasn't perfect, but at least Dewhurst was willing to lead instead of delay... For the next two years, Dewhurst remains the best hope for finding some political middle ground in Austin.""

In the January 16, 2005, Corpus Christi Caller-Times, editorial writer Nick Jimenez wrote that in restoring some benefits to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, open to families of the working poor, ""Dewhurst comes out as the moderate. He wants vision screening, dental and mental health benefits restored. And he wants the families who qualify to stay eligible for 12 months"" without having to re-enroll in intervening months.

And in an opinion column in the February 4, 2007, Statesman, editor Rich Oppel wrote: ""Dewhurst got off to a good start in his first term as lieutenant governor, adopting a moderate stance and building the confidence of the 31-member state Senate.""

So, five commentary or editorial items -- including pieces in the state’s four largest newspapers -- published from 2003 through 2009 described Dewhurst as a moderate.

Next, we widened our look by considering references to Dewhurst in the five biggest Texas papers according to daily circulation tallies listed in the Texas Daily Newspaper Association’s 2012 online directory: the Chronicle (circulation 383,953); Morning News (238,869); Fort Worth Star-Telegram (167,364); Statesman (133,979); and Express-News (129,411).

Searching the Nexis database for ""Dewhurst"" plus ""moderate"" delivered nearly 300 articles, though the vast majority of the stories reflect only Cruz or Cruz supporters characterizing Dewhurst.

Among other stories, an October 16, 2010, Morning News news article states: ""When Dewhurst was first elected lieutenant governor in 2002, he was viewed as a conservative, but more moderate in his approach than then-House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican from Midland who was often at odds with his Senate counterpart. Even Senate Democrats praised Dewhurst in his first session.

""But since then,"" the story continues, ""he has pushed harder for GOP-backed causes, such as voter ID legislation and abortion restrictions. And his leadership of the Senate is now seen by many as more partisan than when he came into office.""

In a January 1, 2007, opinion column, William McKenzie of the Morning News voiced hopes for that year’s legislative session and speculated that the ambitious Dewhurst might play to the center. ""His moderate instincts could prevail,"" the column says.

Most recently, J.R. Labbe, editorial director for the Star-Telegram, wrote a May 14, 2012, commentary on the paper’s decision to endorse another candidate over Dewhurst in the May Senate primary. Her commentary says: ""The Ted Cruz campaign describes Dewhurst as an ‘establishment moderate’ every chance it gets. It's meant as a put-down, but that's what Dewhurst used to be -- and he was an effective lieutenant governor.""

Our ruling

From 2003 through 2010, major Texas newspapers published a few stories referring to Dewhurst as a moderate. 
All but once, though, the references were made in editorial, opinion or commentary contexts, and usually to say that Dewhurst had been more moderate than another leader or to hope that he would show moderation. The single relevant straight-news reference to Dewhurst in this fashion says he was initially viewed as a conservative, though as more moderate than then-House Speaker Tom Craddick. That story also says Dewhurst had since advocated more GOP-backed causes and been seen as more partisan.

Broadly, it's our sense that saying that every major Texas daily ""calls"" Dewhurst a moderate leaves the impression the newspapers -- either two or five -- have all done so routinely or lately and always without qualifying the descriptive. That’s not so.

We rate the statement as Mostly False.

"['Tennessee', 'Julia Hurley']","
Hurley says carving initials in desks is a federal and state government tradition.
","
State Rep. Julia Hurley, R-Lenoir City, sent constituents an email last month declaring, among other things, that carving initials on desks is a ""traditional act"" of legislators and has a long history in both the state and national capitols.

The Hurley history here dates back to last year, when the freshman lawmaker acknowledged carving her initials on her designated desk in the state House of Representatives chamber at the Tennessee Capitol toward the end of a long lawmaking day. After the incident got some media attention, she paid to have the desk refinished to remove the carved letters, J.C.H., at the suggestion of House Speaker Beth Harwell.

In a June 23, 2012, email to constituents reproduced on some blogs, Hurley provided some explanation that she had not offered previously, including an assertion that the practice is commonplace and the media attention unwarranted.

""If you have ever visited Nashville or Washington D.C. you will see MANY names and initials carved into the tops, sides, legs and inside drawers of desks with over a hundred years of history,"" she wrote. ""Not only did this make front page news, the liberal media decided to associate Representative Hurley as being a vandal, while two hundred years of history has shown this to be a traditional act in all aspects of Legislators services.""

The description of desk carving as a normal legislative behavior struck us as an interesting assertion. Does Hurley have her history straight?

In Washington, it appears Hurley is right about the U.S. Senate; but wrong about the U.S. House.
U.S. senators have a long history of signing or etching their names into the drawer of their Senate desks. The tradition started in the early 20th century, around 1901 or 1902, when the first names started to show up, said Betty Koed, associate Senate historian in the Senate Historical Office.

""Now it’s tradition, so most senators that come into office will sign their desk drawer in some form,"" Koed said. ""In fact, the Senate curators who are the people in charge of taking care of the desks encourage senators to do that. There are Capitol ceremonies where the new member comes in to allow them to do that.""

Some senators use a pen to write their names in the desk drawer. Others etch their names into the drawer with a knife.

""It’s not on the top or something that’s visible, but if you open the desk drawer of each of the old desks in the current Senate chamber, you’ll find a collection of signatures in there,"" Koed said.

Some senators add their name every time they switch desks, so some names will appear on multiple desks.

""Harry Truman, I think, signed three or four different desks because he moved from place to place,"" Koed said. ""It’s a way to sort of put their mark on that desk but also to be part of a longstanding tradition.""

In the U.S. House, however, there is no such tradition. In fact, House members sit in theater-style seating and haven’t had actual desks since around 1913, according to the House’s Office of the Historian. Because they don’t have desks, there’s no place for them to write or etch their names.

In Nashville, there is no such tradition for either the House or the Senate chamber.

The State Capitol Commission, with a membership appointed by the governor and House and Senate speakers, oversees the state capitol building itself and all its furnishings in conjunction with the Department of General Services.

Thad Watkins, general counsel for the Department of General Services, said that any marking on the state Capitol structure or its furnishings would ""absolutely"" require approval of the commission under the relevant state law and rules. The State Library and Archives and the State Museum would be involved as well, he said.

In his nine years as department legal counsel, Watkins said, there has certainly never been a request for marking approval and he is unaware of any sought before that.

""The state Capitol is a state treasure, a historic building,"" he said. ""Safeguarding of the furnishings and the physical premises is taken very seriously.

""I am not aware of anyone asking to mark or deface or leave an imprint on any state building,"" Watkins said. ""You would need to ask (to comply with state rules and law).""

Watkins suggested speaking as well with state Sen. Douglas Henry, D-Nashville, the Legislature's senior member, a longtime former member of the Capitol Commission and respected Tennessee history buff. Henry, who served his first term in the Legislature as a House member in the 1950s, said he has heard stories of Union soldiers putting marks on the Capitol and furnishings after seizing Nashville during the Civil War.

Beyond that – and perhaps some defacement of furnishings and the building during the ""tumultuous times"" of the Reconstruction era – the senator said he knows of no tradition for carving initials or anything else on desks or other furnishings.

He recalled there have been small plaques honoring deceased legislators – the late Rep. John Bragg in the House, for example. But those were duly approved in response to resolutions passed by the General Assembly.

""I've never seen such a mark (initial carving) nor have I heard of such a mark,"" said Henry, 86.

The Capitol this summer is undergoing a $15.7 million renovation and is closed to the public during the process. During a recent media tour, we found the House and Senate desks covered with protective plastic and in some cases pushed together, making a thorough check of all desks impractical. A random check of six desks in both the House and Senate chambers turned up no initials or markings inside or outside the desks – though the drawer on one House desk was locked.

Still, WSMV-TV, which initially reported on the Hurley carving last year, did find some markings on other desks in the House chamber at the time.

""We found the word 'Houston' on Rep. Tim Wirgau's desk, a dollar sign on Rep. Dennis Powers' territory, what appears to be the initials W.M. on Rep. Janis Sontany's desk, and an ‘A’ on Rep. Sheila Butt's desk,"" the station reported.

Hurley, when asked about her recent email assertion, suggested that some desks may have initials inside their drawers. Otherwise, she said that the email was intended as her final comment on the initial-carving matter, that she has put it behind her and that the media should as well.

The upshot is that, except for the U.S. Senate custom of names and initials inside desk drawers, there is no tradition of such doings in either Washington or Nashville.

In Nashville, such carving is effectively prohibited – though it seems there have apparently been occasional episodes of unauthorized carving by someone. Those could have been done by legislators or by most anyone, since the Capitol is open to visits by the public most of the time.

There could be other hidden and unauthorized carvings inside some locked desk drawers. But there are surely not ""many"" carvings of any sort outside the U.S. Senate, and what the representative suggests is a tradition is impossible in U.S. House and prohibited in the state House and state Senate.

We rate Hurley’s historical assertion as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C2B840>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/julia-hurley/state-rep-julia-hruley-says-state-and-us-capitols-/

Barack Obama says Mitt Romney received carried interest, a tax 'trick'
","
President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign continues to press the point that Mitt Romney made a lot of money in ways that most people don’t. On July 17, 2012, the campaign unveiled an ad in Pennsylvania, a swing state where Romney was making an appearance.

The ad begins with a narrator saying, ""Tax havens, offshore accounts, and carried interest. Mitt Romney has used every trick in the book.""

The last item in the list -- carried interest, which refers to a type of income typically earned by managers of hedge funds and private-equity firms -- caught our eye. We wondered whether the Obama camp was justified in calling carried interest a tax-limitation ""trick.""

This one is a little technical, so we'll break it into pieces.

What is carried interest?

Private-equity firms (which buy, invest in, help manage and eventually sell companies) and hedge funds (which invest in a wide variety of markets) are run by managers on behalf of outside investors. When profits from a firm’s investments are disbursed, they are typically distributed according to each investor's stake. This income is taxed on each individual’s tax return, usually at the capital-gains rate of 15 percent.

Fund managers may receive some income this way, but there’s a separate stream of income that is usually more lucrative for them. They often take 2 percent of the fund’s assets per year as a management fee, which is paid in cash and taxed at ordinary income rates of 35 percent, plus 20 percent of the profits as a performance-based bonus. The 20 percent portion is typically ""carried over"" for years at a time, often until the investment is closed out (thus the name, ""carried interest""). This payment is taxed at capital gains rates of 15 percent -- less than if it were salary or wages.

The hefty tax rate advantage for carried interest has spawned criticism. In the 2008 campaign, Obama promised to tax carried interest at the same rate as regular income, an effort we currently rate Stalled on our Obameter.

The Congressional Research Service says the dispute boils down to opposing views of what carried interest represents. Obama and his allies say carried interest is essentially a management fee rather than investment profits from an ownership stake, and should be taxed like regular income. Opponents say it’s more like like investment income.

It should not be surprising that Romney had carried interest income, since he co-founded and ran Bain Capital -- a private-equity firm. But this point was confirmed in an on-the-record call the Romney campaign set up with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012.

Ben Ginsberg, an attorney for the Romney campaign, said on the conference call that ""the amount from carried interest"" earned by Romney ""was $7.4 million in 2010 and $5.5 million in 2011."" By having that income taxed at 15 percent rather than 35 percent meant that Romney may have saved more than over $2.5 million in taxes.

Is carried interest a ""trick""?

We found differing opinions about whether it's accurate to describe it as ""a trick.""

Some tax experts told us they think Obama’s use of the term ""trick"" is fair, because carried interest is a way to limit taxes that’s essentially limited to the very wealthy.

""Given that the word ‘trick’ has no specific legal meaning in this context, I think it's fair game to call this one of the ‘tricks’ in the book,"" said Neil H. Buchanan, a law professor at George Washington University. ""Each technique is different, and is used for a different specific tax advantage, but they're all among the list of things that wealthy people have at their disposal to cut their tax bills, that other people do not have available to them.""

Several other tax experts, however, thought the Obama camp went too far in using that term and in lumping carried interest together with tax havens and offshore accounts.

They said the taxation of carried interest involves a pretty straightforward application of U.S. tax law. Offshore accounts and tax havens, by contrast, operate in the spaces between U.S. tax law, rather than as part of it. While there’s a dispute over whether the tax treatment of carried interest is smart policy, its legal standing is solid. Carried interest is a longstanding part of the tax code and applies in several areas of investment including real estate and gas and oil.

Second, some argued that taxing carried interest as capital gains promotes entrepreneurial activity.

Steve Judge, the president of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, a trade group for private equity funds, said carried interest is a way to reward risk takers in a way that tax havens do not. ""They don’t have the purpose of incentivizing risk taking,"" Judge said. ""That makes it inappropriate to blend carried interest with them.""

And third, carried interest isn’t really a tax strategy in the same way that using offshore accounts or tax havens is.

Creating offshore accounts in tax havens can be put into effect quickly, if you are rich enough. As the Congressional Research Service notes, ""The individual, using the Internet, can open a bank account in the name of a Cayman corporation that can be set up for a minimal fee. Money can be electronically transferred without any reporting to tax authorities, and investments can be made in the United States or abroad.""

But to benefit from the taxation of carried interest, you have to become a fund manager -- something that doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a career choice years in the making. Not even a fund’s investors get the benefits of carried interest -- it’s only the fund managers themselves.

Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that as long as they are legal, none of the three techniques cited by the ad are really ""tricks.""

""Carried interest is currently a legitimate way of reducing one's tax obligation,"" he said. ""It may be unfair and distortionary; but it's not any more a ‘trick’ than taking advantage of the mortgage interest deduction. Congress ought to change the law so that carried interest is taxed at regular income rates. But until then. …""

Our ruling

The Obama campaign said Romney's use of carried interest is a ""trick,"" but we find that's an exaggeration. ""Trick"" suggests something nefarious or twisting the tax code in a way that wasn't intended. But we found little to back that up. Using carried interes ist a legal, well-established part of the tax code that can’t be marshaled to dodge taxes by making a few quick mouse clicks on a Cayman Island website. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F4504F40>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-received-carried-int/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Mary Matalin']","
Debbie Wasserman Schultz had offshore accounts like Mitt Romney, said Mary Matalin
","So Mitt Romney had a Swiss bank account. Big deal!

That's the argument Republican pundit Mary Matalin deployed about Romney’s finances on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos.

Responding to comments from fellow panelist George F. Will that Romney needed to be more forthcoming about his finances, Matalin said, ""With deference and respect to my esteemed colleague here, people don't care where his bank accounts are. They care that they don't have much left in their bank accounts. ...

""They don't care about his taxes. They care about their own taxes,"" she continued. ""He's released 2010. He's releasing 2011. He has full disclosure.

""There's no tax advantages to being offshore,"" she said. ""Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the handpicked Democratic chairman by Barack Obama, has these offshore accounts.""

The mention of Wasserman Schultz -- the head of the Democratic National Committee and one of Florida’s more high-profile members of Congress -- caught our attention. Does Wasserman Schultz have offshore accounts similar to Romney’s?

Before Romney became governor of Massachusetts in 2003, he had a long career managing Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm, and that work made him wealthy. We fact-checked whether Romney had a Swiss bank account and found that accurate.

The trustee for the Romney family’s investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- set up the account in 2003. There were no tax advantages to holding the Swiss account, said Malt in a conference call with reporters in January 2012, when the campaign released Mitt and Ann Romney’s 2010 tax returns.

The account contained approximately $3 million, and it was held by Union Bank Switzerland, or UBS.

""The tax is fully paid, just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that,"" Malt said then. And in our review, we found nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account, just as Matalin said.

Now, let’s look at Wasserman Schultz’s finances. As we researched, we found similar claims about Wasserman Schultz and offshore accounts that pointed back to the conservative magazine and website the Weekly Standard.

The Weekly Standard combed through Wasserman Schultz’s financial disclosures, which are required from all members of Congress. It found several 401(k) funds listed there, then cross-referenced the funds with their published holdings. The Davis Financial Fund ""is invested in the Julius Baer Group Ltd. and the State Bank of India GDR Ltd., as well as other financial, insurance, bank institutions,"" the Weekly Standard noted.  Julius Baer is a Swiss private banking group.

We went through the disclosure statements and found what the Weekly Standard described.

To refresh your memory on 401(k) funds: They’re retirement savings accounts where workers can sock away money and defer paying taxes on it. Money managers then invest the savings in all sorts of ways, both in the U.S. and abroad.

In some ways, the Weekly Standard’s point is fair and relevant: It’s a global economy, and many Americans have investments overseas through their own 401(k)s and pension funds. Some of the attacks on Romney suggest that his Swiss account had some nefarious function, and we haven’t seen any evidence to support that.

Matalin sent us this statement, emailed from a spokesperson, that reiterated that point: ""The attack from Obama wasn't about the size of the account but the very existence of it. There is nothing illegal or unique about these accounts. My response was two-fold: Obama is a hypocrite since his own appointees have the same arrangements and using a distraction tactic because he can't run on his record.""

Still, with all due respect to the globally interconnected economy, Wasserman Schultz’s ""offshore accounts"" have little in common with Romney’s.

For one thing, the amounts of money in the accounts are of staggeringly different size. Wasserman Schultz’s 401(k) fund had less than $15,000. Romney had up to $3 million.

Wasserman Schultz’s money was in a 401(k) account, the Davis Financial Fund, which is based in Massachusetts. It was purchased April 15, 2010, and sold on April 23, 2010. So it wasn’t held for very long.

Romney’s money was in a cash savings account held from 2003 to 2010, according to his attorney.

After hearing Matalin’s comments, we also wondered whether Wasserman Schultz and Romney are in the same league financially. They’re not.

Wasserman Schultz’s net worth -- all her assets minus all her liabilities -- was somewhere between $235,000 and negative $290,000 in 2010, according to the most recent disclosure.

In fact, Wasserman Schultz was one of the least wealthy members of Congress that year. The Center for Responsive Politics ranked her at No. 422 out of 440 House members. (The list is slightly larger than 435 seats in the House due to special elections.)

Romney’s wealth, on the other hand, is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million. The Romney campaign told the Washington Post that a more accurate range would be between $190 million and $250 million.

Our ruling

Matalin said that Romney might have offshore accounts, but so do others. ""Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the handpicked Democratic chairman by Barack Obama, has these offshore accounts,"" she said.

Actually, Wasserman Schultz had a 401(k) account of less than $15,000, managed by an American company, that included some foreign investments. Romney’s account was a savings account of approximately $3 million held by a Swiss bank.

Matalin does have a point that Romney’s account was entirely legal and he paid taxes on the earnings. It’s also true that many Americans have foreign investments through 401(k)s and pension funds.

But Wasserman Schultz’s investments are not similar to Romney’s, neither in size nor in type.

We rate Matalin’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809711D5C0>],/factchecks/2012/jul/18/mary-matalin/debbie-wasserman-schultz-had-offshore-accounts-mit/
