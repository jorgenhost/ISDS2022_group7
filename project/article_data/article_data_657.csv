"['Medicaid', 'Health Check', 'Lindsey Graham']","
Graham says N.Y., Calif. and Mass. get over a third of ACA money. The latest data say they don't.
","Sen. Lindsey Graham has never been a fan of the Affordable Care Act — even though it’s helped dramatically lower the number of uninsured people in his home state of South Carolina. The Republican, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, attacked the law at the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Democrats have made the nomination a referendum on the health law, which will be the subject of a Supreme Court hearing Nov. 10. They fear the court may overturn the entire law, which has led to huge expansions in coverage and blocked insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, among other consumer protections. Graham suggested that South Carolina was getting the short end of funding because the health law is sending a disproportionate amount of its money to states represented by Democrats in Congress. ""Under the Affordable Care Act, three states get 35% of the money, folks. Can you name them? I'll help you: California, New York and Massachusetts. They're 22% of the population. Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein's from California, [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi's from California, Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic Senate, is from New York, and Massachusetts is [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren. Now, why do they get 35% of the money when they're only 22% of the population? That's the way they designed the law: The more you spend, the more you get."" His statement got us wondering if those numbers are true. We asked Graham’s office for evidence to support his statement. His spokesperson responded with data he said was from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as well as the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board. To look at total spending under the ACA, Graham’s office analyzed federal money that went to pay for the Medicaid expansion, tax credits given to consumers to subsidize premiums of insurance plans on the marketplace, cost sharing reduction subsidies (which were given to insurers to defray some of the costs they were required by the ACA to pick up for marketplace customers with very low incomes) and the Basic Health Program, which is an option in the ACA that lets states offer low-income residents different coverage than plans offered on the marketplaces. Graham’s office did not share the actual reports used for the analysis, but staffers said they used 2016 data, even though more recent data was available. The numbers were based on calculations made in 2017 when Republican lawmakers sought to repeal and replace the ACA. Their analysis showed $118 billion in total 2016 federal spending on the ACA, with California, New York and Massachusetts receiving about $43 billion, or about 37% (slightly higher than what Graham cited at the hearing). Nearly two-thirds of the funding was attributed to the expansion of Medicaid to all adults below the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court ruled that pursuing the expansion was an option left to states’ discretion — South Carolina opted against it. The federal government paid all those Medicaid costs from 2014 through 2016 for new enrollees and then gradually reduced its share to 90% today. We decided to independently look at the spending using the latest available numbers. We reviewed federal data compiled by KFF as well as data provided directly from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the states, when necessary. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) It is important to note that the Trump administration ended the cost sharing reduction payments in October 2017. So, KHN’s analysis did not include spending for that program. We analyzed the latest Medicaid expansion funding from 2018 and the latest Obamacare tax credit spending and also Basic Health Program spending from 2019. Only two states participate in that program, New York and Minnesota. Adding up the latest data and the federal share of funding came to nearly $140 billion. Of that amount, New York, California and Massachusetts — which represent about 20% of the nation’s population — received a combined $40 billion, or about 29%. The largest category of federal funding by far was the nearly $27.5 billion the three states together received from Medicaid expansion. New York received about $5 billion in fiscal 2019 for the Basic Health Program. Sifting through older datasets, one key discrepancy stands out in the figures used by Graham. He lists Massachusetts as receiving $6.1 billion in federal exchange subsidies — almost 20% of the national total — while federal data used by KFF in 2016 cites $360 million.  Graham insinuated that South Carolina wasn’t getting its fair share of money, calling the law ""a disaster for the state."" But the refusal by the state’s Republican leaders for the past seven years to expand Medicaid — which would have brought in billions of federal dollars — is the main reason for the funding disparity. South Carolina is one of 12 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion. That decision has left hundreds of thousands of the state’s residents uninsured because they have incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to qualify for federal subsidies to help them buy insurance plans sold on the ACA marketplaces. To qualify for a subsidy, consumers’ income must be at least at the federal poverty level, or $12,760 in 2020. ""A big driver of the flow of federal funds is related to that decision about whether to expand,"" said Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy. ""It is not inherently in the design of the law."" If South Carolina expanded Medicaid, about 330,000 more residents would be covered and the federal government would give an additional $1.6 billion  in annual Medicaid funding to the state, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. State Medicaid spending would rise by $250 million. Even without expanding Medicaid, the uninsured rate in South Carolina has dropped from 20% in 2008 to about 13% in 2019, according to Census data. More than 9 in 10 people in the state who get coverage through the ACA marketplace get tax credits to help them pay their monthly premiums. In fact, South Carolina gets a larger share of those premium tax credits than most states. South Carolina, the nation’s 23rd-largest state by population size, ranks 11th in the number of residents getting those subsidies and ninth in receipt of the federal ACA premium subsidies, according to the federal data. Kevin Bishop, a spokesperson for Graham, said the point of the senator's remarks is that the ACA ""is structured so that states that either expanded [Medicaid] or have favorable state eligibility will have a disproportionate share of funds. This gives an advantage to high-spending states."" States that are more ""fiscally responsible"" are at a disadvantage, he said. Bishop acknowledged that ACA spending does change each year. Levitt noted that Graham’s critique omitted an important perspective about other states. The senator did not mention that enrollees in two Republican-controlled states with large populations, Florida and Texas, receive more in ACA premium subsidies than people in New York or Massachusetts. However, neither of those Southern states has expanded its Medicaid program. Still, experts noted that Graham’s comment that the more states spend the more they get from the ACA is partly true. It accurately reflects the ACA’s Medicaid formula. As states expand Medicaid eligibility, they pick up more expenses and also receive more money in a federal match. Joe Antos, a health economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Graham is correct that the Medicaid expansion was designed to help direct additional funding to wealthier states such as New York, California and Massachusetts. Those states, as well as some others, had broader Medicaid eligibility rules than poorer states before the law was enacted so their Medicaid rolls were relatively larger already. That’s why the Medicaid expansion was set at 138% of the federal poverty level, rather than 100%, he said. The higher amount meant those states could get a larger reimbursement for people already in their program. But he said states that chose not to expand Medicaid under the law can’t blame the law for getting fewer federal dollars. ""If a state did not expand, it’s on them for having less federal funding,"" Antos said. Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the expansion of Medicaid for those more progressive states significantly increased their funding. ""New York made out like a bandit,"" he said, noting the state had one of nation’s largest Medicaid populations before 2010. Graham points to higher federal spending on ACA programs in three states that are represented by top congressional Democrats and complains that South Carolina is not faring as well. While his numbers are four years old, the latest numbers are just a few percentage points lower than what he cited — 29% compared with 35%. He also left out some critical information — most important, that South Carolina didn’t pursue federal funding through Medicaid expansion, or both.  His argument that the law was designed to help some states largely controlled by Democrats fails to note that many Republican-controlled states have received heavy federal funding, too, either because of ACA tax subsidies or Medicaid expansion. He also didn’t acknowledge that South Carolina does have a strong record of receiving federal subsidies for consumers buying insurance on the ACA marketplace. We rate Graham’s statement as Half True.","[('Email exchanges with Kevin Bishop, spokesperson for Sen.

App-based companies pushing Prop. 22 say drivers will get health benefits. Will they?
","App-based driving services such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart are bankrolling California’s Proposition 22, which would keep their drivers classified as independent contractors, not employees. Leading into the Nov. 3 election, the ballot measure — which has become the most expensive in state history — is mired in controversy and is the subject of a lawsuit from Uber drivers alleging that the company inappropriately pressured them to vote for the initiative. But what’s occasionally lost in the debate over Proposition 22 are the claims about what it will mean for drivers for app-based services. Detractors, like unions and driver advocacy groups, say Proposition 22 would strip drivers of the protections of AB-5, a 2019 California law that requires drivers to be classified as employees. The law, which has been delayed by legal challenges, would afford them the associated benefits like paid sick leave, workers’ compensation and access to unemployment insurance. Supporters, such as ride-sharing companies and the California Chamber of Commerce, say Proposition 22 would give drivers benefits, like a guarantee of minimum earnings and compensation when they are hurt on the job, while allowing them to maintain the flexible schedule of independent contractors. In an online ad paid for by Lyft, the company says ""Prop. 22 will give them … health care benefits."" That sounds like drivers with Uber, Lyft and other app-based companies will automatically get health insurance if Proposition 22 passes. The truth is a little more complicated. We reached out to Lyft to back up its claim, and the company directed us to the ""Yes on 22"" campaign. This is how the campaign explained ""health care benefits"": Under Proposition 22, drivers who qualify — more on that in a minute — would get a stipend they could use to buy an insurance plan from Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace. That stipend would be calculated like this: App-based companies would look at the statewide average monthly premium of bronze-level plans sold on the Covered California exchange. The companies would then give qualified drivers a stipend of 82% of the average premium, said Geoff Vetter, a spokesperson for the Yes on 22 campaign. (On average, U.S. employers covered 82% of premiums costs for single coverage in 2019.) So hypothetically, if bronze plans cost an average of $100 per month, Uber, Lyft or a similar company would provide qualifying drivers with $82 per month. Drivers would be eligible for the full stipend — all $82 in the hypothetical case — if they average 25 hours per week of ""engaged"" time, which does not include time spent waiting between jobs.  ""Most drivers work part time"" and spend about one-third of their time waiting for rides and deliveries, according to the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst’s Office. Using that equation, drivers would need to work an average of 37.5 hours per week for a single company in order to receive the full stipend. A driver who averages at least 15 but less than 25 hours of engaged time each week would be eligible for 50% of the stipend — or $41 per month. The stipend would be similar to employer-sponsored insurance because both employers and employees would contribute to the cost of insurance, Vetter said. ""For the people who do work closer to full time, it does give them that ability to receive health care coverage by getting a typical employer contribution for that coverage,"" Vetter said. But this stipend bears little resemblance to traditional employer-based insurance, which is what drivers would get if they were considered employees instead of gig workers, said Ken Jacobs, chair of the University of California-Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. ""It has very, very little relationship to what anyone would think of as job-based coverage,"" Jacobs said. ""It’s really wrong to think of this as health insurance."" For instance, under Proposition 22, the stipends would be calculated and distributed quarterly, based on drivers’ hours. That could force drivers to periodically reassess what kind of coverage they would qualify for and could afford. With traditional employer-sponsored insurance, a driver would enroll in a plan once per year and the premium wouldn’t change. A vacation or illness could mean that drivers can’t maintain the hours required by the measure, costing them their stipend — and perhaps their insurance — for the quarter, and stripping them of the stability usually associated with job-based coverage, Jacobs said. And getting money to buy an individual plan isn’t the same as participating in a large group plan offered by an employer, said Jen Flory, a policy advocate at the Western Center on Law & Poverty, a nonprofit organization that advocates for low-income Californians and opposes Proposition 22. Covered California plans are typically less generous than the policies employees usually get through work, she said. And bronze-level plans, which have the lowest monthly premiums, also have the highest out-of-pocket costs for medical services. Consider the deductible, which is how much a person needs to pay out-of-pocket before insurance starts paying for care. In 2018, fewer than half of Californians who had work-based insurance had a deductible, and on average, that deductible was $1,402 for a single person, according to research from the California Health Care Foundation. (California Healthline is an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.) The deductible on a Covered California bronze plan for an individual in 2021 will be $6,300 for medical services plus $500 for prescription drugs. Proposition 22 ties the stipend ""to the highest deductible, highest out-of-pocket plans on the market,"" Flory said. ""And it’s for workers who aren’t making a whole lot of money."" Drivers could use the stipend to buy a more generous plan, but the monthly premium would be higher and the stipend would cover less of it. Depending on their incomes and other factors, drivers may also be eligible for tax credits and state and federal subsidies to help them afford plans on the individual market. But Flory said this amounts to the government subsidizing health insurance that employers should be paying for themselves. It’s also problematic to base the stipends on a statewide average of bronze premiums because that doesn’t take into account the huge regional differences in the cost of care, said Gerald Kominski, a senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. ""In the Bay Area, that contribution is going to buy a lot less than it would in Southern California,"" Kominski said. ""We’re a big state and have a lot of variation of health care costs."" The stipend offered under Proposition 22 is a ""health care benefit,"" but the wording is misleading and ignores critical informaiton. While neither Lyft nor the Yes on 22 campaign says the proposition will give drivers health insurance, saying that it will offer them ""health care benefits"" gives the impression that the stipend is similar to traditional job-based coverage. It’s not. Drivers who value the ability to make their own schedules would have to figure out how to work an average of nearly 40 hours a week — essentially full time — to receive the full stipend. The stipend would cover a fraction of the premiums for health insurance that’s typically less generous than what they’d get as employees. Moreover, because drivers’ stipends could change quarterly based on their driving time — which could be affected by vacation or illness — any coverage purchased with the stipend could carry a cloud of uncertainty. We rate this claim as Half True. Clarification: This story was changed to clarify that ""engaged"" time does not include time spent waiting between jobs.","[('Email interview with CJ Macklin, senior communications manager with Lyft, Oct. 21, 2020', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/cj-macklin-82b2a5a'), ('Yes on 22 Campaign, annotated Proposition 22', 'No link'), ('Legislative Analyst’s Office, analysis of Proposition 22', 'https://protectdriversandservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Protect-App-Based-Drivers-Services-Act_Annotated.pdf'), ('Lyft’s Yes on Prop 22 webpage', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Jen Flory, policy advocate at the Western Center on Law & Poverty, Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=22&year=2020'), ('Phone interview with Geoff Vetter, spokesperson for Yes on 22 Campaign, Oct. 23, 2020', 'No link'), ('Covered California, 2021 Patient-Centered Benefit Plan Designs', 'https://www.lyft.com/yes-on-prop-22'), ('California Health Care Foundation, 2019 California Health Care Almanac Quick Reference Guide', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with James Scullary, broadcast and media relations branch chief at Covered California, Oct. 23, 2020', 'https://wclp.org/our-staff/jen-flory/'), ('Phone interview with Ken Jacobs, chair of the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education, Oct. 26, 2020', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Gerald Kominski, professor of health policy and management and senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, Oct. 26, 2020', 'https://hbex.coveredca.com/stakeholders/plan-management/PDFs/final_2021-standard-benefit-plan-designs_certified-20200529.pdf'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""2019 Employer Health Benefits Survey,"" Sept. 25, 2019\xa0', 'No link'), ('CalMatters, ""Ballot Campaigns Set State Record as Most Expensive,"" Oct. 20, 2020', 'https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/EmployerHealthBenefits2018QRG.pdf'), ('San Francisco Chronicle, ""Lawsuit: Uber Abuses Power With Prop. 22 Ads in Drivers’ Apps,"" Oct. 22, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Washington Post, ""Appeals Court Sides With California on Order to Make Uber and Lyft Drivers Employees,"" Oct. 22, 2020', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-scullary-9670a881')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/28/lyft-lyft/app-based-companies-pushing-prop-22-say-drivers-wi/

Has drug problem worsened under COVID-19?
","For a decade, West Virginia has struggled with a rising tide of drug addiction. Has it gotten worse during the coronavirus pandemic, when many Americans have had to keep their distance from friends and family? That’s what Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said during an interview with the Washington Examiner on Aug. 19. In the interview, Manchin discussed a bill he’s sponsoring, the Crisis Care Improvement and Suicide Prevention Act. The legislation would direct states to use 5% of their federal Mental Health Block Grant funding to support crisis care services. Neither Manchin’s bill nor a House counterpart has advanced in the current Congress. ""The number of overdose cases, exponentially, is just out of proportion,"" Manchin told the newspaper. ""And they're rising tremendously from the opiate (problem), and now with the COVID-19, and suicide, more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol."" Manchin, whose office did not respond to inquiries for this article, got some of his terminology wrong in his comment to the Examiner. But more broadly, he has a point that West Virginia and the nation have experienced upticks in drug and alcohol use during the pandemic. Manchin referred to people becoming ""dependent"" on drugs or alcohol. That means that an individual has a long-term reliance on drugs to function, as opposed to specific instances of using drugs. Complicating matters further, ""dependence"" is not considered the same as ""addiction,"" though the two conditions can overlap. In 2013, the definitive reference work in the field, the American Psychiatric Association's ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,"" replaced the terms ""substance abuse"" and ""substance dependence"" with the single category ""substance use disorder,"" with three subcategories, mild, moderate and severe. This is a long way of saying that Manchin misused the term ""dependence"" to refer to a rise in overdoses or other drug-related crises of the sort his bill would target. That said, the statistics do back up Manchin’s concerns on heightened use of drugs and alcohol during the pandemic. Statistics from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources show that emergency room visits related to overdoses rose were higher in June, July and August 2020 than they were during the same months in 2019.   There is also evidence that rates of overdoses have increased across the country more broadly during the pandemic. We looked at data from the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program, which collects real-time data from law enforcement agencies, fire departments, emergency medical services, hospitals and medical examiners. The data shows that after the onset of the pandemic in March, almost 62% of participating counties experienced an increase in reported overdoses. The number of suspected overdose reports rose by almost 17.6% between the weeks before and after state stay-at-home orders were imposed, the data shows. There’s also evidence of increased alcohol use after the pandemic hit. A study by researchers from the RAND Corp. and Indiana University’s School of Public Health found that self-reported use of alcohol increased by one day more per month for three out of every four adults during the pandemic. Increases were seen in such subgroups as women, adults between 30 and 59, and non-Hispanic whites. Manchin said, ""Now with the COVID-19 … more people are dependent on drugs or alcohol."" Manchin misused the term ""dependent"" to refer to overdoses and other individual drug crises like those targeted by his bill. (It’s also no longer the preferred term in the field.) That said, official West Virginia data shows increases in emergency room visits due to overdoses in June, July and August 2020 compared with the same months in 2019.

Ad for history exhibit in Philadelphia is mistaken for attempt to suppress votes
","Accusations of voter suppression in Philadelphia spread just hours after ads for a history exhibit were plastered on trash bins. Photos uploaded on Instagram showed a man putting up posters with the words ""BALLOT BOX"" in large lettering, on the side of a trash bin. The Instagram user accused the worker of an attempt to suppress votes. ""Stay vigilant, people. They will try anything.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s misinformed. The poster on the trash bin was an advertisement for an exhibit on the history of voting rights, according to reports and the Union League Legacy Foundation. The foundation, which operates the exhibit titled ""Ballot Box: America’s Fight for the Vote,"" unveiled the ads on Oct. 23. It removed the ads just hours later after complaints that voters could be misled to think they were official ballot boxes. Kira Foley-Tuzman, chief administrative officer at the foundation, told PolitiFact the ads were posted on two trash cans near their Union League building on Broad Street, where it has placed ads before. She said the foundation took them down immediately after it received the first call about the confusion at around 10 a.m. ""There was no mal-intent — simply a flubbed execution on marketing,"" Foley-Tuzman said.  Philadelphia, a key city in a battleground state for the November election, has been the subject of attacks by President Donald Trump. He’s falsely accused Philadelphia of attempts at voter fraud and called on his supporters to distrust the results.  ""Bad things happen in Philadelphia,"" Trump said during the first presidential debate.  The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the city’s sanitation workers checked the trash bins after the ads had been posted and found no ballots deposited there.

Trump’s misleading claim about ballot signatures in Nevada
","As President Donald Trump has lobbed attacks on mail in voting this election year, the battleground state of Nevada has become a frequent target of his often misinformed claims on the subject. ""In Nevada, they want to have a thing where you don’t have to have any verification of the signature. It is so terrible,"" Trump said a New Hampshire rally Oct. 25. It wasn’t immediately clear from his remarks, but Trump’s campaign told us the president was referring to his campaign’s recent litigation over signature verification procedures in Clark County, Nev., the state’s most populous county. But we found no evidence that the state or county wants to get rid of signature verification. In August, a day after Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak signed legislation known as AB 4 into law, the Trump campaign sued Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske seeking to block it. The pandemic era elections bill provided, among other things, that active voters would automatically receive ballots in the mail. At Cegavske’s urging, a federal judge dismissed the Trump campaign’s lawsuit. But Trump continued to attack Nevada’s voting by mail system with false attacks about signature requirements.

The website of Cegavske’s office says that ""signature verification is performed on every ballot received. If the signature is missing or if the signature on the ballot return envelope does not match the signature on file for the voter, the ballot will not be counted until the voter verifies their signature."" The state has procedures in place for voters to ""cure"" or fix their ballot if the signature was missing or didn’t match. This is common for checking signatures across states. On Oct. 23, the Trump campaign filed another lawsuit, this time against Cegavske and the registrar of voters for Clark County related to ballot signatures. That’s what the president was talking about in New Hampshire, his campaign said, when he again alleged the state doesn’t ""want"" any signature verification on ballots.  ""We basically have no signature requirement because the system is so lax that virtually all signatures are currently counted in Clark County,"" Adam Lexalt, the state’s former attorney general and Trump campaign chair, told PolitiFact. This lawsuit alleges that Clark County election officials positioned observers in such a way that they can’t fully see the review of ballots, including decisions related to ballots with signature issues. The lawsuit also says that county officials have used a low standard to verify signatures. Clark County is using the Agilis ballot sorting machine as a first step to match voters’ signatures on their ballot envelopes. If the machine finds that the signature doesn’t match the voter’s signature on record, then it is reviewed by elections officials in person. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, is the only Nevada county to use the machine to verify signatures. The Trump campaign lawsuit alleges that ""it is more likely that fraudulent and improper ballots are being tabulated by Clark County"" but includes no proof that any fraudulent ballots were accepted. The lawsuit zeroes in on something referred to as the ""tolerance level"" setting on the machines to determine whether signatures match. The lawsuit says the county registrar, Joseph Gloria, intentionally lowered the manufacturer’s recommended tolerance level to 40 to decrease the number of rejected ballots.  A setting of zero would allow through any ballot while the maximum setting is 100. A spokesperson for the county elections office, Dan Kulin, said that there is no manufacturer’s recommended setting, but confirmed that Clark County uses a setting of 40. We reached out to the manufacturer to ask questions about the settings but didn’t hear back. ""To determine what score to use, we ran tests of the system and concluded that 40 would accept all the signatures that are obvious matches,"" Kulin said. ""Signatures that don’t meet that score are reviewed by our manual processes and may be rejected."" The program compares the writing style, the slant of the letters, and how someone crosses their t’s as part of determining the score of the signature. So far about 30% of the signatures are being automatically authenticated, Kulin said. For those that aren’t authenticated by the machine, the signatures are verified by local elections workers.  The Republicans’ lawsuit, still pending, doesn’t include any documentation from the manufacturer about the settings or proof that the setting used by Clark County is flawed. Instead, it points to the low number of rejected ballots as evidence: As of Oct. 22, 1.45% of ballots in Clark County had been returned for signature issues compared to 3.78% in Churchill County, which doesn’t use the machine, according to the lawsuit. But the lawsuit cherrypicks by choosing Churchill, the county with the highest rate of ballots needing signature cures. Trump said ""in Nevada, they want to have a thing where you don’t have to have any verification of the signature."" Trump’s campaign said he was referring to a lawsuit challenging ballot processing procedures in Clark County. The Trump campaign’s Oct. 23 lawsuit challenges the county’s use of a machine to help flag signature issues on ballots. The case is pending, so it will be up to a judge to decide if any of the arguments have merit. Republicans argue that the fact that only 1.45% of ballots in Clark County needed signature cures translates to a watered down signature requirement. But criticizing the use of the county’s procedures isn’t evidence that the county wants no verification of signatures.  We rate this claim False.

Yes, the Thin Blue Line flag has taken a more prominent place during Trump rallies
","As the 2020 election heads into its final days, a Facebook post is claiming that President Donald Trump had replaced the American flag with an ""anti-Black Lives Matter"" flag at a recent Wisconsin rally. At issue: A Thin Blue Line flag that was prominently featured behind Trump at an Oct. 24, 2020 rally in Waukesha. The flag essentially is a black-and-white version of the American flag, with a single red stripe replaced by a blue one. That blue stripe is meant to symbolize police officers as the ""thin blue line"" between order and chaos.  The Facebook post featured a screenshot of a Twitter post by author and Dartmouth College English professor Jeff Sharlet, that included a photo and read: ""Tonight in Wisconsin. First the anti-Black Lives Matter flag flew outside his rallies, then beside the American flag. Now it has replaced the American flag. That’s significant.""  Alongside the screenshot, the Facebook post read: ""Trump flew the anti-Black Lives Matter flag at his rally in Wisconsin. So much for not disrespecting the troops …"" The post in question was shared by a group called ""The Other 98%"" -- a left-leaning nonprofit, according to its bio on Facebook -- the day after the rally. The post has been shared more than 2,500 additional times and reacted to by more than 7,200 people. This post was flagged as a part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So was the flag really flying behind Trump during his Waukesha rally?  And is it an ""anti-Black Lives Matter"" flag? In a review of photos of the Oct. 24, 2020 Waukesha rally taken by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Thin Blue Line flag is hung prominently behind the risers behind behind the podium where Trump spoke. The flag was featured very prominently at the rally -- a change from the last several Wisconsin rallies that Trump has held in other cities.  In Janesville on Oct. 17, 2020, the flag was featured on one side of the stage, while a larger American flag was featured on the other side of the stage, photos from the Journal Sentinel showed. In Mosinee on Sept. 17, 2020, Trump spoke in front of Air Force One and no flags were prominently displayed, according to photos by the Journal Sentinel.  So the portion of the post that says that the flag was featured prominently -- and more prominently than at earlier rallies -- is on the money. But what about the meaning of the flag?  The flag has been popularized by the company ""Thin Blue Line USA,"" which also sells clothing emblazoned with the symbol. According to the company’s website, the flag is meant to be a sign for ""promoting compassion and support for our nation’s police officers.""  The company began marketing the flag in 2014 amid the Blue Lives Matter movement, which itself was launched in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.  The Black Lives Matter movement arose in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida, according to the movement’s website. Black Lives Matter has been invoked around the country this year during massive protests that were launched by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. In a June 8, 2020, article by The Marshall Project headlined ""The Short, Fraught History of the ‘Thin Blue Line’ American Flag,"" Andrew Johnson, president of Thin Blue Line USA said: ""The flag has no association with racism, hatred, bigotry. It’s a flag to show support for law enforcement—no politics involved."" According to the article: Jacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests—an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper’s—but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online. ""That’s maybe why it came to my eyes,"" he said. Whatever the intended meaning of the flag, it has come to carry different connotations to different people At protests in Charlottesville in 2017, where white supremacist groups and supporters gathered to protest the removal of Confederate statues throughout the country, the blue-line flag was featured alongside Confederate flags, according to an Aug. 18, 2017 report from USA TODAY. (The company disavowed its use in Charlottesville) A July 31, 2020 NPR report highlighted a fight between a Massachusetts fire department flying the flags in honor of fallen police officers, and community members who felt the flag was an overt display of racism. A June 9. 2020 Politico report said even police officers have mixed reactions to the symbol, with some departments banning it outright, while others display it on government-owned vehicles. The Politico report also noted that the flag is controversial because of its likeness to the American flag, and because of the U.S. Flag Code, which states: ""The (American) flag should never have placed upon it, nor any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature.""  When asked why the flag was placed behind the president, Wisconsin Trump Victory --  the state’s Trump campaign group -- did not respond.  To be sure, it is possible to support police officers and the Black Lives Matter movement. But Trump himself has been harshly critical of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, labeling them as violent and claiming they were stoked by anti-government elements.  A Facebook post claims an ""anti-Black Lives Matter"" flag replaced the American flag behind Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally. To be sure, the flag itself violates the U.S. Flag Code, and should not be considered a legitimate U.S. flag by those standards.  In terms of the Facebook claim, The image and description -- that the flag has taken on greater prominence at the Trump rallies in Wisconsin -- is on target. And the Thin Blue Line flag has become a prominent part of the pro-police Blue Lives Matter movement -- which arose to counter the Blak Lives Matter movement. That said, while it is possible to support both, Trump has made clear he opposes the Black Lives Matter protests -- and made that opposition, and a strong law-and-order message, a prominent part of his re-election campaign. So, those attending the rally or seeing the images could easily see the flag as an ""anti Black Lives Matter flag."" We rate the claim Mostly True.    ","[('Facebook post by The Other 98%, October 25, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/TheOther98/photos/a.115969958413991/5407943995883201'), ('Tweet by Jeff Sharlet, October 24, 2020', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Donald Trump continues Wisconsin push, hoping he can replicate 2016 formula,"" Oct. 24, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/JeffSharlet/status/1320189238214799360'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Trump tells thousands in Janesville that Wisconsin is key to winning ‘the whole ball game,’"" Oct. 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Donald Trump tears into Joe Biden in return visit to Wisconsin,"" Sept. 17, 2020', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/24/donald-trump-continues-wisconsin-push-saturday-rally-waukesha/6021636002/'), ('Thin Blue Line USA, About page, Oct. 26, 2020', 'No link'), ('USA TODAY, ""‘Thin Blue Line’: What does an American flag with a blue line mean?""

Upton voted a dozen times in support of repealing the Affordable Care Act
","Jon Hoadley, a Democrat seeking to represent western Michigan’s 6th congressional district, is attacking his Republican opponent, Rep. Fred Upton, for his voting record on health care. ""He voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,"" an ad from Hoadley states. The basis of Hoadley’s attack is Upton’s consistent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which barred insurance companies from discriminating — in pricing and coverage — against people with preexisting medical conditions, such as cancer survivors and kids with diabetes as Hoadley’s ad notes. The ACA also introduced federal subsidies for Americans to buy coverage in the individual insurance market and for states to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income Americans. In 2019, more than 500,000 Michiganders were covered under plans purchased in the individual market, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. And today, a little more than 800,000 are covered under the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. A repeal or overturning of the ACA, and the loss of its protections, would put that coverage at risk, experts say. In the five years that followed the ACA’s passage, Upton voted 12 times for bills, budget resolutions and amendments that called for repealing the law.  More recently, Upton has spoken out against Republican efforts to repeal the ACA without a replacement. ""You simply cannot take what would be millions of people off coverage without a backup plan ready to go,"" he told The Detroit News in April 2019. That month, he was one of only eight Republicans who supported a resolution urging the Trump administration to end its effort to overturn the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month on a case supported by the administration asking the court to invalidate the law. Hoadley’s claim includes recovered COVID-19 patients among those whose coverage would be at risk, but Upton’s votes to repeal the ACA came years before the pandemic.  Upton spokesperson Josh Paciorek said, ""Fred believes we must forge a bipartisan path to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable care while always protecting preexisting conditions."" Nonetheless, Hoadley’s ad gives an accurate count of Upton’s votes from 2011 to 2015 and their potential impact.  The Hoadley ad cites 12 times that Upton voted to repeal or defund the ACA. Here's how they break down: Under the ACA, millions of Americans buy their health insurance through the individual market or receive coverage through the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid. If the law is repealed or struck down by the Supreme Court, many could face higher costs for health insurance, lose automatic coverage or become unable to afford coverage. A New York Times analysis says as many as 21 million people would be at risk of becoming uninsured. They would also lose protection under ACA provisions that bar discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions. President Donald Trump’s executive orders pledging to preserve these protections have no legal effect, experts say. About 54 million Americans had a preexisting condition in 2018 that would likely leave them uninsurable in the individual insurance market if the ACA were repealed, according to a 2019 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That includes 29% — just over 1.7 million — of Michiganders under 65.  The implementation of the ACA’s major protections helped insure thousands of Michiganders in the individual market soon after Upton cast his first vote to repeal the law in 2011.  By the time the preexisting condition protections kicked in in 2014, Upton had voted to repeal the ACA four times and supported three budget resolutions that assumed savings from the law’s repeal.  Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said that votes cast before 2014 may not have led to immediate coverage losses. But she said Congress relies on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that measure the impact of legislation over the next 10 years.  In 2014, nearly 550,000 Michiganders were insured by plans purchased in the individual market, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, up 74,600 from the previous year. The number was 511,700 last year. In mid-2014, Michigan’s expanded Medicaid program covered roughly 58,000. Today, it covers more than 800,000.  An analysis this year from the nonpartisan Center for American Progress estimates that repealing the ACA would result in 827,000 Michiganders losing their insurance. A Hoadley ad states that Upton ""voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,"" citing his votes to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act. Four of those votes were for legislation that would have repealed the law. The eight other votes cited by the campaign laid the groundwork for repealing the ACA, but would have required additional action from lawmakers. Repealing the ACA would have jeopardized health coverage for Michiganders covered under plans purchased in the individual market and the state’s Medicaid expansion program.

Trump wrong about auto plant coming to North Carolina
","To hear President Trump tell it, North Carolina just landed a major automaker. In a speech at the White House on Labor Day, Trump said North Carolina is getting one of ""many auto plants"" being built. He suggested it again during a speech in Michigan on Sept. 10. And then Oct. 15, Trump declared it again before a television audience of more than 10 million people. ""The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan and to Ohio and to South Carolina and North Carolina — just today,"" Trump said during an NBC Town Hall. So what is Trump talking about? Is a major auto plant or an auto manufacturer coming to North Carolina? Not that we could find.  The Washington Post looked into Trump’s claims from Labor Day. The Center for Automotive Research couldn’t substantiate Trump’s statement for the Post, which gave his claim Four Pinocchios.  Inside the state, North Carolina is known for pursuing automakers — and losing out to South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. As recently as Sept. 15, the Triangle Business Journal reported that North Carolina is still chasing its first full fledged car assembly plant. By TBJ’s count, North Carolina missed out on ElectraMeccanica in September, as well as Toyota-Mazda, Peugeot, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz — all since 2015. WRAL TechWire reported that North Carolina’s industrial leaders also recruited Tesla, which picked Texas earlier this year. The trend has not gone unnoticed. ""We've wondered about why North Carolina gets onto finalist lists, only to come up short,"" Miami University professor James Rubenstein, a leading auto industry researcher, told PolitiFact for a separate story. TBJ reports that North Carolina is under consideration for an Indian SUV maker. However, that project is on hold amid the pandemic. PolitiFact North Carolina reached out to the state’s Department of Commerce about Trump’s claim. ""We have not recruited an assembly plant since 2017, although North Carolina offers several attractive sites for such a plant and we’re actively in the hunt,"" David Rhoades, the department’s communications director, said in an email. Rhoades noted that truck maker Freightliner and school bus maker Thomas Built Buses, both part of Germany’s Daimler AG, have locations in North Carolina that are considered automotive assembly operations. However, they predate Trump’s administration.  And while North Carolina has not landed a major car company of late, Rhoades said the state has successfully recruited manufacturers of auto components.  He provided a spreadsheet showing a total of 44 auto-related manufacturers that have expanded operations in North Carolina since 2019. In 2017, Tristone Flowtech announced 300 jobs in Iredell County and Triangle Tyre announced an 800-job expansion in Edgecombe County. Sonic Automotive announced 500 jobs in Gaston County in 2018, and Bharat Forge Aluminum announced 300 jobs in Lee County last year. Still, none of those projects live up to the size of Trump’s claim. And neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to our requests for clarification. President Trump recently said an auto ""company"" or an auto ""plant"" has opened or would be opening in North Carolina. This claim stands out in a state that has aggressively pursued automakers, but has so far fallen short. That’s because it’s not true. Trump’s teams haven’t backed up his claims. Fact checkers can’t find evidence for them. And North Carolina’s Department of Commerce isn’t aware of any new, major automaker opening a plant in the state. We rate this claim false.","[('Video, ""Donald Trump holds a Labor Day press conference,"" posted Sept. 7, 2020.', 'https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-white-house-september-7-2020'), ('Video, ""Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Freeland, Michigan,"" posted Sept. 10, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Video, ""Donald Trump Town Hall with voters,"" posted Oct. 15, 2020.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNdnDByTTi0&feature=emb_logo'), ('Email correspondence with David Rhoades, communications director for the North Carolina Department of Commerce.', 'No link'), ('Story by PolitiFact, ""As auto industry plateaus, Donald Trump touts car plants that don’t exist,"" posted Oct. 22, 2020.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5yUnUxpr_g&feature=youtu.be&t=2235'), ('Story by the Washington Post, ""Trump keeps bragging about imaginary auto plants in swing states,"" posted Sept. 10, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Stories by the Triangle Business Journal, ""Rejected again: North Carolina misses out on another automaker,"" posted Sept. 15, 2020; ""With goal of landing big-time automaker, NC has been down this path before,"" posted Aug. 12, 2019;\xa0', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/22/donald-trump-touts-car-plants-dont-exist/'), ('Story by WRAL TechWire, ""NC loses another auto plant: Tesla picks Austin for new factory, 5,000 jobs,"" posted July 23, 2020.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/oct/28/donald-trump/trump-wrong-about-auto-plant-coming-north-carolina/

Fact-checking Trump’s claim that Biden said he would ‘abolish the entire U.S. oil industry’
","President Donald Trump told supporters at a rally in Allentown that Joe Biden wants to dismantle the country’s oil and gas industry, a move he warned would have devastating consequences for Pennsylvania families. ""Joe Biden confirmed his plan to abolish the entire U.S. oil industry,"" Trump said at the first of three rallies he held in Pennsylvania on Monday. ""That means no fracking jobs and no energy for Pennsylvania."" Biden has said repeatedly that he won’t ban fracking, the controversial drilling technique used to extract natural gas from miles beneath the Earth’s surface. (He does intend to stop new fracking on public lands.) But his vision for the oil industry hasn’t gotten as much attention. Trump’s characterization of Biden’s position is vastly oversimplified, and he’s suggesting Biden doubled down on a stance he never took in the first place. Biden wants to reduce the country’s reliance on oil by investing heavily in renewable energy, and he plans to pay for part of that investment by ending federal subsidies for oil companies. He doesn’t want to wipe out the oil industry as Trump claimed. In fact, some oil executives have cheered Biden’s support for the development of technology that captures greenhouse gas emissions before they reach the atmosphere, allowing companies to safely burn fossil fuel for years to come. Biden’s stance on oil was thrown into question after the presidential debate on Oct. 22, when he said he wants to gradually ease the country’s reliance on fossil fuels. Here’s an excerpt of the former vice president’s exchange with Trump on the debate stage. ""Would you close down the oil industry?"" Trump asked ""By the way, I would transition from the oil industry, yes,"" Biden said. ""Oh, that’s a big statement,"" Trump said. Biden stumbled over his words as he tried to explain his position — that he wants the country to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy over time, and that he wants to end federal subsidies for oil companies. After the debate, he again stressed his interest in eliminating subsidies in interviews with reporters. But the Trump campaign saw an opening and quickly declared that voters would abandon him in swing states where Biden has led for months. Biden’s position on oil has been clear since he released his clean energy plan in July. The document details Biden’s stance on oil subsidies, his support for renewable energy, and his interest in developing technology to capture greenhouse gas emissions, as well as his plan to limit oil companies' methane pollution, ban new drilling on public lands and beneath public waters, and set new fuel economy standards that would reduce U.S. oil consumption by 12 billion barrels. Trump said Biden wants to ""abolish the entire U.S. oil industry."" He’s oversimplifying Biden’s nuanced position — and baselessly saying Biden confirmed that oversimplification. Biden wants to eliminate federal subsidies for oil companies and use that money to invest in renewable energy. Plus, Biden supports the development of carbon capture technology that could help oil companies stay in business. Trump’s statement is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Sen. Thom Tillis flip-flops on filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year
","When it comes to appointing Supreme Court justices, Thom Tillis is one of many Republican senators accused of flip-flopping. Tillis and 51 others voted Monday night to appoint Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. The seat opened after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 18. Barrett’s appointment comes eight days before Election Day, and four years after the Senate refused to hold a vote for a judge nominated by President Barack Obama. In 2016, Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. So has Tillis flip-flopped on the issue of confirming Supreme Court justices? Let’s put his comments, then and now, through the Flip-O-Meter.  To be clear: the Flip-O-Meter doesn’t measure whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. It merely measures whether a politician has been consistent in his or her stated views. Tillis isn’t the first Senator to have his position on Supreme Court appointments examined. PolitiFact found that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have each flip-flopped on the issue. Tillis was one of several senators who claimed that, because it was an election year, the Senate should wait for Americans to vote in the election before moving forward with Obama’s nominee. On Feb. 23, 2016, Tillis and 10 other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed a letter to Senate Leader Mitch McConnell that explained their position. The first two lines say: ""As we write, we are in the midst of a great national debate over the course our country will take in the coming years. The Presidential election is well underway. Americans have already begun to cast their votes."" They noted that it had been more than 80 years since the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year, and concluded by saying they intended to withhold a vote ""to ensure the American people are not deprived of the opportunity to engage in a full and robust debate over the type of jurist they wish to decide some of the most critical issues of our time."" Tillis reaffirmed this stance on multiple occasions. On the Senate floor on Feb. 26 of that year, Tillis started his speech this way: ""Our nation is in the midst of a presidential election in which the american people are currently deciding who will be their next commander-in-chief. In my home state of north carolina, many voters have already submitted their absentee ballots and early voting will begin soon."" He then referred to Vice President Joe Biden’s hypothetical remarks from 28 years ago, old comments in saying the Senate shouldn’t confirm a nominee during an election year:  ""Vice President Biden’s remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable in 2016. The campaign is already underway. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of the republic not to launch our nation into a partisan divisive confirmation ballot during the same time the American people are casting ballots to elect our next president. Vice President Biden -- and this is not something I’ve said very often -- Vice President Biden was absolutely right."" In a statement a couple weeks later, Tillis reiterated his position and emphasized that the country is ""in the middle of a presidential election."" He made similar remarks that March at a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference and in an op-ed for USA Today that August, when he said: ""Voters — not a lame-duck president — should decide the composition of the highest court in the land."" Tillis reaffirmed his position even after Trump was elected. Asked by an MSNBC News host in March 2017 if he regretted how he treated Garland’s nomination, Tillis said no. ""No I don’t. I think that we were at a point in time in the election cycle where we were already past primaries on the Republican side and it’s a principle that I embraced as a new member of the Senate that I will consistently uphold regardless of whether the tables are turned.  I think we were in a situation where it would have been hyper politicized. It would've become a circus here and I think that was a good reason to wait to hear the vote of the people."" We reached out to the Tillis campaign and asked if Tillis has changed his position from 2016.  Tillis spokesman Andrew Romeo argued that the Senator has been consistent. He said there are two key differences between 2016 and 2020, which Tillis noted in his statement after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death: Garland's nomination came during a ""divided government,"" meaning the White House was controlled by Democrats and the Senate was controlled by Republicans. Garland's nomination came while President Obama was a ""lame-duck,"" meaning he couldn’t be reelected the following year. Those differences, however, have not been consistently cited by Tillis when he explained his 2016 position.  While a divided government was mentioned in the letter Tillis and the other Republicans sent to McConnell, he didn’t cite it as a primary reason in his subsequent speech on the Senate floor, the USA Today op-ed or even his MSNBC interview in 2017. Furthermore, PolitiFact has previously found this particular argument to be a weak one.  The argument that Obama was an outgoing president and Trump could serve another term is flawed, since it’s possible that Trump also won’t serve another term. And the excuses don’t erase the simple fact that Tillis said one thing in 2016 and did something dramatically different this year. Tillis in 2016 argued that the Senate shouldn’t confirm a Supreme Court nominee during an election year, and he repeatedly noted that voting was already underway. To argue that Tillis has been consistent on this issue, the campaign cherry-picks his comments from four years ago to obscure the senator’s lead argument -- which was that voting had already started and voters deserved a voice in the appointment. In 2016, Tillis made his argument during the presidential primaries. In 2020, he ignored that argument even though the General Election had already started in North Carolina when Ginsburg died.  (Ginsburg died on Sept. 18, and the North Carolina State Board of Elections had already started mailing absentee ballots to people on Sept. 4) Tillis completely changed his position on whether voters should have a say in Supreme Court vacancies that occur during an election year. He’s done a`Full Flop.","[('PolitiFact stories, ""Is there a \'Biden Rule\' on Supreme Court nominations in a presidential election year?"" posted Sept. 21, 2020; ""Sen.

Jacob's charge that McMurray raised taxes on Grand Island is correct
","In a rematch between Rep. Chris Jacobs, a Republican, and Democrat Nate McMurray for the 27th Congressional District seat, Jacobs says his opponent has a track record of raising taxes and a desire to do so again.  In a large postcard sent to voters, the Jacobs campaign links McMurray with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of Queens and says: ""Nate McMurray Big Tax, Big Spend: An AOC Progressive Who Will Raise Taxes.""  The mailer claims that ""While serving as Town Supervisor, Nate McMurray voted to raise taxes on homeowners.""  We were curious about McMurray’s record on Grand Island, where he served as supervisor for four years, beginning in 2016.  We spoke with McMurray, who confirmed that as a member of the town board on Grand Island, he voted to slightly increase taxes. He also proposed budgets, as supervisor, with slight tax increases, he said.  During all four years of his tenure, the increases remained under the property tax cap, he said. He also said that he was one of five people on the board, where Republicans held the other four seats.  ""I had no control to raise taxes myself,"" he said.  Taxes increased about $27 in 2018 for a house assessed at $210,600. The tax rate for the general fund, which makes up a large amount of town spending, decreased by 3.1%, but an increase in the sewer district tax led to the increase. The 20% of residents without sewer access generally did not have an increase.  The town’s official meeting minutes of the board session with the budget vote show that McMurray voted in favor of the increase. McMurray said he sometimes had to fight to keep the increases from getting too high during negotiations with other board members. ""I’m one of five, and everybody has their pet thing.""  In the 2019 budget, adopted in late 2018, the tax levy, or the amount raised in taxes, increased by 28% on Grand Island for the sewer system fund, though overall levy increase was 2.63 percent. Rates increased only for people using the sewer system and went down for those who do not. The combined levy for the general and highway funds fell by 4%. McMurray voted in favor of this budget.  The town's sewer system needed costly repairs, and a prior administration reached a deal with the state Department of Environmental Conservation, McMurray said. It was his administration's obligation to fund them, he said, a statement supported by a 2017 outside auditor's report.  The general fund tax rate was lower when he left office than it was during his first year, but that is not true of all of the funds that tax residents.  McMurray said that the mailer makes it seem like he was recklessly raising taxes as supervisor. ""It’s acting like we’re willy-nilly raising taxes,"" he said. ""Sure, there was a moderate increase under the tax cap."" McMurray has campaigned on his fiscal management of Grand Island, including a claim from 2018, in which he said he was a ""small-town supervisor who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had."" PolitiFact rated that claim True.  Jacobs said McMurray voted to raise taxes on homeowners while he was town supervisor on Grand Island.  McMurray said that he raised taxes slightly while he was supervisor, which is corroborated by other documents. He also said that he couldn’t do anything unilaterally, and that he was a member of a five-member board.  We rate Jacobs’ claim True.

""China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud,"" said Wood, a Donald Trump supporter who was banned from Twitter for promoting conspiracy theories about the election. A video with the audio clip was posted on Rumble, an alternative to YouTube that’s popular with conservatives. From there it made its way to Facebook, where it was flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration at the Capitol, we’ve seen several claims that China interfered in the election. My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, who recently met with Trump at the White House, told Axios that the country used machines from Dominion Voting Systems to do it. Those claims are not based in fact. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. There is no credible evidence that voter fraud affected Biden’s win.  Here’s how we know that: Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process.  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its election partners called the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history."" Former Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud. Not one of the 62 lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed in state and federal courts proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome. In Wood’s interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show, during which he also falsely claimed that COVID-19 is akin to the flu and a biological weapon, he cited John Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence. In a Jan. 7 memo, Ratcliffe wrote that a classified assessment recently completed by the intelligence community undersold the extent to which China interfered in the 2020 election The memo cited a report from Barry Zulauf, analytic ombudsman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — a position tasked with upholding the objectivity of reports from the intelligence community. That report described a ""widespread perception in the workforce about politicization"" of information about foreign election interference. Ratcliffe wrote that, in his view, intelligence analysts were treating similar actions from Russia and China differently. But he didn’t ""confirm"" any reports that China orchestrated voter fraud in the U.S., as Wood claimed. In a rumor control page on its website, CISA said that bad actors would not be able to change election results without being caught. Dominion, a voting technology company that was targeted by disinformation after the election, said on its website that it has no ties to the Chinese government. A statewide audit and hand recount in Georgia, which used Dominion technology, upheld the original machine vote tally. We reached out to Wood for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. His claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Norway deaths after COVID-19 shot were among very frail elderly, not proved to be caused by vaccine
","As countries around the world begin COVID-19 inoculations, vaccine critics are promoting the notion that the shots can easily cause injury or death — even though the evidence does not support their claims. That’s what happened after Norway reported the deaths of elderly people who had received the COVID-19 vaccine.  Social media posts, like this one from Fox News commentator Jan Morgan, point to the Norway deaths as evidence that the vaccine causes harm: ""23 die within hours of taking COVID vaccine. ... I’ve never taken a flu shot and I’m certainly NOT letting anyone inject this garbage in to my body."" Morgan’s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Initial Norwegian reports on Jan. 15 indicated that 23 people had died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. By Jan. 18, the number of deaths had increased to 33, out of about 48,000 vaccinated. Though the Facebook post says people died ""within hours"" of receiving the vaccine, Norwegian authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate the time frame for the remaining 10 deaths.  The Norwegian government said the country’s vaccination program is initially targeting the most vulnerable — the elderly and those in nursing homes — and ""a high proportion"" of the latter were very frail or terminally ill and already very near the end of their lives. As a result, health authorities said, ""It is expected that deaths close to the time of vaccination may occur."" There’s no proof that the COVID-19 vaccines caused the deaths, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said. Norway’s strong ""reporting culture"" for vaccine adverse reactions means that ""health care professionals have a low threshold for reporting possible adverse reactions, even when the causal relationships appear very unclear,"" a government report said.  An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, according to the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Therefore, ""it is not a given that this represents any excess mortality or that there is a causal connection,"" Camilla Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said at a press conference on Jan. 18. The COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly but rely on scientific research that is decades old, and they underwent a rigorous review process, PolitiFact has reported. That hasn’t prevented a barrage of misinformation about them, including claims that they can cause death and infertility and that they are part of a plan to implant people with microchips — claims that have all been debunked by PolitiFact. U.S. health experts were aware of the possibility that deaths following vaccination would be perceived as being caused by the vaccine. Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a member of the U.S. federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said in December that the likelihood of nursing home patients dying from other causes shortly after vaccination could erode public confidence in the safety of the vaccines. She said that’s why she voted against prioritizing residents of long-term care facilities for vaccines.  However, residents and staff of long-term care facilities in the U.S. are among the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. They represent 40% of COVID-19 deaths nationwide, though they make up less than 1% of the U.S. population. Other members of the advisory committee voted to include nursing home residents in the earliest phase. Of the 33 Norwegians who died after receiving the vaccine, 13 of their cases have been completely assessed by health authorities. The 13 people were all older than 80, with some older than 90, and were considered severely frail, which was defined as having serious heart failure, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and similar conditions.  As of Jan. 18, Norway had vaccinated more than 48,000 people, the majority of whom were nursing home residents. The 33 fatalities represent fewer than 1 out of 1,000 of those who were vaccinated, Steinar Madsen, the medical director of Norwegian Medicines Agency, told Bloomberg.  For some of the frailest patients, though, ""the possibility that relatively mild side effects of the vaccine could have serious consequences cannot be ruled out,"" health officials said. Common vaccine reactions — including fever, nausea and diarrhea — could have contributed to some of the deaths in the 13 cases for which investigations have been completed.  ""There is a possibility that these common adverse reactions, that are not dangerous in fitter, younger patients and are not unusual with vaccines, may aggravate underlying disease in the elderly,"" Madsen told the medical journal BMJ. ""We are not alarmed or worried about this, because these are very rare occurrences and they occurred in very frail patients with very serious disease."" The risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for much older people are not as well understood, because a limited number of people 85 and older participated in the large clinical trials. Madsen said Norwegian officials are now recommending careful medical evaluation of the very frail before deciding whether vaccination is appropriate. A Facebook post says, ""23 people die within hours of taking the COVID vaccine. ... I’ve never taken a flu shot and I’m certainly NOT letting anyone inject this garbage in to my body."" The claim implies the deaths were caused by the vaccine. Norway health officials said 33 elderly people died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. (The initial figure of 23 was later updated.) But the vaccine has not been proved to be the cause of death, and those who died were very frail nursing home residents with serious underlying illnesses. The Facebook post says people died ""within hours"" of getting the vaccine, but authorities said only that 23 deaths occurred within six days of vaccination, and published reports do not indicate when the other 10 deaths occurred. An average of 45 people die each day in Norwegian nursing homes and similar institutions, so it is not clear that the deaths represent any excess mortality or a connection to the vaccine. Because it lacks important context and misrepresents when the deaths occured, we rate this post Mostly False.","[('Bloomberg, ""Norway moves to calm vaccine anxiety after elderly deaths,"" Jan. 18, 2021', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/norway-finds-no-direct-link-between-elderly-deaths-and-vaccine'), ('Bloomberg, ""What to know about vaccine-linked deaths, allergies,"" Jan. 18, 2021', 'No link'), ('BMJ, ""Covid-19: Norway investigates 23 deaths in frail elderly patients after vaccination,"" Jan. 15, 2021', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/what-to-know-about-vaccine-related-deaths-allergies-quicktake'), ('Facebook post, Jan. 17, 2021', 'No link'), ('Faktisk, ""Too soon to say whether 23 Norwegians died because of the COVID-19 vaccine,"" Jan. 19, 2021', 'https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n149'), ('Kaiser Health News, ""What seniors can expect when COVID vaccines begin to roll out,"" Dec. 9, 2020', 'No link'), ('Norwegian Institute of Public Health, ""International interest about deaths following coronavirus vaccination,"" Jan. 19, 2021', 'https://www.facebook.com/janmorganhomepage/posts/10218047459729155'), ('Norwegian Medicines Agency, ""COVID-19 vaccination associated with adverse drug reactions in elederly people who are frail,"" Jan. 15, 2021', 'No link'), ('Norwegian Medicines Agency, ""Reported suspected adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccines,"" Jan. 15, 2021', 'https://www.faktisk.no/artikler/1wY/too-soon-to-say-whether-23-norwegians-died-because-of-the-covid-19-vaccine'), ('Norwegian Medicines Agency, ""Weekly report on suspected adverse drug reactions to coronavirus vaccines,"" Jan. 14, 2021', 'No link'), ('NPR, ""Health care workers, nursing home residents to be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccine,"" Dec. 1, 2020', 'https://khn.org/news/what-seniors-can-expect-when-covid-vaccines-begin-to-roll-out/'), ('PolitiFact, ""8 facts and 4 unknowns about the coronavirus vaccines,"" Dec. 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Vaccine misinformation: preparing for infodemic’s ‘second wave,’"" Dec. 21, 2020', 'https://www.fhi.no/en/news/2021/international-interest-about-deaths-following-coronavirus-vaccination/'), ('Washington Post, ""Health-care workers and nursing home residents should be the first to get coronavirus vaccines, CDC advisory group says,"" Dec. 3, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2021/jan/19/facebook-posts/norway-deaths-after-covid-19-shot-were-among-very-/

Bans on animal ag and gas-powered cars not on the Biden agenda
","Throughout president-elect Joe Biden’s campaign, Republicans in Iowa and nationally made claims about what a Biden presidency could do to the agriculture and energy sectors — both important industries for Iowa’s workforce and economy. At the Republican National Convention in August, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, claimed that Biden would end animal agriculture as we know it. ""The Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing the so-called Green New Deal. If given power they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars,"" Ernst said on Aug. 26. At an October campaign rally in Des Moines, President Donald Trump accused Biden of supporting policies that would eliminate gas-powered cars. ""One of the most important issues for Iowa is the whole thing that happened with ethanol, they were killing ethanol, and Joe Biden has vowed to abolish fossil fuels, he supports all of the outside… This crusade to eliminate gas powered cars…"" Trump said on Oct. 14. Trump also weighed in on the banning-animal-agriculture theme, at a Wisconsin campaign rally on Sept. 17, when he said the New Green Deal would ban cattle. PolitiFact called that claim false when it was made. Biden takes over the presidency from Trump on Wednesday, Jan. 20, so PolitiFact Iowa took a look at whether or not these accusations about him, specifically, have a chance to be true.  Ernst campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa that the Green New Deal resolution calls for removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation and agricultural sectors. ""How does one completely remove greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation and agriculture sectors without virtually banning animal ag and gas-powered cars?"" Conley wrote. The Biden-Harris climate plan says ""the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."" The plan’s written statement continues: ""It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected."" However, Biden has not endorsed the controversial Green New Deal legislation that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., introduced in the House in February 2019, Christina Freundlich, an Iowa spokesperson for the Joe Biden campaign, said. While he has said he agrees with the legislation’s principles, his position paper for dealing with the environment does not adopt key details found in the legislation, a look at his position shows.  Biden also has not endorsed a resolution introduced in the House in May 2019 by U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., which says the Green New Deal is ""antithetical to the principles of free market capitalism and private property rights.""  During a March 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate between Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a strong supporter of the Green New Deal, Biden said, ""We both agree that we … have to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity. We disagree on the details of how we do it, but we don’t disagree on the principle.""  Rob Jackson, an earth system science professor at Stanford University, examined strengths and weaknesses of the Green New Deal in a March 2019 report with other Stanford environmental experts. Jackson said the claim that eliminating greenhouse emissions would lead to the elimination of animal agriculture — which Ernst said the Green New Deal would do — is unfounded.  ""There are multiple ways of addressing that … obviously people could eat less red meat, but there are also feed additives that scientists are studying that cut methane emissions but don’t appear to reduce the productivity of the cattle,"" Jackson said in a PolitiFact Iowa interview. ""Unless there’s something more that they’re pointing to, I think that this statement that they’re planning to ban animal agriculture is ridiculous."" But, Biden’s climate plan agrees with Green New Deal basic principles such as creating jobs in clean energy and infrastructure and investing money into underserved communities that are hit hardest by the changing climate. The Green New Deal resolution calls for net-zero global carbon emissions by 2050, as does Biden’s climate plan. Implementing the Green New Deal would cost about $10 trillion but Biden says he plans to spend $2 trillion on combating climate change.  Biden’s written plan for rural America says he would expand the federal Conservation Stewardship Program created by former U.S. Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, in 2007 to support farm income by providing payments based on farmers’ conservation practices, like sequestering carbon and planting cover crops.  Those in agriculture point out that they can adapt to federal policies. Benjamin Riensche, 59, owner of the Blue Diamond Farming Company in Jesup, Iowa, said farmers and climate activists have the same goals but the language they use doesn’t align. ""Because our farm is forward-thinking, we are ready to adopt whatever policy says,"" Riensche, a registered Republican, said.  Dal Grooms, communications director for the Iowa Pork Producers Association, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa that her organization will ""work with elected leaders from any party in achieving conditions that best serve our members."" Grooms said she would not comment directly on any claim made by Ernst. ""Iowa pig farmers are focused on their everyday work that is an economic engine for rural Iowa. Their industry creates 147,105 jobs in Iowa and generates $40.8 billion in sales. The Iowa Pork Producers Association will work on both the state and national level to ensure pig farmers can continue to operate in a sustainable and socially responsible manner,"" Grooms wrote. Both Ernst and Trump claimed during their campaigns that Biden would eliminate the use of gas-powered cars. To back Ernst’s claim, Conley referred to a Fox News interview with Patrick Moore, who bills himself as a co-founder of Greenpeace, an independent campaigning organization that promotes sustainability and conservation. Greenpeace says he is not a co-founder. Moore said in the March 2019 interview the Green New Deal would ""lead to the end of civilization"" because of its call for phasing out coal and nuclear power. Travis Nichols, Greenpeace media director, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa that ""Patrick Moore does not represent Greenpeace. He is a paid lobbyist, not an independent source. His statements about the Green New Deal, which is an inspiring vision for climate action commensurate with the scale of the problem, have nothing to do with Greenpeace’s positions and should not be reported as such."" Nichols went on to write that Moore often uses his ""long-ago affiliation with Greenpeace"" to gain legitimacy in the news media. Moore worked at Greenpeace from 1971 to 1986. Trump claimed at an Iowa campaign rally that Biden ""vowed to abolish fossil fuels."" Biden’s sustainable infrastructure plan says he would build on an existing proposal in the Senate, called Clean Cars for America, and offer Americans rebates for swapping old, less-efficient vehicles for newer cars manufactured in the U.S. The plan also would place limits on corporations’ use of methane. The Green New Deal resolution calls for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in— zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing…"" The Green New Deal resolution calls for working toward emissions-free vehicles, but it is unlikely that the legislation would ban gas-powered cars, and given Biden’s written proposal, it is unlikely Biden would lead an initiative to ban gas-powered vehicles. We’ve concluded that Ernst’s and Trump’s claims that Biden would eliminate animal agriculture and gas powered cars if elected president aren’t true because Biden has never endorsed the Green New Deal legislation as written. And, while Biden says he agrees with some basic principles of the legislation, the resolution would not eliminate animal agriculture or gas-powered cars. Our ruling is False.

Barack Obama wasn’t arrested before Biden’s inauguration
","A conspiracy theory linked to QAnon is using footage from 2013 to falsely claim former President Barack Obama is behind bars. In a video published Jan. 17, Gage Nelson, host of the conservative podcast America Divided, said: ""Barack Obama was arrested."" ""With over 30,000 National Guard troops in DC, the rumor on the street is that, on Jan. 20, many people are going to jail,"" he said. ""Now there’s a video of Barack Obama in a jail cell.""

The Obamas visited the former prison in June 2013. Watch for yourself below: Unproven claims that Democrats will be arrested in the lead-up to Joe Biden’s inauguration have circulated on social media over the past few weeks.

Trump spokesman falsely claims Trump ‘can’t say anything’ on Capitol riot without social media
","Former Trump campaign and White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley falsely claimed that President Donald Trump cannot speak out against the violent breaching of the U.S. Capitol because tech companies have kicked him off their social media platforms. Gidley accused critics of Trump of ""trying to have it both ways"" during a Jan. 17 interview with Fox News host Howard Kurtz, who asked about the president’s conduct on the day of the riot. ""On one hand, he should be censored by Big Tech and not be allowed to talk. He also shouldn't say anything because it's divisive,"" Gidley said. ""And then when he doesn't say anything and can't say anything because the platforms have removed him, they say, 'Where's the President?'""  Gidley’s claim came as tech companies like Twitter and Facebook cracked down on Trump’s and other accounts for spreading misinformation or extremist messages. Twitter permanently suspended Trump’s Twitter account, which had millions of followers, for example. Gidley’s claim also came days after Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. and a staunch defender of the president, wrongly claimed that Republicans had ""no way to communicate"" without Parler, a social media platform targeted to conservatives. PolitiFact rated Nunes’ claim False. PolitiFact reached out to Gidley for comment, but we did not receive a reply. Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication and affiliate professor of history at American University who once worked as a speechwriter, said Gidley’s comments made his jaw drop. ""There's a reason Theodore Roosevelt called the presidency a ‘bully pulpit,’ and that was because of the platform it gave him to communicate with the public and advocate for issues,"" Steinhorn said. ""That was way before television and radio."" Former congressional staffers who spoke to PolitiFact recently described many ways public officials can communicate with the public beyond social media. They can send out press releases or mailers, hold press conferences, and give interviews, to name a few. Steven Thomma, executive director of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said that Trump can appear anytime in the White House briefing room and talk to reporters as he wishes, whether it be outside Marine One or with a smaller group inside the Oval Office. ""His remarks will be covered by the news media in any of those cases, including on camera, as well as streamed live via the White House web page,"" Thomma said. Trump can also sit down or phone in for interviews with major TV networks, mainstream news outlets and local TV and radio stations. Throughout his presidency, Trump regularly appeared for interviews on Fox News shows such as ""Fox & Friends."" ""He can basically pick up the phone and talk to any journalist in the world,"" said Mary E. Stuckey, a professor at Penn State University who specializes in political and presidential rhetoric and political communication. Since Twitter banned Trump’s account on Jan. 8, Trump has delivered remarks in Texas and gaggled with reporters, according to Factba.se, an interactive transcript website that tracks his public statements. He and other officials have put out official White House statements. He also released a five-minute video Jan. 13 discussing the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol, when a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the building in an effort to overturn the election. The House impeached Trump for inciting the insurrection that same day. The video was broadcast to Twitter and Facebook via the White House. Gidley, whose Twitter account remains active, shared it to his followers. (White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s Twitter account is also active, although she did not share the video.) Twitter was founded in 2006. Facebook launched in 2004. But long before those platforms took off, presidents were communicating with the public successfully.  Steinhorn said Gidley’s claim not only shows a ""misunderstanding of the way a president can communicate to the American people,"" but also a ""complete ignorance of our nation’s history."" Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address at a battlefield, Steinhorn said. George Washington wrote his Farewell Address in a letter initially published in a newspaper.

Donald Trump Jr. tweets altered video of Joe Biden event
","With only a few days left before his inauguration, Joe Biden’s detractors are sharing a manipulated video that makes it look like he’s unfit for office. On Jan. 17, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a video that shows the president-elect behind a podium. Biden says goodbye to the audience, then walks to a table and picks up a folder. After standing there for a moment, Biden slowly makes his way off stage. ""Yikes. If he was a Republican the 25th Amendment talk would be trending and rightfully so,"" Trump Jr. said in his tweet. The 25th Amendment outlines ways to handle presidential power if a president is incapacitated. (Screenshot from Twitter) The video has more than 2.8 million views, and we found similar clips published on Facebook. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Twitter labeled Trump Jr.’s video as ""manipulated media."" It was published a few days after the House of Representatives called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare that President Donald Trump is ""unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office."" Online misinformation often tries to falsely portray Biden, 78, as senile and demented. This video is no different. The clip comes from the end of a Jan. 16 event in which Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris announced several members of their White House science team. Biden did not stand around looking confused — the video Trump Jr. shared was edited. The original footage shows Biden making some closing remarks alongside Harris. Another angle shows that, when Biden leaves the podium and stands at the table for a few seconds, he’s waiting for other people to leave the stage. Watch for yourself below: The video Trump Jr. shared does not show anyone else on stage with Biden. It also edits out the sound of people leaving before him. The clip is an example of what the Washington Post calls ""omission,"" or ""editing out large portions from a video and presenting it as a complete narrative, despite missing key elements."" We reached out to the White House for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Trump Jr.’s tweet is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Photographer with man arrested in Capitol siege was not working for CNN or NPR
","A conservative website claimed that a CNN and NPR journalist joined an anti-fascist leader in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The headline of the Gateway Pundit article stated: ""CNN-NPR Photo-Journalist Jade Sacker was Embedded with Antifa Leader John Sullivan During Siege of US Capitol The article, widely shared on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The text of the article refers to Sacker as a CNN photojournalist and later says, ""Sacker has done work for NPR, CNN, NBC and other liberal outlets."" CNN and NPR denied Sacker was working for them during the Capitol attack, and CNN said she has never worked for the network. Sacker said she was there with Sullivan as part of a documentary she is producing about him and his brother James, who is described as a conservative activist. Sacker told the Associated Press her film ""intends to portray the emotional interior of the family’s story as they become divided"" by the brothers’ ""opposing political activism."" There is no evidence Sacker was at the Capitol working for a news organizationworking for a news organization covering the siege. Sullivan has denied having any connection with a broad coalition of left-wing activists known as antifa, and there is no evidence that antifa activists incited the attack. However, Sullivan was arrested in connection with the attack.

Sacker not working for a news organizationfor a news organization at the Capitol Both CNN and NPR said Sacker was not working for them at the Capitol. CNN spokesman Matt Dornic said: ""Jade Sacker was not at the Capitol on our behalf. She does not work for CNN in any capacity and has never been employed by our organization."" NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara said: ""NPR retained Jade Sacker in October of 2020 for a freelance photography assignment. She has not performed any services for NPR since. She was not at the Capitol at our request or on our behalf. If we determine that her actions in any way contributed to the incident at the Capitol, Ms. Sacker will not be engaged by NPR again."" Sacker, who says she is a documentary photographer, lists NPR and CNBC among her clients. She told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check that she is a documentary filmmaker working on a project about Sullivan and his brother, and was alongside Sullivan for much of the riot.  She did not return a call for this fact-check. Sullivan is a Utah resident and the founder of Insurgence USA, an activist group against police brutality, who joined supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol. He has denied any affiliation with antifa, although he has posted related hashtags on his Twitter accounts. There remains no legitimate evidence that the mob at the Capitol was infiltrated or led by antifa activists in disguise. We rated as Mostly False a claim shared on Facebook that Sullivan incited the riot at the Capitol. incited the riot at the Capitol.   On Jan. 15, Sullivan was arrested in connection with the Capitol attack. He was charged with one felony count of interfering with law enforcement in connection with a civil disorder, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.  An affidavit from an FBI agent filed in support of the criminal complaint and arrest warrant noted that, despite Sullivan’s claims that he was present as a journalist, he has no press credentials and is not affiliated with any journalistic organization. The affidavit does not say Sullivan led the mob or had a special role organizing it. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that ""CNN-NPR photojournalist Jade Sacker was embedded with antifa leader"" during the U.S. Capitol attack. Sacker is a freelance photojournalist. CNN said she has never worked for the network. NPR said she once took photos for its network. Both said she was not working for them during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Sacker was with Utah activist John Sullivan inside the Capitol during the attack. She said she was there to work on a documentary about him. Sullivan has denied being connected with antifa and there is no evidence that antifa incited the attack. He was arrested in connection with being inside the U.S. Capitol nine days after the attack.  We rate the statement Mostly False.

No, Marine Corps didn’t rebuff Pelosi’s request for inauguration security
","The Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden is set to have the largest security response of any inauguration in United States history, with over 20,000 National Guard troops deployed to Washington to guard against threats of violence. An article circulating online, meanwhile, claims that the head of the Marine Corps rejected a request from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to use the military branch to help safeguard the inauguration, telling her ""we don’t work for you.""  The Jan. 13 story, published by a website called Real Raw News, quickly began to spread in social media posts. It claims Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, made the comment and added that the Marines only take orders from President Donald Trump. This isn’t true. The Marines confirmed the alleged conversation never took place.  The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For its evidence, the story cites a secret Pentagon source. According to the article, after Pelosi requested that Berger commit 5,000 troops for the inauguration, he supposedly told her: ""Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country? … I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it."" We searched and found zero credible accounts to support such a discussion. Capt. Casey Littesy, communication strategy and operations officer for the Marine Corps, told PolitiFact that the article is ""unequivocally false and inaccurate."" Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, called the story’s claims ""false and absurd."" Berger, along with the highest-ranking officers in the military, released a joint statement Jan. 12 to all members of the armed forces, condemning the attack on the Capitol and reaffirming that Biden will be inaugurated as the 46th president. ""We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection,"" the memo reads.

Fact-checking a top Pa. Republican who said false election claims didn’t play ‘any role’ in the riot
","Pennsylvania Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman said in an interview last week that unproven voter fraud claims didn’t play ""any role"" in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The remark came after Matt Maisel, an anchor for FOX43 in central Pennsylvania, asked the state’s highest-ranking Republican about the violence that occurred when a pro-Trump mob attacked the building and temporarily halted the final counting of elector ballots in President-elect Joe Biden’s win. ""House Democrats yesterday called on state Republicans to accept some responsibility for some of the violence that we saw at the U.S. Capitol last week because of unproven voter fraud claims,"" Maisel said. ""What role do you think that played?"" ""I don’t think it played any role,"" Corman responded. But there’s plenty of evidence that people who traveled to Washington and stormed the Capitol did so because they believed the election was rigged and unfairly stolen from President Donald Trump. He told them so repeatedly. And Corman, like many Republican officials in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, frequently helped advance Trump’s narrative. Asked to provide evidence that supports his claim, Corman spokesperson Jenn Kocher offered none. ""You’re asking me to prove a negative,"" she said. There is no evidence of any widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania’s presidential election. Trump’s campaign itself hasn’t presented any such evidence in its numerous legal challenges contesting the result. Rather, its legal efforts have been aimed at disqualifying votes that all evidence shows were legitimately cast under rules the president and his supporters disagree with. Disputes over those rules were adjudicated in court. The postelection controversy has been stirred by unfounded claims of fraud. For two months, Corman and other Republicans across the country repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of Biden’s win. Some falsely claimed widespread fraud, while others griped about procedural issues, in arguments that courts have struck down. A week after the election, Corman accused Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration of attempting to ""tip the scales"" in Biden’s favor while also acknowledging he had no hard evidence of ""any misdoing."" He later urged Congress to delay certification of the state’s election results, ""to allow due process as we pursue election integrity in our Commonwealth."" The letter Corman sent to Congress repeated several false claims that have been debunked, including that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar encouraged only some counties to help voters fix technical mistakes with their mail ballots and that Republicans in Philadelphia were prohibited from observing workers as they counted ballots. ""Due to these inconsistent and questionable activities, we believe that Pennsylvania’s election results should not have been certified by our Secretary of State,"" Corman wrote. Corman wasn’t alone. In November, U.S. Rep. Scott Perry attended a ""Stop the Steal"" rally in Harrisburg before going on Fox Business Network to declare Pennsylvania’s election ""a horrific embarrassment."" U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser told Fox News host Sean Hannity the situation is dire: ""There is no longer one citizen, one vote."" And U.S. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler told the conservative outlet Newsmax that ""we know there is voter fraud that occurred,"" it’s just a question of how much. The president’s Pennsylvania supporters were listening, and before the attack on the Capitol, they told The Inquirer so. Raberta Hans, a 50-year-old teacher from Northeastern Pennsylvania, said she planned to attend the rally to make a stand for election integrity: ""It’s too dangerous not to go back and count every ballot."" Jackie Kulback, the local GOP chair in Cambria County, said she wanted to gather with other Trump supporters to show the president, who had repeatedly spouted false claims of election fraud, ""how much we support him."" And Ben Philips, a 50-year-old computer programmer from Bloomsburg, said he was eager to see what Trump would do next: ""It seems like he called us there for a reason. I think something big’s about to go down that no one’s talking about yet. I think he has an ace up his sleeve."" Philips was one of five people who died in or near the Capitol amid the attack after he suffered a medical emergency. When Trump addressed his supporters on Jan. 6 before they stormed the Capitol, he again rattled off a slew of false claims. Targeting Pennsylvania, he wrongly said the number of votes cast exceeded the state’s number of voters, that ballots received after Election Day were improperly counted, and that dead people had voted. None of that was true. And the president’s insistence that the election was stolen but could still be reversed with Congress’ help is what rioters cited when asked by reporters why they were there and what they hoped to achieve. Corman said unproven voter fraud claims didn’t play ""any role"" in the attack. No role at all? That’s absurd. A false but deeply held belief that the election was rigged and stolen from Trump led thousands of his supporters to gather in Washington and later storm the Capitol. The claims inspired the riot.

The article copies information from another website, Before It’s News, which has been identified by Columbia Journalism Review and others as a source of misinformation.   But Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration is proceeding. It has been scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will have added security following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, but there is no hint it has been called off. The Biden transition team published a schedule of inauguration events and sent emails to reporters describing the events in more detail. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office at the U.S. Capitol’s West Front. Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez are expected to perform.  The New York Times reported that Biden will be sworn in by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sometime before noon and then give his inaugural address. Harris will be sworn in by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, ABC News reported. Trump announced that he will not attend, but an aide to Vice President Mike Pence told the New York Times that Pence will. Instead of the tradition of nighttime balls, a primetime TV special ""Celebrating America"" will air, hosted by Tom Hanks and carried live by ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC, MSNBC, and PBS.  The stories on Facebook include a purported quote by Trump stating, ""I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807"" and that ""I will remain president indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested."" But Trump didn’t make that statement and there is no evidence that Trump invoked the act, a federal law that would allow a president to deploy the military to suppress insurrection.  Other fact-checkers including Reuters, Snopes, and Factcheck.org found that the phony Trump quote stemmed from @TeamTrumpNews on Parler. Reuters found that Trump did not have a personal account on Parler but his campaign posted under the handle @TeamTrump. Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives, was kicked off Amazon Web Services following the Jan. 6 riot.  Trump has falsely and repeatedly said that he won, lodging numerous unsuccessful court challenges disputing the results. But on Jan. 7, the day after the mob attacked the Capitol, Trump made it clear he would leave office. ""Now Congress has certified the results,"" Trump said. ""A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power."" Multiple news reports say Trump plans to leave the White House Wednesday morning before the inauguration and hold his own send off at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland before flying to Florida. A headline says, ""Inauguration Cancelled, Trump Remains in Office."" This information is bogus — there is no evidence that Biden has canceled his inauguration. Biden’s transition team has announced his plans for the inauguration ceremony and a nighttime celebration.

Fact-checking post claiming to show picture of armed soldiers protecting inauguration
","D.C. National Guard troops stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial over the summer observing people protesting the killing of George Floyd. Now, an image from that time is being shared on Facebook suggesting it shows soldiers protecting the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. ""If you need 10,000 armed soldiers to protect you’re (sic) inauguration from the people, then you probably weren’t elected by the people,"" said text over the image of a row of National Guard troops standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The Jan. 15 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) About 20,000 National Guard troops are expected in D.C. for Biden’s inauguration, but the image shared on Facebook is not from this month’s security preparations. It was taken June 2, 2020 and showed troops at the Lincoln Memorial and matches an image credited to ABC News’ Martha Raddatz. Raddatz posted a similar photo on Twitter that day as well as a video on her Instagram account that showed the scene. A similar photo was taken by a Getty Images photographer that day with the caption, ""Members of the D.C. National Guard stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial as demonstrators participate in a peaceful protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, on June 2, 2020 in Washington, DC."" The protest was among many that took place across the country as demonstrators called for racial justice and end to excessive use of force by police after Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer. The Facebook post also ignores the context of the heightened security for Biden’s inauguration — on Jan. 6 a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters, some armed, stormed the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers gathered to certify Biden’s electoral win. FBI Director Christopher Wray on Jan. 14 said law enforcement was ""seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter… about a number of events surrounding the inauguration."" ""We’re concerned about the potential for violence at multiple protests and rallies planned here in D.C. and at state Capitol buildings around the country in the days to come that could bring armed individuals within close proximity to government buildings and officials,"" Wray said during the Jan. 14 briefing on inauguration security. Biden beat Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Biden got more than 7 million votes than did Trump, and also won the Electoral College votes 306-232.

A Facebook post suggests that a photo shows armed soldiers protecting Biden’s inauguration. Thousands of troops are expected in D.C. to protect Biden’s inauguration; an increase in security is due to threats of potential violence, especially after a mob rioted the Capitol earlier this month.

No, Joe Biden didn’t stay silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests
","After a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed and occupied the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, an Instagram post suggested that President-elect Joe Biden, who condemned that attack, remained silent when demonstrations turned violent in the late spring and summer of 2020. The post was an apparent reference to the numerous Black Lives Matters protests held around the country, following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned Floyd’s neck under his knee. Some of the demonstrations turned violent. The post showed four images. Three depicted fire and violence in the streets — one labeled June, one July and one August; superimposed over each was a photo of Biden, with his eyes closed. A fourth image showed a tightly packed crowd and a superimposed photo of Biden, looking forward, with a quote: ""This violence is a threat and must end now.""   ""He was asleep the whole time,"" reads the accompanying caption. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) During the attack on the Capitol, Biden called on Trump to go on national television ""and demand an end to this siege."" ""This is not dissent, it’s disorder, it’s chaos."" Biden said. ""It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now."" But Biden also spoke out a number of times when violence broke out during some Black Lives Matter protests. On May 30, Biden said in a statement about Floyd: ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not."" In a campaign speech on June 2 about the Floyd protests, Biden said: ""There’s no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses."" On July 28, he said: ""I’ve said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property. Peaceful protesters should be protected — but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted — and local law enforcement can do that."" After protests in downtown Portland, Ore., for every night for nearly three months following Floyd’s killing, Biden said Aug. 30 in a statement while campaigning: ""I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same."" On Aug. 26, in the wake of violence in Kenosha, Wis., following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, Biden said in a video: ""Burning down communities is not protest, it’s needless violence — violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community. That’s wrong.""

Examining how science determines COVID-19's 'herd immunity threshold'
","The strategy to achieve herd immunity within a population to reverse the spread of COVID-19 has been a matter of intense debate over the course of the pandemic.   One component of this debate involves the herd immunity threshold, or the percentage of a population that must be immunized from a disease, be it through infections or vaccinations, for the spread to abate. The more infectious a contagion, the higher its threshold.  For instance, measles, a highly infectious disease that is at least three times as contagious as COVID-19, requires a herd immunity threshold level of around 94%, meaning that 94% of a population will need to be immune to measles before its transmission rate declines.  But pinning down a concrete herd immunity threshold level for COVID-19 has so far been theoretical guesswork. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say that the herd immunity threshold for any virus lies between 50% and 90%. Researchers in the United Kingdom and Brazil hypothesized during the early part of the pandemic that threshold could be as low as 6% to 21%, although their study has since been found to have critical errors.  Earlier this month, state Rep. Jon Rosenthal, D-Cypress, who has lost a family member and friend to COVID-19, took to Twitter to dispel common myths and ""rampant misinformation"" about the virus and its vaccines, which are now slowly being distributed throughout Texas. In his tweet thread, Rosenthal echoed a number that has commonly been repeated as COVID-19's herd immunity threshold.  ""To defeat this pandemic AND recover our economy, the safest and most effective way is for the population to be immunized,"" he tweeted Tuesday. ""The way to reach ‘herd immunity’ is for >70% of the population to get vaccinated.""  Immunity can be reached one of two ways: through natural infections, which create antibodies in people who have recovered from a disease that can potentially ward off future infection (an estimated 20% of the global population has been infected naturally); or through vaccination, a safer way to immunity because it does not cause illness.  The herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 has been somewhat of a moving target throughout the pandemic as researchers grapple with understanding the virus. Let’s review what current thinking is on the virus’ threshold.  There are two ways health experts think about a virus’ infection rate, mathematically represented as the R value. First, there’s the more theoretical R value known as the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced ""R naught""). This term indicates the average number of times one infected person will transmit the virus to another person. For example, measles has an R0 value between 12 and 18, meaning that one person infected with measles will, on average, spread the virus to another 12 to 18 people before they either die or recover. R0 is a theoretical figure that assumes everyone in a population is without immunity and susceptible to infection.  Then there is the more practical version of the R value — the effective reproduction rate, represented as Rt. The effective reproduction rate considers the fact that some people within a population will be immune to a disease, or that certain interventions have been put in place to slow spread, like social distancing or mask-wearing. The Rt value is more of a real-time representation of what a virus’ infection rate is and it decreases as a greater share of the population is immunized or as more interventions are put in place.   The exact R value for COVID-19, however, has not been concretely determined. According to Spencer Fox, associate director of the COVID-19 modeling consortium at the University of Texas, data during the early period of the pandemic suggested that the R0 rate was 2.5. Now it is believed to be within the 4 to 6 range. The Rt value, while much harder to determine, is estimated to be around 1.05 in the U.S. thanks to preventative measures and natural immunities.   ""There's kind of been this shifting conversation about what is the actual basic reproduction number of the virus,"" Fox said. ""We try and extrapolate from other populations, but every population will have a slightly different number.""  Typically, it is the R0 figure that is used in determining a virus’ herd immunity threshold because the goal is to return to a state of normalcy where interventions are no longer necessary. The threshold is calculated by plugging the R0 value into a formula: [1-(1÷R0)]*100 = threshold %.  With an R0 value of 2.5, the herd immunity threshold for COVID-19 would be 60%. With an R0 value of 6, the threshold would be 83%.  But according to Dr. David Dowdy, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, these numbers are highly theoretical.   The herd immunity threshold is ""something that’s easy for the public to understand, but not really reflective of reality,"" Dowdy said. ""The reality is that it’s a spectrum, but people like to see things in black and white and they like to have specific numbers to latch onto.""  ""At some point we will build up enough immunity. Whether it be through people getting the disease or through people getting the vaccine, that transmission (rate) will start to go down,"" he said. ""It's not like there's a magic number that we have to hit and if we don't hit it we'll forever have this pandemic with us. The more people we can get vaccinated the fewer people get sick and die.""  According to Fox, publicizing a herd immunity threshold level, while not accurately reflective of reality, does have usefulness.  ""Right now, the main use of providing a high number is to motivate people to actually get the vaccine, because in my mind we should try and vaccinate as many people as possible,"" Fox said.  The 70% threshold cited by Rosenthal and others is, to Fox, ""in the ballpark.""   ""It could be possibly as low as 50% and as high as 80%, so 70% is kind of in the middle. I would shoot higher. I wouldn't have this expectation that the disease goes away at this point,"" he said.  On Jan. 5, Rosenthal published a tweet saying that the way to reach herd immunity is for at least 70% of the population to get vaccinated. In an email, Rosenthal said his information came from a Reuters article that cited the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimating a 67% herd immunity threshold and the World Health Organization estimating a 65% to 70% threshold.  ""There are apparently too many unknowns to be certain, but the 70% figure lines up with some common estimates,"" Rosenthal said.  The herd immunity threshold is calculated by using a disease’s rate of transmission. Although scientists have not agreed upon a definite rate, and even though these rates are highly theoretical, estimates show that the thresholds lies somewhere between 60% and 83%.  We rate this claim Mostly True. ","[('Tweet, Jan. 5, 2021\xa0', 'https://twitter.com/Jon_RosenthalTX/status/1346502243814666240'), ('Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,\xa0What is Herd Immunity and How Can We Achieve It With COVID-19?, April 10, 2020\xa0', 'No link'), ('News Medical,\xa0COVID-19 herd immunity threshold far higher than previously thought, say researchers, Dec. 4, 2020\xa0', 'https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html'), ('Mayo Clinic,\xa0Herd immunity and COVID-19 (coronavirus): What you need to know, Dec. 15, 2020\xa0', 'No link'), ('The Atlantic,\xa0This Overlooked Variable Is the Key to the Pandemic, Sept. 30, 2020\xa0', 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201204/Herd-immunity-threshold-far-higher-than-previously-thought-say-researchers.aspx'), ('Health Knowledge,\xa0Epidemic theory (effective & basic reproduction numbers, epidemic thresholds) & techniques for analysis of infectious disease data (construction & use of epidemic curves, generation numbers, exceptional reporting & identification of significant clusters), accessed Jan.\xa06, 2021\xa0', 'No link'), ('Email with Texas Rep.

Amanda Chase pushes bogus theory of antifa conspiracy behind Capitol riot
","State Sen. Amanda Chase urged fellow Republicans to attend a Jan. 6 rally in Washington protesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. She drove to it with personal bodyguards and gave a speech repeating a discredited statement she’d been making for two months - that the election had been ""stolen"" from President Donald Trump. Chase left D.C. before demonstrators stormed the U.S. Capitol. But the next day, she  pinpointed blame for the deadly riot, and it was not on the pro-Trump protestors. ""Antifa is the culprit,"" she wrote on her Facebook page, referring to a loose collection of activists who rally against fascism and far-right groups.  Chase was hardly the first election-results denier to blame the violence on far-left activists impersonating Trump supporters. The fabricated charge has saturated social media sites and has been spread by Republican politicians such as U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. PolitiFact National has rated both of their statements Pants on Fire. We add Chase, who is seeking this year’s GOP nomination for governor, to that list. Shortly after making the post, Facebook suspended her account, which has more than 100,000 followers. Majority Democrats in the state Senate have submitted a censure resolution against Chase for ""fomenting insurrection against the United States."" As PolitiFact has reported, mentions of ""antifa"" started to take off on 4chan, an anonymous online forum, around noon on Jan. 6, according to data from the Social Media Analysis Toolkit. Shortly after 1 p.m., when rioters pushed past barricades at the Capitol, posts in pro-Trump Facebook groups claimed antifa activists were to blame. They cited a Breitbart live stream that showed rioters brandishing Trump paraphernalia.  The baseless rumor gained traction on Parler, a social media platform popular with conservatives, and on Fox News programs hosted by Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Lou Dobbs. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., suggested during a nationally televised congressional debate that antifa was behind the riot. Chase blamed antifa the next day, Jan. 7. She offered no substantial evidence, simply linking her post to a video of protesters at the Capitol - whom she called ""patriots"" - chanting ""No antifa.""  Her Facebook account was suspended on Jan. 8. She told Newsradio WRVA on Jan. 11 that she was merely passing on already-aired information about possible antifa involvement. ""The posts I put up simply said there are reports that antifa had infiltrated those that had gone into the Capitol, breaking the windows and doing the destruction, and there was a company that had some kind of a facial recognition that could identify those people back to antifa,"" she said. But Chase’s claim of being a mere conduit of reports from others doesn’t hold up. She said, ""Antifa is the culprit,"" presenting it as fact, even though there was plenty of information that contradicted her claim. The supposed smoking gun on Jan. 6 - which Chase referred to on WRVA - was an article in the conservative Washington Times falsely reporting that a New York facial-recognition company had identified antifa supporters among the rioters. The Times retracted the article the same day and apologized to the company - XRVision. All of this happened the day before Chase’s post blaming antifa. And, of course, Trump had been urging his backers to attend the rally for several weeks. Trump identified the mob as his own supporters in a Jan. 6 video posted to Twitter amid the Capitol incident, where he asked them to disperse peacefully, adding, ""We love you. You’re very special."" The day after Chase’s post, the FBI said there is no evidence of antifa involvement in the riot. Some of the most visible demonstrators who have since been identified or arrested have long social media records of supporting Trump. We should note that Chase is not the only Virginia Republican blaming antifa for the riot without proof. State GOP Chairman Rich Anderson, in a Jan. 7 Facebook post, wrote, ""Last night and this morning, I spoke to Virginia Republicans who were present on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and who personally witnessed the group that led the penetration of the U.S. Capitol... According to these eyewitness accounts from individuals who I know and trust, this group appeared to employ the signature strategies of antifa and other leftist groups.""  Our ruling Chase wrote, ""Antifa is the culprit,"" in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. She and other Republicans  who have spread this myth have presented no evidence to back it up. There was an array of easily accessible information that refuted Chase’s claim at the time she made it.

Yes, slow absentee count explains supposed “ballot dump” in Milwaukee
","Votes from the November election have now been counted, recounted, reviewed by state and local officials and used to nominate electors — which in turn were counted, then confirmed by Congress Jan. 6. This process confirmed Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. Along the way we’ve seen hundreds (if not thousands) of fact checks and dozens of court decisions explaining why the stolen election narrative fails to hold water once claims are examined closely. Nevertheless, the baseless fraud claims put forth by President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have persisted and remain accepted among a large slice of American conservatives. Prominent among these is the idea of ballot ""dumps"" — where the late reporting of largely Democratic totals in several states are seen as suspicious or proof of malfeasance. But the new Republican leader of the Wisconsin state Senate says that’s nonsense. Talking about the need to restore voters’ confidence, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said Wisconsin needs to allow work on absentee ballots to begin before Election Day. Wisconsin is one of just a handful of states that ban election workers from starting to process these ballots until then. ""It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee,"" LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said Jan. 10, 2021, on WKOW-TV’s Capitol City Sunday. ""It just takes them that long to load in those absentee ballots. So we need to make sure there’s a process in place going forward so that reporting is timely."" LeMahieu added that there was not ""widespread"" voter fraud in the 2020 election. The state senator is precisely right about why Milwaukee ballots were reported in the early morning hours of Nov. 4, as the Wisconsin tally neared its conclusion. (Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes, one of five he flipped from Trump). Let’s review what we know. The ""ballot dump"" claim has been one of the most widespread since the November election. A conservative website trumpeted it as ""Voter Fraud in Wisconsin."" Widely shared Facebook posts claimed there was a ""ballot dump"" or ""found"" votes. Trump himself asserted that his lead in key states ""started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted"" and that ""Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly."" This line of thinking also appeared in numerous lawsuits and one nonsensical claim that statistics show the probability of Trump losing in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania ""given President Trump’s early lead ... is less than one in a quadrillion"" in each state. Those claims led to unanimous debunking from an array of fact-checking organizations. All are built on a fundamental misunderstanding of the vote-counting process. Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states that don’t allow absentee votes to be counted before Election Day. So the unprecedented volume of absentee ballots spurred by the pandemic created a bottleneck in the largest cities. That brings us to a simple logical chain that explains the late Democratic votes in Milwaukee (and Atlanta and Detroit and Philadelphia). Milwaukee, like most large cities, is a longtime Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee 77% to 18%. We knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee. Polling showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden. We knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later. That counting time is why LeMahieu said he wants to change the law to allow workers to start on absentee ballots before Election Day. ""We need clear laws that are easy to follow, and we must instill confidence in the electorate that the results are accurate and free of fraud,"" LeMahieu said told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""With the proper safeguards in places to ensure transparency, allowing the ballot count to begin early should accomplish both of those goals.""  LeMahieu said the Milwaukee ""ballot dumping"" is due to the amount of time it took to count absentee ballots. He’s right We’ve seen an array of nonsensical claims that these ballots were illegitimately added based on the progress of the Wisconsin count. But those all overlook the simple truth that these ballots were reported later because it took longer to count them. We rate LeMahieu’s claim True.  ","[('WKOW-TV, Capitol City Sunday, Jan. 10, 2021', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/20/donald-trump/trump-again-flat-wrong-claims-about-wisconsin-vote/'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, Trump again flat wrong with claims about Wisconsin voter fraud, Nov. 20, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, Lawsuit claim that statistics prove fraud in Wisconsin, elsewhere is wildly illogical, Dec. 9, 2020', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/10/facebook-posts/texas-lawsuit-statistics-fraud-wisconsin-michigan/'), ('National Conference of State Legislatures, VOPP Table 16: When Absentee/Mail Ballot Processing and Counting Can Begin, Oct. 1, 2020', 'No link'), ('Marquette University Law School Poll, New Marquette Law School Poll finds Biden holding a steady lead over Trump in Wisconsin, Aug. 11, 2020', 'https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-16-when-absentee-mail-ballot-processing-and-counting-can-begin.aspx'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, Split in voting methods puts COVID, mail center stage in Wisconsin, Oct. 10, 2020', 'No link'), (""Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin likely won't have presidential results on election night, Sept. 17, 2020"", 'https://www.marquette.edu/news-center/2020/new-marquette-law-poll-finds-biden-holding-a-steady-lead-over-trump-in-wisconsin.php')]",/factchecks/2021/jan/15/devin-lemahieu/yes-slow-absentee-count-explains-supposed-ballot-d/

The article, which appeared Jan. 6 on the website of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, cites a journalist’s reporting of data from a federal reporting system that health officials use to track and study ""adverse events"" associated with vaccines, ranging from mild side effects to serious health problems. The journalist, Alex Berenson, told PolitiFact he has not reported that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing the adverse events, only that the data are showing many more such events than are reported with flu shots. ""I am pointing to a potential problem that this data raises,"" he said.  Health experts told us there isn’t enough data in the reporting system to indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular reaction, or to accurately compare the adverse events associated with different vaccines.  The article reported on what it called ""disturbing numbers"" from a series of tweets a day earlier from Berenson.  Berenson wrote that through Dec. 22, with fewer than 1 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine given, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had received reports of 307 emergency room visits and 17 ""life threatening"" events, for ""roughly 50 times the rate of adverse events from the flu vaccine.""  ""It gets worse,"" the article said, noting that Berenson wrote that the COVID-19 adverse events were reported after shots were given mostly to healthy people in settings where problems can be quickly treated and before the rollout to older, less healthy people. Berenson’s tweets said he obtained his figures from the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The CDC told us its system does not allow for searches dating back to Dec. 22, so we could not replicate the searches Berenson did, and Berenson told us he didn’t have the earlier search results from the CDC’s database. But Berenson showed us screenshots of results from a more recent search he did of the database, which he said showed that adjusted for the number of vaccinations given, there were now roughly 35 times as many adverse events reported for COVID-19 vaccinations as for flu shots. The search results he showed us indicated 4,060 adverse events after 4 million COVID-19 vaccinations in the three weeks ended Dec. 31; and 9,553 adverse events reported over 18 months for 180 million flu shots given during the 2019-20 flu season. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a physician in the infectious-disease division at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned against reading too much into the CDC’s figures cited in the tweets or the article. ""The VAERS system is very noisy, so it's hard to compare,"" he said. The system, he said, identifies ""a lot of temporal associations that are not necessarily causal."" VAERS is not designed to indicate whether a vaccine caused a health problem, but is good for detecting patterns of events that might indicate a problem, which in turn might trigger further investigation of a possible safety concern.  The site notes that it contains ""unverified reports"" of adverse events that occur after vaccination. Anyone can make a report. Results of searches on the VAERS database appear with this caveat, among others: ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness."" As part of heightened safety monitoring for COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration ""have strongly engaged healthcare providers, public health jurisdictions and the public to report adverse events to VAERS,"" said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. Dr. Werner Bischoff, professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, said he had ""several concerns"" with the statement comparing the COVID-19 and flu vaccines. ""Any adverse events, from mild to severe, are much more closely monitored"" for COVID-19, given that people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are observed for at least 15 minutes, which generally does not occur with flu vaccinations, Bischoff said.  ""The range of side effects is broad, as with any other vaccine, and we need more data to accurately estimate the occurrence of severe reactions caused by the COVID vaccine,"" he added.  ""Making comparisons at this early stage may lead to misinterpretation,"" he said. The Ron Paul Institute did not respond to our requests for further information. An article shared in Facebook posts claimed: ""Coronavirus vaccinations seem to be causing 50 times the adverse events of flu vaccinations after just the first of two shots."" A journalist’s search of raw data from the CDC’s reporting system indicated that the rate of reported ""adverse events"" following COVID-19 vaccinations is many times higher than for the flu shots. The journalist who surfaced the data that the article drew from said he wasn’t drawing any conclusions about cause and effect. The CDC and experts say the raw data from the reporting system cannot be used to draw conclusions about whether vaccinations cause the adverse events. Experts say the data about the new COVID-19 vaccinations are too new to make meaningful comparisons to flu shots.

A group of Democratic lawmakers didn’t wear clothing, masks with swastikas. The image is doctored
","Four Democratic congresswomen known as ""the squad""— Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan — became frequent targets of online misinformation after their wins in the 2018 midterm elections. And the attacks haven’t stopped. A photograph of the group, which also includes U.S. Reps. Cori Bush, D-Mo. and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., is circulating on social media and shows the women wearing clothing or accessories that appear to have stars in the shape of the Nazi swastika symbol. For Bush and Bowman, the symbol appears on their masks.  The photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo isn’t genuine. It was manipulated to add the symbols. The colors on the clothing were also doctored. Squad up. pic.twitter.com/bp2KATL22R The original image was posted on Twitter by Bush on Jan. 3, the day the 117th Congress was sworn in. It shows no signs of any swastikas.","[('Facebook post, Jan. 11, 2021', 'https://archive.is/1M7gP'), ('Tin Eye, Reverse image search, Jan. 14, 2021', 'No link'), ('Twitter, Cori Bush post, Jan. 3, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/CoriBush/status/1345804761380085760')]",/factchecks/2021/jan/15/viral-image/group-democratic-lawmakers-didnt-wear-clothing-mas/
