Scott Walker says he invested $100 million in worker training
","In February 2012, one of the Democrats who aimed to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin’s historic recall election made an aggressive claim. Former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk said Walker enacted ""the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history."" We rated the statement True. Among the $1.1 billion in education cuts in Walker’s 2011-’13 state budget was a reduction of $71.6 million, or 30 percent, in general state aid for technical colleges. And the governor has since restored only a fraction of that funding. So, we wondered about Walker’s claiming in a new TV ad, which his campaign highlighted in an Aug. 13, 2014 news release, that he has ""invested over $100 million in worker training."" The system The state's tech school system has a long history and a large clientele. In 1911, Wisconsin became the first state to establish a system of state aid and support for industrial education, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. Currently, the Wisconsin Technical College System has 16 schools that serve some 380,000 students each year. The tech schools’ primary mission is occupational education and training, although they also provide general education, career counseling and other services. As for financing, the largest share of the tech system's funding, slightly more than 50 percent, comes from property taxes. But given Walker’s claim, our focus here is on state spending. State funding General state aid to technical colleges remained virtually unchanged during the eight years under the previous governor, Democrat Jim Doyle. It ranged between $118 million and $119 million per year. Walker cut the allocation to $83.5 million for each year of his first budget, causing the $71.6 million reduction for 2011-’13 that we mentioned. He kept the funding at $83.5 million the following year, then bumped it up to $88.5 million in 2014-’15, still well below the Doyle levels. But when Walker first made the reductions, the tech system told us it estimated that 60 percent of the reductions were offset by savings the system was able to make as a result of Act 10, Walker’s collective bargaining reform law. That law required most public employees pay for a larger share of their pension and health benefits. Beyond that, the reductions were in general aid -- which can be used for many purposes, including general education and overhead, as well as worker training. They weren’t cuts in funding strictly for worker training. The claim As for Walker’s claim of investing more than $100 million in worker training, the governor in February 2013 said he would invest $132 million from various sources, including nearly $100 million in state money, to build a faster system to track jobs data, tie technical school and university funding to filling high-demand professions, and require nearly 76,000 people to train for work to collect food stamps. A key point here is that, although Walker has not restored all of the general state aid he had cut to the tech schools, he was adding money to other types of job training. Here are some of the larger worker training allocations: $35.4 million in increased workforce training grants in a March 2014 law. It requires the state Department of Workforce Development to fund initiatives such as reducing waiting lists for technical college programs in ""high-demand"" fields and collaborative efforts by school districts, tech schools and businesses to train high school students in high-demand fields. $31 million in the 2013-’15 state budget to carry out a new requirement that able-bodied adults who don't have dependent children work or get work training in order to receive food stamps. $22.5 million in the 2013-’15 state budget for new ""incentive grants"" to University of Wisconsin System institutions for economic development programs, programs that aim to develop the workforce and programs that make post secondary education more affordable for state residents. $20 million in a March 2013 law to the state Department of Workforce Development to provide grants to private and public organizations for training unemployed and underemployed workers. Of that amount, $15 million is for grants and the rest to run the program. $4.21 million in additional money for the state's vocational rehabilitation program through a December 2013 law. Those initiatives alone exceed $100 million. Walker's campaign provided us a spreadsheet listing those initiatives and others totaling nearly $178 million.  However, whether the full $178 million could be considered worker training is debatable. For example, $12 million is allocated for ""WorkKeys,"" a job skills assessment that is intended ""to help high school pupils identify necessary coursework and provide another indicator for career readiness."" Our rating Walker said he has ""invested over $100 million into worker training."" The governor has directed more than $100 million into a variety of new worker training programs. But his statement needs clarification in that he also cut general aid to technical colleges, some of which is used for worker training.   Our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-invested-100-million-worker-t/

Allan Fung says Ken Block's campaign compared Fung supporters to Nazis
","Who would have thought that the battle between Republicans Allan Fung and Ken Block in the race for governor would slip into a debate over Nazis? But it did, thanks to a Facebook posting. On Aug. 18, Fung's campaign manager and spokesman, Patrick Sweeney, issued a statement complaining of a ""disgusting and offensive campaign tactic."" The tactic? ""The use of Nazi imagery by the Block for Governor campaign to describe supporters of Allan Fung for Governor."" ""The Block Campaign's comparison of Fung supporters to Nazi soldiers is an unconscionable tactic,"" the release said. What’s this all about? It begins with a message that the Fung campaign says it spotted on the personal Facebook page of a man named Peter Godon, who lists his hometown as North Smithfield. It includes two, side-by-side images. One shows the torso of a woman wearing a blue T-shirt that says, ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fung,"" a play on the Cyndi Lauper song. The other shows a drawing of a man in a Nazi uniform. The message above the images: ""Can you spot any difference in their actions?"" The Fung campaign then issued the news release calling the posting ""disgusting and offensive,""and  included the Facebook posting as part of the news release, which can be seen in the notes section of the Fung For Governor Facebook page. In the news release, Sweeney was quoted as characterizing Godon as ""a contributor and key supporter of the Block campaign"" and he alleged that the Block campaign was comparing Fung supporters to Nazis. When we looked for the original Facebook posting on Aug. 20, we could not find it. The key point we are checking is whether the Block campaign had any role whatsoever in the posting of the image. We checked the Block Facebook page and didn't see the image posted there, so we wondered whether the Block campaign was really equating Fung supporters with Third Reich soldiers. We emailed Sweeney asking for his evidence that Godon represented the Block campaign. While we were waiting, we asked Block spokesman Jeff Britt about Godon's role in the campaign. He said Godon had worked as an unpaid volunteer putting up signs, who only got reimbursed for expenses. Britt produced records showing that on three dates in May, July and August, Godon was reimbursed a total of $122.61 for white panel boards, hardware and posts he purchased at Lowe's and Home Depot. The latest campaign finance records on file with the Rhode Island Board of Elections show that Godon contributed $100 to Block on Jan. 20, 2014 and wrote a second check, for $25, that was received on June 2, 2014. Donating $125 to a campaign, even if you also volunteer to put up signs, doesn't exactly make you a ""key supporter"" in a multi-million dollar campaign. We emailed Godon and left a message on his home answering machine seeking information, but received no reply. Britt called the posting ""tasteless"" and said that by the time he looked for it on Godon's page, late on Aug. 18, it was gone. ""It had not been posted on our page. If it had shown up on our Facebook page, we would have taken it down,"" he said. ""And if you take it in the context that Ken Block is Jewish, nobody in our campaign is going to be making Holocaust jokes."" When we got through to Sweeney, he said, the posting ""just got brought to my attention so we put out something quick on it."" He said he wasn't sure who raised the matter and contended that, ""I don't think we said anything in our release that the Block campaign posted anything. As a matter of fact, I know we didn't say that."" The next day, Fung spokesman Robert Coupe emailed us to again say that Godon ""was in fact a key supporter of the Block campaign"" because of the $125 donation, the $122.61 reimbursement, the fact that Godon posted photos of himself online with Block at a fundraising event, the fact the Godon has frequently posted messages on social media advocating for Block or attacking Fung, and he appeared in Block's ""Town Hall"" television commercial. We checked the 30-second commercial. Godon is shown as an attentive audience member for one second. Our ruling Allan Fung, represented by his campaign manager, said in a news release that Ken Block's campaign compared Fung supporters to Nazi soldiers. The Fung campaign could offer no meaningful evidence that any official with any authority in the Block campaign was involved in creating or posting the bizarre message. To suggest that being an unpaid volunteer, donating $125 to a campaign, and showing up for one second as an extra in a campaign commercial makes you a ""key supporter"" of a candidate is a huge stretch. And to suggest that a posting on a personal Facebook page by a supporter of the campaign automatically represents the opinion of the candidate or the candidate's campaign is an equally large contortion. We rate this claim False.

"['Oregon', 'Marijuana', 'Anthony Johnson']","
Have Colorado highway fatalities decreased since marijuana use was legalized?
","Oregon voters will have the chance in November to join only Colorado and Washington as states where recreational use of marijuana is legal. Not surprisingly, the issue is already heating up, with those for and against staking out positions they hope will sway voters on Measure 91. The claim: Anthony Johnson, the measure’s chief petitioner and director of the advocacy group New Approach Oregon, made his pitch recently when the City Club of Portland met to debate the merits of nine political issues, legal marijuana among them. When an opposition speaker questioned why Oregon should follow the lead of Colorado and Washington into the relatively uncharted territory of legal pot, Johnson noted the pluses of regulation and taxation. Addressing opposition predictions that driving accidents would spike in those states, he added, ""We've seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado"" since recreational use of marijuana became legal there in January. Since the effect legalization might have on impaired driving is a big topic in Oregon in the lead up to November, PolitiFact Oregon checked the numbers. The analysis: Colorado’s medical marijuana law took effect in 2002, giving the Centennial State a relatively long history of dealing with the drug in an other-than-illegal capacity. However, recreational use has been in effect for only seven months, making any numbers suspect in terms of how longer-term trends might play out. That said, we figured that comparing the number of traffic fatalities recorded during the first seven months of this year with the first seven of 2013 would the fairest way to evaluate Johnson’s claim. We called Emily Wilfong, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman. As of Aug. 22, 2014, she said, 295 people had died in motor vehicle crashes in the state. That compared with the 313 deaths reported as of the same time a year ago. A difference, yes, but one of less than six percent. But even so, Wilfong added, those two figures don’t reveal a useful picture when it comes to assessing traffic deaths in the age of legal marijuana. For starters, neither figure includes the icy dangers of Colorado’s winter driving season, which begins around mid- to late-October, she said. Hazardous conditions could easily skew the number of traffic fatalities dramatically. For another, neither includes an analysis of exactly how the deaths occurred. ""There could well be a big decrease in the number of pedestrian fatalities,"" Wilfong said. ""There’s nothing in these figures to show that impaired driving has been reduced to any measurable degree."" Muddying the numbers further is the fact that toxicology reports showing what drivers had in their systems may not come back for months, she said. ""So we have some numbers,"" Wilfong said, ""but we’re not at all certain what they mean at this point. It’s way too early to tell."" Trooper Josh Lewis, Wilfong’s Colorado State Patrol counterpart, agreed. ""Statistically, we’re essentially neck and neck with last year,"" he said. ""But there’s nothing to say that marijuana use is reducing the number of fatalities or that there’s any correlation between the two. It could well be months or years before we have gathered that sort of data."" We tried to reach Johnson, but were told he was out of the office. The Yes on 91 campaign referred us to Art Way, senior drug policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance (Colorado). Over the past decade, he said -- or roughly the time that Colorado began loosening its marijuana laws -- total highway fatalities are down. Statistics bear that out, but the margin is slim and there are other factors such as improvements in vehicle safety and trauma medicine. The ruling: Anthony Johnson, chief petitioner for Measure 91, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in Oregon, pointed to Colorado’s brief seven-month experience with legal pot and noted that traffic fatalities have decreased there over that stretch. Colorado’s most recent statistics show that 18 fewer people have died so far this year in fatal traffic accidents than did during that same time period in 2013. Nothing in those numbers, however, supports any contention that legal marijuana had anything to do with a drop that’s as much as a blip as anything. Johnson’s statement is true, but it omits important details and context. We rate it Half True. Thoughts on our ruling? Click on over to OregonLive/politics.com and leave your comments. (This fact-check has been edited. An earlier version mischaracterized one of Anthony Johnson's arguments regarding driving and recreational marijuana.

Barack Obama says Congress was going on 'vacation,' on eve of his own vacation
","Last week, PolitiFact Texas gave a Mostly False rating to a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that Congress is ""on a five-week vacation,"" noting that even if lawmakers take some days off, they continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings. Not long after that fact-check appeared, a reader wrote in to ask us why we hadn’t taken President Barack Obama to task for using the same terminology to describe the congressional recess. We missed Obama’s comment the first time around, so we’ll check it here. In his weekly address on Aug. 2, 2014, Obama touted recent job gains and urged Congress to act on some of his proposals, including spending on infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, student-loan reforms, equal pay and paid leave. Such initiatives have been stalled in the House, currently controlled by the Republicans, and to an extent the Senate, where the GOP minority has tools it can use to block legislation. So Obama sought to paint congressional Republicans as being derelict in their duty by leaving town for the summer recess. ""House Republicans actually got together this week and voted to sue me for taking actions on my own,"" Obama said. ""And then they left town for the month without settling a bunch of unfinished business that matters to working families across America. … And when they return from vacation next month, instead of trying to pass partisan bills on party lines, hopefully we can come together with the sense of common purpose that you expect. And in the meantime, I will never stop doing whatever I can, whenever I can, not only to make sure that our economy succeeds, but that people like you succeed."" The White House used the word again in the introduction to the transcript it sent to reporters, saying that ""Congress is about to go on vacation."" While Perry was referring to a different issue -- border security -- he expressed equal disgust at Congress leaving Washington. ""Congress shouldn’t be on a five-week vacation,"" Perry said. ""I can assure you that drug cartels and gangs are not on vacation."" We don’t see any significant differences in the context of the two politicians’ uses of the word ""vacation,"" so we’ll recap here what PolitiFact Texas found when it talked to congressional experts and apply it to Obama’s comment. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry for this article.) A 1970 law mandates annual recess The annual August break is required by law, according to an Aug. 6, 2014, Wall Street Journal blog post by Linda Killian, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center, a think tank. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, she wrote, directs the House and Senate to recess for the month of August, until after Labor Day. The act says that unless Congress provides otherwise, the House and Senate shall adjourn no later than July 31 of each year or so and, it looks to us, to remain adjourned to the second day after Labor Day. (It does say the mandate shall not be applicable in any year there’s a state of war as declared by Congress as of July 31.) This year, Congress started its five-week summer recess on Aug. 1, 2014. Is the recess a vacation? It’s one thing not to be in session, but is that the same as taking a vacation? First, there’s the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of vacation: a ""period of time that a person spends away from home, school, or business usually in order to relax or travel."" Just because it’s called a recess doesn’t mean congressional leaders are taking a break. ""Business still goes on,"" Senate Historian Don Ritchie told Time magazine. ""There’s just no action on the floor."" Scant business goes on, we suspect, though an official House calendar listed a few hearings scheduled during the 2014 recess — an Aug. 6 hearing of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs on health care access in rural America, hosted by panel Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla.; an Aug. 7 hearing of the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations about combating the Ebola threat; and an Aug. 14 hearing, also by the veterans affairs panel, on rural health care and infrastructure needs. Time’s story said: ""Especially because this is an election year, many members will be campaigning, visiting offices and town halls in their home states and holding town meetings. Offices will stay open to receive mail and calls from constituents. Members who aren’t up for reelection might enjoy family time or a vacation,"" the story said. PolitiFact Texas found many members who held or planned to hold official appearances, outreach sessions with voters and the like during the recess period. The American Enterprise Institute’s Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional observer, said that during recesses, most senators and House members ""use this time to travel to trouble spots or to go back and campaign or do meetings in their home districts or states. They are not laying back in the sun, but working. I would prefer more time in Washington legislating, and less time back in the district. But calling this a five-week vacation is a distortion."" Obama’s own vacation Meanwhile, we’d be remiss if we didn’t note that Obama himself hasn’t exactly been huddled, monk-like, in the Oval Office this August. He left with his family for a vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., on Aug. 9, then returned to Washington for about 48 hours before resuming his vacation. The Obamas’ time away came during an unusually intense news period that included unrest in Ferguson, Mo., the launch of U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic extremist group ISIS, the beheading of American journalist James Foley by ISIS, and the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa -- pairings that were not lost on many of the president’s critics, as well as some of his supporters. For instance, the New York Times quoted Jim Manley, a veteran Democratic strategist, saying, ""As a general rule, I think that he’s right that you can’t be held hostage to the news cycle — the man deserves a bit of downtime,"" said. ""But in this particular instance, I think a lot of Democrats flinched a little bit. … (The video of the beheading) was just so shocking that the idea that he was going to immediately run to the golf course was just a little too much for folks. It was tone-deaf."" For the record, CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller, the unofficial chronicler of presidential travels, reports that Obama has taken 19 vacations totaling 125 days so far while in office. That’s far fewer than George W. Bush’s 65 combined trips to his Texas ranch and his parents’ home in Kennebunkport, Maine, which totaled 407 days at the same point in his presidency. A president, Knoller tweeted, ""is never really on ‘vacation.’ The job and responsibilities go with him wherever he is."" This suggests that Obama should know better than to label Congress’ August recess with the broad brush of ""vacation."" Our ruling Obama said Congress is on ""vacation."" Hypocrisy aside -- Obama was about to go on vacation himself just a week later -- he’s stretching it on the terminology. During Congress’ August recess -- mandated by a 1970 law -- lawmakers aren’t debating matters on the floor of the House or Senate. But even if they take some dog days off, the recess isn’t a no-work vacation. Lawmakers continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings, and many also campaign. On balance, we rate Obama’s claim the same as Perry’s -- Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-congress-was-going-vacation-eve-/

Henry Cuellar claim about social media, rebates and children in Central America lacks proof
","EDITOR’S NOTE: Our first review of this claim, posted Aug. 12, 2014 and readable here, resulted in a Pants on Fire rating. That story appeared just before the State Department emailed a fresh statement leading us to take down the article and do more checking. In the end, we rated this statement Mostly False. In a ""did-you-know?"" moment, a Laredo congressman said drug cartels offer rebates for children from Central America to lure other kids to make the overland journey to the United States. In an interview with ABC News and Yahoo News, posted online July 16, 2014, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar talked up legislation he and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, had introduced enabling immigration judges to determine quickly whether any unaccompanied child apprehended on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico should be sent home. Agreeing that poverty and violence in Central America have been factors in children flocking north, Cuellar told reporter Jeff Zeleny: ""The drug cartels found an incentive, and this is what we’re trying to cut off, these incentives. Finally a last thing: Did you know that they’re even using social media -- social media that says if you get recruited, we’ll give you a rebate if you bring another child with you."" Zeleny: ""So an advertisement of sorts?"" Cuellar: ""Oh, without a doubt. They have marketing. They’re very sophisticated organizations."" Cuellar’s mention of rebates being floated by cartels via social media stirred our curiosity. After all, the cartels aren’t known for guiding children to the U.S. from the countries south of Mexico, though they do find ways to profit from people passing through their territories. Also, rebates sounded unwieldy at least if the rebates were anything like the return of part of the up-front payment for a service or item such as what you get if you mail a form to a postal box. By phone, Cuellar told us his claim tracked what he heard from an official in the U.S. Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which is part of the State Department, in a July 11, 2014, briefing of a congressional delegation in Guatemala City. ""When they mentioned rebates, it got my attention,"" Cuellar said, adding the briefer (whom he did not identify) also mentioned discounts. At our request, Cuellar’s office emailed photos of what Cuellar described as his post-briefing journal entry. The presented July 11 entry doesn’t mention drug cartels, repeatedly saying ""smugglers"" instead. The relevant portion says: ""Less Mexicans going north so smugglers looking for new markets (CA) & social media used to recruit."" We took ""CA"" to mean Central America. The next page opens by saying ""smugglers rebate $s if they bring someone with them."" His office guided us to State Department spokespeople who emailed us several statements. None of them covered all of what Cuellar said. Spokeswomen Mo Mimnaugh and Susan Bridenstine each said smugglers employ social media and Mimnaugh specified that embassy staff told Cuellar ""smugglers are known to provide rebates for positive referrals. This information is from Guatemalan government sources."" Bridenstine said smugglers sometimes offer discounts to ferry children. Otherwise, we found no news stories on cartels using social media to offer rebates. Also, outside experts expressed doubts about the claim. News stories don’t mention rebates In an email, Mimnaugh pointed out a news story about smugglers using Facebook. The July 7, 2014, article from Prensa Libre, a Guatemalan news service, was headlined, ""Coyotes coordinate through Facebook."" The story quoted a smuggler identified only as Juan saying he logs onto Facebook to smooth the logistics of guiding almost 100 people a month from Latin American countries into Mexico. Facebook, he said, is cheaper than a telephone call. Other news stories talked about smugglers, social media and occasional discounts without mention of cartels offering rebates. An Associated Press news story, datelined Tecún Umán, Guatemala, said: ""Coyotes get their business through social networks, from friends and family, or referrals from prior customers,"" without saying where that information originated. The 1,900-word story also was published July 21, 2014, after Cuellar spoke to ABC News, making us loathe to consider it because Cuellar wouldn’t have had it as an information source. Some news stories refer to smugglers or the drug cartels vending travel packages. A June 26, 2014, news story in the New York Times quoted Raul L. Ortiz, deputy chief of the Border Patrol for the Rio Grande Valley, saying families and children had become a high-profit, low-risk business for Mexican narcotics cartel bosses who, Ortiz said, had taken control of human smuggling across the Rio Grande. ""They now offer family packages, migrants said, charging up to $7,500 to bring a minor alone or a mother with children from Central America to the American side of the river."" A July 9, 2014, news story in El Universal, a Mexican newspaper, quoted Ana Cecilia Oliva Balcarcel, director of immigrant protection at the National Institute of Migration in Mexico, describing special offers to migrants that, in some cases, cover up to three trips into the United States for a $6,000 payment, the story said. She was further quoted as saying people prefer to purchase such packages from traffickers rather than going to the trouble of applying for a humanitarian visa from Mexico. Expert: ‘Sounds like talk-radio chatter’ To our inquiries, academic experts on immigration expressed no awareness of rebates being offered to families or children via social media, though some said smugglers might occasionally employ social media. (Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook declined to comment.) Wayne Cornelius, a professor emeritus at the University of California at San Diego, said via email he hadn’t heard of evidence supporting the rebate claim ""and I deal frequently with attorneys providing legal representation for unaccompanied child migrants. It sounds more like talk-radio chatter."" Also by email, Austin-based security and intelligence consultant firm Stratfor, which describes itself as a ""geopolitical intelligence firm that provides strategic analysis and forecasting,"" provided a statement from Tristan Reed, its security analyst for Mexico, who said that while drug cartels employ social media, Stratfor had no specific examples of rebate offers ""at the moment."" Generally, Reed said, ""even if Mexican organized crime were advertising their human smuggling services via social media -- which itself makes their operations more vulnerable -- it's only occurring in an isolated manner."" Cuellar’s office urged us to query San Antonio consultant Alonzo Peña, former deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said by email that from his experience, ""I can tell you that what the congressman said is not at all outside the realm of possibility or incredible."" Peña also said by phone: ""I haven’t heard the word ‘rebate’ used"" in the context of smuggling children. If the drug cartels aren’t directly ferrying children north, he said, they no doubt find ways to profit from the vulnerable traffic. ""I know the cartels are using social media for just about everything they do,"" he said. Texas professors who study immigration across the Rio Grande expressed skepticism. Nestor Rodriguez, a University of Texas sociologist who has done research in rural Guatemala, said he’d be surprised if formal rebates are offered via social media or otherwise though perhaps smugglers offer discounts if, say, a group of children is expanded by one or two kids, driving down overall expenses. ""I never heard of anyone going to a web page to find a smuggling tour,"" Rodriguez said, saying arrangements are done face to face. ""I’m not saying it couldn’t happen."" Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said the congressman’s statement struck him as flawed in several ways. Drug cartels don’t smuggle people, he said, leaving that to others, though one cartel levies a ""right-of-way"" charge for people being smuggled through its territory, he said.   ""No. 2, this assumes the people doing this, both fleeing and doing the human smuggling, have access to the Internet,"" Payan said. ""Most do not have access to the Internet; they do not operate that way. They don’t want to leave any record of this."" And, Payan said, the people who are leaving have no web access at home and don’t necessarily even have cell phones. ""Smugglers tend to operate person to person, do their own recruitment, go colonia to colonia,"" Payan said. ""I haven’t seen any of this evidence of social media."" After Mimnaugh said Guatemalan government sources had mentioned rebates, Payan said by email the embassy’s response sounded like cherry-picking to defend the congressman. Payan suggested we query Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas-Brownsville. Correa-Cabrera called Cuellar’s claim unfounded and ridiculous, adding she would need to see independent evidence before she put credence in the Mimnaugh rebates’ statement. Cuellar, informed of the lack of published evidence and skepticism among most experts, told us he believes the government briefer over others ""because those are the people on the ground and they’re not sitting in some university office looking up information."" Our ruling Cuellar said drug cartels are offering rebates via social media so more children from Central America get guided to the United States. The elements of Cuellar’s statement — cartels, social media and some sort of rebate or, perhaps, discount — stem from a State Department briefing for which we found minimal degrees of confirmation. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Mike Martinez says majority of Austin residents are renters, not owners
","After an Austin mayoral candidate proposed to permanently cut homeowner taxes, City Council Member Mike Martinez said the idea wouldn’t benefit most residents. Martinez, also a candidate for mayor, reacted after attorney Steve Adler said the council could have created a city homestead exemption, or tax break for homeowners, years before. ""We need to act,"" Adler said Aug. 4, 2014, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story that day. Adler called for a 20 percent exemption--as in a 20 percent cut to each home’s taxable value--at a city-estimated cost of $36 million a year. Martinez and a third mayoral aspirant, City Council Member Sheryl Cole, said Adler’s idea revealed his lack of governing experience. Martinez said: ""This would be $36 million that would benefit the wealthiest Austinites the most. The majority of Austinites rent and would see no financial benefit at all."" We wondered about Martinez’s statement that most Austin residents rent, rather than own, the places they live. We did not delve into his contention that renters wouldn’t benefit from Adler’s proposal. To our inquiry, a Martinez campaign spokesman, Nick Hudson, pointed out a July 31, 2014, city report including an illustration stating that 183,000 of the city’s 331,000 households in 2012 (55 percent) were renters--a proportion in keeping with trends in 2000 and 2008, the report says. By contrast, 148,000 households, 45 percent, were owners. Hudson also forwarded a web link to a city-generated chart drawing on the 2010 U.S. Census indicating 51 percent of Austin’s residents were renters that year. To get our own fix on this, we queried Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, who said by email Martinez’s claim is supported by the best available resource, American Community Survey data annually gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the surveys taken from 2010 through 2012, Potter said, 418,138, or 52 percent, of an estimated 799,183 Austin residents lived in rental units compared with 381,045 residents, or 48 percent, who were owners. He said the 2012 survey alone suggests 432,400, 53 percent, of the city’s 823,340 residents were renters compared with 390,940, nearly 48 percent, who were owners, Potter said. Separately, a bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, responded to our inquiry by emailing a chart based on the bureau’s 2012 survey suggesting there were more ""housing units"" rented in Austin than units that were occupied by owners. According to the survey, 183,080 of 330,838 housing units (55 percent) were renter-occupied with 147,758 (45 percent) being owner-occupied. (We suspect these figures were the basis of the information in the report noted by Martinez’s camp.) Occupied housing units 2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 American Community Survey (chart received by email from Robert Bernstein of the bureau).

Wisconsin ranks low in expectations on school testing, Scott Walker challenger Mary Burke says
","Much attention is paid to how well Wisconsin schoolchildren score on standardized tests -- what percentage of them are proficient, for example, in reading or math. But states define proficient differently. So just how rigorous are Wisconsin’s standards? Mary Burke, the Democratic challenger to Gov. Scott Walker, raised that issue in response to a question posed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a news article published Aug. 11, 2014. The Journal Sentinel asked: ""Common Core: Should Wisconsin scrap or modify these academic standards for students? If so, should the state cover the costs of doing so for schools?"" Burke replied by saying, in part: ""Common Core is an opportunity, if implemented correctly, to make sure our young people are ready for the workplace or college. Students will have the critical thinking skills needed to compete with students in any state or any country. We absolutely need higher standards in Wisconsin –- we are currently 38th in the country in terms of proficiency standards –- and implementing Common Core correctly will do just that."" Let's see if, on a national scale, Wisconsin’s standards are relatively weak.   Federal statistics One authority on proficiency standards is the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics, which does ""mapping studies."" States develop their own assessments and set their own standards as to what it means for a student to be proficient. What the mapping studies do is compare each state's standard for proficient performance by placing the various state standards onto a common scale. The latest mapping study was done in 2011, based on data from 2009. Results from testing of fourth- and eighth-graders on reading and math were used. The study found that the proficiency standards set by most states are at or below what the U.S. Department of Education defines as Basic. Basic is defined as ""partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade."" There was no ranking of how states and the District of Columbia fared overall. But there was a ranking by grade and subject. Here are Wisconsin's rankings:   4th grade reading 39th--behind bordering states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa 4th grade math 30th--ahead of Illinois and Michigan 8th grade reading 43rd--behind all four bordering states 8th grade math 37th--ahead of Illinois and Michigan   Burke’s evidence To back Burke’s claim, her campaign cited a slightly different and newer ranking from a September 2013 article in the Education Next journal. The lead author was Paul E. Peterson, the journal’s editor and director of Harvard University's Program on Education Policy and Governance. Peterson uses a different methodology than the mapping study and used more recent data, from 2011. Peterson also utilizes the fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math testing, but gives the states an overall rank, as well as a letter grade. Here’s how Wisconsin and its neighboring states fared among the 50 states and the District of Columbia:   State Rank Grade Minnesota 8th B Wisconsin 38th C-minus Iowa 41st D-plus Illinois 46th D Michigan 48th D-minus 
The three top-ranked states -- Massachusetts, Tennessee and Missouri -- were the only ones that earned an A. The article emphasized that the rankings list states in terms of how high their expectations are, not in terms of what percentage of the students are proficient. Another comparison  In July 2010, the Washington, D.C.-based Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education, compared standards in the various states to those of Common Core, the voluntary English and math standards that Wisconsin and nearly every other state has adopted. The study ranked Wisconsin based on the standards it had in place before adopting Common Core. For English standards, the institute gave Wisconsin a grade of D, saying the standards ""are generally clearly written and presented, and include some rigorous content. Unfortunately, their failure to provide grade-specific expectations creates critical gaps in content that leave teachers without the guidance they need to drive rigorous curriculum, assessment and instruction."" For math standards, Wisconsin received an F. The math standards ""are scant,"" the institute said. ""They are provided only for the end of fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades, and very few standards are provided for each grade band."" Peterson, the professor who ranked Wisconsin 38th, told us that since Wisconsin has adopted Common Core, its future ranking could change once it administers tests with the new definitions for proficiency. But those rankings won’t be done for a few years, he said. Our rating Burke said Wisconsin is ""38th in the country in terms of (school) proficiency standards."" The ranking she cites is from a respected national source and is the latest available, although it is based on 2011 data. Wisconsin has since adopted the new Common Core standards, which could change the state’s ranking in the future. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, we give Burke a Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/22/mary-burke/wisconsin-ranks-low-expectations-school-testing-sc/
"['Georgia', 'Democratic Party  of Georgia']","
Jobs did go overseas; but how many unclear
","Jobs are always a big issue in elections.   This week’s federal employment report gave Georgia the dubious honor of ranking 50th among the states and District of Columbia. With Georgia’s 7.8 percent jobless rate, only Mississippi fared worse.   Lest anyone miss the blame, the Democratic Party of Georgia recently focused on jobs to draw a distinction between its nominee for the U.S. Senate, former Points of Light CEO Michelle Nunn, and her GOP rival. David Perdue ""led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas"" during his business career, spokesman Michael Smith said in a July 28 press release.. Smith cited Perdue’s leadership role at three firms – Sara Lee, Haggar Clothing Co. and Pillowtex – to arrive at the thousands figure. ""It’s how he spent his career, looking to manufacture goods abroad instead of in the United States,"" Smith said. ""That was his management style."" Leveling that kind of charge requires a deep dive into Perdue’s career as an executive, starting when he was senior vice president for Sara Lee in 1992. Perdue told PolitiFact Georgia he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to open up the company’s Asia operations. His task, which he accomplished, was to increase manufacturing and contracts in the region. For the first three years of the decade, the company went on a spending spree, including acquiring undergarment maker Playtex in 1991, which focused heavily on foreign firms. By 1994, Perdue’s final year with Sara Lee, the company announced a major restructuring that eliminated between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs worldwide. Among the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down. The breakdown of jobs lost at overseas plants could not be determined, though a 1994 statement from Sara Lee said most of those jobs were at European operations. Perdue’s stint at Haggar is even clearer. As senior vice president from 1994 to 1998, Perdue was in charge of international operations and later also domestic operations at the clothing firm. Democrats point to the loss of about 1,950 domestic jobs at Haggar between the key years of 1996 and 1998, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In that same period, domestic manufacturing dropped from 29 percent to 12 percent of operations. At least one domestic plant, in Texas, was shut down as part of discontinuing production of men’s suits. Those same SEC filings, though, show that workers in foreign countries also dropped – if only by 65 jobs – during that period. Sales, likewise, were down, from $437 million to $402 million, records show. ""It looks like they shifted some production overseas, but not jobs, given the numbers,"" said Rob Bliss, a finance professor at Wake Forest University. ""U.S. facilities were probably bloated and (cutting) them had a big effect on domestic employment."" Perdue had a similar goal for Pillowtex, where he wanted to improve sales through aggressive marketing and branding and moving more work overseas. Shifting manufacturing abroad would put Pillowtex on the same page as other textile firms that had already moved offshore and would also save some jobs domestically, Perdue said. The plan was never put into place, though, after Perdue and other top managers found a $40 million-$50 million pension liability that had gone unnoticed as the firm emerged from bankruptcy. Instead of a turnaround, Pillowtex opted to sell off some pieces and eventually shut down entirely. Perdue left as CEO after seven months, with a $1.7 million paycheck, and 7,650 people lost their jobs, including 300 laid off from Pillowtex’s first bankruptcy. In an interview with PolitiFact, Perdue acknowledges that some of his employers, and other firms, have developed a so-called ""diversified matrix"" that calls for shifting some operations overseas in a bid to save money – and American jobs. It is not a simple matter of trading a job for job, he said, a premise backed up by the complicated income statements and financial reports from the companies themselves. ""We have total industries that have been decimated by the tax laws and regulations,"" Perdue said. ""Some of that manufacturing can come back if we cut our corporate tax rate and stop penalizing foreign profits to encourage reinvesting in the United States."" With that, we get into the question of political policy. The Democrats’ charge focused more on overall loss of jobs to overseas operations. It’s nearly impossible to prove, or disprove, the number of lost jobs at Perdue’s firms that went aboard. The only documented actual domestic job losses are from Haggar, but those jobs did not go overseas. Undoubtedly, records and news coverage show some job shift did occur. Even the candidate acknowledges as much. He also admits he would have sent jobs - potentially thousands of them - overseas at Pillowtex before a free fall pre-empted his plans and shut down that firm for good. The Democratic Party’s statement is partially accurate. Perdue did lead efforts that resulted in jobs being created overseas while jobs were cut in this country. How many jobs, it’s hard to say. And there is a lot of context needed to understand exactly why companies employed this strategy.

Democratic ad says Iowa GOP candidate Joni Ernst backs privatizing Social Security
","The news networks may be focusing on protests in Ferguson, Mo., the rise of the extremist group ISIS in Iraq and the spread of the Ebola virus in west Africa. But on television screens in the heartland, the fiscal future of Social Security is attracting significant notice, at least where campaign ads are concerned. We recently checked claims by a Democratic House candidate and a Republican-aligned advocacy group that told less than the full story about where members of Congress stand on the question of raising the retirement age for receiving Social Security. Now we’re looking at a claim in Iowa’s highly competitive open-seat Senate race, where the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- the party’s Senate-campaign arm -- has opened up a new front against Republican nominee Joni Ernst. The ad opens by spotlighting Ernst’s endorsement from (and grateful words for) former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has become an icon for some conservative Republicans but a polarizing figure for many Democrats. ""Joni Ernst would be another tea party vote in the Senate,"" the ad says in part. ""Ernst would privatize Social Security. ... Palin, Ernst: Too extreme for Iowa."" We wondered: Is the ad correct that Ernst ""would privatize Social Security""? We decided to take a closer look. A primer on privatization First, some background about Social Security privatization. Currently, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients are paid from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have advocated turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is that retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that the beneficiary could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither is possible under the current Social Security program. One of the most high-profile proposals along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into ""personal retirement accounts."" Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation. A few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress. These two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom -- that changing the way Social Security operates is the ""third rail"" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. For this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term ""privatization"" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology. What Ernst said The visuals in the DSCC ad offer a footnote to support its claim about Ernst -- a primary debate aired on KCCI, the CBS affiliate in Des Moines. Here’s the full text of what Ernst said during that debate in response to a question about the future of Social Security: ""I do think we have to keep the promises that are made to today's seniors, absolutely. So to do this, we do have to reform Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And the way we do that with Social Security is by looking at transitioning our younger workers onto individual plans or individual savings accounts, whether that’s tied to the market, whether it’s based on interest rates -- however we want to do that, we can have that discussion. But the way we are protecting our seniors is by transitioning our younger workers. And we can do that, but we have to keep our promises to seniors."" This passage makes clear that Ernst is open to the idea of a ""market""-based Social Security overhaul. However, there’s reason to believe the ad goes too far in how it describes Ernst’s stance. Where the ad goes too far One stretch in the ad involves the words ""would"" and ""privatize."" Ernst was vague about specifics, relying on phrases like, ""however we want to do that"" and ""we can have that discussion."" The issues page on her campaign website is similarly vague. ""Joni believes strongly that Social Security and Medicare must be preserved and protected for our seniors of today and tomorrow. She opposes any efforts to change the promised benefits for today’s seniors. At the same time she supports reforms that will strengthen both Social Security and Medicare to ensure the long-term health of both programs for her daughters and grandchildren and their generations."" Would she make private investments optional and valid for only a portion of the taxes paid into the system, as was the case under both the Bush and Ryan plans? Based on Ernst’s public comments, it’s impossible to know. Ernst’s decision to avoid the term ""privatization"" and keep under wraps whatever roadmap she favors may amount to a dodge, but it’s what she’s advocating, and the ad ignores that nuance. Meanwhile, the second problem is that Ernst specifically limited her proposed reforms to ""younger workers,"" emphasizing that ""we have to keep the promises that are made to today's seniors."" The ad doesn’t note that limitation -- an omission that’s only exaggerated by the fact that the ad uses an image of a senior citizen, rather than a younger worker. Our ruling The DSCC said Ernst ""would privatize Social Security."" In the KCCI debate, Ernst did say pretty clearly that she supports ""reform"" for Social Security in order to keep it fiscally sound over the long term. However, by using the word ""privatization,"" the ad overstates the degree of clarity in the policy changes Ernst says she supports, while also glossing over the fact that she limited her proposed changes to ""younger workers.""

Talk show host: Police kill more whites than blacks
","The turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., has spurred many assertions that blacks are unfairly victimized by police. Conservative talk show host Michael Medved aimed to turn that argument on its head. In a post-show summary on his website this week, Medved cast police as the protectors of African-Americans. Medved said that blacks are much more likely to be killed by another black person than they are by a cop. ""When it comes to keeping black youths from violent death, police aren’t the problem – in fact, they’re a crucial part of any solution,"" Medved said. As for the charge that police target blacks, Medved said the opposite is true. ""More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings,"" he said. We asked Medved’s producers for the source of that claim and did not hear back before we published. Thanks to the good work by the team at fivethirtyeight.com, we know that there is no precise accounting of how many people the police kill. An unknown number of deaths go unreported because the coroner failed to note it or police departments categorize deaths in different ways, or some other data glitch got in the way. However, even the incomplete figures gathered by the government tell us that Medved could be partially correct and still ignore a huge piece of the picture. Yes, more whites than blacks die as a result of an encounter with police, but whites also represent a much bigger chunk of the total population.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on fatal injuries from 1999 to 2011 and one category is homicides by legal intervention. The term ""legal intervention"" covers any situation when a person dies at the hands of anyone authorized to use deadly force in the line of duty. Over the span of more than a decade, 2,151 whites died by being shot by police compared to 1,130 blacks. In that respect, Medved is correct. However, Brian Forst, a professor in the Department of Justice, Law and Criminology at American University, said this difference is predictable. ""More whites are killed by the police than blacks primarily because whites outnumber blacks in the general population by more than five to one,"" Forst said. The country is about 63 percent white and 12 percent black. Rather than comparing the raw numbers, you can look at the likelihood that a person will die due to ""legal intervention"" in the same way you might look at the chance a person will die in a car accident or a disease like lung cancer. When you do that, the numbers flip. A 2002 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that the death rate due to legal intervention was more than three times higher for blacks than for whites in the period from 1988 to 1997. That is not the final story though. There are different theories as to why the black rate is so much higher. Candace McCoy is a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York. McCoy said blacks might be more likely to have a violent encounter with police because they are convicted of felonies at a higher rate than whites. Felonies include everything from violent crimes like murder and rape, to property crimes like burglary and embezzlement, to drug trafficking and gun offenses. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that in 2004, state courts had over 1 million felony convictions. Of those, 59 percent were committed by whites and 38 percent by blacks. But when you factor in the population of whites and blacks, the felony rates stand at 330 per 100,000 for whites and 1,178 per 100,000 for blacks. That’s more than a three-fold difference. McCoy noted that this has more to do with income than race. The felony rates for poor whites are similar to those of poor blacks. ""Felony crime is highly correlated with poverty, and race continues to be highly correlated with poverty in the USA,"" McCoy said. ""It is the most difficult and searing problem in this whole mess."" On his website, Medved tried to link police killings with whether someone resisted arrest. ""If you defer and don’t try to challenge a police officer, he may insult you but he won’t kill you,"" Medved said. But criminologist Lorie Fridell at the University of South Florida told PunditFact that the research on this point is mixed. Some studies that factor in the level of resistance show that race doesn’t matter, and some show that it does. Our ruling Medved said that police kill more whites than blacks. In absolute terms, that is accurate. However, the statement ignores that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. When comparing death rates, blacks are about three times more likely than whites to die in a confrontation with police. Medved’s statement leaves out significant information that would change someone’s understanding of the topic. We rate his claim Half True. Update: The number of deaths due to legal intervention were changed after we initially published this report to include only firearms deaths, which lowered the overall totals. The rating remains the same. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/496cb988-8485-4be0-9ea5-d480ed262d1e",/factchecks/2014/aug/21/michael-medved/talk-show-host-police-kill-more-whites-blacks/

Rand Paul says federal program incentivizes police militarization
","With heavily armored vehicles stationed in the streets and law enforcement officers dressed in camouflage, many have dubbed Ferguson, Mo., a ""war zone."" After a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown Aug. 9, much of the conversation has focused on race relations, and the interactions between police and the community. There’s also been criticism of local police forces using military-style equipment and generally giving the appearance of conducting a military operation. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., weighed in on this topic in a Time magazine column, where he said big government’s to blame for this trend. ""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement."" Many recent media reports have tied police militarization to a federal program that gives surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., has announced that he’s working on a bill to amend this program, in order to scale back police militarization, in light of the situation in Ferguson. We wanted to know more about the program and what experts had to say about it. They told us that the program certainly has contributed to a militarized police force, but that's not the only reason. What is this program, and is it to blame? Paul’s talking about the 1033 program, known as such because it’s outlined in section 1033 of the 1997 National Defense Authorization Act. Congress first approved the program in the 1990 National Defense Authorization Act (then section 1208), as part of the country’s war on drugs, which began in the 1970s. Law enforcement agencies felt outgunned -- police carried handguns, while drug criminals wielded assault rifles. However, much of the equipment the agencies wanted was far out of their price range. The 1033 program allows local law enforcement agencies to acquire surplus military equipment, at nearly no cost (they have to pay for transporting the equipment). This ranges from field gear -- like assault weapons, armored vehicles, night-vision goggles and bulletproof vests -- to office supplies -- like filing cabinets, computers and desks. More than 8,000 agencies participate in the 1033 program, which has given out more than $5 billion in property since it started, according to the website of the Defense Logistics Agency, the government body that oversees the program. (To be clear, the incentive here is the free equipment alone, not any additional payment or reward for accepting it.) Law enforcement agencies apply for specific equipment through the Defense Logistics Agency. Agencies are given preference if they request equipment specifically for counter-drug and counter-terrorism purposes. Additionally, since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have received grants from the Department of Homeland Security to address potential terrorist threats, and some have used those grants to purchase military gear. Public opinion on police using military equipment varies with context, said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation and a former police chief. For example, in the case of a major bank robbery where multiple robbers have machine guns and are holding people hostage, the community would likely be glad their local police has comparable weapons, an armored vehicle and protective gear. However, when police break out that sort of equipment and military-style tactics at a peaceful protest, they look understandably bad, Bueermann said. For example, HBO television host John Oliver ridiculed police in Keene, N.H., recently for requesting a ""military-grade armored personnel truck,"" citing the town’s annual pumpkin festival as a potential terrorist target. (We rated Oliver’s statement True.) What else is at play? We spoke with many experts, and all agreed that there is an upward trend of police militarization. They said the 1033 program has accelerated this trend, but it’s not the sole cause. Much of the change is rooted in police culture. In fact, many of the experts we spoke with said that absent the 1033 program, police would still want military-grade equipment -- they just wouldn’t be able to afford it. ""Militarization is not just equipment -- it’s an ideology and a mindset,"" said Victor Kappeler, associate dean of justice studies at Eastern Kentucky University. The shift from a community service culture to one that is more militaristic began in the 1960s with the rise of SWAT teams -- made prominent by the Los Angeles Police Department and their response to the violent Watts Riots, said Brian Buchner, president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. Police departments across the country quickly created their own SWAT teams elite squads that used military-like tactics. Police started to use SWAT-like tactics in less hostile situations -- such as no-knock raids to execute low-level drug busts -- because of a small (and in some cases unreasonable)  fear that they would encounter heavily armed suspects, Buchner said. ""That training seeped into other parts of police operations and police culture,"" Buchner said. The 1033 program has exacerbated the problem, because in the past, when police agencies didn’t have this equipment, they were unable to act as a military force, Kappeler said. Instead of responding to a protest with armored vehicles, they would have had to address the issue in a ""community-based"" way. But it’s not just the government pushing this equipment on law enforcement agencies. Private defense manufacturers have also started to make dual-purpose equipment that they can market to the military, as well as civilian law enforcement agencies, said Kathleen Campbell, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who studies role convergence between police and the military. (Campbell asked us to note that her views and research are her own and do not reflect the views of West Point, the army or the federal government.) Now when police officers see military-style equipment and uniforms in catalogs, they think that’s what they’re supposed to look like -- perpetuating the culture, said John DeCarlo, an associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police chief, in a Washington Post interview. Culture spillover also comes from interactions between the police and military, Campbell said, noting that the two collaborate in anti-drug and anti-terror efforts. Aspects of police work that mirror the military -- like officer hierarchy and a focus on discipline -- make the profession a good fit for former military personnel. A 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics study found that 10 percent of all employed male veterans ages 18 to 54 work in some sort of protective service, which includes police, sheriff officers, correctional officers, bailiffs and security workers. The recent recession also could have forced police to lose sight of community policing, Bueermann said. Stripped down to their bare bones, some agencies have lost community policing positions, like school resource officers, and are left only with the law enforcement positions. This makes them appear less like they are there to help the community and more like they are there to control it. And it has made agencies more inclined to take advantage of programs like 1033 because they can get free equipment. Our ruling Paul said, ""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts."" We found that the government’s 1033 program, which gives surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, has contributed to police militarization by offering free equipment. But it’s not the only thing. Police culture has shifted toward militarization for a number of reasons over the past 40 years. The program (and Washington) might not be the cause of police militarization, but it does incentivize and allow that culture to continue.

Black unemployment three times higher in Ferguson, because of Obama, Lou Dobbs claims
","Fox News host Lou Dobbs criticized President Barack Obama for not going firsthand to Ferguson, Mo., to calm tensions after the killing of an unarmed 18-year-old African-American by a white police officer. Obama, Dobbs claimed, bears responsibility for the economic issues that have contributed to the tensions in Ferguson. ""Black unemployment is three times that of white unemployment,"" Dobbs said on Aug. 19’s America’s Newsroom. ""The community itself has a 13 percent unemployment rate, more than double that of the national average. The household net worth in that community is $10,000, a third less than the national average."" ""These are the results of policies on the part of the state government, the local community, and the president of the United States,"" Dobbs said, arguing that President Obama should assure residents that ""there will be honest and forthright dealing"" with ""no ambiguity about the conclusions."" Obama needs to see, Dobbs said, ""what happens when you don’t push job creation, you don’t push prosperity for all Americans."" Linking Obama’s economic policy to the tensions in Ferguson, a town of 21,000, is a fairly significant charge. So we wanted to check Dobbs’ claim that because of Obama’s failure to ""push job creation,"" the black unemployment rate in Ferguson is three times higher than the white unemployment rate. Ferguson’s unemployment rate The most recent unemployment figures for Ferguson come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which asks an annual sample of 1 in 38 households about their demographics, background and finances. Ferguson’s small enough that the Census only produces figures over a three-year period, the most recent of which track 2010-2012. Over that period, 16 percent of the black labor force in Ferguson was unemployed, compared to 8.5 percent of the white labor force. That’s a ratio of about 1.9; not the three times that Dobbs alleged. Dobbs' figure is more accurate for St. Louis County, which includes Ferguson. In 2012, St. Louis County had a black unemployment rate of 17.8 percent, 3.1 times the white unemployment rate of 5.7 percent. But Ferguson makes up just 2 percent of St. Louis County in terms of population. Dobbs is also closer if you include Ferguson Census figures from 2008-12. In that scenario, the black unemployment is 2.8 times the white unemployment rate. Natalie Holmes, a researcher for the Brookings Institute, told us the best statistics to use are the Ferguson numbers from 2010-12, because they are both more current and ""capture less of the recession."" Putting the racial employment gap in context Dobbs is right that Ferguson’s unemployment rate of 13 percent, according to the American Community Survey’s 2010-12 estimates, is roughly twice the current national average of 6.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By most measures, Ferguson is not a prosperous town. But the gap between black and white unemployment in Ferguson is nowhere near unique. In July, the national black unemployment rate was 11.4 percent. That’s about 2.2 times the 5.3 percent white unemployment rate, according to the BLS -- a bigger gap, proportionally, than in Ferguson, with the caveat that the numbers from Ferguson aren’t as recent. So Ferguson is reasonably representative when it comes to the racial employment gap. More critically for Dobbs, this isn’t a recent phenomenon somehow created or exacerbated by Obama. Since the BLS began keeping unemployment data by race in 1954, the black unemployment rate has consistently been about twice as high as the white unemployment rate.  According to the Pew Research Center, which published the above graph in 2013, the discrepancy between black and white unemployment was highest in the late 1980s, and lowest during the Great Recession. The average ratio between black unemployment and white unemployment since the BLS began keeping data is 2.2 -- exactly what it was in July. Put simply, African-Americans have been 2.2 times more likely to be unemployed since 1954 than whites. Researchers haven’t reached a consensus on why this gap persists: explanations include, according to Pew, ""differing industrial distribution of black and white workers,"" a ""skills gap,"" and the ""‘last hired, first fired’ hypothesis."" Dobbs goes too far in pinning the blame on Obama. Experts have consistently told us and our colleagues at PolitiFact that although government policies can affect employment figures, other economic factors are typically at play; in this case, the Great Recession and subsequent recovery. And according to Elizabeth Kneebone of the Brookings Institute, Ferguson’s economic downturn over the last decade is a potent example of the general increase of suburban poverty in America as more money flows to urban areas. Our ruling Dobbs said that because Obama failed to ""push job creation,"" the black unemployment rate in Ferguson is three times higher than the white unemployment rate. First and foremost, Dobbs’ numbers are off. The most recent and best available statistics say the black unemployment rate is 1.9 times higher than the white unemployment rate in Ferguson (16 percent to 8.5 percent). Second, that has little to do with Obama. Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping data in 1954, African-Americans have been nationwide are more likely to be unemployed than whites.

Sarah Palin incorrect Rosemary Lehmberg's office convened grand jury that indicted Rick Perry
","In an online commentary, Sarah Palin suggested a sign of Democratic corruption is the Texas district attorney whose resignation was sought by Republican Gov. Rick Perry convened the grand jury that indicted him. We can't judge Palin’s corruption opinion. But the former Alaska governor's claim about the DA’s connection to the grand jury is incorrect. Palin, in a commentary posted on the Fox News website Aug. 17, 2014, said: ""This ridiculous politically motivated ‘indictment’ of"" Perry ""stems from the ugly thug tactics of the ‘politics of personal destruction’ that the left is known for."" ""First and foremost,"" Palin said, ""today's liberals have no shame. Case in point: Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg."" Palin recapped Lehmberg’s drunken driving conviction from 2013 and noted that Lehmberg refused to resign afterward. ""Lehmberg's D.A.’s office runs the state’s Public Integrity Unit, which prosecutes public crimes like government corruption,"" Palin wrote, and after Perry tried to get her to resign or face his veto of the unit’s state funding, Palin said, Democrat Lehmberg’s ""liberal supporters filed an ethics complaint against Perry..."" Subsequently, Palin wrote, the ""Travis County D.A.'s Office, still under Lehmberg, convened a grand jury, and – surprise, surprise! – Perry was ‘indicted.’"" It’s a fact that a liberal-leaning group, Texans for Public Justice, which monitors the influence of money in state politics and the courts, submitted a complaint to the Travis County district attorney’s office on June 14, 2013 about Perry’s actions. The complaint was submitted a day after the Austin American-Statesman revealed Perry was threatening to veto a $7.5 million, two-year appropriation to the Public Integrity Unit, housed in the district attorney’s office, unless Lehmberg resigned. Texans for Public Justice’s complaint alleged that the threat amounted to a violation of state laws prohibiting coercion of public officials. The day the complaint came in, Gregg Cox, the attorney who heads the Public Integrity Unit, told the Statesman that Lehmberg’s office would not investigate it. ""It’s clear, it would not be appropriate for us to have any role in this,"" Cox said then. Upshot: Lehmberg subsequently recused herself from the matter, which ended up being overseen by a Republican judge from Bexar County and a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by the judge, neither one picked by Lehmberg or her office. In checking Palin’s claim, we reached out to relevant judges and Lehmberg’s office, finding no sign the DA’s office played a role in convening or guiding the grand jury that indicted Perry. By telephone, Bert Richardson of San Antonio, the senior state district judge overseeing the Perry case, and Republican Billy Ray Stubblefield, the Williamson County state district judge who appointed Richardson to oversee the review, declined to comment on Palin’s claim. But an Austin-based judge who momentarily managed the complaint and the Travis County assistant district attorney who works with most grand juries each said Lehmberg’s office had no role in convening the grand jury that indicted Perry. Julie Kocurek, who presides over the 390th criminal district court in Travis County, called Palin’s statement ""completely and absolutely false."" And why? Kocurek said that after Lehmberg’s office received the complaint about Perry, lawyers from the office brought it to Kocurek  in her capacity as presiding judge for the county’s criminal district courts. The DA’s office also brought a motion to recuse its attorneys from acting on the complaint because, Kocurek said, Lehmberg was obviously entangled. Similarly, Kocurek said, she recused herself as a judge in the matter given that she had worked for the DA’s office in the past and continued to routinely work with Lehmberg on matters of criminal justice. In accord with state law, Kocurek said, her next step was to turn the matter over to Stubblefield,  the presiding judge of the 3rd Judicial District that includes Travis County. Kocurek said Stubblefield then appointed Richardson, ""a very non-partisan straight-shooter judge,"" to handle proceedings involving the complaint. Richardson’s job, she said, was to appoint an attorney to serve as the district attorney in the matter; that appointee, Michael McCrum of San Antonio, subsequently worked with the Travis County special grand jury named in April 2014 that ultimately indicted Perry. McCrum didn’t respond to our telephone inquiry. Richardson, Kocurek said, sat in her courtroom to impanel the grand jury, which consisted of a dozen residents and two alternates drawn from a pool of 80 county residents created at random. ""They didn’t know what case they’d be hearing,"" Kocurek said. We also drew a recap of the Perry matter from Lehmberg’s office. Gary Cobb, director of the office’s grand jury division, said by phone that when the TPJ complaint was received, the office recognized it couldn’t reasonably handle the topic. ""Because of a clear conflict of interest, we didn’t do anything but receive the complaint and recuse ourselves, putting in motion the process of having a special prosecutor assigned to it,"" Cobb said. The office-wide recusal, Cobb said, was sought so that ""later on we wouldn’t be accused of having some kind of undue influence."" We asked if Lehmberg’s office played some role in choosing who would serve on the special grand jury that indicted Perry. Cobb said not, adding that Richardson or Kocurek would have notified the district clerk’s office that a pool of potential jurors, chosen randomly from adult residents of the county with a Texas driver’s license or state-issued identification card, was needed on the date (April 14, 2014) Richardson wanted to impanel the grand jury. The DA’s office ""had no role"" in the grand jury’s impaneling, Cobb said. ""We don’t even show up."" Generally, Cobb said, the office has no role in determining which residents are in the larger pool of potential jurors; that duty, he said, resides with the county’s district clerk. After the special grand jury’s initial three-month term ended, Cobb said, its term was extended another three months. ""They have a right and can request an extension for an additional three months in order to complete business,"" Cobb said. ""They did make the request and they did extend."" Generally, Cobb said, ""we went out of our way to make sure we didn’t do anything that even gave the appearance of having any kind of involvement in the investigation for this case against Rick Perry,"" though occasionally the office had to coordinate schedules so different grand juries weren’t simultaneously trying to occupy the room the county sets aside for grand juries. Our ruling Palin said that under Lehmberg, the ""Travis County D.A.’s office"" convened the grand jury that indicted Perry. A special grand jury consisting of Travis County citizens indicted Perry in August 2014. But Lehmberg’s office played no role in organizing the jurors. Early on, Lehmberg’s office recused itself from handling the complaint that eventually resulted in the grand jury whose secret deliberations culminated in Perry’s felony charges. A senior district judge from San Antonio, chosen by a judge based in Williamson County, impaneled the grand jury. The San Antonio judge picked a San Antonio lawyer to prosecute the case.

Story that Obama supporter was behind wheel of car in Charlottesville is fake news
","A fake news story falsely claimed that white supremacist Jason Kessler was the one responsible for killing a protester in Charlottesville, Va., in addition to meeting former President Barack Obama as a Democratic supporter.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to stamp out fake news. The post began by claiming Kessler, who organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12, had been exposed as a former liberal, Occupy Wall Street protester and Obama supporter. The post included this tweet from conservative writer Dinesh D’Souza: Well, well. The white supremacist organizer of #Charlottesville was an Obama supporter & Occupy Wall Street activist https://t.co/hI5PxNUmb7 That part, at least, is accurate, as D’Souza’s link to the Southern Poverty Law Center showed. Kessler has said he changed ideologies near the end of 2013. But that’s about all in the story that’s true. The story said Kessler was the person accused of being ""the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road."" That’s not the case. Charlottesville police arrested James Alex Fields Jr. for driving his car into a crowd of liberal protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 more people. There have been several fake news stories attempting to shift the blame for the killing or suggesting Democrats were behind the protests. This attempt to put the blame on Kessler included the assertion in the post that he visited Obama in the White House in 2016, including the crude Photoshopped image at the top of this page with the story. That photo is actually a White House image from 2011, showing actor Will Ferrell visiting Obama in the Oval Office (Ferrell’s wife Viveca Paulin has been cropped out):

Death rates for white men up 20 percent, GOP strategist says
","President Donald Trump’s supporters continue to back him because they felt so besieged by the political landscape and life in general that it’s literally killing them, a GOP strategist said on ABC’s This Week. Alex Castellanos, who has worked as a consultant for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, said during an Aug. 20, 2017, discussion on the show that Trump’s backers have stuck with him through controversies because they didn’t see an alternative option. Democrats attacking Trump’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., just fed into growing bitterness among his base over their dire socioeconomic situation, he said. ""What I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was, the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election,"" Castellanos said. ""No. White working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said, ‘no wonder they're resentful.’"" We wondered about his statistic that working-class white men are dying at a higher rate than before. It turns out that researchers have identified increasing mortality among the white working class, but it’s not as high for men as the 20 percent number Castellanos cited. In response to our questions, Castellanos sent us two articles from the New York Times and the Guardian about a 2015 paper by husband-and-wife Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case. Their research showed that death rates for middle-aged, white Americans had been going up, while they had been going down for every other age, race and ethnic group. Those rates also had been falling in other countries. This was a reversal of a years-long trend in which mortality rates had been steadily decreasing, meaning that Americans across many groups were living longer. From 1978 to 1998, white Americans were seeing mortality rates fall about 2 percent each year. So the fact that Case and Deaton found an increase was considered significant. But Deaton told us the 20 percent number Castellanos cited for men was too high. (That’s a number the Guardian reported, but it cites the increase as being for ""the death rate for white Americans aged 45 to 54."") ""In our 2015 PNAS paper, we say that for all white non-Hispanics (men and women together), mortality rates for those aged 45 to 54 rose at half of one percent per year, which from 1998 to 2013 is 7.8 percent, not 20 percent, and certainly not 20 percent for men only,"" Deaton wrote via email. Case added that that was for all levels of education, not just people who didn’t have a college degree. Deaton and Case’s study showed that mortality rates were climbing for white, non-Hispanic Americans aged 45 to 54 with a high school education or less. The research further showed that deaths were up from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Mortality rates rose for all education groups, but ""those with less education saw the most marked increases,"" the paper read. It’s important to note that overall mortality rates for African-Americans were still higher than whites. But African-Americans still recorded an overall drop in the same time period, not an increase. Researchers were surprised by the Case and Deaton study in 2015. Dartmouth economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner said in an analysis that while most Americans’ life expectancies had gone up in the face of the Great Recession and rising income inequality, the study’s findings ""dashed even this cautiously optimistic view of the past several decades."" ""These trends are indeed concentrated among the least educated Americans who never attended college,"" Meara told PolitiFact. ""Of note, the trends do not apply to current retirees, nor youth, both groups that have experienced mortality improvements in recent decades."" Others questioned the paper’s results. Columbia University statistics professor Andrew Gelman argued that the situation wasn’t as dire as it first appeared. He said that some statistical adjustments showed that middle-aged white women largely made up the difference in mortality rates, and the figures evened out when you combined men and women. Deaton and Case addressed some of these doubts in a 2017 follow-up to their paper. While the 2015 data didn’t focus on differences between men and women, their latest work did, along with adjusting their age groups. ""For non-Hispanic white men aged 30 to 59 without a four-year college degree, age-adjusted all-cause mortality rose by 7 percent from 1998 to 2015,"" Deaton said of the latest data. Again they found that a lack of education was a major factor for increasing mortality rates, among other issues. (Gelman and Jonathan Auerbach, a Columbia doctoral student, again disputed their findings.) ""We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next, in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health, is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education,"" the 2017 paper read. There’s evidence that whites with less education on the lower end of the income spectrum didn’t make up the bulk of Trump’s voters. The Washington Post reported that his base is largely affluent Republicans, whether they have a college education or not. Deaton said Castellanos was speaking too broadly, and the spirit of his comment misses what the research really says. ""To be fair, that mortality rates are going up at all is a big deal, and is a measure of the fact that bad things are happening to these people,"" he said. Castellanos said that for the white working class, ""death rates among white men are up 20 percent."" Research has shown that death rates are up for white men, which is a cause for concern because death rates have historically declined. But that research is not without controversy. Also, the researchers who documented the increase in death rates say it’s not as alarmingly high as 20 percent just for white men. A more accurate estimate would be around 7 percent. Castellanos has a point about increased death rates among whites, but he incorrectly cited figures from the study.

Blog posts wrongly say there's proof Democrats hired actors to play white nationalists
","An Internet post that claimed Democrats planned the demonstrations against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., tracks back to a Craigslist ad calling for people to be paid for filler crowds in North Carolina. ""Internet sleuths just found the smoking gun on Dems planning violence in Charlottesville,"" declared the headline on an Aug. 14, 2017, post on NewsUpToday.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to curb fake news on the site. The post, which we also saw on other websites, said that violent clashes Aug. 12 between white nationalists and people demonstrating against their Unite the Right rally were possibly the result of a coordinated protest. ""The media flurry after the confusing happenings in Charlottesville yesterday is fueling violence in this country and it appears that this is exactly what the Dems want,"" the post read. ""Users on Reddit found a potential smoking gun Craigslist post seeking to hire protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina for ‘rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.’"" The post included an image of a Craigslist ad for a company called Crowds On Demand, ""a Los Angeles-based Public Relations firm specializing in innovative events."" The ad, which said it had been posted a week prior, was ""looking for enthusiastic actors and photographers in the Charlotte, NC area to participate in our events."" Note that said Charlotte, N.C., and not Charlottesville, Va. Both cities were named for King George III’s wife, Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, but that’s about all the two places share. Online detectives focused on a portion of the ad that read, ""Our events include everything from rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes."" It said the pay was typically $25 per hour, plus travel expenses to an event. The Craigslist ad asked interested people to reply to the ad, which has been repeatedly flagged for removal and then restored by Craigslist. During the research for this fact-check, it had been flagged and restored twice, but is unavailable as of this writing. ""This is highly suspicious and almost suggests that these people were being hired for the rally in Charlottesville this weekend to impersonate ‘white nationalists’ and incite violence so it would look like they were at fault for the chaos,"" the NewsUpToday.com post read. That’s hardly a ""smoking gun"" implicating Democrats in faking protests and causing violence. The Craiglist ad proves nothing at all, beyond the fact that Crowds On Demand is a real company. Crowds On Demand hires crowds for events, including political rallies. It’s run by a UCLA political science graduate named Adam Swart, who started the company in 2012. Swart has said that his company has been hired by political campaigns before, and that Crowds On Demand will work with any political party. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., for example, had paid Crowds On Demand $15 a head for people to attend events during his 2013 New York City mayoral run, the New York Post reported. Donald Trump’s presidential campaign also used crowd-hiring services, although they denied it at first. Trump used a different crowd-filling company. Swart did not return multiple phone calls and emails from PolitiFact asking for comment. He did provide a statement to Snopes.com saying Crowds On Demand didn’t work with either the Unite the Right rally or the counter-protesters. ""We were not involved in any capacity with the recent tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those impacted by the violence,"" the statement read. Some liberal event organizers we contacted denied using any service to hire protesters. Walter Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education, had obtained permits for liberal counter-demonstrations in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Trump had falsely claimed protesters on the left hadn’t gotten permits.) ""As far as I know, and I am very connected to various protest groups involved, there was no use of this kind of company,"" Heinecke told us. Scott Huffman, who heads the anti-Trump group Indivisible Charlotte in North Carolina, said he had quickly coordinated a candlelight vigil in Charlotte the evening after the attack in Charlottesville. He said close to 400 people attended after he posted a Facebook event inviting people to gather the evening of Aug. 13. Crowds On Demand was in no way affiliated with that vigil, he said. ""At no time has Indivisible Charlotte hired any actors to attend any of our rallies,"" Huffman said.  Bloggers said there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville. Several websites implied that left-leaning protesters hired crowds to impersonate white supremacists to incite violence. They pointed to a Craigslist ad  for California-based Crowds On Demand hiring paid actors in Charlotte, N.C., to join crowds at unspecified events as evidence. But wild suspicions and allegations aren’t enough to serve as proof. Crowds On Demand denied being involved, and we found no confirmation of the accusations the bloggers made.   It requires a big leap in logic to presume an ad in North Carolina has anything to do with protesters clashing in Virginia.

Was St. Petersburg the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007?
","Former Mayor Rick Baker says his management of St. Petersburg’s sewage system was so good, it earned statewide recognition. Writing on Facebook, Baker plucked a city achievement from his two terms as proof of his management prowess compared with Mayor Rick Kriseman. Kriseman, Baker’s main opponent in the Aug. 29 primary election, has been hampered by the sewage crisis that developed after the city closed a plant. Baker linked to a Tampa Bay Times story about how fixing the sewage system to reduce spills may lead to higher utility bill payments at the start of the next year. ""Who do you trust to fix this mess?"" Baker asked in a July 28 Facebook post. ""A man who caused the mess and is tens of millions of dollars over budget on the pier, police station and public relations staff? Or a mayor who made St. Petersburg the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007?"" St. Petersburg did nab its first Wastewater Collection System Award in 2007 under Baker. But Baker’s claim goes further to say St. Petersburg was the state’s best sewer system — which is not entirely true, because only utilities that applied were considered, and not every utility in the state applied. Further, Baker left out the backstory about why the city was pouring so many resources into the sewers at the time. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Baker emphasized he has been more precise with his word choice in other instances touting this accomplishment, saying the city was ""named"" the best maintained large sewer system. Still, we wanted to take a look at this specific claim. The award came from the Florida Water Environment Association, a nonprofit group that recognizes utilities for significant accomplishments related to the operation and maintenance of wastewater collection systems among other things. Lane Longley, the division manager of St. Petersburg’s Wastewater Collection Division, submitted the city’s 2007 application. Longley said St. Petersburg started adopting maintenance strategies to prevent spills rather than wait for problems to happen on their own, and those steps reduced the number and magnitude of sanitary sewer overflows from 1999 to 2007. But the award doesn’t reflect a real contest among Florida cities. For one thing, not every city applies for the award. The city of Tampa stopped applying for the FWEA awards decades ago, saying it takes up too much time to gather the information and fill out the applications. A spokeswoman for the city of Orlando said the city has heard of the FWEA, but she couldn’t point to any specific awards the city had won or applied for. And a spokeswoman with the city of Jacksonville said the city was aware of the FWEA, but said it hasn’t won or applied for any awards. What’s more, these other cities could point to other awards. Tampa won a 15-year Directors Award from a different group in 2013 for treating water significantly above minimum standards at the David L. Tippin Water Treatment Facility. Orlando won recognition from the Water Environment Federation, an FWEA sister organization. Another major issue with Baker’s claim: St. Petersburg made a lot of the improvements because it was under Florida Department of Environmental Protection consent orders that required changes be made to the sewer system. One order started in 2000 and the other started in 2002. Both went on to cover Baker’s entire tenure. After massive spills in the late 1990s, St. Petersburg entered into its first consent order. A spokeswoman for the FDEP said it covered the city's four facilities for unauthorized discharges and included corrective actions pertaining to the collection system and the facilities to address the discharges. The second consent order covered violations and discharges only from the Albert Whitted Facility. In both cases, the state agency assessed civil penalties against the city, but decided to implement programs for environmental enhancement, education and restoration in lieu of payment. Baker acknowledged the city was ordered to improve, but said the improvements were significant nonetheless. ""We invested everything that was recommended to me by either my staff or FDEP under the consent order to get the system to the point where we didn't have spills,"" Baker told the Tampa Bay Times on June 24. ""It was absolutely a success, what we did."" According to the Tampa Bay Times, the highest year of sewer spending under Baker was 2005, when the city spent $38.5 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. By the end of his second term, spending had dropped to less than $2 million a year.  Baker said he started by doing an analysis of the system to evaluate what needed to be done and to prioritize the repairs — and then developed a funding and operational plan. Along the way, the city charted its progress online. As an example, Baker’s campaign sent a graph showing that the city went beyond the requirements laid out in the consent order. The original goal was to rehabilitate 97,680 linear feet of pipe. By September 2008 a little under 160,000 linear feet of pipes had been rehabilitated, according to the city document. Still, the Baker years haven’t escaped criticism when it comes to sewers. Investigators have traced some of the blame for the city’s sewage woes to the city’s decision to close and not reopen the Albert Whitted treatment plant in 2015. That move was approved by the city council in 2011 and carried out under Kriseman. Taking the plant offline reduced capacity and led to the release of millions of gallons of sewage into the Tampa and Boca Ciega bays after major storms in 2015-16. But a draft report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also places much of the blame for the sewage spills on the Kriseman administration, as well as on the past two decades of city leadership, which includes the Baker administration from 2001-10. The FWC report said the city's many sewage problems were not adequately repaired in the past. During Baker’s tenure, most of the projects recommended in the consent order focused on clearing pipelines and hydraulic improvement to increase flow velocities. Some changes related to inflow happened as a result of a consent order, but the report goes on to blame Baker’s administration and others for not doing enough to fix leaky pipes that contributed to the city's sewage problems. ""Claims made by others that they thought the system was fixed and therefore did not need to worry about it were not based in fact,"" the report said. Baker said he made St. Petersburg the state's best-maintained large sewer system in 2007. Baker’s evidence is that the Florida Water Environment Association gave St. Petersburg a Wastewater Collection System Award. But the award was hardly a comprehensive comparison of similarly situated cities in the state. Nor is it the only award that recognizes excellence in sewage management. St. Petersburg was under consent orders for Baker’s tenure that required the city to make improvements to the system. Outside investigators looking into the current sewage crisis have put some blame on Baker’s years for not addressing some problems with the system. This statement is partially accurate, but needs clarification of additional information. We rate it Half True.

Federal judge: 'Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills'
","When a federal judge issued a sweeping decision to curb the use of solitary confinement, pepper spray and use of restraints at Wisconsin's teen prison complex, he included a sweeping claim to condemn the conditions at the facility: ""Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills,"" James Peterson, chief U.S. district judge for the western district of Wisconsin, said from the bench. Kaczynski, of course, is the Unabomber, the man that killed three and injured two dozen more in letter and bomb attacks. He is serving a life sentence at a federal ""supermax"" prison in Colorado known as the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies."" In issuing his June 23, 2017 ruling, Peterson said the problem with the use of isolation -- that is, solitary confinement -- as a form of punishment at Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls is ""acute, immediate and enduring."" The ruling was part of a lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates at the two facilities, which share a campus 30 miles north of Wausau. They house about 170 inmates. In the ongoing lawsuit, the inmates claim abuse by prison officials in the form of excessive use of pepper spray and confining inmates to solitary confinement for weeks or months at a time. A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation found state officials missed repeated warning signs at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, where lax management, confusion over policies, lack of communication and chronic staff shortages contributed to the problems. Both facilities have been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation involving child abuse and neglect for two years. Prosecutors haven’t said whether or when they might file charges. Kaczynski is serving a life sentence at the ADX-FLORENCE prison for his decades-long letter and bomb attacks. The prison houses the nation’s worst offenders, such as Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.   Is Peterson on the mark with his comparison? Lincoln Hills conditions Peterson declined to comment on his statement, since the case is still before him. However, documents in the lawsuit and court proceedings in the days leading up to his ruling shed light on the judge’s comments. For instance, the bulk of the arguments that preceded his comment focused on the use of solitary confinement. The lawsuit itself focuses on three issues separately: use of solitary confinement; use of pepper spray; and use of restraints. Between 15 percent and 20 percent of inmates at Lincoln Hills are housed in solitary confinement at any given time, according to court documents. The cells are 7-by-10 feet and, prior to Peterson’s ruling, inmates spent 20 hours or more -- sometimes an entire day -- inside them. Under Peterson’s ruling, prison officials have to give youth more out-of-cell time, according to the Journal Sentinel. When they are let out of their segregated cells for classes, many of those inmates were handcuffed to a desk, according to the lawsuit. These inmates receive an hour of classroom work a day, compared to the usual four to five hours. The court documents also claim the physical conditions of those cells are dirty and smell like sweat and urine. Meanwhile, pepper spray was used nearly 300 times throughout the prison complex, not just in solitary confinement areas, from January 2016 to April 2017, according to a June 9, 2017 Journal Sentinel report. In May 2017, the state acknowledged some of these claims in court documents, including that some youth have spent more than 180 days in solitary confinement and that staff had used pepper spray on youths who were already restrained. Wisconsin Department of Correction spokesman Tristan Cook said in an email that the department has made changes at the prison and that improvements are ongoing. Ted Kaczynski conditions Court filings regarding inmate treatment in the federal supermax in Colorado and reports by news outlets such as The Boston Globe, The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic paint a bleak picture inside the nation’s most secure prison. Several of the prison’s 400 inmates spend 23 hours a day in a 7-by-12 foot cell that has a slot for food and small window slit, according to The Boston Globe. Inmates at ADX have claimed denial of psychological medical treatment. Todd Chapman, public information officer for ADX, disputed these reports in an email. However, we’re looking specifically at the Unabomber’s prison conditions, since that is the comparison Peterson made. In an email, Chapman said Kaczynski has a minimum of 30 hours a week outside his cell. Chapman also said that Kaczynski and other inmates are housed singularly and generally have a bed, TV, desk, stool, shelf and a storage area.    Inmates at Lincoln Hills in solitary confinement had less outside time than Kaczynski before Peterson’s ruling, no access to paper or writing material, their lights are kept on 24 hours a day and they have few of the amenities that Kaczynski has. Those in general population at Lincoln Hills have access to a desk in their room, TV in the dayroom and are outside their cells for significant portions of the day. Our rating Peterson said: ""Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills."" His claim is on target for those Lincoln Hills inmates placed in solitary confinement, which was the issue at hand when the claim was made. The caveat: Those inmates not in solitary confinement would fare differently. We rate Peterson’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/aug/18/james-peterson/district-judge-ted-kaczynski-has-less-restrictive-/

How many U.S. adults have a criminal record? Depends on how you define it
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants businesses in New York state to hire more applicants with a criminal record. They become loyal employees and bring tax benefits, he said. And, they make up a huge pool of prospective employees. ""70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults,"" Cuomo wrote in an article on career website LinkedIn. People with a criminal record number too many for employers to pass over because of unsubstantiated fears of workplace violence, theft or incompetence, he said. But is the number as high as he said? Does one in every three adults have a criminal record? The FBI’s definition of criminal record The FBI considers anyone who has been arrested on a felony charge to have a criminal record, even if the arrest did not lead to a conviction. The FBI only counts those with a misdemeanor if a state agency asks the bureau to keep it on file. So by the FBI’s standard, 73.5 million people in the United States had a criminal record as of June 30. The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record. Cuomo’s statement Cuomo did not make any distinction between convictions and arrests in his article. He just used the term 'criminal record' without defining it. The meaning of criminal record can be ambiguous. A search on the internet will tell you a criminal record is a history of someone’s convictions, a step beyond the FBI’s definition. ""When I teach my classes and I talk to my students about this, I tell them the term criminal record is almost useless,"" said Robert Brame, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. ""It could mean so many different things,"" Brame said. ""Are you talking about conviction record, arrest record, juvenile record?"" In most cases, arrests shouldn't show up on pre-employment checks, said Michelle Rodriguez, a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. ""But there's still mistakes that happen in background check reports so there is a possibility that something could show up,"" Rodriguez said. There is no federal data on the number of people with a criminal conviction living in the U.S. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics does have an estimate for how many people were under correctional supervision in 2015. The bureau reported 6.7 million adults either incarcerated or on parole or probation. That’s close to three out of every 100 adults. Our ruling Cuomo said ""70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults."" By the FBI definition, that is correct. But the term ‘criminal record’ is ambiguous, and the FBI definition is different from the common-sense definition. His claim may have been interpreted by some to mean one-third of adults have a criminal conviction. That’s not true. His statement leaves out how he defines criminal record, an important detail.

Donald Trump wrong that Charlottesville counter-protesters didn't have a permit
","During the contentious Trump Tower question-and-answer session about protests in Charlottesville, Va., President Donald Trump said that the Unite the Right marchers had a permit to demonstrate, but that counter-protesters did not. Here’s a portion of Trump’s extensive comments about Charlottesville during the session with reporters: ""There were people in that rally. I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. I am sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest. ""Because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit. So I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country."" Here, we’ll take a look at whether white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville ""had a permit"" and that the counter-protesters ""didn’t have a permit."" The Washington Post Fact Checker published a document in an earlier fact-check showing that counter-protesters had indeed acquired an official permit for Saturday, when the Unite the Right march was scheduled. The permit was issued to Walt Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education. The ""special events certificate of approval"" for a public demonstration at two parks in Charlottesville, McGuffey Park and Justice Park. Those are located within one and two blocks, respectively, of Emancipation Park, the location of a Robert E. Lee statue and the destination for the Unite the Right march. The certificate covers Saturday, Aug. 12, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Click on the markers in this map to see key sites in the clashes on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017. You can zoom in and out. Here’s an image of the certificate, which has been authenticated to PolitiFact by both Heinecke and Miriam Dickler, a spokeswoman for the city of Charlottesville.  In an interview, Heinecke told PolitiFact that he had secured the permit as a citizen, not in his capacity as a University of Virginia professor. Before requesting the permit, he said he consulted with representatives of several local organizations. The counter-protest was called the Peoples Action for Racial Justice and was co-sponsored by two groups, Together Cville and Charlottesville Center for Peace and Justice. According to the Facebook post advertising the march, it was to be ""a peaceful protest against all forms of white supremacy, racial intolerance, and discrimination."" Heinecke said he sought the permit after seeing what had happened during a July 8, 2017, rally in Charlottesville by Ku Klux Klan members. After KKK members were removed from the rally, Heinecke said, counter-protesters who were also in the area found themselves vulnerable to arrest and potential targets for tear gas. Given this experience, he said, the initial purpose for the Aug. 12 permits in McGuffey and Justice parks ""was to assure that there would be two spaces for lawful assembly"" by counter-protesters. ""What we did was provide food and water, and medics were stationed there. We allowed for that space to be used for peaceful and nonviolent demonstrations, and for protesters at Emancipation Park to have respite from a lawless melee,"" he said. In addition, Dickler of the city of Charlottesville said that counter-protesters would have been permitted even outside of the two park locations specified in the permit. ""A permit does not bar other individuals from entry to a public park (such as Emancipation Park), nor does it restrict who can be on streets or sidewalks outside of and/or adjacent to the park."" For the record, the city of Charlottesville had sought to have the Unite the Right march hold their demonstration in McIntire Park, which is away from downtown. But a court ruled that the march be held at Emancipation Park instead. So the Unite the Right march effectively had judicial permission to hold it there, rather than a city permit. The existence of the city permit issued to Heinecke flatly debunks Trump’s assertion that the counter-protesters lacked a permit -- assuming you understand Trump to mean that counter-protesters had no permit for Saturday’s march. And that’s where the White House told us they differ. The White House told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about a related, but separate, Friday night protest on the campus of the University of Virginia. On the night before the Saturday march, about 250 white nationalists carrying torches marched on campus and confronted 20 to 30 students who had locked arms around the base of a statue of Thomas Jefferson, according to the Washington Post. Clashes occurred there, leaving some injured. The White House pointed to the president’s statement from Trump Tower that ""I looked the night before -- if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. ... You had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest -- because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit.  The other group didn’t have a permit."" (Emphasis by the White House.) However, there are a few problems with this explanation. First, no permit was required for any protest on the University of Virginia campus, either from the university (which has jurisdiction on the campus) or the city (which does not). ""The University does not require permits to use public spaces,"" said University of Virginia spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn. ""Existing university policy speaks only to the ability to access university-owned facilities such as academic buildings and performance venues."" He added that ""the University of Virginia is a public institution, and as such must abide by state and federal law regarding the general public’s right to access outdoor spaces. This includes open spaces such as … our historic Lawn."" So if Trump meant to refer to the Friday night protest, then he’s wrong here, too. Neither side had permits because there were none to give. Second, it’s worth noting another problem: Documentary footage by Vice shows clearly that marchers shouted ""blood and soil"" -- a slogan from Nazi Germany -- and ""Jews will not replace us."" That’s not a case of ""people protesting very quietly,"" as Trump said.   Trump said that white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville ""had a permit. The other group didn’t have a permit."" In reality, both the Unite the Right marchers and the counter-protesters had official permission to assemble on Saturday, either from a court or from the city. If Trump meant to refer to the Friday night march, then neither side would have needed a permit to assemble. And if he did mean Friday night’s march, then he is seriously distorting the torch-light march by saying participants were ""protesting very quietly.""

Tucker Carlson wrongly says United States 'ended slavery around the world'
","Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson said on his primetime talk show that while many are arguing for the removal of Confederate monuments because they legitimize slavery, America should get some recognition for stopping the practice globally. On the Aug. 15, 2017, episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the host was discussing with political commentator Jasmyne Cannick whether former U.S. Sen Robert Byrd’s name should be removed from a building because Byrd was once a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Cannick said that offensive or racially insensitive monuments or dedications may be reviewed in time, but Americans should still remember to mark its history properly. Carlson affirmed her answer with a remark about the result of the Civil War. ""The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too,"" he said. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, and the 13th Amendment formally abolished slavery in the United States after it was ratified following the end of the Civil War in 1865. But did that stop slavery across the planet? Experts told us there was no way that was true.   We don’t know exactly how Carlson was defining slavery, whether as a government-sanctioned practice or criminal enterprise. We reached out to the show and to Fox News Channel but did not get a response. But he’s not right in any case, historians told us. Slavery has been instituted by myriad cultures, empires and nations around the globe for centuries, they said. There have been patterns of abolishing slave trades and then the practice of slavery, before later reinstating them. In the modern context, the roots of the abolitionist movement really began in Great Britain in 1787. The Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade set the stage for organized, widespread protests against slavery. ""If anyone could lay claim to leading anti-slavery forces in the world it was Britain, which after it abolished the slave trade and slavery made anti-slavery a leading aspect of its foreign policy and policed the Atlantic to end the slave trade,"" University of Connecticut history professor Manisha Sinha said. The British stopped its own trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807, and America did the same a year later. Vermont did become the first state to ban slaves in 1777, but it remained in practice among wealthy landowners into the 19th century. Other northern states also began to ban slavery, but the practice in the United States and abroad continued for far longer, eventually becoming the flashpoint of the Civil War. Several Western nations ended slavery before the United States did. Spain abolished it in 1811, although Cuba refused the royal decree. Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Portugal all banned the slave trade — but not the owning of slaves — shortly thereafter. The British didn’t officially abolish slavery until 1833. Then other European powers began to follow suit. Several Latin American countries and a handful of other places like the principality of Moldovia banned slavery through the 1850s. Fast forward to the 1860s, when the Confederate States of America’s surrender to Union forces dovetailed with the official end of slavery here. But that wasn’t the last word on slavery. ""The 13th Amendment abolished chattel slavery in the United States, but slavery continued in Cuba and Brazil until the 1880s, and in other places in the world well into the 20th century,"" Georgetown University history professor Adam Rothman said. Slavery and indentured servitude in Cuba finally ended in 1886, while Brazil stopped the official practice of slavery two years later. That’s still not the end of the story, however. ""Slavery still exists in most every corner of the world,"" Siddharth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard, told us. ""When people speak about the abolition of slavery, what they mean is the abolition of the legally sanctioned institution of buying and selling other people like property."" But forced labor continued, perpetrated by the likes of Nazis and the Soviet Union. Child labor and bonded labor, in which people must work to pay off debts, remains a problem, particularly in the Third World. The Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize in 2016 for documenting cases of slavery in the seafood industry in Southeast Asia. ""The global campaign against modern slavery has been going on for a long time under the auspices of international anti-slavery NGOs and organizations like the U.N., which the U.S. participates in,"" Rothman said. ""But at the same time, it's likely that forms of unfree labor akin to slavery lurk in the dark shadows at the end of the global supply chains of American businesses."" Carlson said, ""The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too."" The practice of treating other human beings as property that can be forced into labor continued as official policy for more than decades in Cuba and Brazil after the Civil War. Historians said slavery continued to exist across the world into the 20th century, and conditions comparable to slavery still exist. Any credit for originating the ideals leading to the end of slavery as most people would define it should go to the British, historians said, who formally organized abolitionist thought long before the United States adopted any official policy.

Donald Trump retells Pants on Fire claim about Gen. Pershing ending terrorism for 35 years
","After a terrorist deliberately crashed a van into a crowd of people in Barcelona on Aug. 17, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the attack. He then suggested that the world should get tougher on terrorism. ""The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!,"" Trump tweeted. He later followed up, writing: ""Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!"" The person who needs a lesson, however, is Trump. Trump has made this claim about U.S. Army Gen. John Joseph ""Black Jack"" Pershing before. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War. After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department. After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies. ""They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,"" Trump said, according to a February 2016 account in the Washington Post. ""And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem."" In Trump’s most-recent telling, 25 years became 35 years. But either way, neither version of the story adds up.   The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades. For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin ""to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers,"" Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently. The best evidence U.S. troops used pigs as a tactic against Muslims comes from a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents ""were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins."" In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics."" While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, there is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts. Experts have been skeptical the practice was widespread or directly authorized or ordered by Pershing. ""This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,"" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. ""I am amazed it is still making the rounds."" Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that ""I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character."" Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to ""pacifying"" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors. ""He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply."" Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions. ""The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,"" Janda said. ""This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism."" To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s actions stopped ""radical Islamic terror"" was actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable. ""Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,"" said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region ""remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present."" Silbey of Cornell agreed. ""Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,"" he said. ""The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism."" If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative. ""The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,"" Janda said. ""It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies."" Trump said that Pershing stopped ""radical Islamic terror"" for 35 years. Of the eight historians we checked with the first time we heard Trump speak about Pershing, all were at least skeptical that the specific tales of Pershing actually took place, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. But more critically, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years.

A ridiculous statement in Republicans' radio ad says Sen. Bill Nelson 'supports murderers'
","A national Republican group is misleading Miami voters with a radio ad that says U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson ""supports murderers,"" pointing to the Democrat’s positions on Cuba and Venezuela. The crisis in Venezuela could become an issue for Florida candidates in 2018, including Nelson, who is expected to face a challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott. The Spanish-language ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacks Nelson for meeting with then-Venezuela President Hugo Chávez in 2005 and tries to link Nelson to Chávez’s successor, Nicolas Maduro, and the Castro brothers of Cuba. Here’s part of the script in English: ""In the past, (Nelson) has aligned himself with communists and dictators. Look at him with Cuba. He supported Obama when he negotiated with the other terrorists, the Castro brothers. When Nelson supports the Castros, that only reinforces and encourages others, like it did with Chávez’s and now with Maduro. In 2005, Bill Nelson even visited Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Here it says Nelson went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution. If Bill Nelson supports murderers, I can’t support Bill Nelson."" The fact that Nelson met with Chávez and supported Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba is by no means evidence that Nelson ""supports murderers"" or admired Chávez’s revolution. In fact, Nelson has repeatedly criticized the leadership of both Venezuela and Cuba. When we asked for evidence of the ad’s claims, an NRSC spokeswoman pointed to a Miami Herald article about a 2005 meeting between Nelson and Chávez. In January 2005, Nelson and two other U.S. senators on the Foreign Relations Committee -- Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. and Lincoln Chafee R-R.I. -- met with Chávez in Caracas. In addition to Venezuela, the senators traveled to Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru to discuss counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and economic issues. The senators discussed with Chávez concerns about his relationship with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), though Nelson also described the session as ""very friendly (in) tone."" Senators ""made a point of emphasizing the need for a fresh start in the often troubled relationship between Washington and Chávez's government,"" the Herald wrote. An NRSC spokeswoman also pointed to a September 2006 editorial in Investor’s Business Daily that describes trips taken by Nelson as ""junkets to Venezuela to admire Chávez's ‘revolution’ in his dog and pony shows."" But the article included no evidence that Nelson admired Chávez’s revolution. There is evidence of Nelson, however, criticizing Chávez over his new media laws, private property seizures and pro-Chávez judicial appointments in a 2005 op-ed. ""While we cannot accept Chávez's duplicity, his anti-democratic consolidation of power or his ties to Cuba, dialogue between the United States and Venezuela is needed to help avoid the real possibility of a disruption in the relationship with our fourth-largest oil supplier,"" he wrote. Other have called Nelson a frequent critic of Chávez. In 2004, the Miami Herald described Nelson as being ""perhaps Chávez's fiercest critic in Congress."" Nelson called on the federal government to investigate terrorist operations in Venezuela and called Chávez a ""serious threat"" governing in ""an increasingly autocratic manner"" and ""unfriendly to the civilized world."" In April 2014, Nelson held a joint press conference with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio to call for stepped-up attention to Venezuela for repressing political protests. ""It's time to stand up and speak out,"" he said. In July 2017, after Maduro won re-election in which what has been described as a fraudulent vote, Nelson urged sanctions. ""It's time that we consider cutting the imports of Venezuelan oil,"" Nelson said in a Senate Floor speech. ""We are now dealing with a Cuban-style dictator."" ""Maduro has made himself dictator, and he and his cronies are bent on turning Venezuela's once-vibrant democracy and once-vibrant economy into a Cuban-style regime,"" he said. Nelson supported Obama’s move in December 2014 to normalize relations with Cuba, but he called for Castro to expand freedoms. The Republicans point to an article about Nelson speaking on CNN after Obama’s announcement. He described the day as ""Hallelujah Day,"" as American Alan Gross was released from Cuba prison as part of the agreement. Nelson described himself as ""anti-Castro"" but saw Obama’s decision as a step in the right direction. In July 2015 when the U.S. and Cuba opened embassies, Nelson supported the move but continued to criticize Castro. ""I still distrust Castro, but we have to get that regime to open up, stop human rights abuses, and give the Cuban people their basic freedoms,"" he said in a statement. The ad says that Nelson ""supports murderers,"" which appears to be a reference to Chávez, Maduro and the Castro brothers. The leaders have been associated with political violence of different types. Sebastian A. Arcos, associate director at the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said the Castro brothers have a well-documented history of politically motivated killings beginning in the early months of the Cuban Revolution and extending to recent years. ""Chávez and Maduro do not have the Castro’s record of politically motivated killings,"" he said. ""Under their collective rule, however, Venezuela has suffered a significant spike in the murder rate, already high before Chávez came to power. In addition, Maduro has been responsible for over 100 dead while repressing anti-government demonstrations."" Andy Gomez, interim director of the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies, called the attack on Nelson ""absolutely silly."" ""Bill Nelson has always been anti-Castro and anti-Chávez and Maduro, the record speaks for itself,"" he said. ""Does the U.S. ever take positions, or any senator including Bill (Nelson), approving atrocities being made to the people? Absolutely not. Has Sen. Nelson ever supported any of these guys? Absolutely not."" The NRSC radio ad says Nelson ""has aligned himself with communists and dictators,"" ""went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution"" and ""supports murderers.""

Donald Trump said wages 'haven’t gone up for a long time,' but that's wrong
","It was hardly the most widely noticed remark in his Trump Tower lobby question-and-answer session on Aug. 15 -- that would be his comments on the unrest in Charlottesville, Va. But one economic assertion by President Donald Trump caught our attention. As Trump was leaving, a reporter asked him what he thought ""needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?"" ""I really think jobs can have a big impact,"" Trump said, going on to tout investments by car companies and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn. ""I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I’m creating jobs, I think that’s going to have a tremendous impact, positive impact, on race relations."" The reporter then pressed him on how an improved economy would ease race relations. ""Because the people are going to be working,"" Trump said. ""They’re going to be making a lot of money, much more than they ever thought possible. That’s going to happen. The other thing, very important: I believe wages will start going up. They haven’t gone up for a long time."" Is Trump correct that wages ""haven’t gone up for a long time?"" Short answer: No. They’re going up now, in fact. While it’s true that wages were stagnant for several years -- especially after the Great Recession -- they have been on an upward swing since early 2014. We put together the following chart showing median, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for wage and salaried workers, 16 years of age and older, going back to 1979: It shows that for much of the time between 2012 and 2014, median weekly earnings were lower than they were in 1979 -- a frustrating disappearance of any wage growth for 35 years. But that began changing in 2014. After hitting a low of $330 a week in early 2014, wages have risen to $354 a week by early 2017. That’s an increase of 7.3 percent over a roughly three-year period. ""In this case, you can say the president is flatly wrong,"" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. ""Real wages have been rising more slowly than anyone wishes, except perhaps employers. Nonetheless, they have been rising."" Burtless noted that the increases for a subset of all workers -- ""production and non-supervisory employees"" -- have been occurring for even longer. They’ve gone up every month but two since late 2012. Jed Kolko, the chief economist with the jobs site Indeed.com, added that ""not only have wages gone up overall, but wages are now increasing most for people with less education. So, wage gains aren't being driven only by top earners."" He provided this chart, showing that non-college full-time employees have been growing by 3 percent to 4 percent a year.  The White House did not respond to an inquiry. Trump said that wages ""haven’t gone up for a long time."" That was once accurate, but it’s significantly out of date. Wages have been increasing for the past three to five years, depending on the measurement you use.

Alabama's Roy Moore says whole communities in Midwest are under Sharia law
","On the eve of his first-place finish in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Roy Moore -- a former Alabama judge who advocated for the display of the Ten Commandments -- attracted some attention for a comment he made about Muslim Sharia law. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. Some commentators, particularly on the right, have warned that Sharia poses a threat to the United States’ legal system. But PolitiFact has debunked a string of claims about the influence of Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States, including by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who became President Donald Trump’s short-lived national security adviser. Moore made his comments during a campaign stop to meet with members of the pro-gun group BamaCarry Inc. There, reporter Jeff Stein of the website Vox.com asked him, ""Some right-wing conservatives think Sharia law is a danger to America -- do you?"" Moore responded, ""There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don’t know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts."" Stein pressed Moore to name the communities under Sharia law. He responded, ""Well, there’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know."" Later in the interview, Stein tried again, asking Moore to be specific and name which communities he was referring to. Moore said, ""I was informed that there were. But if they’re not, it doesn’t matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That’s not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith -- so there’s a difference."" So are there really entire communities that ignore U.S. law and operate instead under Sharia law? We found zero evidence of it. (We did not hear back from the Moore campaign.) The office of the Illinois attorney general told PolitiFact that there are ""no communities under Sharia law"" in the state. Experts were equally dubious. ""Seriously, I've never heard of any such thing,"" said Nathan J. Brown, director of George Washington University’s Institute for Middle East Studies and a specialist on the rule of law in the Arab world. ""I suspect the only accurate part of his statement is when he confesses, ‘I don't know.’ "" Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na‘im, an Emory University law professor, was equally skeptical. ""I have not seen evidence of entire communities being run by Sharia law anywhere in the United States,"" An-Na‘im said. In fact, ""it is legally impossible for any community anywhere in the United States to be ‘under Sharia law’ simply because for that to happen, Sharia law must be enacted as the law of the state, and that is unconstitutional under the First Amendment."" Specifically, the First Amendment ""allows for accommodation but not establishment,"" said Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University. ""So, private groups may choose to abide by religious law, such as Jews who abide by judgments made by rabbinical courts and Muslims who might abide by a decision made by their Sharia council or imam. But to assert that Sharia is being enforced by the state is entirely incorrect."" That exception -- the use of religious law to settle intra-community disputes between consenting parties, outside of the United States legal system -- is sometimes a source of confusion for critics of Sharia law, experts said. ""If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land,"" Choudhury said. ""So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation. Or, if you marry in the United States, your religious ceremony may not be recognized unless you have a state license and conform to the state's requirements."" Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, agreed that his group knows of no such Sharia-ruled communities. Making such a suggestion, he added, ""feeds into the fear that Muslims are attempting to impose their laws on others in our country. Individual Muslims and their families may voluntarily observe Sharia-related rituals, but this is no different from Jews or Christians living their lives in accordance with the dictates of their own religious traditions."" Tuchman suggested that Moore might have been mistakenly referring to a satirical column published in the Daily Beast in 2015. The column, written by Muslim-American radio host and comedian Dean Obeidallah, was headlined, ""Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana."" It poked fun at Indiana, which was facing criticism for a new religious-liberty law signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president. In the column, Obeidallah jokingly floated ways that Muslims could take advantage of a law that was mostly supported by conservative Christians. ""Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose Sharia law in some fashion in Indiana -- turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?"" he wrote. ""Well, the Indiana law doesn’t just provide ‘religious liberty’ for Christians. It provides ‘liberty’ for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. … There are now so many things we can do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America,"" from taking more than one wife to requiring that restaurants institute halal-compliant rules. When we brought Moore’s comments to Obeidallah’s attention, he responded, ""LOL.""   Moore said, ""There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there. I don't know."" After checking with multiple experts, we found no evidence of such a community.

Under bill, could drivers hit protesters with immunity? Cooper misleads
","As graphic images emerged from Virginia over the weekend of a car crashing into a crowd of people, some turned their attention to a proposed North Carolina law that aims to protect drivers who inadvertently injure protesters in the street. House Bill 330 was introduced in response to protests in Charlotte last fall, when some residents who were upset about the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott blocked interstate highways and other roads in the city. The N.C. House of Representatives approved the bill this spring but it hasn’t been considered by the state Senate. The bill drew renewed scrutiny after an Ohio man named James Fields, 20, allegedly rammed his car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. The car killed one woman and injured 19 others. The news sparked fears that drivers in North Carolina could hit protesters without legal repercussions. On Tuesday, Gov. Roy Cooper called for legislators to let the bill die. ""The North Carolina legislature should defeat a bill that grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters. That bill passed the state House and remains alive in the Senate. The Senate should kill it. Full stop. Those who attack protesters, weaponizing their vehicles like terrorists, should find no safe haven in our state."" he wrote. We wondered whether the bill really ""grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters,"" as Cooper said. A ‘tightly tailored’ bill? Cooper spokesman Ford Porter elaborated on the governor’s statement in an email. ""The purpose of the bill is to immunize certain drivers from findings of liability. Courts already take into consideration the circumstances surrounding an accident – this legislation adds vague new protections specifically for people who hit protesters with their cars,"" Porter said. ""That sends the wrong message and opens the door to potentially serious consequences. Governor Cooper has been clear that our state has no business going down this path."" The bill’s authors, Republican state Reps. Justin Burr and Chris Millis, released a statement saying the bill is ""tightly tailored"" to protect drivers as well as people who are lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. ""It is intellectually dishonest and a gross mischaracterization to portray North Carolina House Bill 330 as a protection measure for the act of violence that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend,"" Burr and Millis said. ""Any individual who committed a deliberate or willful act, such as what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, would face appropriately severe criminal and civil liabilities."" What the bill says The one-page bill, which is short by legislative standards, aims to provide legal immunity from personal-injury lawsuits to motorists who exercise ""due care"" when driving but injure someone who blocks traffic while participating in a protest. The bill expresses important distinctions: it wouldn’t apply to drivers who injure protesters through ""willful or wanton"" actions; nor would it apply to drivers who injure someone who has a permit to protest in the street. It also wouldn’t apply to someone being criminally prosecuted. And it certainly wouldn’t allow drivers to ""weaponize"" their cars without legal consequence. In short, the bill doesn't grant immunity to anyone who hits a protester on purpose. What it changes Attorneys and legal experts doubt that the bill would have much impact because state laws already offer broad protections to drivers who accidentally hit people who are unlawfully in the street. In North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama and Maryland, state law makes it difficult for a plaintiff to win. Other states apply the doctrine of ""comparative fault."" Let’s say a protester in a comparative fault state is found to be 20 percent responsible for his or her injury and a driver is found to be 80 percent at fault. State laws in those states merely limit – not block – the amount of money awarded to the protester. In North Carolina, by contrast, state laws apply the doctrine of ""contributory negligence."" If a defendant proves ""that the Plaintiff is even 1 percent responsible for their injuries – they lose automatically,"" said T. Greg Doucette, a criminal defense and business litigation attorney based in Durham. Doucette said the effect of the bill is unknown because it’s untested. But, on the bill’s surface, it seems to change little about civil litigation. Proving intent If the bill were to pass, how would it play out in court? If a protester is in the street and doesn’t have a permit, but thinks a driver intentionally struck him with his car, the protester would have to prove ""willful and wanton"" intent. Donald Beskind, a Duke University professor who’s practiced law for more than 30 years, said juries in that kind of situation are asked to consider direct and circumstantial evidence. Most cases are clear cut, he said. ""If you want to know if someone was careful, you would want to look at what they were doing at the time of the accident. If they were texting, we would infer they were not careful,"" Beskind said. If someone drove into protesters and ""on the back side of their car there was a sign that said ‘Kill the Antifa,’ we would assume they were being willful,"" he added, referring to the anti-fascist political organization. Inspiring recklessness? Effectiveness or ineffectiveness aside, attorneys said the bill might inspire violent acts by people who don’t understand the laws. ""While I don’t think it would make the Charlottesville thing legal by any stretch of the imagination, it could embolden someone to do something like the Charlottesville guy did,"" said David Stradley, a personal injury lawyer in Raleigh. ""We just don’t need to be encouraging people to do something around a demonstration."" Our ruling Cooper overstates what this bill would do. And legal experts say that, while untested, the bill doesn't appear to change litigation and might not offer any additional protections at all.

Wisconsin paying Foxconn $1 million per job possible, if not likely
","When one Democratic lawmaker claimed Wisconsin is offering $3 billion to Foxconn for 3,000 jobs, or $1 million per job, the math didn’t work. We rated the statement, by state Rep. Melissa Sargent of Madison, False. The full $3 billion would be paid only if the plant Foxconn plans to put in Wisconsin creates 13,000 jobs. But is it possible that the Foxconn offer could end up costing Wisconsin taxpayers more than $1 million per job? Perhaps. A new $1 million-per-job claim was made by another Democratic lawmaker, state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, on Aug. 14, 2017. The same day, the $3 billion incentive package cleared its first legislative hurdle, winning  approval from a Republican-controlled Assembly committee. Shilling made her claim in a news release about the $3 billion that carried this headline: ""Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job."" Let’s crunch the numbers. The $3 billion Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has pledged to invest up to $10 billion on a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing facility that would employ at least 3,000 people, and up to 13,000. In turn, Wisconsin has offered the company up to $3 billion in incentives. We’ve already reported that based on the best available data, Wisconsin’s offer would be the largest incentive ever provided by a state to a foreign company. It’s helpful to think about the $3 billion in three parts -- a $2.85 billion in essentially cash payments and the rest in a sales tax exemption: Up to $1.35 billion in tax credits paid to Foxconn if the company invests at least $9 billion in the plant Up to $1.5 billion in payments if Foxconn creates 13,000 jobs $150 million in sales tax exemptions So, the more the company spends on capital and payroll, the more cash it gets from Wisconsin taxpayers. Shilling’s claim Shilling bases her claim on Foxconn making the full capital investment -- but employing only 1,000 people. Here is her math: The $9 billion capital investment would bring Foxconn a $1.35 billion payment 1,000 jobs -- with what the company says would be for an average salary of $53,876, and the jobs last for 15 years -- would bring another $137 million That totals $1.49 billion in tax credit payments. Divide that by 1,000 jobs and you get $1.49 million per job. Jon Peacock, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, and Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed to us that Shilling’s math is accurate. And Peacock, who has done an analysis on Wisconsin’s offer to Foxconn, told us that even if 1,500 jobs were created, the cost to taxpayers would still exceed $1 million per job. But Shilling is doing some cherry picking. She is taking Foxconn at its word that it will invest at least $9 billion, but rejecting the company’s pledge that it will create at least 3,000 jobs. And a large investment with relatively few jobs results in a higher per-job cost to taxpayers. Moreover, it’s not clear that Foxconn would invest $9 billion or more in a plant that would employ only 1,000 people. Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, insisted to us that ""no company would invest anything close to $10 billion"" to create only 1,000 or 1,500 jobs. ""It just wouldn’t make economic sense. You wouldn’t be able to produce enough to recoup the investment."" Scott Manley, a senior vice president at Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, echoed Still’s analysis. He said that based on Foxconn’s plans to spend $10 billion on a plant that eventually would employ 13,000 people, WMC estimates the company would spend only $769.2 million on the plant if the plant only employed 1,000 people. He said that comes out to $252,000 per job, based on the tax credits the company would collect for its investment and payroll. In short, it simply isn’t known yet how much Foxconn will spend on capital or on payroll -- leaving the amount of incentives to be paid up in the air. How many jobs? In a memorandum of understanding it signed with the state, Foxconn has pledged to invest up to $10 billion in its plant. And it has said it would initially employ 3,000 people, with the potential to employ 13,000. (We rated Half True a claim by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that Foxconn ""is bringing"" 13,000 jobs.) But the agreement has no minimums on capital investment or hiring. (The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. told us it is negotiating a contract with Foxconn ""that will outline annual benchmarks that will need to be met in order for the company to access, and retain, these tax credits."") Finally, it’s worth noting the plant is expected to create thousands of construction jobs and spinoff jobs. But the state’s $3 billion incentives offer applies only to the factory itself. Our rating Shilling said about a $3 billion incentive package being offered by the State of Wisconsin: ""Foxconn tax break could exceed $1 million per job."" We found in a previous fact check that the state would not be paying Foxconn $3 billion for 3,000 jobs -- or $1 million per job -- because the full $3 billion would be paid only if 13,000 jobs are created. In Shilling’s favor, if Foxconn invests at least $9 billion in its plant as it has said it will -- but hires only 1,500 workers -- the incentives paid would exceed $1 million per job. That being said, while there is not yet a commitment that Foxconn will create a minimum number of jobs, there is also no evidence that the total would be only 1,500 jobs if it invests $9 billion in its plant. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.  ",/factchecks/2017/aug/16/jennifer-shilling/wisconsin-paying-foxconn-1-million-job-possible-if/

Jeff Sessions stretches to link ""criminal aliens"" and Chicago crime
","When Chicago filed a lawsuit Aug. 7 to block the U.S. Justice Department from withholding federal police grant money from so-called sanctuary cities, U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions reacted swiftly and fiercely. ""To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system,"" Sessions said in a press release. ""They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — Federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."" Under its Welcoming City Ordinance, which defines Chicago’s ""sanctuary city"" status, the Chicago Police Department ""will not question crime victims, witnesses and other law-abiding residents about their legal status."" It also will not use immigration status alone as grounds for detention, and it imposes strict limits on interaction between police officers and federal immigration agents. Like other cities with similar policies, Chicago says doing so fosters trust between immigrant communities and the police department, so immigrants won’t fear coming to police to report crime or assist police investigations. Accusing the Chicago Police Department of maintaining ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents"" is a pretty serious charge from the nation’s top law enforcement officer. We thought this deserved a closer look. Chicago was one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly invoked the city’s murder and gun-crime rate as a byproduct of everything from its gun laws to its leadership. After he was elected, he threatened to ""send in the feds"" to tamp down the city’s crime. If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible ""carnage"" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!   Sessions’ invocation of ""criminal aliens who prey on their own residents"" refers to a theme that has been prevalent in Trump’s platform ever since the day he announced his candidacy with a speech highly disparaging of Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The central premise is that undocumented immigrants present an unusually high propensity for crime. On Aug. 16, Sessions doubled down on the alleged link between Chicago’s violent crime and its sanctuary city status in a speech in Miami, which dropped its sanctuary status to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. ""Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, their so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies are just one sad example,"" Sessions said. ""...We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had an historic number of shooting deaths – zero."" The alleged link between illegal immigrants and surges in crime is an idea that has been debunked repeatedly for decades in numerous academic, government and advocacy-group studies. So we started our look at Sessions’ statement by contacting the Department of Justice with a request for data to back up his claim. The response we got back was obtuse and weird. It came from a justice department press aide and was so loaded with swampy beltway caveats--""deep background,"" ""background,"" ""not for attribution,"" and ""off the record"" -- that we consulted our dog-eared copy of ""All The President’s Men"" for guidance. But to no avail. To be clear, we never agreed to any preconditions in seeking official comment and feel under no obligation to abide by them. And we won’t. So what follows, in full, is the official DOJ response to our question. (Click here to view in pdf format.)   Where to start? Perhaps with the link to the Washington Post story, which argues vigorously against the position taken by Sessions even while acknowledging that there’s no way to be 100 percent sure there’s no link between illegal immigration and Chicago’s homicide rate. At the same time, the article does state flatly, ""There’s no link between a jurisdiction being a sanctuary city and higher crime rates."" It also cites a pair of statistics that would argue strongly against the DOJ’s position. While 84 percent of Chicago’s undocumented immigrants come from Latin America, 82 percent of its murder victims at the time of the article were black vs. only 4 percent Hispanic, the Post reports. ""FBI data show that most killings in the United States are carried out by people in the same racial group as the victim. The reason for this is obvious: Homicides are usually a function of personal relationships, and people generally associate with family members and friends who share their racial identity,"" the article states. It’s not conclusive evidence that immigrants aren’t driving up Chicago’s homicide rate, it continues, but ""this isn’t what we’d expect the demographics to look like if Chicago’s homicides were tightly intertwined with a population of immigrants who are in the country illegally from Latin America."" DOJ also referred us to a 2016 study by the Murder Accountability Project, a non-profit group that tracks unsolved homicides and advocates for better crime reporting, that showed Illinois had the lowest homicide clearance rate in the nation. But the report attributes the state’s poor showing to record-keeping methods used by the Illinois State Police in gathering crime data statewide. Still, the DOJ spokesman argues that combining those articles with Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city -- in which police do not collect immigration information -- validates Sessions. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, however, has a simpler explanation. ""The vast majority of our issues in Chicago and our violent crime is committed by homegrown people - either individuals that were born and raised in Chicago or most certainly in this country,"" Johnson said in an NPR interview Aug. 7. ""So our instances of undocumented people committing horrific crimes and murder in particular in Chicago is just - it's nominal."" Against those two articles stands a mountain of research that casts doubt on Sessions’ assertion that illegal immigrants cause crime to rise and that Chicago’s official police policy on immigrants endangers residents. ""Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates,"" said a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences. One of the authors of that report explained why to PolitiFact in 2016: Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. ""They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,"" he said in an email interview. ""This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."" Crime went down even as the immigrant population increased, the report said. The NAS study reinforced the findings of a 2005 paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. ""Despite the widespread perception of a link between immigration and crime, immigrants have much lower institutionalization (incarceration) rates than the native born. More recently arrived immigrants have the lowest comparative incarceration rates, and this difference increased from 1980 to 2000,"" that report said. These studies blow a big hole in Sessions’ underlying assertion of ""criminal aliens"" being significantly responsible for the increase in gun violence in Chicago. But what about Sessions’ allegation that Chicago’s ""official policy"" protects ""criminal aliens?"" CPD’s directive ""Responding to Incidents Involving Citizenship Status"" lays out the do’s and don’ts for officers dealing with undocumented immigrants. Essentially, it prohibits officers from detaining anyone based on questions about citizenship status and sharply limits interaction with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. However, it also establishes exceptions for suspects with outstanding criminal warrants, who are known gang members or convicted felons or are on trial for a felony. The city defended its policy in its lawsuit against the federal government: ""(T)his policy promotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident or visitor, regardless of immigration status, is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement, report criminal activity to the police, testify as a witness in court, or seek help as a victim of crime; and by ensuring that police officers focus on criminal activity occurring in Chicago instead of federal civil immigration infractions."" A 2017 report by the National Immigration Law Center that focused specifically on counties that employed ""sanctuary city"" policies bolsters Chicago’s case. ""Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary (sic) counties,"" the report said. ""The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts."" The problem for Chicago here is that, because its police department does not collect immigration data, the city can’t unequivocally state that its murder or gun violence rates are not attributable to immigrants. The anecdotal evidence in Chicago’s favor appears strong, but it’s still anecdotal. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions said Chicago’s leaders ""have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."" Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance does prohibit Chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents. But evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is much less a matter of ""protecting criminal aliens"" than of fostering trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. Yet because Chicago does not collect immigration data in police interactions, it can’t be known conclusively how many of its murders and gun crimes are committed by illegal immigrants ""who prey on their own residents."" That absence of conclusive data to disprove Sessions doesn’t give him license to make claims that are groundless.

Did Confederate symbols gain prominence in the civil rights era?
","A major catalyst in the run up to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., was the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. As the nation reeled from the violence, some political analysts sought to place Confederate symbolism in a broader historical context to help explain the turmoil around the Aug. 11-12 weekend. ""The idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s,"" MSNBC analyst Joy Reid said on NBC’s Meet The Press, Aug. 13, 2017. Reid went on to say that Confederate symbols were political statements aimed at African Americans. American history features two periods when Confederate symbolism spiked: around the turn of the 20th century and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. As a group, most Confederate statues went up in the earlier period. A sharp uptick in the construction of Confederate monuments took place from the late 1890s up to about 1920. That’s according to a Southern Poverty Law Center study that took a nationwide inventory of the more than 1,500 Confederate symbols in public spaces. This chart from the study shows the increased pace of construction around the turn of the 20th century, with blue dots signifying monuments on courthouse grounds, red dots indicating other sites (including monuments) and green dots representing schools.  Several cross-currents explain the explosion of Confederate symbolism in this period. This was an era of generational change during which Civil War veterans, dying of old age, were venerated by their children and grandchildren, experts told us. ""Organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans came into being,"" said Charles S. Bullock, III, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia. ""Civil War veterans were honored in parades. There is a Confederate Memorial Day which pre-dates the National Memorial Day."" But as a victorious North fixed its gaze on a prosperous future, the American South was mired in poverty that would persist for generations. The monuments were a way to look back to an idealized past.   ""Tributes to the Confederacy — placing statues, naming streets and other public facilities — were part of the Lost Cause ideology that focused on an idyllic era of stately mansions, beautiful women and gallant Confederate officers,"" Bullock said. But the monuments also implicitly symbolized slavery and white violence, the experts said. ""On the surface, they were memorials to the Confederacy and their heroes,"" said Karen L. Cox, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. ""Yet, they were also built during a period of racial violence and strong beliefs about Anglo-Saxon (i.e. white) supremacy."" ""The fact that they were placed on the grounds of county and state courthouses was intentional,"" she added. ""The message: white men are in charge."" The period between 1890-World War I saw whites reassert control over the South by enforcing Jim Crow laws, taking control of southern governments and systematically disenfranchising and disempowering African Americans, said Jonathan Leib, a professor of geography and chair of the department of political science and geography at Old Dominion University. Racial segregation also got a major endorsement at the federal level during this era. In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson which upheld the constitutionality of state laws that racially segregated public facilities that were ""separate but equal."" (Nearly 60 years passed before the Court would declare such segregation ""inherently unequal."") ""This was also a moment when the nation itself began to repair the wounds of the late war by agreeing on the inferiority of African Americans,"" said Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School. ""Racial segregation became the law and custom of the nation at precisely the moment when many of these monuments were built."" Another monument born roughly of this era, a statue of Robert E. Lee installed in Charlottesville in 1924, now figures as a present-day flashpoint. The second period when Confederate symbols exploded was the civil rights era. But it was the Confederate flag — not monuments — that gained prominence during this time, as Reid later clarified in an email to PolitiFact and in a Aug. 15 appearance on MSNBC. The flag became a symbol of opposition to desegregation. ""It was the choice to fly Confederate flags, more so than the building of new statues, on government property that became a popular show of resistance during the civil rights era,"" Muhammad said. He added the decision to fly the flag was a clear sign of protest against the federal government’s growing enforcement of civil rights. It was during this era when the Ku Klux Klan came to embrace the Confederate flag, notes the Southern Poverty Law Center.   Reid said, ""the idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s."" She added that Confederate symbols were political statements aimed at African Americans. Reid's comment that Confederate symbols are political statements aimed at African Americans is backed up by history, say experts. But she is wrong that Confederate monuments were built during the civil rights era. Roughly 75 percent were erected before then, according to a comprehensive study of Confederate symbolism. It was during the civil rights era that the Confederate flag gained prominence, which she later clarified. We rate her statement Mostly False.
