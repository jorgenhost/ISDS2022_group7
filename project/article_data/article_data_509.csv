Candidate Barge, Superintendent Barge sometimes differ on Common Core
","State School Superintendent John Barge -- along with Dalton Mayor David Pennington -- has joined the race for governor, challenging GOP incumbent Nathan Deal. Barge is campaigning hard on what he knows best: education, which he sees as economic development. During his two-year tenure as the state’s schools chief, Barge has presided over implementation of the controversial Common Core standards in Georgia’s schools. As superintendent, Barge has supported the national standards despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers and tea party and advocacy groups. So when we saw Barge’s stance on Common Core posted on his campaign website, we were puzzled. In an item he wrote and posted Sept. 12, Barge says he wished Georgia would have realized that its existing educational standards were at the college and career-ready level, ""rather than changing them for the second time in a few short years"" and adopting Common Core. Had Barge moved away from his prior position of supporting the educational standards in hopes of appealing to a certain group of voters? We decided to do some research. In July 2010 the state Board of Education voted to have Georgia adhere to the Common Core standards. The standards are designed to better prepare students for college and careers, and they ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts in the same grades. Creating the standards was a national state-led effort championed by Republican Sonny Perdue when he was Georgia’s governor. And they rolled out in Georgia school districts during the 2012-2013 school year. With many people calling for Georgia to pull out of the national standards, Barge said in the website statement that a measured review of Common Core is necessary. ""I definitely want to avoid the type of rushed, hasty and un-vetted decision that got us into this situation in the first place,"" he wrote. Our Atlanta Journal-Constitution colleagues covering the governor’s race also reviewed Barge’s statement and noted that Republican opposition to the standards has put Deal and Barge on the defensive. And a few days after Barge’s column caught the attention of the AJC, state Sen. Fran Millar -- a past chairman of the Senate’s Education Committee -- took to Facebook to air his feelings on the issue. ""This reminds me of (Barge’s) flip flop on the charter school amendment. Ironic how his professional staff are all in favor of Common Core. Trying to get primary votes? So much for principles,"" Millar’s Facebook post said. We examined some of Barge’s comments about Common Core over the past few years. In discussing the shortfalls of the state’s integrated math curriculum last summer, Barge touted the upcoming Common Core implementation. ""As we move to the Common Core Georgia Performance Standards, students will get the high-level skills in algebra and geometry necessary to be successful in college and careers,"" he said. In April 2012, Barge highlighted the standards as one initiative to help improve Georgia’s graduation rate. ""The Common Core will toughen standards for our students and let us compare Georgia student achievements with students across the country,"" Barge wrote in an AJC op-ed. In September 2011, he highlighted the ""consistent framework"" Common Core would provide. We then reviewed Barge’s statements about Common Core before becoming state superintendent. In two posts from his ""On the Campaign Trail with John Barge"" blog, the-then candidate questioned Common Core’s rigor and alleged secrecy in developing the standards and the state’s rush to implement them. ""I submit to you that it is not at all really about this phenomenal new curriculum that is the silver bullet fix for educating our children. It is about the current federal administration wanting to control the education of your children, including what goes into the textbooks,"" Barge wrote in a blog post titled ""Common Core Standards - Why the Rush?"" Barge also criticized Common Core’s connection to Race to the Top grant funds from the federal government, which included stipulations for implementing a merit pay system for teachers. In an interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Barge stood behind his Common Core record and comments. And, as he has previously done, noted that the standards were already approved for the state when he took office. Barge was elected as the state’s education chief in November 2010. Before that he was director of secondary curriculum and instruction for the Bartow County School System. ""When Common Core came out we were all in shock. So no, I wasn’t for Common Core then, not because I didn’t think the standards were good, but I wasn’t for rolling them out on top of standards we had just implemented,"" Barge said. ""Once I was elected and Common Core was already adopted and set for implementation, I didn’t want to pull back and put in place another set of standards on teachers. I’m not recommending any pullback from Common Core standards."" The Georgia School Boards Association said Barge has remained consistent on his support for Common Core. The group noted that Barge inherited Common Core and has supported rigorous standards for Georgia We asked Millar, a Dunwoody Republican, whether Barge had flip-flopped on the issue. ""No, I’d call it a lot of waffling,"" he said. ""(Barge) initially said he was in favor. I think he wants to be to the right of Deal on this issue. These standards are not perfect, but it’s a way to try to improve things."" So did Barge flip-flop on his Common Core position? Barge said himself that he was critical of Common Core before becoming superintendent but was more supportive after taking the job because the standards had already been adopted by the previous administration. He gets some credit for being put in a predetermined situation, but he did change his position on support for Common Core. We rate his position as a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE56640>],/factchecks/2013/oct/04/john-barge/candidate-barge-superintendent-barge-sometimes-dif/
"['Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Florida', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz']","
Debbie Wasserman Schultz says federal shutdown is projected to cost the economy $10 billion per week
","Now that we’re living in a federal government shutdown, what’s the hit to the economy? U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wagged her calculator at the GOP and cited a whopping figure on Twitter. ""$10 billion in costs to the economy per week and this is what the R's had to say?"" tweeted Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, who also serves as the chair of the Democratic National Committee.   We wanted to check her number: How much will the shutdown cost the economy? Predictions about economic shutdown Wasserman Schultz’s numbers are the same as those from the White House. A White House spokesman said the $10 billion figure came from an August report from the investment group Goldman Sachs. We also found similar estimates from Moody’s and IHS. These financial firms agree that the impact depends on how long the shutdown goes on. The impact gets worse the longer a closure lasts. ""A brief shutdown would delay, not cancel, most spending,"" said the Goldman Sachs report. ""In a brief shutdown, it is likely that only federal employee compensation would be lost — most of the other activity would just be delayed and made up later. A longer shutdown ― the longest shutdown on record in late 1995 and early 1996 lasted about three weeks — would affect a greater share of federal activities."" The report includes three scenarios based on a two-day, one-week and three-week shutdown. It predicts a $2.6 billion economic loss for a two-day shutdown, $10.4 billion for a week and $36.8 billion for three weeks. Moody’s found that a shutdown lasting three to four weeks would cost $55 billion, with costs accelerating as time goes on. Moody’s takes into account the losses from federal workers not getting paid, the delay of housing and small business loans, the hit to tourism spending and the interruptions for contractors. ""To be clear, these are rough estimates of what we think impacts will be,"" Moody’s analyst Brian Kessler told PolitiFact. ""There is just a ridiculously large number of moving parts."" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, testified before the Joint Economic Committee about the shutdown in September. ""A shutdown that lasts only three or four days would have modest economic consequences, costing the economy approximately 0.2 percentage point of annualized real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. ... However, shutting the government down for three or four weeks would do significant economic damage, reducing real GDP by 1.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter. And this likely understates the economic fallout, as it does not fully account for the impact of such a lengthy shutdown on consumer, business and investor psychology."" IHS calculated a loss of $1.6 billion for one week as a result of furloughs, with the impact increasing for a longer shutdown. ""The spending habits of government employees probably would not change if the shutdown was short-lived, particularly if they believed that they would receive back wages, as in 1995,"" states the September IHS report. ""Any uncertainty about compensation, however, could increase the impact on consumer spending. Meanwhile, incomes would be maintained for Social Security beneficiaries. Medicare payments would also continue, so spending on health care services would not be harmed and hospitals and doctors would receive payments."" Other experts weighing in on the estimates We also read studies about previous shutdowns and media reports analyzing the potential hit to the economy. We interviewed Tad DeHaven, budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute; Jason Peuquet, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic Policy Research. Our experts generally agreed on one key point: The economic hit will depend on how long the shutdown lasts. Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us that it ""extremely difficult to quantify"" the impact on the economy of a shutdown. ""Sure, analysts can calculate the direct costs of furloughing federal employees,"" Peuquet told PolitiFact in an email. ""But once you factor in the impacts on thousands of federal contractors, the time and resources lost preparing for and implementing the shutdown, the added economic uncertainty of how lawmakers will resolve this, how the Federal Reserve may respond if the shutdown continues for an extended period, and then the ensuing economic reverberations of these changes, it is a very imprecise exercise."" DeHaven of Cato emphasized that these analyses from economists are just estimates and that the actual impact on the economy could be different. ""If you go back and look at previous shutdowns, there was no long-term effect...,"" DeHaven said. ""For Wasserman Schultz or the White House to tweet out this going to cost X amount of money to me is nonsense. You could talk about the cost associated due to government creating uncertainty in the economy for a lot of things Washington is doing."" The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded that the cost of shutdowns in fiscal year 1996 was $1.4 billion -- most of that was for back pay to furloughed workers, according to University of Maryland political science professor Roy Meyers. In 1995, the government first closed from Nov. 14-19 and then again from Dec. 16-Jan.6. But Peuquet and Meyers told us that there are some factors that could make the shutdown economic hit different today, which means we can’t simply add an inflation factor to the mid 1990s shutdowns. Back then, several appropriations bills had already been enacted -- allowing spending in several areas of the federal government. This time, those bills haven’t been enacted. The federal government also relies more heavily on contractors than it did in the 1990s, and they are unlikely to get back pay. ""We are still learning a lot of this as we go,"" Peuquet said. Another factor to consider: The economy is much worse now than it was in the mid 1990s. ""This one is going to be bigger in terms of daily costs...,"" Meyers told PolitiFact. ""The economy is weaker. It can’t handle as much of a shock as it could handle in ‘95-’96."" Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said the shutdown is projected to result in ""$10 billion in costs to the economy per week."" That number comes from an investment report from Goldman Sachs. We found other estimates from financial firms that were slightly larger and slightly smaller than the $10 billion figure, but they were in the same ballpark. A key point here, though, is that these are estimates. Experts agree that caution and caveats are needed: There is much uncertainty about the economic impact, including the timing and length of the shutdown. For instance, if the shutdown is short and workers get paid back wages, the impact could ultimately be modest. If the shutdown continues for several weeks, the price tag could escalate exponentially. Overall, we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6A0080>],/factchecks/2013/oct/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-federal-shutdown-10-/

‘Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month,’ bloggers claim
","The headline flew around the conservative blogosphere: ""Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month."" The fact that it came from a website, National Report, known for Onion-like satire, didn’t stop some bloggers from reporting it as news. The piece was packed with fake details designed to press anti-Muslim buttons: President Barack Obama held a news conference to make his declaration. He said Muslims ""are not all bad. In fact, most of them are good."" His announcement was hailed by a ""member of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party."" He said he would work with Congress to make it easier for Muslims to earn U.S. citizenship. ""Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us,"" he was reported to say. Following other attempts to paint Obama as a Muslim -- such as this one that we rated Pants on Fire -- the National Report’s gambit worked. ""How dare Obama declare November, the month when we give thanks to God for our blessings and great nation, National Muslim Appreciation Month!"" wrote a blogger for Tea Party Nation. The PolitiFact inbox saw email after email with links to such stories from readers who got it from outraged friends. Urban-legend debunker Snopes.com quickly confirmed that it originated with National Report. The headline was utterly invented, and the event was entirely fabricated. While we didn’t hear back from the White House, we found no evidence of any such proclamation at the White House website. We also asked Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""I’m fairly certain they haven’t. Otherwise, I would have heard about it,"" he said. Obama regularly commemorates Muslim holidays alongside Christian and Jewish ones. He’s proclaimed a Jewish American Heritage Month, a National Day of Prayer and a Religious Freedom Day, noting, ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, Sikhs and non-believers."" He has declared heritage months for Irish-Americans, Asian-Americans, Caribbean-Americans and Hispanics. He has proclaimed a month for appreciation of African-American music. But nothing about Muslims. As for Obama’s purported proclamation, the Tea Party Nation blogger posted an update to her outrage: ""Just found out this article was a hoax. They sure fooled me.

Milwaukee's city-suburban poverty disparity worst among U.S. metro areas, Mayor Tom Barrett says
","Stating that Milwaukee is pounded by poverty isn’t startling -- unless you state it the way Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett did. Seeking support for his 2014 city budget, Barrett met Sept. 24, 2013, with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At one point, he lamented the economic hardship in his city. The mayor distributed a list that showed the ratio of city poverty to suburban poverty in the nation’s 51 largest metropolitan areas, those with a metro population above 1 million. Then he said of Milwaukee: ""We are the only metropolitan area in the entire country where you’ve got that ratio higher than four, meaning that the poverty rate is four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs. Only one. Only one."" There’s no question the city of Milwaukee has had some of the highest poverty rates in the country. Let’s see if the measure Barrett uses -- a city-to-suburban poverty ratio -- is accurate. Barrett’s numbers The list Barrett provided came from NewGeography.com, which is ""devoted to analyzing and discussing the places where we live and work."" It was included with a July 2012 article by Wendell Cox of Demographia, a Belleville, Ill., public policy firm. Using 2010 census data, Cox provided a ratio to show how much greater the poverty rate is in the city vs. the suburbs in the 51 largest metro areas. For Milwaukee, the poverty rate was 29.5 percent in the city and 6.9 percent in the suburbs -- a ratio of 4.3. In other words, the city’s poverty rate was 4.3 times higher than the suburban rate. And, as Barrett said, Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a ratio above 4. The three next-highest ratios behind Milwaukee, along with the city poverty rate vs. the suburban rate were: Metro area City poverty rate Suburban rate Ratio Hartford, Conn. 31.2% 7.8% 3.99 Baltimore 25.6% 6.7% 3.80 Rochester, N.Y. 33.8% 9.3% 3.62 Newer numbers Nearly a week before Barrett made his claim, the U.S. Census bureau released new poverty figures -- for 2012. Barrett alluded to them in his editorial board interview and had commented on them several days earlier in a Journal Sentinel news article. A day after the new census figures, the Brookings Institution think tank posted a report on the 2012 poverty rates. The report didn’t list ratios like those in the report Barrett had cited. But a simple calculation of Brookings’ city and suburban poverty rates shows that both the Milwaukee and Hartford, Conn., metro areas had a poverty ratio above 4: Metro area City poverty rate Suburban rate Ratio Hartford, Conn. 38% 7.9% 4.81 Milwaukee 29.9% 7.3% 4.10 Our rating Barrett said that among the nation’s 51 largest metropolitan areas, Milwaukee is the ""only one"" where the poverty rate is more than ""four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs."" Barrett was correct in citing 2010 census figures showing Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a poverty ratio above 4, but his claim went a bit too far in that the just-released 2012 figures show two areas with that ratio. That did not, however, undermine the thrust of his point, that the Milwaukee metropolitan area is virtually alone by this measure. We rate the statement Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA15D00>],/factchecks/2013/oct/03/tom-barrett/milwaukees-city-suburban-poverty-disparity-worst-a/
"['Bipartisanship', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe says Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" Va. government
","Which gubernatorial candidate is most likely to shut down Virginia’s government? Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe pointed fingers at each other during a Sept. 25 debate. Cuccinelli noted that McAuliffe has repeatedly said that, if elected, he would not a sign a budget that failed to expand the state’s Medicaid program as allowed under Obamacare. Cuccinelli said McAuliffe’s vow is tantamount threatening a state government shutdown -- a statement we’ll look at in the coming days. McAuliffe threw the dart back at Cuccinelli. ""The only one on this stage that almost had (a shut down) effected was Ken Cuccinelli, when he almost derailed the Virginia budget when he was trying to defund Planned Parenthood,"" McAuliffe said. ""So he’s the only one on the stage that actually tried to shut down our government."" When asked for more information, McAuliffe’s campaign said Cuccinelli tried to padlock state government on Feb. 27, 2008. The General Assembly, deliberating a two-year state budget to go into effect at midyear, faced a procedural deadline that day. The House and the Senate were scheduled to advance competing versions of the budget, which would be ironed out in the coming days by negotiators from each chamber. Cuccinelli, then a state senator, threw a crimp into the proceedings by offering an amendment that would have stripped Planned Parenthood of all state funding -- roughly $250,000 at the time.   Democrats, who held a 21-19 majority in the Senate, traditionally had been supportive of Planned Parenthood, while Republicans had been critical of the women’s health group, which provides abortion services. But one of the Democrats -- Sen. Charles Colgan of Prince William County -- was firmly opposed to abortions and planned to vote for Cuccinelli’s amendment. And there was no doubt that Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, would cast a tie-breaking vote to defund Planned Parenthood. Democrats spent much of the afternoon in caucus trying to pressure Colgan to change his vote. They failed, and Bolling pushed the amendment through. Cuccinelli’s victory was short-lived, however. The Planned Parenthood amendment was not part of the final budget approved by the General Assembly two weeks later. McAuliffe’s campaign says an Associated Press story from that day justifies the claim that Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" state government through his amendment. The article said the budget ""was almost killed Wednesday in a partisan Senate duel."" The story added, however, that the amendment was one of several issues that strained relations that day and kept the Senate in session almost eight hours before it narrowly approved its version of the budget. Even if the Senate had failed to pass its spending plan, the article noted, the state’s complicated budget process would have remained alive. McAuliffe’s campaign also backed the statement by pointing to a 2008 blog from the conservative Family Foundation that said Cuccinelli’s amendment ""shut down the Senate for over four hours while Republicans and Democrats fought within their own caucuses."" It should be noted that none of the news stories written that day characterized Cuccinelli’s amendment as an attempt to shut down state government or quoted him making such a claim. The General Assembly that year passed a $77 billion biennial budget on March 13. That was five days past its original deadline, which is not an unusual delay. Then-Gov. Tim Kaine signed the budget on May 9 -- 52 days before it went into effect. Our ruling McAuliffe said Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" state government in order to defund Planned Parenthood. Cuccinelli in 2008 offered a budget amendment that would have ended funding for Planned Parenthood, and debate over the measure tied up the Senate for about four hours. McAuliffe offers no credible evidence that Cuccinelli’s intent was to force state government to close. The Senate, later that same day, approved a budget bill. The final version of the state budget was signed by the governor more than seven weeks before it took effect. McAuliffe has invented a crisis to blame on Cuccinelli. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8B4CC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-tried-shut-down-va-gover/

Sen. Bernie Sanders says Texas Republicans want to abolish Social Security, V.A. health care
","There have been no shortage of claims about Obamacare in the build up to the health insurance marketplaces opening on Oct. 1. On MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the effort by some Republicans to defund Obamacare in exchange for funding the government ""nickels and dimes"" in comparison with other stances they take. ""What Mr. (Ted) Cruz and his Republican friends think in terms of health care is that we should voucherize Medicare, make massive cuts in Medicaid and ignore the fact 48 million Americans have no health insurance at all,"" he said Sept. 25. He used the Republican Party of Texas to criticize the beliefs of the entire party. ""If you look at something like the Texas Republican platform, do you know what they believe in? They believe not only in getting rid of Obamacare,"" he said. ""They believe in abolishing Social Security, abolishing V.A. (Veterans Affairs) health care."" It’s not shocking that most Republicans would have differing views on these programs than Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. But do they really call for these services to be abolished? We wanted to find out. Sanders was referring to the Republican Party of Texas 2012 party platform, spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact in an email. We noticed the platform’s language called for the ""privatization"" of both government programs, but never mentioned the word ""abolish"" or anything similar. GOP Texas Chairman Steve Munisteri said the group does not support abolishment. ""To me, both statements he made are grossly inaccurate,"" he said. Let’s delve further into each issue. Proposed Social Security changes Munisteri emphasized that the proposed Social Security changes would not affect retirees and near-retirees, who have already paid into the Social Security system. Then, for younger people, the platform calls for a ""transition to a system of private pensions based on the concept of individual retirement accounts."" According to previous proposed privatization plans, this would entail individuals redirecting all or part of their current Social Security taxes to a personal account, which would be invested in some sort of asset, said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in Social Security policy. ""They’re very different programs, but there still exists a mandatory, government-regulated retirement program,"" he said. ""People would not be free to invest in their brother-in-law’s South American gold mining stock."" Former President George W. Bush and others have proposed many Social Security privatization plans over the years, but we should note that the platform Sanders referenced doesn’t cite any specific proposal. Still, privatizing Social Security isn’t the same thing as abolishing it. Efficient care for veterans The Republican Party of Texas platform directly addresses health care for veterans, saying, ""The Veterans Administration must become more responsive and more efficient by eliminating its backlog and reducing waiting times for treatment. We support the privatization of veterans' heath care."" To Munisteri, the platform’s call for the privatization of health care means exploring a system in which the government would pay veterans to seek out private health care. Currently, veterans enrolled in the program seek treatment from government-funded facilities. ""The current system is causing veterans to wait too long (for treatment),"" he said. ""We support having other options available for veterans."" Kevin Bacon, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said abolishment of a health care system -- one that includes more than 8.7 million veterans, 150 hospitals and 80 clinics -- would not be a realistic stance. Veterans face a unique set of medical issues that need to be treated, like multiple amputations and PTSD, he said. ""Privatization is one of those terms that have so many different flavors to it,"" Bacon said, noting the complexity of the issue. There are lots of different propositions out there to privatize health care, but no serious options call for an end to providing health care for veterans, Bacon said. Due to a host of different possibilities within the realm of privatized veterans’ care and again, a broad statement from the GOP platform, it’s unclear to us if the V.A. facilities would remain open if the system were privatized. In any case, the Oxford dictionary defines ""abolish"" as meaning to ""formally put an end to (a system, practice, or institution)."" While the privatization of either system Sanders mentioned could drastically change the way these issues are handled, the government would not be removing itself from the responsibility of providing either of these services. Generally speaking, government-funded medical treatment for veterans and retirement benefits for seniors would still exist in some form. Our ruling Sanders' claim that the Texas GOP wants to ""abolish"" Social Security and VA health care didn’t line up with the official 2012 party platform, which called for a ""privatization"" of both programs. Privatization could bring systemic shake-ups to either issue in question, but wouldn’t entirely eliminate the programs. While the state party would like veterans to get their health care through private plans and young people to direct their Social Security taxes to private accounts, we found no evidence that GOP Texans are pushing to eliminate either system entirely. We rate Sanders' claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB39580>],/factchecks/2013/oct/02/bernie-sanders/sen-bernie-sanders-says-texas-republicans-want-abo/
"['Georgia', 'Crime', 'City of Atlanta']","
Atlanta erred in claim on drop in crime
","Atlanta officials had some explaining to do last month when an audit concluded the city mismanaged federal grants designed to combat crime in poor neighborhoods plagued by illegal drug activity. The city disagreed with some of the findings and noted that crime was down significantly in the neighborhoods the program was designed to help. Mayor Kasim Reed’s Office of Communications put out a press release, noting the program had enjoyed some success.  ""From 2009 to 2013, in the Pittsburgh and Mechanicsville neighborhoods, crime is down 42 and 35 points, respectively. In English Avenue and Vine City, major crimes are down 51 percent and 50 percent, respectively, between 2007-2011,"" the city said in a press release. PolitiFact Georgia was curious about the numbers. Did crime really drop by these percentages in those neighborhoods, as the city claimed? From 2007 to 2010, the city of Atlanta received slightly more than $1.1 million in U.S. Justice Department grants for its now-defunct Weed and Seed program. The Justice Department questioned the city’s spending of nearly $400,000 in grant money. ""Weed"" is used to represent the campaign to weed out criminals and drug dealers while ""seed"" represents the effort to plant seeds of revitalization. ""Four elements make up the two-pronged Weed and Seed strategy,"" the Justice Department said in its report. ""Law enforcement; community policing; prevention, intervention, and treatment; and neighborhood restoration."" The four neighborhoods that received help from the Weed and Seed program are located on the city’s south side. Pittsburgh and Mechanicsville are located near Turner Field. English Avenue and Vine City are located near the Atlanta University Center and the Georgia Dome. All four neighborhoods have had trouble with crime, drug dealers and mortgage foreclosures. Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the city, agreed to assist PolitiFact Georgia when we questioned the crime numbers and asked for more details. Campos called us back a couple of days after our initial inquiry. He said the city’s numbers in the press release were incorrect. They were way off base for Mechanicsville. Campos sent PolitiFact Georgia a statement with the corrected statistics: Neighborhood            Claim            Actual Change Mechanicsville            down 35%        up 35% Pittsburgh            down 42%        down 37% Vine City            down 50%        down 44% English Avenue        down 51%        down 45% Campos said the numbers in the original press release were not vetted with the Atlanta Police Department’s Tactical Crime Analysis unit beforehand. Campos took the blame for the incorrect numbers. ""It is worthy to note that major crimes are down for 2011 compared to 2007, collectively, in those four neighborhoods served by Weed & Seed by 21 percent, according to APD’s numbers,"" the city said in a statement. The city posted the statement and the corrected crime statistics in a news release on its website. Again, the city of Atlanta claimed crime was down between 35 and 51 percent in four neighborhoods that received help from its Weed and Seed program. The decrease in crime was not as great as the city claimed in three of the four neighborhoods. In Mechanicsville, the city said crime had declined 35 percent, but it was actually up 35 percent. Campos conceded the crime stats initially presented to the public and news organizations were incorrect. The crime decrease cited by the city in its original statement was not as dramatic as officials said. The city did issue a follow-up press release with the correct numbers. But that came after the initial, incorrect information was broadcast to the public and only after PolitiFact Georgia questioned the initial numbers. PolitiFact has had others who’ve offered mea culpas when we’ve inquired about the accuracy of their claims. In those instances, PolitiFact will still report our findings and note the speaker admitted to making an error. The city fessed up, but that does not erase the initial error. We rate the city’s initial claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA5B580>],/factchecks/2013/oct/02/city-atlanta/atlanta-erred-claim-drop-crime/

That’s not equal protection under the law.’ Yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle (Democrats) are now saying, ‘No, no, no.’ They’re going to protect this sweetheart deal. ... ""Now members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. Is this fair, Mr. Speaker? I think not. Clearly, the other side of the aisle wants to preserve this special deal for Members of Congress granted by the President of the United States."" Hensarling was referring to a provision of President Barack Obama’s health care law that was originally intended as a political maneuver by critics of the law. We asked his office for evidence to support his statement, but we didn't hear back. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring that lawmakers and their staffers obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for Congress. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. The problem arose in the drafting of the law. For most Americans who have employer-based insurance, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance. But the version of the health care bill signed into law doesn’t include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges, now called marketplaces. (Here’s a rundown of how this drafting error occurred.) Without a fix, congressional employees would have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. To fix this problem, the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources office, issued a ruling that allowed the same money that would have been spent on the employer’s old health insurance to instead be spent on whatever they purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. Obamacare critics have portrayed this as a special exemption to protect politically connected lawmakers and staff, one that was unavailable to the public at large. So some lawmakers backed an effort by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to revoke the employer’s premium cost-sharing for members of Congress, aides and other political appointees. As the House and Senate debated how to proceed to end the shutdown, passage of a funding bill with the Vitter Amendment attached was floated as a possibility. So that’s the background. Getting back to Hensarling’s statement, we see four claims embedded in  it: Will members of Congress be ""the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges""? Hardly -- the tax credits commonly known as subsidies under Obamacare were being put into place starting Oct. 1, the same day the shutdown began. Anyone within a specified income range who purchases insurance on the Obamacare marketplace will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2017, about 24 million Americans will be buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces, many of them with federal subsidies. Only time will tell how many Americans eventually sign up, but it’s almost certainly going to be more than the roughly 30,000 people who work in the legislative branch. Will Members of Congress even get ""subsidies""? Not really. All lawmakers and many staffers won’t qualify for the subsidies we discussed above because their income is too high. Instead, what lawmakers and staff will qualify for is better described as employer cost-sharing -- an allotment of money that works exactly the same way as it does for the majority of Americans who get employer-based health care, and that long predated the beginning of the Obamacare exchanges. For Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance, the employer pays a share of the premiums. In this case, that ""employer"" is the federal government. Is this a ""sweetheart deal""? Quite the opposite. Under the law as enacted, lawmakers and congressional aides are actually treated more harshly than any other American. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who have insurance will remain on their existing plans and see few if any disruptions. The marketplaces were created for Americans who lacked insurance entirely or had to buy insurance on their own, without employer assistance. By contrast, the law revokes the longstanding congressional health insurance arrangement and forces them into a new system, something not done for any other class of employee. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff ""particularly badly."" The situation ""isn’t a ‘special handout’ for congressional employees. … People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience."" An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. In short, the ability for congressional employees to keep their employer cost-share merely returns them to the already harsh provision that severs them from their existing health care plan. All the fix does is stop that provision from making even more trouble by forcing them to pay thousands of dollars more. We don’t think this qualifies as a ""sweetheart deal."" Is this ""thanks to the Obama administration""? The Obama administration isn’t entirely blameless -- in the rush to sign Obamacare into law, the president overlooked or ignored the problem looming in the legislative language, and his administration did approve the ""fix."" Still, this controversy has been kept alive largely by Republicans, from the original Republican proposal to the Vitter amendment. So it’s at best a stretch to blame Obama. Our ruling Hensarling said that in a ""sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges."" This statement is wrong in almost every regard. Millions of ordinary Americans who currently lack health coverage are expected to get Obamacare subsidies in the years ahead. Congressional employees who purchase insurance on the marketplaces won’t be getting subsidies so much as they will be benefiting from a traditional employer cost-share, as many other Americans do. Far from getting a ""sweetheart deal,"" congressional employees would otherwise find themselves forced off their existing insurance plan, something the law itself does to no other employment group. And the issue has been largely driven by Republicans, not by the Obama administration. That’s a lot to get wrong in the space of a sentence or two. We rate Hensarling’s comment Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA5BB80>],/factchecks/2013/oct/01/jeb-hensarling/gop-rep-jeb-hensarling-assails-sweetheart-deal-law/

 Government report said 6.5 percent of border miles were under top level of control
","Continuing his call for more border security, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said in a flier recently mailed to his constituents, ""In 2010, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border was under full control of the Border Patrol."" That’s not a lot of border. Is he right? Kim Smith, a spokeswoman for the San Antonio Republican (whose district runs north into Travis County), emailed us a web link to a Feb. 15, 2011, GAO report describing the five levels of border security the Border Patrol used from 2005 through 2010. The agency has not announced a new official measure but has said it plans to do so this year. In fiscal 2010, the report said, about 44 percent of the border was under ""operational control,"" meaning the two highest levels of security: 129 miles at the highest level, ""controlled,"" and 744 miles at the second-highest level, ""managed."" Dividing 129 by the border’s total 1,993 miles yields 6.5 percent. No miles were classed under the lowest level of security. About 1,120 miles were described as ""not acceptable for border security"" -- two-thirds of these were ""monitored,"" the third-highest level, and one-third were ""low-level monitored,"" the fourth security level. The levels describe how comprehensively an area is covered and how close to the border the agents and equipment are. A GAO report issued Dec. 10, 2012, explained it this way: ""Resources were in place to apprehend illegal activity at the immediate border for 129 southwest border miles, or at some distance from the border for an additional 744 southwest border miles.""   Feb. 15, 2011, GAO report’s description of levels used in 2010:       Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations nonpartisan think tank, told us by phone that ""controlled,"" the highest level, meant agents and surveillance were directly on the border or within a few hundred yards. ""The only places where the Border Patrol deems this necessary is in a very small number of what were historically high-traffic corridors, so San Diego, El Paso … mostly urban areas,"" he said. ""The reason you need to be on top of those areas,"" Alden said, is that ""in an urban area, with El Paso and Juárez backed up together, if somebody gets over the wall, you know it’s a minute until they disappear into the streets of El Paso. The San Diego border, it’s a little farther, sort of a suburban area, but it’s pretty easy to disappear,"" he said. ""Managed,"" the second level of security, ""can mean a series of cameras at various points, various distances from the border; it can mean physical patrols by the agents that two or three times a day go past the same area,"" Alden said. ""Most of the border’s unpopulated, and you’re miles and miles from the nearest road. … You’ve got a surveillance camera that spots somebody in Arizona crossing the border, they may have a two-day walk before they get to the road"" -- less if they’re in a vehicle, he said, but still not requiring instant response. Do any of the levels equate to ""full control""? A former head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Doris Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an interview, ""It obviously depends on what you define as full control,"" but after years of ""incredible investment"" along the border with Mexico, ""crossings are dramatically down in almost all of the high-traffic areas ... Overall, the enforcement picture at the border is vastly improved from what it was ten years ago."" In light of those facts, Lamar Smith’s statement ""sounds misleading to me,"" she said. PolitiFact has brushed on the border security buildup and drop in apprehensions before. We also found in a Sept. 6, 2013, fact-check that as many as 40 percent of undocumented U.S. residents didn’t get here by crossing a border illegally at all, but by overstaying their visas. The congressman’s flier notes the latter statistic alongside the border security claim in its section on ""Supporting immigration enforcement."" At the border, complete control -- zero illegal entries -- is improbable, and isn’t the goal. Lamar Smith’s spokeswoman pointed out that the 2011 GAO report said, ""Border Patrol stated that operational control does not require its agents to be able to detect and apprehend all illegal entries."" In testimony to a House subcommittee Feb. 11, 2013, the GAO's then-director of Homeland Security and Justice, Richard Stana, said that the ""resources that would be needed to absolutely prevent every single incursion would be something probably out of reasonable consideration."" Lamar Smith told us in an interview, ""You make me think now, I wish I’d used the word ‘controlled,’ because ‘full control’ sounds so absolute that ‘controlled’ sounds to me to be less certain."" But ""the operative word is ‘control,’ I think, where they know they actually have a high probability of apprehending somebody who’s coming across,"" he said, adding that he also uses the 44 percent ""operational control"" figure when discussing border security."" Alden called Rep. Smith’s statement misleading because ""operational control"" -- the Border Patrol’s top two security levels, covering 44 percent of the border miles in 2010 -- meant the Border Patrol was detecting and responding to ""90, 95 percent"" of the illegal entry activity there, he said, pointing us to the appendices of the 2012 GAO report for details. Using numbers in that report, a June 21, 2013, Washington Post news blog entry calculated ""effectiveness"" ratings for the nine border sectors -- the percentage of total estimated illegal entries in which the Border Patrol apprehended suspects or turned back suspects with a likelihood that they returned to Mexico:
          In fiscal 2010 and 2011, the nine Border Patrol sectors ranged from 63 percent to 96 percent effectiveness. 2010’s two highest-rated sectors accounted for 21 percent of the border’s nearly 2,000 miles and illustrate some of the physical differences Alden indicated. El Paso’s 286-mile sector averaged 96 percent effectiveness across New Mexico and Texas terrain described in the report as ""including mountains and arid desert with canyons,"" 88 miles of river border ""and an urban metropolitan area."" Of the sector’s 11 Border Patrol stations, seven were on the border and four in the interior. The 126-mile Yuma, Ariz., sector averaged 95 percent effectiveness in fiscal 2010 over ""sandy desert terrain, mountains and river valleys … sand dunes and several mountain ranges … In addition, large portions of the Yuma sector fall within federal land and military reservations."" The sector had two border stations and one interior station. Our ruling Lamar Smith wrote, ""In 2010, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border was under full control of the Border Patrol."" That report showed 6.5 percent of border miles in fiscal 2010 were under the Border Patrol’s top level of security, meaning agents and equipment were constantly present and monitoring the border -- a level of enforcement usually reserved for high-traffic urban areas. But the rest of the border’s not a sieve. The same report said 44 percent of border miles were under what the agency considered acceptable levels of security. We rate this claim, lacking such clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Barack Obama says new health law offers average American more than 50 plans
","A central goal of Obamacare is to promote competition among insurance companies. This produced the online health insurance exchanges, now called marketplaces. In theory, these marketplaces will make it easier for people to shop for the best deal, just as they would buy home appliances or anything else sold on the Web. During a speech in Maryland, President Barack Obama touted the success the marketplaces had achieved in providing individuals with options. ""In states where the federal government helps run these marketplaces, the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from, with different levels of coverage,"" Obama told the crowd. We thought it would be worthwhile to take a closer look at that. Would the average person actually see 50 different offerings? To what extent does talking about averages mask wide variations? We contacted the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services, and they pointed us to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services. That assessment stated, ""Individuals will have an average of 53 qualified health plan choices in states where HHS will fully or partially run the Marketplace."" To be clear, this was not a claim that if you went to a state website you would find 53 insurance companies competing for your business. There might be four or seven or some other number of companies participating in the marketplace but each of them offers multiple insurance plans. Some plans would cost less per month but put more risk on the buyer with higher deductibles, and others would cost more but be more generous if you become ill. The government’s analysis included 36 states. There are 11 other states and the District of Columbia that run their marketplaces entirely on their own. The 36 states in the government study all rely on Washington completely or partially to operate their programs. The HHS math  The report included a table with the states and the number of plans offered in each one. At the bottom of the column is a cell labeled ""Average, 36 states"" and the number for that cell is 53. An HHS spokesperson told us that figure reflected the number of uninsured people in each state. So a state with a larger number of uninsured would have a bigger impact on the calculation than a state with fewer uninsured people. So the president's claim is in line with the HHS findings. Averages mask big differences Averages don’t lie, but they don’t tell the full truth either. A person going to Arizona’s online exchange would find 106 plans; someone in Florida would see 102. But if you try to buy in Alabama, your choices are limited to seven plans. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, you can pick from 12. The variation doesn’t end there. Within each state, there are insurance regions. In some larger states, some regions are flush with plans and others less so. In Pennsylvania, residents of Beaver County, northwest of Pittsburgh, have 41 choices; their fellow Keystone staters in Union County in the center of the state have 119 options. In Texas, the spread is from 25 plans in some places to 71 in others. In Virginia, the low is 27 and the high is 68. The number of plans in a particular place depends on the decisions of private health insurance companies. Insurers contract with hospitals and other care providers. Hospitals tend to serve their local area. Generally speaking, insurance companies are active in places where they have contracts with local providers. If it doesn’t make business sense for them to serve a community, they don’t offer plans in that region. There are exceptions but as a rule, urban areas tend to have more competition than rural ones. This pattern existed before the Affordable Care Act, and it continues under it. There’s a third level of variation, according to Sabrina Corlette, senior research fellow at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. ""If you only have one insurance company offering 50 different plans in an exchange, that might offer choice, but it ain't competition,"" Corlette said. We didn’t find that exact scenario in any state, but we did see that in Missouri, just two companies are in the exchange. (Depending on the region, they offer between 12 and 23 plans.) In contrast, in Ohio, the average across the state’s regions is five, and one region has eight firms in the marketplace. The number of insurance companies matters because it seems to be tied to competition. The HHS report found that ""states with the lowest average premium tend to have a higher average number of issuers offering qualified health plans."" Corlette said Obamacare seems to have drawn new companies into the market. The law helped fund the creation of nonprofit health insurance co-ops, and Corlette counted 23 co-ops nationwide. Plus, she said companies that historically participated in the Medicaid program were moving into the commercial market to take advantage of the premium subsidies in Obamacare. ""I do concur with the general statement that exchanges are generating more competition,"" Corelette said. ""At least in some states."" Our ruling Obama said the average American will have more than 50 plans to choose from. A Department of Health and Human Services analysis of the number of plans offered in each state, weighted by population, backs up Obama's figure. But talking about the average number of plans masks significant variation among states and within regions of many states. The average obscures that some people may have far fewer plans to choose from. In some places, just two insurance companies are in the market which undercuts competition even further. We rate the claim Half True. Editor’s note: We received a response from the HHS on Oct. 2, 2013, after we initially published our item. The agency clarified that it arrived at its figure of 53 plans by weighting the calculation to account for the number of uninsured in each state, and our report now includes their comments. The rating is unchanged at Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDA4EC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/01/barack-obama/obama-says-new-health-law-offers-more-than-50-choi/

Nearly all Texans who vote by mail need not present a photo ID
","Toward the end of a press release describing the Texas mandate that voters present photo identification at the polls, the League of Women Voters of Texas Education Fund said: ""Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail."" Say what? Granted, there is an obvious logistical lurch in requiring someone who mails in a ballot to also in some fashion prove that they are the person whose ballot is being cast. That is, for you youngsters, there’s not yet an instant-check app for that. But still, if the 2011 ID law put in place by the state’s ruling Republicans was intended to prevent voter impersonation, it’s arguably a twist that there is no ID provision for those who vote by mail. As noted by the league, voters going to the polls will be expected to present a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or by the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). The registration deadline for voting in the Nov. 5, 2013, election is Oct. 7. So, no photo ID for Texans voting by mail? By email, Linda Krefting of Lubbock, who chairs the education fund, pointed out the 2011 law has no provision for photo IDs being presented in connection with balloting by mail. She also pointed out a query and reply on a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" web page kept by the Texas Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections: ""Does the new photo ID requirement apply to voting by mail? ""A. The new requirement does not change the process for voting by mail."" Another question and answer on the web page delivers more detail, stating that a registered voter wishing to vote early by mail, which is no longer called ""absentee voting,"" may request a mail ballot by meeting any of several conditions. That is, according to the answer, the voter will be out of her or his home county on Election Day and during the early-voting period or the voter is sick or disabled or she or he will be 65 or older on Election Day or confined in jail though still eligible to vote. Chapter 82 of the Texas Election Code further defines ""disabled""; a disability can include an expectation of being in childbirth on Election Day, for instance. Also, a person in jail can be allowed to vote in person at the discretion of the authority in charge of the jail, the law says. By telephone, Alicia Pierce, an office spokeswoman, confirmed that the state voter ID law did not impose photo ID requirements on Texans voting by mail. But there is a photo-ID element to federal law, Pierce said, in that a first-time voter who registers to vote without providing either their photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number will be asked by county officials to send a copy of their ID if she or he requests a mail ballot. By phone, Dana DeBeauvoir, the Travis County clerk, told us local officials must request a copy of a photo ID of such first-time voters in accord with the federal Help America Vote Act, which took effect in 2006. She said the ID copy must be sent back to the county in the envelope holding, but separate from, the sealed mail-in ballot. DeBeauvoir emailed us the county’s notice requesting photo IDs of such voters. Notably, it says that mail-ballot voters are still not required to send a copy of a photo ID if they check a box indicating they are ""disabled, in the military or living overseas."" DeBeauvoir said that in the 2012 general election, about 3 percent of the county’s ballots for president were submitted by mail. A snapshot of current events: In late September 2013, county elections official Michelle Parker told us by phone that 1,767 of the county’s more than 600,000 registered voters--less than 3/10 of 1 percent--had been flagged to possibly be asked for photo IDs should those voters seek to vote by mail in the 2013 elections. Our ruling The league said: """"Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail."" That’s correct for all but first-time voters who did not present a photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when registering to vote. Such voters who seek to vote by mail can expect to be asked for a copy of their photo ID, yet even these voters do not have to do so if they are disabled, in the military or living overseas.

Dan Gelber says Florida paychecks aren't going as far today as they did a decade ago
","Gov. Rick Scott is using ""gimmicks"" to take credit for an economic recovery in Florida, Miami attorney and former state Sen. Dan Gelber writes in an article for the online website, ContextFlorida. ""Scott’s self-congratulatory claims of success simply don’t comport with the harsh facts that for the last decade, Floridians’ salaries have shrunk substantially while the cost of living has increased,"" Gelber wrote. We decided to fact-check Gelber’s claim. First, however, we have to clear up some confusion Gelber created with his statement. Taken literally, Gelber argues that salaries in Florida decreased over the past decade, while the cost of living increased. But what Gelber was trying to say is that Floridians’ paychecks don’t go as far today as they did a decade ago. Put another way, salaries ""have shrunk substantially"" when adjusted for inflation. Inflation is another way of saying cost of living. As evidence to that claim, Gelber pointed to a report produced by economists at Florida International University called the ""State of Working Florida 2013."" The report looks at the ""economic lives"" of Floridians, mostly working in the private sector, from periods of time between 2000 and 2012. Using statistics from 2004-12, the report concludes that the median wage of all salary and wage employees fell 4.34 percent when adjusted for inflation. Put another way, people’s paychecks in 2004 went further than they do today. We sought out other economists and studies to see what they had to say on the topic, which produced several caveats. Alan Hodges, an extension scientist the University of Florida’s Food & Resource Economics Department, noted that issues with salaries are not isolated to Florida. Salaries ""have been stagnant over the last decade nationally,"" he said, the result of the economic slowdown following Sept. 11, 2001, and the later global economic recession. Florida’s economy was ""interrupted by two pretty severe shocks to the economy,"" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. But saying that salaries have shrunk substantially ""is painting a more grim picture than what the reality is as far as wages and income in the state,"" he said. The U.S. Census Bureau, which collects information from individuals and households, provides figures on median earnings -- that’s the midway point where half of households earn more and half earn less. Many economists prefer median figures because ""average"" salaries can be skewed by outliers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1999 (when information was collected for the 2000 census), median wages in Florida for men 16 and over who worked full-time, year-round were $32,212 and for women, $25,480. Adjusted for inflation, men would have to earn $44,389, and women, $35,112, in 2012 to keep pace. But in 2012, census figures showed that men made a median salary of $40,889 annually while women earned $34,202. That's about an 8 percent decrease in buying power for men and about a 3 percent decrease for women over that time period. The 8 percent decline for men is ""substantial,"" Hodges said. Another way to crunch the numbers comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles average annual pay. Using their statistics from 2000 to 2012, economists said that average pay -- when adjusted for inflation -- actually increased 6 percent. (Remember, economists generally prefer median figures because ""average"" salaries can be skewed by outliers.) Another issue -- besides what years you use and whether you measure median or average wages -- is how you measure inflation, economists told us. The most-typical way is by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI measures what urban consumers (about 87 percent of the population) are buying. It doesn’t reflect the spending of people living in rural areas, farm families, military and people in prisons and other institutions. The Consumer Price Index is compiled for the nation, the four regions of the country and 26 metropolitan areas. In Florida, the index measures spending in the St. Petersburg-Tampa-Clearwater area and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, but there isn't a Consumer Price Index compiled on a state-by-state basis. That can be an issue when considering a Florida-based claim. In the FIU study Gelber cited, cost-of-living figures are based on numbers for the southern region, which is comprised of Washington, D.C., and 16 states, including Florida, Texas, Alabama and Virginia. Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Economic Opportunity, said that ""using a regional or national CPI would not be appropriate"" to adjust Florida salaries for inflation. Added Troy Martin, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis: ""Consumers in different areas are consuming different goods and services that make comparison difficult. Someone in a Manhattan condo pays $4,000 a month for a one-bedroom condo while someone in Nebraska living in a five-bedroom house may be spending $1,000 a month. How do you compare those?"" That said, while CPI is not a perfect measure of cost of living, ""it is the best information we have available,"" Hodges said. Our ruling Gelber wrote that Floridians’ ""salaries have shrunk substantially while the cost of living has increased.""  In an un-artful way, Gelber is claiming that a Floridian’s salary doesn’t go as far today as it did a decade ago. While one calculation bucks Gelber's claim, the evidence generally backs him up. Reports show that salaries have shrunk when adjusted for inflation. The one calculation that does not is also the least persuasive. Still, economists we spoke with noted several caveats and cautioned against reaching broad conclusion. As such, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA58A80>],/factchecks/2013/oct/01/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-says-florida-paychecks-arent-going-far-/

Group blames Deal for bill defeat
","Gov. Nathan Deal has typically received high marks from gun advocacy groups, so we were surprised by a flier one group put together that accused him of derailing pro-gun legislation earlier this year. ""Nathan Deal killed pro-gun bills in 2013. Will he do it again in 2014?"" the flier read with a photo of the governor. Next to the photo were several demands. ""No new mental health mandates. No new mandatory training requirements. No Gun Control, No Deals!"" The fliers were paid for by Georgia Gun Owners, which describes itself on its website as ""the ONLY no-compromise, no-sell out grassroots gun organization in the State of Georgia."" So, we wondered, what pro-gun bills did the governor eliminate this year? Patrick Parsons, the executive director of Georgia Gun Owners, talked about the matter with the Atlanta-based weekly Creative Loafing. ""Governor Deal, his staff, and others worked behind the scenes to water down pro-gun bills,"" Parsons said. ""They wanted to run out the clock. And that's exactly what they did. We want the governor to publicly support passage of clean, pro-gun bills, not bills watered down with anti-gun amendments."" The group handed out fliers in August at the governor’s ""Grillin' with the Governor"" event at Lake Lanier. Deal is facing a quandary, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted in April after two pro-gun bills were not passed during this year’s legislative session. The governor doesn’t want to be labeled as an obstructionist among gun supporters and have new conservative enemies during his re-election bid next year. ""We do think that over this next recess period that there will be an opportunity to bring the different points of view together in a more orderly fashion than the last few days of the session allowed,"" Deal told the AJC. ""And perhaps some middle ground can be found."" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out more about the veracity of the group’s claim. Parsons said he would provide information to back up the claim in the flier. PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Georgia Gun Owners four times over the past month, but we did not get a response. We even took a drive to Kennesaw to the address listed on the organization’s website. The address was a UPS store. Brian Robinson, the communications director for the governor, said he was baffled by the claim. The fliers are apparently focused on two bills that included language concerning firearms training and gun laws for anyone with a mental illness. Republican lawmakers pushed legislation during this year’s legislative session that would allow concealed weapons in new locations, including the more than 50 campuses of the state's university and technical college systems. Current Georgia law permits students to keep firearms locked in vehicles in university parking lots, but nowhere else. Two bills aimed at easing some restrictions concerning guns on campus, House Bill 512 and Senate Bill 101, passed their respective chambers with some tweaks to the legislation. Neither bill, however, reached the governor’s desk for his signature. The Georgia Board of Regents, which provides oversight for the University System of Georgia, fought the bills. So, too, did University System Chancellor Hank Huckaby, a former legislator who still holds sway in the Legislature. Deal had concerns about some parts of the legislation, the AJC reported. On March 13, the newspaper reported that the governor offered support for only one portion of the bill that would strengthen the rules about how people with mental illness qualify for a weapons ""carry"" license. ""It expands the population who will be flagged by an instant background check, which the governor believes will protect innocent Georgians, "" Robinson said at the time. The Associated Press reported Deal’s staff forwarded an email from Huckaby to a state representative that noted that few states allow firearms on campus. The AP also reported his chief of staff made it clear in a meeting that Deal was not personally backing the proposal, although one of the governor’s Senate floor leaders was backing the bill. Deal’s staff said the lawmaker was backing it for his own reasons. House and Senate leaders worked on a compromise of their respective bills to come up with something that both chambers and Deal could support during the final two weeks of the session. On March 28, the final day of the session, the negotiations continued near midnight. No bill was passed. Sine die. ""We thought we had a deal,"" the AJC quoted an exasperated Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, chairman of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. Powell said in March that House and Senate negotiators had agreed, after Deal stepped in, to allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry weapons on college campuses with the stipulation that permit holders between the ages of 21 and 25 would have to complete an eight-hour safety course first. Senators then told House negotiators that they wanted to require anyone, regardless of age, to complete the safety course before being allowed to carry a firearm on campus. ""We had a conflict over some of the language that the Senate was opposed to,"" Powell told PolitiFact Georgia. Some lawmakers have said they oppose any mandatory training. Powell took issue with the description in the flier that the bills had been killed. ""Those bills are still alive and well and still kicking,"" Powell told us, adding they could be adopted in 2014. Powell said the governor did not talk to him about anything in the legislation. Powell said Georgia Gun Owners ""blamed our committee for a lot of things that were not correct."" To sum up, Georgia Gun Owners claimed Deal killed some pro-gun bills earlier this year. It does appear from public statements from Deal’s office earlier this year that he was concerned about some elements of the bills under consideration. So, too, were other key voices. House and Senate lawmakers are still debating the matter six months later. The flier suggests the failure of these bills to pass earlier this year was the governor’s fault. We think that’s a bit of a stretch. Our rating: Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB0D280>],/factchecks/2013/oct/01/georgia-gun-owners/group-blames-deal-bill-defeat/
"['Rhode Island', 'Campaign Finance', 'Candidate Biography', 'Anthony Gemma']","
Gemma says Bill Lynch ""told three lies in ten seconds""
","
When congressional candidate Anthony Gemma sent out a news release with the headline ""Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds,"" he practically challenged PolitiFact  to check the accusation.

Not only did he call one of his Democratic primary opponents a liar, but in specifying a time frame, he forced us to pull out our stopwatch.

The action started during the 1st Congressional District debate Aug. 18 on WPRO (630-AM) radio when the two candidates took several good shots at each other.

A day later, Gemma ratcheted up the rhetoric by sending out a news release that accused Lynch of multiple lies -- and fast ones at that.  It was part of what Gemma calls his ""Enough is Enough Initiative,"" his vehicle for attacking opponents. 

A video tape of the debate shows this is what Lynch said:      

""What I am going to tell Anthony, and it’s understandable that he wouldn’t know — not having been involved, not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago, and someone who didn’t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election, has only been a Democrat for a couple of months, and really his only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri.""

First of all, Lynch's somewhat rambling statement is more like 23 seconds. If you cut out the introductory clauses, it gets down to about 15 seconds. Either way, it’s not 10.

And Lynch makes five claims, not three. Let's take a look at them, point by point.

Keep in mind that we're fact-checking Gemma's statement. But to do so, we need to check what Lynch said.

1) Gemma has not been ""involved"" in politics. We can't evaluate this one, because it's a subjective comment, not a fact.

2)  Gemma was ""not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago.""

Gemma told us he first registered in Providence many years ago, moving his registration to Cumberland when he relocated there in the 1990s, before moving again, to Lincoln, in 2004.

The Cumberland Board of Canvassers has a record showing Gemma registered to vote there in 1998. In Lincoln, town records show Gemma has been registered to vote since 2004 and voted in the November 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections.

It was difficult to verify Gemma's entire registration history, in part because of record-keeping problems at the boards of canvassers and the move from paper to computer records.

But we verified that Gemma has been registered for at least six years, so Lynch's second claim is false.

3) Gemma ""didn’t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election.""

The Lynch team now says it was referring to Gemma's failure to vote in the March 2008 presidential primary. But the Lincoln Board of Canvassers and the secretary of state's office both confirm that Gemma voted in the November 2008 general election. So Lynch is wrong on that one too. (For the record, we asked Gemma whom he voted for, and he said Barack Obama.)

4)  Gemma ""has only been a Democrat for a couple of months.""

Records from Lincoln and the secretary of state show that Gemma registered as a Democrat in May 2010 -- the month before he announced his candidacy for Congress. Prior to that, he was registered as unaffiliated since 2004.

When we asked Gemma why he accused Lynch of lying about this fact, he insisted he has ""always been a Democrat"" even if his voter registration doesn't indicate so. He can call himself whatever he wants, but his official designation tells a different story. Therefore, Lynch's claim is true.

5)  ""Really [Gemma’s] only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri.""

Gemma’s campaign finance reports show that in recent years he gave about $3,000 to a small group of candidates. Carcieri received the largest sum: $1,000, almost a third of the total. But Gemma also donated to U.S. Rep. James Langevin, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and former Providence Mayor Joseph Paolino, a developer. So Lynch's claim is false.

Now let’s get back to Gemma's original accusation: ""Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds."" As we know there were five statements -- of which we checked four -- and it was at least 15 seconds, not 10.

So we’re not sure how Gemma did his timing. His explanation: if you take any three of these claims they’ll add up to 10 seconds. That's very creative timekeeping.

But we understand we're nitpicking. So let’s look at the more substantive part of the claim. Three of the four factual accusations Lynch made were wrong. Whether they were lies or misstatements is for someone other than PolitiFact to decide.

Remember though, we’re ruling on what Gemma said, not Lynch's accuracy.

While Lynch’s claims might have warranted a check, Gemma trumped them by putting out a news release that was intended to be provocative. Instead of just pointing out Lynch’s inaccuracies, he called him a liar and he cited a precise time frame. Neither point was completely right and Gemma deserves to be called out on that. But the meat of what Gemma said about his opponent's accusations was correct. 

So we’ll give him a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4C9E1B240>],/factchecks/2010/aug/26/anthony-gemma/gemma-says-bill-lynch-told-three-lies-10-seconds/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Iraq', 'Stimulus', 'Mark Tapscott']","
Did the stimulus cost more than the war in Iraq?
","
Washington Examiner editorial page editor Mark Tapscott warned readers Aug. 23, 2010, to expect to hear a lot from Democrats about the cost of the Iraq War. It might be expensive, he said, but not as expensive as President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus.

Citing data from conservative writer Randall Hoven, Tapscott said, ""Obama’s stimulus, passed in his first month in office, will cost more than the entire Iraq War -- more than $100 billion more.""

Really? Could the nearly seven-year-long war cost less than the 2009 stimulus, which was designed to keep the U.S. economy from sliding into a depression?

At first glance, the numbers look pretty close. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office, released in August 2010, put the total cost for the stimulus -- from February 2009 through 2019 -- at $814 billion. Estimated funding for the war in Iraq totals $709 billion from 2003 to 2010, according to the same CBO report.

But note the different time periods. The stimulus costs are projected through 2019. But the war spending is calculated only to the end of this year.

We also should note that the $814 billion cost for the stimulus includes $70 billion to fix a problem with the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is designed to target the wealthiest taxpayers but is gradually affecting more people in the middle class. 
As for the war cost, we found a variety of opinions on the total. Some reports have higher estimates than the CBO’s for that same time period.

A July 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated the cost at $748 billion, which includes costs for the military, the State Department and foreign aid, and Veterans Administration medical costs related to the war. Add in supplemental appropriation from 2010, and you get about $750 billion, said James R. Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that studies tax and fiscal issues.

Another expert on defense spending told us it’s also important to account for inflation. ""The cost of the Iraq War going back seven years and the cost of the stimulus act through 2019 cover a broad stretch of time over which inflation becomes important,"" Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said in an e-mail. The center is a think tank that focuses on defense issues.

Adjusted for inflation, the cost of the Iraq War to date totals $756 billion and the stimulus act totals about $820 billion, according to Harrison.

So by that barometer, Tapscott is right that spending on the stimulus exceeds the cost of the Iraq war, although by $64 billion, rather than $100 billion.

But there’s a big assumption in his logic. As Harrison put it to us, the comparison ""assumes the cost of the Iraq War ends"" this year.

The costs are still adding up. Although the last combat troops have been withdrawn from Iraq, there are still 49,700 troops on the ground conducting security patrols and training Iraqis. And troops are expected to remain until the end of December 2011. Harrison noted that the president’s 2011 budget includes an additional $43.4 billion for Iraq, and ""even if the withdrawal continues as planned, we are likely to see a request of $10 billion-$5 billion in the 2012 budget.""

And the number could be much higher depending how broadly you define the cost of the war. Some experts believe you should include the continuing costs of disability compensation and medical care for Iraqi war veterans -- costs that will last for decades.

Linda Bilmes, senior lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-author of the Three Trillion Dollar War, argues that official government estimates of the war’s costs are too low because they do not take into account costs such as higher combat pay and recruiting costs, Social Security disability payments for veterans who can no longer work, the cost of restoring the military to its pre-war strength (replacing the bullets and bombs that have been used). She and Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist at Columbia University, argue that the ""true"" cost of Iraq will be several trillion dollars.

Bilmes also notes that there are a higher number of disabled veterans from the war in Iraq than in previous wars. According to Bilmes, there are eight veterans wounded in combat in Iraq per fatality,  compared with 2.6 wounded in combat per fatality in Vietnam. In addition, she said in an e-mail, 10 percent of Vietnam veterans enrolled in Veterans Administration health care -- whereas 44 percent of Iraq veterans have already enrolled in VA health care.  Her book estimates the long-term cost of continuing medical care of Iraq and Afghanistan vets to be hundreds of billions of dollars. 
So let’s recap. If it were true that the war and its costs had truly ended today, then Tapscott would be right. But he says that the stimulus will cost more than the ""entire"" war, and we are persuaded by the experts that with nearly 50,000 troops still in Iraq, it is premature to say the war is over. And when you make reasonable adjustments for inflation, the expected costs of the troops still there and the long-term cost of medical care and re-stocking the military for all the bullets and bombs, it appears likely the war costs will exceed the stimulus. So we find his claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEA4840>],/factchecks/2010/aug/25/mark-tapscott/did-stimulus-cost-more-war-iraq/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Lee Fisher']","
Lee Fisher says Rob Portman “actually sucked the jobs” out of Ohio
","
Lee Fisher has stopped tap-dancing around it.

Ohio’s Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate used to suggest that his opponent, Rob Portman, played a big role in promoting job-killing free trade agreements. But on July 31 in Youngstown, Fisher ditched the notion that Portman was just a cog in the wheel, conferring new status on his Republican rival: Portman was at the controls of the job-sucking vacuum.

""I’m running against Congressman Portman, who was George Bush’s trade advisor,"" Fisher said while campaigning in the Mahoning Valley. ""He’s the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the Valley and sent them to China.""

With apologies to H. Ross Perot, who famously described the ""giant sucking sound"" of jobs going abroad, Fisher was getting at the heart of an Ohio campaign issue. He was saying to the voters of the Youngstown region: If you’ve lost your job, as many around here have, blame it squarely on Rob Portman.

How can you prove something like that?

We asked, and the Fisher campaign provided several statistics and pieces of information, which fit together like this:

First, Portman was a Republican member of Congress who voted in 2000 for normalized trade relations with China. That opened the door to more Chinese imports here, and more American exports to China, without the annual reviews of human rights violations that used to be required before Chinese trade could go forward.

Next, Portman was President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador from May 2005 to April 2006. And as trade ambassador, Portman supported Bush’s decision in December 2005 to turn down American steel makers who wanted import restrictions against China.

The U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent fact-finding panel within the Commerce Department, had recommended the protections because Chinese steel pipe imports were surging into the United States, threatening the domestic pipe industry.

But Bush had the ultimate say, and he decided that the potential harm to the United States economy, including to the construction industry, was too great to restrict the Chinese pipe. Portman reiterated that view as well, when asked about the decision by a member of Congress in 2006.

Here’s what happened because of these actions, Fisher says. The trade deficit with China went from $162 billion in 2004 to $202 billion in 2005.

Furthermore, the trade deficit with China between 2000 and 2008 cost Ohio 91,800 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, or EPI, a labor-affiliated think tank whose work is cited by Fisher.

Those job losses, according to EPI, included 5,500 in the 17th Congressional District, which includes most of the Mahoning Valley and a swath of Akron, and 3,300 in the 6th Congressional District, which includes Boardman,  just south of Youngstown.

In the steel tube and pipe industry alone, 500 jobs were lost in the United States, including some in Mahoning Valley plants, because of trade abuses by China, according to a Plain Dealer story in 2008 that Fisher’s aides cited.

Fisher’s trade deficit figures, provided by the Census Bureau, are good, although they do not specifically measure the trade imbalance in the Mahoning Valley. That would be impossible to measure because thorough import data is not available at the local level.

But numbers for the other side of the ledger, exports, are available at the local level. From 2005 to 2006, while Portman was trade ambassador, the value of exports from the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman metropolitan area rose by 10.7 percent, to $1.25 billion, according to Commerce Department data we reviewed independently of the Fisher and Portman campaigns.

Exports from the Youngstown metro area rose by only 2 percent the following year, but by 2008 they had jumped by another 14 percent, Commerce figures show.

So if you were viewing only exports, you might say that trade deals helped the Youngstown area. But several experts, as well as economic data, suggest that exports were hardly enough to compensate for job losses.

In fact, if any place in America has faced tough times, it is the Mahoning Valley. In 2000, there were 224,200 private-sector jobs in the Youngstown metro market. By the end of last year, there were 187,800, a 16 percent drop over the decade, according to figures we reviewed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The biggest hits have been in heavy manufacturing, including the once-dominant steel industry, and with those hits came losses in the service industries that supported communities, according to Robert E. Scott, a senior international economist at EPI.

The Mahoning Valley’s economic decline began in the 1970s with steel imports from Japan, says John Russo, director of labor studies and co-director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University. But China picked up the mantle later, and foreign trade has absolutely created a drag on the economy, Russo says.

There’s no disputing that since 2000, things in the valley have gotten worse. So we also won’t quibble here with EPI’s figures for trade-related job losses, partly because no one else has come up with an accurate measurement. But EPI’s numbers are actually an ""estimate of labor displacement,"" the think tank says, or an extrapolation drawn from employment statistics, census data and trade data. The figures, EPI says, seek to measure the result of the trade imbalance regardless of its causes, which include dumping of cheaper products in this country, price controls in foreign countries, steep tariffs to U.S. products abroad, and currency manipulation by China.

We are leery for a different reason, however, of using the EPI numbers to support Fisher’s claim. EPI’s figures include eight years of job losses, and Portman was trade ambassador for only 11 months. Although he was in Congress before joining the White House, Portman was one of 237 House members to vote for trade with China, and the measure passed by a margin of 40 votes. Then-President Bill Clinton fought to get that result, yet Fisher is not blaming Clinton – or Portman’s 163 Republican and 73 Democratic colleagues who also voted for passage in the House -- for sucking jobs out of the Mahoning Valley.

We admit, the bar here for Fisher is high. That’s because Fisher said that Portman is ""the one"" who caused the jobs to go away.

Is Fisher’s claim fair?

""To the extent that he failed to deal with these things, he contributed to the problem,"" said Scott, of EPI.

We put the same question to Russo at Youngstown State, and he said Fisher’s statement could be considered partly true. You could blame Portman, he said, and Bush, and former and successive trade ambassadors, and corporate CEOs, and China for manipulating its currency and raising barriers to U.S. exports, and Treasury secretaries, and anybody else who has been involved in Chinese manufacturing and trade policy. The list goes on and on, Russo says, and includes members of both parties who have failed to develop a real strategy for dealing with manufacturing.

By the same token, Fisher was state development director during some of the worst job losses, in charge of retaining Ohio jobs and attracting new ones. Using Labor Department data, we determined that the Youngstown metro area shed 16,900 jobs -- an 8.25 percent loss -- during the time Fisher led the state’s job retention efforts.

Was Fisher ""the one"" responsible for those losses?

We’re not contending that. Rather, we’re raising the point because the economic forces that caused the entire region to fall are beyond any single person – even a candidate for Senate.

So we go back to Fisher’s words: ""He’s the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the Valley and sent them to China.""

That’s a big responsibility for one man, even if he was trade ambassador for 11 months. Too big, we think. That’s why we rate Fisher’s claim False.

Kendrick Meek only one of big three in U.S. Senate race to support Sonia Sotomayor
","
Now that U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek has dispatched billionaire U.S. Senate Democratic rival Jeff Greene, Meek is quickly pivoting to a general election campaign where he will face Republican Marco Rubio and a former Republican, Gov. Charlie Crist.

That means Meek will do everything he can between now and Nov. 2, 2010, to distinguish himself from his two opponents.

At his Aug. 24, 2010, primary victory speech at the Westin Diplomat in Hollywood, Meek labeled his two major fall opponents conservative. He repeated a claim that PolitiFact Florida ruled Mostly True, that he is the only candidate who has consistently opposed additional offshore oil drilling.

And he also talked about the 2009 Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor.

""I will be the only candidate, ladies and gentlemen, that stood in there with Justice Sotomayor,"" said Meek, surrounded by his family and supporters. ""When she was up for her nomination, I stood up and said she was the right selection and she will make an excellent Supreme Court justice.""

This fact check is pretty straightforward: Does the record support Meek's claim?

President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court on May 26, 2009. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Aug. 6, 2009. Here's what the three major candidates said about Sotomayor that summer.

Kendrick Meek -- Meek joined Puerto Rican leaders in Miami on June 1 to support Sotomayor's nomination to the country's highest court. On June 2, he attended a similar event in Orlando. ""She is an outstanding candidate for the Supreme Court,"" Meek said in Orlando. There is no record of him wavering from that position.

Marco Rubio -- Rubio, meanwhile, is on record opposing the Sotomayor nomination. He wrote an Aug. 5 column published by Politico titled ""Opposing the philosophy of Sonia Sotomayor isn't anti-Hispanic."" Rubio wrote: ""During the recent Judiciary Committee hearings, it became clear that I could not in good conscience support Sotomayor's confirmation and would vote against it if I were in the Senate today ... As a whole, Sotomayor's record reflects a view that judges can and should inject personal experiences and biases into what should be the objective interpretation and application of the law.""

Charlie Crist -- On July 21, Crist also came out against Sotomayor's confirmation. At that point, Crist was still a Republican. ""While I have not had the opportunity to meet personally with Judge Sotomayor -- a crucial step in the selection process -- I have reviewed and reflected upon her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and come to the conclusion that I cannot support her appointment to the United States Supreme Court,"" Crist said. ""Judge Sotomayor is worthy of respect for her many accomplishments and her remarkable story of success. However, I have strong concerns that Judge Sotomayor would not strictly and objectively construe the constitution and lacks respect for the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. For these reasons, I cannot support her appointment to the highest court in the land.""

In a May 2010 interview with the Miami Herald, no-party candidate Crist continued to say that he would have opposed Sotomayor over questions about the Second Amendment, though he could not recall specifically what those questions were.

The fall ballot will include more names than just Meek, Rubio and Crist. But we couldn't find statements on Sotomayor from any of the minor or no-party candidates. None of those candidates has received more than 5 percent in any recent statewide poll.

In his primary victory speech, Meek said that he is the only candidate who publicly supported Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Compared to Crist and Rubio, the two other major candidates, Meek is right.

Rep. Alan Grayson says U.S. is 50th in the world in life expectancy
","
Instead of talking about whether President Barack Obama is a Muslim, lawmakers -- especially Republicans -- should do more to address challenges like unemployment and lagging performance in United States schools, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, told Cenk Uygur, guest host for the MSNBC's The Ed Show, on Aug. 18, 2010.

""It‘s sad. Look, we really are cheating ourselves. This can be a heaven on Earth. This could be an outstanding place to live, the very top in the entire world. Instead, we‘re 50th in the world -- 50th in life expectancy, just below Albania. We are dead last in math test scores. And believe me, the math is the same in Seoul, Korea, as it is in here. It‘s the same math,"" Grayson said.

Is the U.S. really that low on the life expectancy scale? We decided to find out. 

Todd Jurkowski, Grayson's press secretary, directed us to the 2009 life expectancy estimates in the CIA World Factbook. The United States is, indeed, No. 50.

But the CIA has since updated those estimates. In 2010, Macau had the highest life expectancy at birth -- 84.36 years. The United States comes in at No. 49, with an average life expectancy of 78.11 years. Still, that's only slightly off from the figure that Grayson cited.

But we quickly found that other sources paint a different picture. 

The World Health Organization maintains its own life expectancy data. In 2008, the latest year for which the numbers are available, people in the U.S. had an average life expectancy of 78 years. That put us in a tie with the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Costa Rica, and Chile. The figures are all rounded to the nearest whole number, which means that numerous countries were tied. There are 30 countries that had higher life expectancy than the United States. 

Then there is the U.S. Census Bureau Statistical Abstract. In 2010, the United States came in at No. 50 with an average life expectancy of 78.2 years. Macau, a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC), came in first, with 84.4 years.

The United Nations Statistical Division provides a gender breakdown of life expectancy at birth. For men, Iceland came at the top, with 81 years. The United States was No. 18 (78 years). Again, due to whole-number rounding, the U.S. tied with the Netherlands, Malta, Austria, Ireland, Cyprus, the United Kingdom, Germany, Luxembourg, Greece and Belgium. For women, Japan dominates -- the average life expectancy is 87 years. The U.S. came in 34th (82 years). 

Finally, 2010 data from the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit research institute in Washington D.C., put the United States at No. 41. We're tied with Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), French Guiana, Cuba, and Kuwait.

And that brings us to an important caveat with virtually all of the rankings. While it is technically true that the United States ranked 49th in the latest CIA World Factbook, consider some of the countries that had a higher ranking. Macau, for example ranked first, but it's less than one-sixth the size of Washington, D.C. San Marino, a state nestled inside Italy, came in at No. 11, but it has a population of only slightly more than 30,000 people. You get the picture -- some of the ""countries"" that ranked higher than the United States are, well, countries in name only. 
To a get a better picture of where we stand, we wanted to see how the United States compares with its peers (that is, generally large, industrialized democracies). We consulted statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The latest year for which data are available for all 31 countries is 2007. Japan ranked first, with average life expectancy of 82.6 years. The United States came in at No. 25, with 77.9 years. So among large industrialized democracies, the U.S. is on the lower end of the spectrum. 
Grayson claimed that the United States ranks 50th in the world for life expectancy. We found a few sources that show that we're actually a bit higher. The Population Reference Bureau put us at No. 41, while data from the World Health Organization indicate that we may be in the low 30's. Still, we think that Grayson's underlying point that the U.S. isn't as high in life expectancy as one would think is valid, so we rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB03200>],/factchecks/2010/aug/25/alan-grayson/rep-alan-grayson-says-us-50th-life-expectancy/

Reid bashes Republicans for a position on immigration that he once pushed
","
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been critical of Republican efforts to revisit the question of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants, but that seems to have backfired, with rivals saying he once supported the idea himself. The claim has popped up everywhere from the website of the Nevada Republican Party to the Washington Times to a twitter feed from Reid's GOP opponent, Sharon Angle, so we decided to look into it.

Has Reid switched his position on ""clarifying"" the 14th amendment?

To check, we looked back to August 4, 1993. That's when Reid introduced the Immigration Stabilization Act of 1993, a bill that would have, among other things, revoked birthright citizenship. Section 1001, entitled ""Basis of Citizenship Clarified,"" said, in effect, that children born in United States to parents who are illegal immigrants would not become U.S. citizens. 
And just in case there was any confusion about the matter, a press release that Reid's office issued a day later states that the bill ""clarifies that a person born in the United States to an alien mother who is not a lawful resident is not a U.S. citizen."" This clarification would have eliminated the ""incentive for pregnant alien women to enter the United States illegally, often at risk to mother and child, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child and accompanying federal financial benefits,"" said Reid.

Reid encouraged other lawmakers to consider and vote for the bill in a Senate floor speech on September 20, 1993. ""While other legislation has been introduced in this session of Congress to address some of the most egregious abuses of our immigration laws, this legislation is the only one that institutes comprehensive reform to the entire process"" Reid said. He reiterated his arguments for increased immigration controls in an August 10, 1994, op-ed piece published in the Los Angeles Times. Comparing the United States to a table that is ""becoming overcrowded,"" Reid wrote that ""unless changes are made, our dinner table eventually will collapse, and no one will have security and opportunity."" The bill ultimately died in committee.

But as they say, past is the past. What is Reid's position today?

Reid was asked about the issue in a press conference on August 3, 2010. He did not answer the question directly but quoted extensively from Michael Gerson, a Washington Post columnist. Gerson wrote a column on July 30, 2010, in which he said that Sen. Lindsey Graham -- a South Carolina Republican who is considering a constitutional amendment to change the birthright citizenship process -- has ""either taken leave of his senses or of his principles.""

So, in 1993, Reid was clearly for restricting birthright citizenship. He introduced a bill that would have ""clarified"" the 14th amendment to mean that children of illegal immigrants do not automatically become U.S. citizens at birth. Twenty years later, he seems to be agreeing with Gerson that Republicans have either lost their senses or abandoned their principles.

However, Reid has openly acknowledged his changed position on at least two occasions. In a House floor speech on August 5, 2006, he admitted that the ""low point"" of his legislative career came when he introduced the ""travesty that [he] called legislation"" in 1993. The Las Vegas Review-Journal also reported on December 13, 1999, that Reid said that the legislation is ""way up high"" on his ""list of mistakes"" and that it was ""short-sighted."" He added, ""I didn't understand the issue. I'm embarrassed that I made such a proposal.""

To sum up. Nobody -- not even Reid himself -- is denying that Reid switched his position on ""clarifying"" the 14th amendment. He wrote a bill in 1993 that would have denied birthright citizenship to children of illegal aliens. Six years later, he called that bill a mistake. Granted, he apparently regrets introducing the bill, but we wanted to know whether Reid has changed his position. We found that he did, so we rate this a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA605C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/25/harry-reid/reid-bashes-republicans-position-immigration-he-on/

Georgia gubernatorial hopeful Roy Barnes said it's possible to run a ""civil and polite"" campaign
","
Former and would-be governor Roy Barnes declared recently that it's possible to do what few politicians dare try: run a ""civil and polite"" campaign.

At the end of a Republican runoff rife with name-calling and false accusations, Barnes, a Democrat, gave morning anchors at Channel 2 Action News a homily on political civility

""I think that you can show differences without being mean,"" Barnes said Aug. 11. ""You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. There are differences, but they’re honorable people. And so just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names.

""But we do have a responsibility to show the differences, and I think they do, too. As long as it’s done in a respectful way and one that’s not personal, I think that we can do that.""

Barnes has worked to live by his words, his campaign spokesman Emil Runge said.

So Barnes thinks it's possible to run a respectful campaign. Has he run one?

AJC PolitiFact Georgia pulled out its Flip-O-Meter, which we keep on our desk next to our Truth-O-Meter. Politicians commonly shift their positions over time, sometimes for good reasons. The Flip-O-Meter determines whether such a shift has taken place.  

In an earlier item, PolitiFact Georgia ruled a claim by Barnes that he ran an all-positive TV ad campaign during the Democratic primary as Mostly True. His eight commercials generally took on a positive tone. They did not single out or criticize specific primary opponents, although he did take jabs at the state Legislature. 

At the time, Barnes didn't have to go negative. He polled way ahead of his challengers, and it was to his advantage to keep his party unified while Republicans squabbled.

Times have changed. Recent polls put Barnes either behind Republican nominee Nathan Deal or in a dead heat. And when candidates are behind, they tend to run negative commercials, political experts told AJC PolitiFact Georgia.

Those experts agree with Barnes that it's important for a candidate to demonstrate how he differs from the competition. That's the whole point of campaigning. And if one candidate has serious, legitimate problems, his opposition should mention it.

So what's negative campaigning? And how do you avoid it?

It's hard to say, said Richard Lau, a political science professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has studied political messages for decades.

""Negative"" is often in the eye of the beholder, Lau said. The candidate making the unflattering accusations thinks he's telling the truth. His rival thinks he's the victim of a negative attack.

Deal does. Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson said Barnes has run a ""100 percent"" negative television ad campaign since Deal clinched his party's nomination this month.

Barnes' camp, however, thinks Georgians deserve to know about the issues the ads raise, Runge said.

Further complicating things is that much of political rhetoric, even the milder stuff, is way out of line in everyday life. You'd think twice about telling a fellow parishioner at a church picnic that he has ethical problems. 

""You wouldn't say this face to face to a friend or acquaintance,"" said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia.

So AJC PolitiFact Georgia's yardstick is the etiquette of political discussion, not a church picnic. And we acknowledge there is a spectrum of ads that can be perceived as ""negative"" that includes outrageous, vicious lies on one end and legitimate comparisons at the other.

Barnes' campaign has released three new TV commercials since the day of the runoff. In this item, we'll see whether he stays on the right side of the line.

""The Newspaper Says"" 

Barnes' first post-primary ad, ""The Newspaper Says,"" came out Aug. 10, the day of the Republican gubernatorial runoff. 

""This great state is falling behind,"" an announcer begins. A finger clicks through what appear to be newspaper articles on a touch-screen tablet computer about mortgage foreclosures, an ethics investigation and job losses. The headlines come from actual articles.

""Do we continue down the same path, with the same team that gave us ethics violations, teacher furloughs, tax breaks to special interests, homes foreclosed and misplaced priorities? Or do we work our way back?"" the announcer asks. 

The ad is critical of ""the same team"" and ""more of the same,"" but the announcer doesn't portray any individual or government body in a negative light. All the issues it raises are real and stated accurately.

""Newspapers Deal""

Barnes' second ad, released Aug. 13, is much like the first one. The finger's there. So's the touch-screen. It opens with the same words: ""This great state is falling behind.""

But this one calls out Deal by name, accusing him of being ""distracted"" with ""ethical charges"" as the state suffers.

The ad closes with ""Nathan Deal: just more of the same.""

Deal's name appears on a rusty real estate-type 'For Sale' sign, which breaks and tumbles to the ground.

This ad raises ethics accusations against Deal that are well established by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other news organizations. The headlines it uses come from actual articles. The description of the complaints is mindful of the fact that while a congressional ethics investigation found that Deal possibly violated U.S. House rules, he resigned from Congress in March before any formal accusation was made.

The ad's finale strays from an everyday definition of ""polite,"" but overall, the ad is well-sourced and carefully worded. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel called Deal far worse in the Republican runoff.

""Hiding""

Barnes' ""Hiding,"" released Aug. 18, is his most aggressive so far. It gives Deal a loopy sound effect: a slide whistle.

""Roy Barnes released 25 years of tax returns. Online,"" it says. ""Nathan Deal refuses to disclose his income taxes.""
 
A cutout of Deal's head appears. His eyes and nose peer over the words: ""What is he hiding this time?"" 

That slide whistle blows, and the rusty real estate sign breaks apart once more. Then comes the unflattering slogan from the last commercial: ""Nathan Deal. Just more of the same.""

Deal declined to release his tax returns but may in the future. 

The ad also appears on a website PolitiFact Georgia found Friday, www.whatisdealhiding.com. It asks, ""Did his backroom deals as a Congressman break the law as has been charged? We have a right to know."" And it offers readers the chance to sign a petition.

There are a couple of problems with this. ""What is he hiding?"" is insinuation. And the site treats accusations of ""backroom deals"" as fact.

So is Barnes running a ""polite"" and ""civil"" campaign?

All of Barnes' ads, even his most aggressive one, ""Hiding,"" raise legitimate issues such as ethics accusations against Deal. For the most part, they portray those issues accurately.

But as time has passed, the imagery and language show Barnes' campaign has changed in tone. Consider the slide whistle and the cutout of Deal's head and the ""backroom deals"" accusation. 

Our experts agreed that ""The Newspaper Says"" isn't negative. ""Newspapers Deal"" might be considered negative by Deal's camp, but it stuck to legitimate issues.

""Hiding,"" however, is different. 

""That is verging on what I think most people would be calling a negative ad,"" Lau said.

Barnes' ads are not nearly as nasty as those in the Republican gubernatorial runoff, but with each new TV commercial he has moved further from ""civil and polite"" territory. 

We give Barnes a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB10340>],/factchecks/2010/aug/25/roy-barnes/georgia-gubernatorial-hopeful-roy-barnes-says-its-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Corporations', 'Economy', 'Keith Stokes']","
In wake of Curt Schilling deal, Stokes says video gaming is a consistent growth industry
","
Many questions have been raised about the wisdom of the state Economic Development Commission's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios, former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's video game company. In an interview aired Aug. 7 on WJAR-TV, EDC Executive Director Keith Stokes was asked whether the loan guarantee is a good investment for the state.

""In the case of 38 Studios, we looked at this company very carefully,"" Stokes said. ""One of the challenges we've had is that this industry, video gaming, is a fairly new industry but it's a very fast growth trajectory industry. We hired a series of national analysts to come in to look at -- not only 38 Studios as a company and their particular business model and their particular product that they were offering to the marketplace -- but we also looked at the industry in total. One of the things we found very clearly and consistently is that it is a growth industry.""

With most people hurting in the recession, we wondered whether the growth was clear and consistent.

Melissa Chambers, senior communications manager for the EDC, sent us a PowerPoint presentation made by Wells Fargo Securities, dated June 14, 2010, showing the growth in the interactive game software industry.

It said that worldwide software sales increased from $25.4 billion in 2006 to $46.6 billion in 2008, and predicted a whopping 28-percent jump in 2009. In North America alone, 2009 sales would go up by 23 percent, to $24.4 billion.

But then we found some other sales numbers -- including actual numbers for 2009 -- that made us wonder about Stokes' statement.

Less than a week after Stokes' TV interview, the Entertainment Software Association, an industry group for developers of video and computer games for consoles, personal computers and the Internet, released a sales report showing that the amount spent on games in the United States dropped by about $1.2 billion in 2009, going from $11.7 billion to $10.5 billion. That's a decline of 10.3 percent.

Then we found a previous Software Association report on U.S. sales showing a dip in 2005, when consumer spending on games dropped by about $400 million, to $7 billion. The dip wasn't reflected in the Wells Fargo report, which begins with 2006.

Because the United States makes up the bulk of the North American market, we wanted to find out why Wells Fargo's 2009 positive sales projections seemed so far from the actual sales numbers reported by the ESA. 

We asked the EDC for all  the reports it has received that might be relevant to the issue, hoping to find out whether the U.S. numbers reflected a worldwide trend. The corporation sent us another PowerPoint presentation, this one from Strategy Analytics, based in Newton, Mass. It didn't contain any numbers that seemed relevant, so we contacted the firm directly.

Jia Wu, a digital media analyst for Strategy, confirmed that U.S. and North American sales for video and online games declined by more than 2 percent in 2009. Worldwide sales, he said, rose by just two thirds of 1 percent, going from $46.2 billion to $46.5 billion. That's a far cry from the 28 percent worldwide jump Wells Fargo predicted for 2009.

Then we heard from Lewis Ward, research manager of gaming at International Data Corporation, which also tracks worldwide software game sales, who said that his figures showed a 5-percent decline in in 2009.

We also found two reports from February -- four months before Wells Fargo presented its rosy 2009 projections to the EDC -- showing that 2009 was a rough year for the industry. One was from three video game sales tracking companies reporting that overall software sales in the United States, United Kingdom and Japanese markets dropped by 8 percent. The other was a Feb. 19, 2010, press release from Strategy Analytics stating that ""2009 was a tough year for video game publishers."" In addition, the Strategy Analytics PowerPoint the EDC gave us notes, under the category of ""Mitigating risk factors,"" that ""Game industry does have cycles.""

While the numbers differ from analyst to analyst, the overall theme is contrary to the assertion Stokes made on Channel 10.

We asked the EDC to put us in touch with its Wells Fargo representative. They said they weren't able to provide an analyst to speak with us and, instead, sent us to Fred Hashway, the EDC's director of government affairs and policy.

He said it really doesn't matter if sales declined in 2009 because ""the individual year is irrelevant"" to what EDC considers to be more important -- the long-term trend. Wells Fargo's ""forecasting ability is still excellent. You don't look at it at one year. You look at it over a period of time."" Wells Fargo is predicting good things for the industry, he said.

Hashway also said any 2005 U.S. sales dip is ""a distinction without a difference"" for the same reason -- broader trends are more important. ""I think we went back as far as we needed to.""

By all accounts, the video gaming industry has grown substantially since the 1990s, topping more than $46 billion worldwide. But the sharp drop in U.S. sales in 2005 and 2009, combined with last year's minimal increase in global sales -- or decline, depending on who's giving you the numbers -- show that, at least for those years, the growth in the industry has not been consistent. Strategy Analytics, in its report to the EDC projecting double-digit growth over the next five years for the type of game 38 Studios plans to develop, noted as much.

Stokes could have said that the overall trend in the video gaming business has been strongly upward despite a downturn or two. But he didn't. He said growth in the industry was clear and consistent. So we rate his comment as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB37800>],/factchecks/2010/aug/25/keith-stokes/wake-curt-schilling-deal-stokes-says-video-gaming-/

Minority Leader John Boehner relies on temporary census workers to bolster claim on federal hiring
","
Rep. John Boehner, as House minority leader, is not bashful when it comes to criticizing the Obama administration and arguing that his Republican party offers a better way. Boehner seized that opportunity again during an appearance at the City Club of Cleveland.

His targets were familiar ones: health care reform, the stimulus program, slow economic recovery and federal government running amok.

""Since February 2009, the private sector has lost millions of jobs while the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers,"" the Ohio Republican said.

Boehner's statement is a popular claim among Republicans when criticizing the White House and Democratic leadership in Congress. PolitiFact has checked out variations of the statement three times, including once involving Boehner. In each case we've arrived at similar conclusions, that while there's some truth to some of the statement, it glosses over important information.

Careful readers will notice that previous PolitiFact stories cited somewhat different numbers than what follows below. That's because previous claims were made - and adjudicated by PolitiFact - based on the most up-to-date data for government, private-sector and census-specific hiring. But those numbers change each month, and PolitiFact uses current numbers unless a claim is based on a specific month's data. For example, a recent analysis of a hiring claim made by Rep. Steve LaTourette used May data because LaTourette based his claim on May numbers, which were fairly current at the time. Here we use new preliminary numbers available from July.

First let's look at Boehner's contention that the private sector has lost millions of jobs. 
When we looked into the job figures previously, Boehner's office referred us to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, and said that they started the count from January 2009. By starting with that month's figure, all jobs lost in February 2009 and after would be included.

In January 2009, there were 110,961,000 private-sector jobs in this country, according to the BLS database of employment statistics. By the end of July 2010, BLS says, there were 107,737,000 private sector jobs. The July figure is a preliminary number that could be adjusted upward or downward as more data becomes available. But as it is now, that's a drop of 3.224 million jobs -- or as Boehner told the City Club, ""millions of jobs.""

The biggest job hemorrhages came in February and March of 2009, when 707,000 and 744,000 jobs disappeared. Job losses slowed down into last summer and fall. During the first five months of 2010, though, there were actually job gains.

But what about the other part of Boehner's claim; that ""the federal government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers""?

BLS data shows that there were 2,803,000 federal employees in January 2009. By the end of July this year, there were 3,017,000 federal workers, according to preliminary BLS figures. That's a gain of 214,000 federal jobs, or as Boehner put it, ""hundreds of thousands of workers.""

But here’s the problem. Most of the growth of the federal workforce came entirely from the temporary buildup of census workers.

For example, the government brought on 411,000 temporary U.S. Census Bureau workers in May 2010. But one month later, 225,000 temporary census workers completed their work and were let go. Another 143,000 finished their jobs in July.

What all this means is that from January 2009 through this July, there was a net increase of 191,000 new federal jobs. Exclude those workers hired for the census and total federal hiring comes to only 23,000.

We think that's an important caveat to consider.

The House minority leader is right on the money when he says millions of private sector jobs were lost. But his reliance on the temporary hiring of census workers to support the notion that the government has grown by hundreds of thousands of workers shortchanges accuracy.

That's why we rate this statement, just as we have previous similar claims, as Half True.

Pat Toomey hits Joe Sestak on estate tax, but leaves out some details
","
In his Senate race against Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey is using a favorite GOP issue: taxes. In an ad, Toomey charges that ""Joe Sestak ... even wants to bring back the death tax, letting the IRS take half of your savings when you die.""

Before we look at the substance of the ad, let's first take a closer look at what Toomey calls the ""death tax"" and what others call the ""estate tax.""

According to the IRS, the decades-old estate tax was levied until recently on ""your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death,"" including such items as cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, annuities and business interests. Various factors reduce the gross amount subject to the tax, such as mortgages and other debts, amounts passed to surviving spouses and a credit that shields upwards of $1 million per person, and double that for a couple.

Unless Congress and the president act to eliminate it permanently, the estate tax won't exist at all for exactly one year -- 2010. This oddity came about as a result of the passage of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which was one of the tax cuts proposed and signed by President George W. Bush. The 2001 law slowly ratcheted down the estate tax's rates and ratcheted up the amount excluded from the tax, concluding with a total elimination of the tax for 2010. At the end of 2010, the estate tax would return to its levels in the early part of the decade -- a $1 million exclusion and a 55 percent top rate -- though many expect that Congress would either act before then to set new levels or eliminate the tax entirely.

We see two questions to ask in evaluating in Toomey's ad. The first is whether Sestak ""wants to bring back the death tax."" The second is whether it's accurate to say that the tax ""(lets) the IRS take half of your savings when you die.""

On the first question, both Toomey and Sestak have points to make.

Toomey's camp points to votes Sestak took in Congress that supported continuation of the estate tax. In one of them, on Dec. 3, 2009, Sestak voted with 225 other Democrats (and no Republicans) to pass the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families, Farmers, and Small Businesses Act of 2009. This legislation -- which passed the House but stalled in the Senate -- would have established the top estate tax rate at 45 percent and set the exclusion rate at $3,500,000 per person or $7 million per couple. (This happens to be the Obama administration's proposal as well.) Immediately prior to that vote, Sestak voted against a GOP-backed ""motion to recommit"" that would have asked lawmakers to go back to the drawing board and permanently eliminate the tax.

When we spoke to Sestak's camp, they confirmed that their candidate continues to support the position he voted for in the 2009 bill. However, they took issue with Toomey's characterization of his position as one that would ""bring back"" the tax. A Sestak spokesman noted that it was actually the 2001 bill -- which Toomey himself voted for -- that is the reason why the estate tax is set to pop back to life in 2011 (and at a higher tax rate and lower exclusion level than what Sestak supports).

We accept the Sestak camp's point, but we believe it's ultimately a bit of semantics. Toomey's main point is that, one way or another, Sestak, unlike Toomey, wants there to be an estate tax of some sort after the tax's disappearance in 2010, and the Sestak camp confirms that he stands by the estate tax parameters he voted for in 2009.

Now to the second question -- the ad's claim that the tax ""(lets) the IRS take half of your savings when you die.""

On the surface, what the ad says is close to true -- that is, unless Congress and the president agree to new terms before Dec. 31 of this year, the new top estate tax rate in 2010 would be 55 percent, which is slightly over the ""half"" indicated by the ad.

However, the ad glosses over three pieces of context that are important.

The first is that the ad says a reinstated tax would ""(let) the IRS take half of your savings when you die,"" giving the impression that many of those watching would be subject to it. Yet the reality is that in any given year, very few families would pay the tax, and all of them would be quite wealthy.

According to calculations by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, the 2009 proposal Sestak voted for would levy the tax on 6,400 estates nationwide in 2011 -- about three-tenths of one percent of all those who die that year. (By comparison, the estate tax that would apply in 2011 without any congressional action would levy the tax on 44,200 estates -- still only 2 percent of deaths that year, but about seven times higher that what Sestak voted for.)

The second problem is that even those families that do pay the tax would not pay it on half their savings, as the ad states. Because of the exclusions, the ""effective"" tax rate -- that is, the tax levied divided by the total amount of assets considered under the tax -- averages around 20 percent, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The last problem is that Sestak supports setting the estate tax rate at 45 percent. Even ignoring the much lower ""effective"" tax rate due to the $3.5 million-per-person exclusion, that top tax rate falls short of the ""half"" that Toomey's ad indicates.

Advocates of eliminating the estate tax defended the ad's distillation of a complicated subject.

""In politics, as opposed to policy writing, you have a very brief time to get across any message, so I don't think it is realistic for candidates to include all the caveats,"" said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""So I would view Toomey's ad as kosher, much as I would feel it would be acceptable if Sestak were to run an ad about Toomey wanting to 'put people's retirement incomes at the mercy of Wall Street.' It's Sestak's job to criticize Toomey's ad, just as it's Toomey's responsibility to to go after Sestak when his positions get caricatured.""

To recap, while there is some truth to Toomey's claim because Sestak supports reviving the estate tax, Toomey exaggerates the scope of the tax, incorrectly implying that it would apply to far more taxpayers, and that it applies to their entire estates. In fact, only the wealthiest Americans would pay the tax under the proposal that Sestak supports, and the proposal would exclude $3.5 million per person and $7 million per couple. On balance, then, we rate the ad Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD72500>],/factchecks/2010/aug/24/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-hits-joe-sestak-estate-tax-leaves-out-s/

John Cornyn says stimulus money will fund iPods for Utah students, BlackBerrys for smokers who quit and an exotic ant study
","
Sen. John Cornyn, the junior Republican from Texas, isn't running for re-election this year, but he's sounding a similar tenet as his colleagues squaring off with Democrats: spending bad. 
In an Aug. 3 press release, Cornyn touted the latest in a series of three stimulus reports by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., crowning 100 projects funded with stimulus money as examples of wasteful spending. 
""As summer barbecues pop up in backyards across the country, another kind of pork is making its way to a gratuitous study or project near you,"" Cornyn said. ""This new report reveals 100 stimulus-funded pet projects that have failed to create jobs for Americans. Instead, we discover taxpayer money will provide iPod Touch devices to high school students in Utah, Blackberry smart phones to smokers who kick the habit, and funding for a study of exotic ants in East Africa. 
We wondered about the three projects that Cornyn singles out — but first, a few words about job creation. 
There are a couple ways to assess the impact of the stimulus bill on employment: counting jobs created directly by the stimulus and counting those created in the broader economy since the stimulus took effect in February 2009. In February 2010, PolitiFact.com rated False a claim by Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who said the stimulus ""didn't create one job."" 
According to Recovery.gov — the Obama administration's website that tracks the stimulus effort — the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created or saved 634,042 jobs between Feb. 17, 2009, and Sept. 30, 2009, and it funded 595,263 jobs between Oct. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2009. More recently, the stimulus funded 749,142 jobs between April 1 and June 30. The data come from reports filed by the primary recipient of stimulus funds such as state and local governments and private-sector companies. 
These numbers meld different part-time jobs into ""full-time equivalent"" jobs, and some of the time periods use different criteria for job counting, due to a change dictated by the Office of Management and Budget in December 2009. So those statistics may overstate the actual number of jobs created. 
Another take comes from economists who have compared current employment statistics with an estimate of what those employment numbers would have been without the stimulus. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for example, has estimated between 800,000 and 2.4 million jobs have been saved and created.  
But we digress. Back to the 'pods, berrys and ants. 
iPod Touch devices to high school students in Utah 
Through a $1 million federal stimulus Enhancing Education through Technology grant, about 1,600 students at Kearns High School in Utah will receive iPod Touches this school year, in the vein of giving them a laptop without the expense of a computer lab, according to a July 6 article by The Associated Press. 
The students will download applications to use during lessons, use the iPods to take notes, research online and read their English textbooks. And — according to a July 1 Salt Lake Tribune article — students who graduate will get to keep the device. 
BlackBerrys for smokers who quit 
In September 2009, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded about $500,000 to the American Legacy Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that develops programs to address the health effects of tobacco use. Laura Cruzada, a spokeswoman for the foundation, told us it will study 700 low-income smokers who contact the Washington, D.C., Quitline program, 400 of whom will receive smartphones. The phones will enable smokers to access literature online, track their progress in quitting and determine what coping techniques work. 
While the foundation will use about a third of the stimulus money to purchase the phone plans, Sprint donated the BlackBerry phones. The foundation expects to publish the program's results by fall 2011. Once the study ends, the foundation will stop paying for the plans but participants can continue paying for the phone service themselves. 
""We're trying to create a free sustainable system that any DC resident can use, so one day someone can download this onto their phone for free,"" she said. ""But we start with a sample and test it out."" 
To the senators' point, the project has resulted in one new full-time job. 
Exotic ant study 
Using stimulus money, the National Science Foundation awarded the California Academy of Science about $1.9 million to collect and study ants from Southwest Indian Ocean islands with the goal of discovering evolutionary relationships and capturing ""detailed digital images of over 3,000 species of African ants, the vast majority of ant species known from the continent,"" the foundation said. 
On recovery.gov, the award is divided among universities. For example, about $276,490 is allotted to the University of California, Davis, where 0.06 of one job was created. Other benefits of the project, according to the science foundation: ""A large pool of ant taxonomists will be fostered through student training and support, graduate student recruitment, mentorship, and ant taxonomy workshops."" 
Where does that leave us? 
On two of the three projects, Cornyn got it mostly right. Through stimulus grants, taxonomists will study ants on islands in the Southwest Indian Ocean and in East Africa, and some 1,600 high school students in Utah will each receive an iPod Touch. What Cornyn didn't mention is that the iPods — better known for playing music and surfing the Internet — are for helping students with school work. 
Cornyn was less accurate when he said that taxpayer money will provide BlackBerrys to smokers who kick the habit. First, the phones are part of a study — they're not a reward for quitting smoking, as Cornyn suggests. Plus, the phones are free, thanks to Sprint, which is trying to gin up business. It's true, however, that stimulus money will fund the initial purchase of service plans for the phones. 
We rate Cornyn's statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA37400>],/factchecks/2010/aug/24/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-stimulus-money-will-fund-ipods-ut/

Barnes part of the team to blame for failed policies, Deal spokesman says
","
So who's responsible for the economic mess ensnaring Georgia and the rest of the nation?

Democratic Party gubernatorial nominee Roy Barnes pointed his finger at his GOP challenger, Nathan Deal, and fellow Republicans during the Democrats' state convention on Aug. 14 in Athens. The Republicans have cut education funding and raised property taxes during their eight years in control of the Governor's Mansion, Barnes charged.

""Nathan Deal is part of the team that brought Georgia to where we are now,"" said Barnes, a former governor.

Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, wasn't going to let that slide. 

""Roy Barnes is part of the team that has run up trillions of dollars in debt that Americans will spend years paying off, and they've done it without creating one job,"" Robinson told the Athens Banner-Herald.

Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia he based his statement on the results of the stimulus package passed by the Democrat-led Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2009.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look at Robinson's claim, since it was more specific than what Barnes said.

Republicans have portrayed Barnes as a supporter of Obama and some of the policies supported by Democrats in Washington, figuring they won't play well with voters in conservative Georgia. In fact, in 2008 Barnes donated $2,300 to ""Obama for America"" and $2,500 to the ""Obama Victory Fund,"" records show. More recently, Barnes avoided the president when he came to Atlanta this month. Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter said he wasn't invited to two events Obama held on his visit. A Democratic National Committee spokeswoman said Barnes was invited to an Obama fundraiser. PolitiFact Georgia gave Carpenter a ""Pants on Fire"" rating for claiming Barnes wasn't invited to any of the events.

Robinson cited Barnes' campaign contributions to Obama's presidential bid as part of his rationale for connecting the two Democrats.

""If Nathan is a part of [the team of Republicans], then Roy is part of the Democratic team that passed the stimulus bill, bailed out [General Motors] and passed ObamaCare,"" Robinson said. 

""Barnes didn't vote for [those policies], he couldn't. He wasn't a member of Congress,"" Bullock said. ""The only thing you can say [about Barnes and Obama] is there is a D on their jersey.""

So, what about Robinson's claim about the debt? The federal debt held by the public was nearly $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008, which encompassed most of George W. Bush's last year as president, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2009, OMB data shows the debt rose to $7.5 trillion. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30 of the next calendar year. Fiscal year 2010 ends Sept. 30, 2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the debt held by the public will rise to $10.5 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2011 under Obama's budget and nearly double by September 2020.

Now, let's deal with Robinson's claim about jobs.

""There are fewer jobs today than there were [when the stimulus passed],"" Robinson said. ""You can't say you created a job if 30 others were lost.""

Federal labor statistics data show the number of Georgians employed has dropped by about 200,000 people since the 2009 stimulus was adopted. Georgia's unemployment rate rose in that time from 8.7 percent to 10 percent. Nationally, the unemployment rate has risen since February 2009 from 8.1 percent to 9.5 percent.

The data suggest Robinson is right about fewer jobs being created since the stimulus. But that's not what he said. Robinson said the stimulus hasn't created ""one job.""

Federal officials credit the stimulus for creating or saving 24,103 jobs in Georgia during the last three months of 2009, the AJC reported in January.

There are some issues with the numbers. It combines some part-time jobs into ""full-time equivalent"" jobs. Raises funded through the stimulus are counted toward the job numbers, the AJC reported in January.

Federal officials initially reported jobs ""created or saved"" by the stimulus. They changed the terminology to ""recovery funded jobs reported by recipients"" in January after consulting recipients, good government groups and members of Congress. The federal government counts stimulus jobs as positions funded by the money, even if the person worked at the company beforehand.

Several private-sector economic-analysis firms say the stimulus has saved or created more than 1 million jobs.

U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., made a similar claim during a February news conference that ""the last stimulus bill didn't create one new job."" Our friends on the national PolitiFact site asked Brown about that statement. A spokesman clarified the senator's statement to say the stimulus hasn't created ""any new jobs."" PolitiFact gave Brown a ""Pants on Fire"" rating for his initial statement.

While Barnes did support Obama financially, he has not been a member of Congress and hasn't been a close adviser to the president. We agree with Bullock that it is tenuous to link Barnes to Obama's policies. As for the other aspects of the claim: Robinson is correct to say debt has risen since the stimulus, but we have trouble with the final portion of his quote to the Athens Banner-Herald. The way the federal government counts stimulus jobs has been problematic, but several independent groups say the stimulus has saved or created some jobs. It's a stretch, we believe, to say the stimulus has not created ""one job."" All in all, we rate Robinson's statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC0AE40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/24/brian-robinson/barnes-part-team-blame-failed-policies-deal-spokes/

Is the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" not even a mosque?
","
By now, most of those following the so-called ""Ground Zero Mosque"" issue know it is not on Ground Zero -- but rather is two blocks away. 
But on ABC's This Week on Aug. 22, 2010, Bloomberg's Al Hunt said it's not even a mosque. 
Hunt said the issue has been ""demagogued"" and added, ""This is not on ground zero. This is not a mosque. It's a cultural center that has a prayer area."" 
Hunt's comment echoed Frank Rich who stated in an Aug. 21, 2010, New York Times op-ed, ""It’s not a mosque but an Islamic cultural center containing a prayer room."" 
But the developing organization repeatedly refers to the religious component of the site as a mosque. 
On the website for the project (Park51.org), the plan sounds more like a Muslim YMCA-type operation. The site's ""facilities"" page details plans for a ""world-class community center"" open to all New Yorkers, regardless of faith. According to the site, plans include: a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios, childcare services and a September 11 memorial and ""quiet contemplation space, open to all."" 
The plan also includes ""a mosque, intended to be run separately from Park51 but open to and accessible to all members, visitors and our New York community."" 
Organizers say the center would be used to promote cultural diversity and would be overseen by a 23-member Board of Directors, whose membership will not be limited to Muslims. But the center would be geared toward ""engaging New York’s many and diverse Muslim communities and promoting empowerment and compassion for all."" 
Another page of the website explains that the project, called Park51, is an independent project led by American Muslims. On that same page, it states, ""The mosque, yet to be named, will be run by a separate non-profit whose Board of Directors will reflect a broad range of experience. While the mosque will be located in the planned final structure of Park51, it will be a distinct non-profit."" 
In a July 24, 2010, interview with altmuslim.com, an Islamic news site, Sharif El-Gamal, owner of the building and developer of the Park51 project, was asked, ""Why must the project necessarily include a mosque? Wouldn't a general prayer area, which could be reserved in advance by any religious group, be more appropriate and compatible with the community-centric interfaith mission of the project?"" 
Gamal answered, in part, ""With respect to the mosque, which will take up only a small portion of the final space, it’s a question of meeting a need. This mosque will be open to all. There are probably one million Muslims in the tri-state area and several hundred thousand in New York City."" 
We also turned to a website for the Cordoba Initiative, ""a multi-faith non-profit organization whose aim is to improve relations between different communities, and in particular between the Muslim world and the United States of America"" which was founded by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who along with Gamal acts as project manager of the Park51 site. 
On the ""Frequently Asked Questions"" page is one that asks, ""Why are you building a mosque at Ground zero?"" 
The response: 
""The community center is not located at Ground Zero. 
""It will be a multi-floor community center open to all New Yorkers, much like a YMCA or Jewish Community Center (JCC) with a designated prayer space (mosque) in one area to serve the needs of the large existing community of American Muslims in the neighborhood. 
""The community center will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their culture or background, will find a place of learning, arts and culture, and, most importantly, a community center guided by the universal values of all religions in their truest form – peace, compassion, generosity, and respect for all."" 
We note that the ""mosque"" in parentheses is their word, not ours. 
Imam Rauf has been leading prayer services in one of the buildings -- a former Burlington Coat Factory -- since 2009, drawing a spillover from the imam's former main place for prayers, the al-Farah mosque about a dozen blocks north of the World Trade Center grounds, according to the Washington Post. According to the Post, the site's organizers estimated that the mosque could attract as many as 2,000 worshipers on Fridays. 
So how exactly does one define a mosque according to Islamic tradition, as opposed to simply a prayer space? We explored this very issue a bit when we researched a claim from Kendrick Meek, a Democratic Senate hopeful, who said there is a mosque at the Pentagon. It turns out there is a non-denominational chapel at the Pentagon, and it is used once a day by Muslim employees who gather there for prayer services. 
While that might be considered a sacred place by those who use it, it doesn't meet the definition of a mosque, according to Shafayat Mohamed, imam of the Darul Uloom mosque in Pembroke Pines, Fla. ""The main thing that makes a mosque a mosque is the establishment of praying five times a day at that spot,"" Mohamed said. ""If people pray five times per day, then it is considered a regular mosque."" 
We agree with those who say it's imprecise to simply refer to the New York project as a mosque. As is clear from the organizers' comments and formal web pages, the big picture plans are for a $100 million, 15-story Muslim community center that would be open to New Yorkers of all faiths. But those comments and websites also make clear that the plans do include a ""mosque."" It may be a ""small portion"" of the overall project, but it is a part. And so when Hunt said, ""This is not a mosque. It's a cultural center that has a prayer area,"" that's not accurate either. It's a cultural center that includes a mosque. And so we rate Hunt's comment False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC7BD00>],/factchecks/2010/aug/23/al-hunt/ground-zero-mosque-not-even-mosque/

Health care law institutes a sales tax on home sales? No, it doesn't
","
A new chain e-mail wrongly claims that the 2010 health care law will institute a new tax on home sales.

Here's the e-mail a reader recently forwarded to us:

""Under the new health care bill -- did you know that all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax? The bulk of these new taxes don't kick in until 2013 (presumably after Obama's re-election). You can thank Nancy, Harry and Barack and your local Democrat Congressman for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Is this Hope & Change great or what? Does this stuff makes (sic) your November and 2012 votes more important?

""Oh, you weren't aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren't alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren't aware of it either (result of clandestine midnight voting for huge bills they've never read). AND, there are a few other surprises lurking.""

The root of this claim appears to be Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled ""Unearned income Medicare contribution.""  Legislative wonks might remember that this was the second part of the health care bill, passed via reconciliation so that it only required 50 votes. Democrats had to do it that way after they lost their 60-seat majority due to a special election for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. (Republican Scott Brown won the seat that Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democrat, held until his death.)

The health care law imposes a 3.8 percent tax on the investment income of couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. That investment income could include income from real estate transactions. But it would only apply to those high earners, who make up less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. We're not sure why the e-mail extrapolates this tax to all real estate transactions, but that's the only 3.8 percent tax we could find in the new law. We ran this by two tax policy experts who confirmed our analysis of the new law.

Under current law, workers pay Medicare hospital taxes on wages. Workers and employers split a 2.9 percent tax; the self-employed pay all of it.

The new tax marks the first time investment income will be subject to Medicare taxes, said Clint Stretch, the managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP. We should point out that the government currently taxes investment income in various ways and could have simply raised current rates.

But lawmakers wanted to link the new revenues to health care, Stretch said. ""The point of doing it as a Medicare tax was to have the money go to the Medicare trust fund and have it act like a tax that is paying for health care. So there is additional complexity,"" he said.

And by the way, if you're an empty-nester of any means, and you're thinking of downsizing, part of your profits are already tax-free. There are long-standing tax exemptions on the profits from home sales. In general, if you sell your own home, individuals are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit and married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit. Again, that's profit, not the sales price.

If you're wealthy and sell your home at a substantial profit, it's possible you might get hit with the new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Most Americans won't have to worry about this, though.

Not that our chain e-mail acknowledges any of those pesky facts. It says that a 3.8 percent tax applies to all real estate transactions as a sales tax. That is not the case. The e-mail seems intended to scare people, particularly older Americans, and it urges them to vote a particular way based on false information. And for that, we award this chain e-mail a Pants on Fire! 
Update: This report has been changed to reflect that there is no wage limit on Medicare hospital taxes. A wage limit of $106,800 applies to Social Security payroll taxes, but not Medicare hospital taxes.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC906840>],/factchecks/2010/aug/23/chain-email/health-care-law-sales-tax-home-sales-no/

Debbie Riddle says more than 81% of babies born at Houston hospital have moms here illegally
","
State Rep. Debbie Riddle, R-Tomball, has long expressed concerns about illegal immigration. She sounded that theme anew Aug. 10 during an appearance on CNN, telling host Anderson Cooper that mothers who are illegal residents routinely have babies in the United States to ""anchor"" their families in this country. 
""The fact is it is documented,"" Riddle said. ""Over 81 percent of the babies that are born at LBJ Hospital right here in Houston are born of women who are not here legally. It is well-known that women come over here, cross the border in order to have the babies here because once they get here and once that little American citizen is born and becomes an anchor baby — look, I'm a grandmother of 10, I love children, but the fact is this is breaking the back of the taxpayers of Texas and the United States."" 
Eighty-one percent? Documented, well-known? We decided to check Riddle's claim, remembering that PolitiFact recently rated as Half True South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's statement that people come here to have babies and then leave. 
While there's ample evidence that many illegal immigrants give birth in the U.S. every year, PolitiFact's research found that the incentive for illegal immigrants to come here is based more on economic hopes than quickie citizenship for U.S.-born babies. 
Cooper grilled Riddle after she claimed that pregnant women were entering the U.S. as tourists to give birth to their children ""with the nefarious purpose of turning them into little terrorists who will then come back to the U.S. and do us harm."" Riddle didn't offer Cooper evidence to back up the claim, and when we contacted her, Riddle told us in an e-mail that she shouldn't have talked about the ""terror babies,"" as they've come to be known. 
""I demand proof when my opponents challenge my viewpoints, and it's reasonable to expect me to do the same,"" she said. ""That doesn't mean the things I said aren't true; it just means that I shouldn't assert them as fact unless I'm prepared to show you the facts."" 
So what are the facts on the babies born at Houston's Lyndon Baines Johnson General Hospital to mothers who are not here legally? 
Jon English, Riddle's legislative chief of staff, said she based her claim on an opinion article by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, published in the April 30 Houston Chronicle. Noting that Texas bears a cost from illegal immigration, Patrick wrote: ""In recent years, 81 percent of babies born at the LBJ General Hospital were born to mothers who were here illegally."" 
Patrick's chief of staff, Logan Spence, told us that Patrick heard the 81 percent number from officials at the Harris County Hospital District, which oversees LBJ Hospital. However, six years of delivery data from the district did not confirm that statistic. Melinda Muse, a spokeswoman for the district, told us that Patrick's figure may have also included mothers who are legal immigrants as well as deliveries at Ben Taub General Hospital, the other hospital in the district that delivers babies. 
In a search of newspaper stories, we found an Aug. 8, 2010, Dallas Morning News article which reported that 82 percent of the births at LBJ and Ben Taub in 2009 were to women who were not U.S. citizens. The article relied on Texas Health and Human Services Commission information derived from an emergency Medicaid program that reimburses hospitals for delivering the babies of poor women who lack U.S. citizenship. 
But Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the commission, said that information included births to both legal and illegal immigrants. She said that the state doesn't know how many of the Medicaid mothers were undocumented. 
We also found a September 2006 Houston Chronicle story on the rising number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America coming to South Texas to give birth. The article quoted Shannon Rasp, then a spokeswoman for the hospital district, as saying that ""using anecdotal information provided us by our staff, statistics from other public hospital systems and our patient demographics, we believe that approximately 70 to 80 percent of our obstetrics patients are undocumented."" 
The best information we found to assess Riddle's statement was the district's six years of delivery data. A caveat: Delivery statistics refer to the number of women who give birth, not the number of babies born, which Riddle and Patrick were talking about. Deliveries of multiple children, like twins and triplets, mean that there are more babies than mothers in any given year. 
About 85 percent of the 8,974 deliveries at Ben Taub and LBJ in fiscal 2010 — March 1, 2009, to Feb. 28, 2010 — were to noncitizens, which include both legal and illegal immigrants. Forty percent of those were at LBJ. Of those, 2,418 were to undocumented mothers. 
That means that in fiscal 2010, 63 percent of total deliveries (3,818) at LBJ hospital were to undocumented immigrants. For fiscal 2009, that figure is 59 percent. Previous years saw higher percentages — 71 percent in 2008, 73 percent in 2007, 70 percent in 2006 and 69 percent in 2005. 
Remember, those statistics are for mothers only. When we asked the hospital district for data that links babies born at LBJ with the immigration status of their mothers, Muse said the district doesn't keep that information. ""Since all babies who are born in the hospital are American citizens, we don't link them to either documented immigrant or undocumented immigrant mothers,"" Muse said. 
That means it is unlikely that Patrick accurately cited how many babies were born to undocumented immigrants because the hospital district doesn't have those figures. And Riddle was relying on Patrick's newspaper column when she made her claim. 
In an e-mail, Patrick told us that if he was off ""by a few percentage points, the big picture is still the same. The fact that the number ranges from 58 to 72 percent over the last several years at LBJ reinforces my message that the state of Texas cannot control its economic or cultural destiny until the border is secured."" 
Close but no cigar? According to the latest statistics at LBJ hospital, the proportion of deliveries to illegal immigrant mothers was 63 percent, not 81 percent. The average over the past six years: 68 percent. If Riddle had said those deliveries constitute a clear majority, she'd be on solid ground. But that's not the claim she made on national TV. 
As PolitiFact has noted before, numbers matter — and when it comes to issues as fractious as immigration and so-called ""terror babies,"" politicians have an obligation to be scrupulously accurate. 
We rate her statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF3E3C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/23/debbie-riddle/debbie-riddle-says-more-81-babies-born-houston-hos/

Republicans accuse Georgia Democratic congressman of taking ""dirty"" money from embattled Congressman Charles Rangel
","
Republicans are raising questions about a controversial campaign contributor to a Democratic Georgia congressman.

The National Republican Congressional Committee put together a recorded telephone message that it said went to residents on Aug. 10 in Democrat Jim Marshall's congressional district in Middle Georgia. The message said U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, who is in a heap of ethics trouble, made $37,000 in campaign contributions to Marshall.

Rangel, a Democrat from New York City, is facing 13 ethics charges largely surrounding whether he used his office for personal gain. Rangel admits to belatedly reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars in income and assets. But Rangel insists he's not corrupt.

The RNCC urges Marshall in the message to give the money back.

""So far, Congressman Marshall's fellow Democrats have returned almost $640,000 in dirty campaign money from Rangel,"" the unidentified voice in the message says. ""Yet, Congressman Marshall refuses to return $37,000.""

Is a New York congressman who is under an ethics cloud helping fund the campaign of a Middle Georgia congressman running for re-election?

AJC PolitiFact Georgia contacted Marshall's office about the NRCC allegation. Our initial search of federal campaign contributions from Rangel for Congress showed the congressman sent just $9,000 to Marshall.

Marshall's spokesman Doug Moore said the GOP has included money from a political action committee Rangel is involved with called ""National Leadership PAC."" In all, Moore said Marshall has received $38,000. But that money arrived before Rangel's ethics problems, Moore said.

A leadership PAC is a fundraising device politicians to back other candidates. National Leadership PAC is Rangel's PAC. It  collects money that is then doled out to other Democrats running for office.

Moore called it a ""technicality"" to say the money from the National Leadership PAC is from Rangel. Moore argued the message is misleading because all of contributions were made by 2007, a year before the ethics allegations surfaced. Marshall has since refused to accept contributions from Rangel or the PAC, Moore said.

Marshall represents Georgia's 8th Congressional District, which includes Macon and much of Middle Georgia. It's considered a swing district that Republicans are eager to seize this fall in their attempt to win control of Congress. Marshall has won several close races in recent years. Linking him to Rangel, a liberal with ethics issues, could damage Marshall this election cycle, experts say.

""(Republicans) are trying to say this guy might be dirty like the rest of them,"" said Emory University associate political science professor Michael Leo Owens.

Marshall is trying to distance himself from such comparisons. He told PolitiFact Georgia in a statement that ""if Rangel is indeed guilty of the charges, he should have resigned a long time ago.""

Anthony Corrado, an expert in campaign finance laws, said it is common practice for members of Congress to give money from their PACs to fellow members facing tough re-election battles. The National Leadership PAC donated $899,000 to various Democratic candidates in 2008, said Corrado, a government professor at Colby College in Maine. National Leadership is probably one of the top 10 PACs in terms of donations, Corrado said.

Corrado said candidates return money to someone or an organization that becomes politically liable. However, he said that Rangel giving money to Marshall during the last election cycle does not carry the same weight as if the contributions were made after Rangel's ethics allegations went public.

""It's not the same,"" he said.

Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint agreed with Owens that the RNCC is smart to attempt to link Marshall with Rangel. However, Swint said the robocall is ""slightly misleading"" because it does not mention that contributions were made before the ethics allegations emerged.

""That's politics,"" Swint said. ""All is fair.""

So is the NRCC's message correct? The total amount of money was off by $1,000.

But a point that concerned us more is that the contributions were made before the allegations surfaced. Anyone who hears the message would not know from it when the contributions were made, which made a difference to every expert we spoke with. We believe the statement does contain some truth. But it leaves out important details and takes some things out of context. On our Truth-o-Meter scale, that rates as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8C0680>],/factchecks/2010/aug/23/national-republican-congressional-committee/marshall/

Rick Perry says Bill White refuses to debate
","
For months, Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, has been rebuking incumbent Gov. Rick Perry for refusing to debate him. So we were surprised to learn that Perry recently turned the tables. 
""Today is day 164 of liberal trial lawyer Bill White refusing to debate,"" according to an Aug. 18 press release from the Perry campaign. ""He also continues to refuse to release his taxes from his years in public service."" 
The White campaign fired back on its Twitter account devoted to lambasting the governor: ""Perry claimed today that it's Bill White who refuses to debate. What's next, Perry says editorial boards refuse to meet with him?"" 
On Aug. 12, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Perry won't meet with newspaper editorial boards, where political candidates answer questions from editorial writers and editors in an effort to win the newspaper's endorsement. White is meeting with editorial boards, including those at smaller papers like the Killeen Daily Herald. 
Is Perry's plaint that White is debate-averse justified? 
Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, told us that White ""has accepted five televised debates,"" pointing to a July 21 press release calling on the governor to join him in those debates. 
Perry has said he wouldn't debate White until the Democrat makes public his tax returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor, the two years he was deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration and from when he led the Texas Democratic Party. As of Aug. 18, 164 was the number of days the Perry campaign says have passed since it called for their release. 
""Once he releases his income taxes and tells the public how he made his money in public service and as a business person, we'll be more than happy to discuss debates,"" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said, according to an April 26 story on WFAA.com. Perry has made public his own returns going back to 1991, when he first became a statewide officeholder. 
White has since released his returns dating back to 2004, when he took office as Houston's mayor. 
Perry's campaign said it still wasn't enough. ""Questions remain concerning income Bill White received while Deputy Secretary of Energy under President Clinton and as chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, and how he has profited from those positions,"" said Miner. White served in Washington from 1993 to 1995, and he led the party from 1995 to 1998. 
If one candidate does not comply with the ground rules set by his opponent, does that mean he is declining to debate? Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, said it does: ""Bill White's refusal to release his tax returns is his refusal to debate. The issue is one and the same."" 
Still, we couldn't find any instances of White flat-out refusing to debate Perry. 
If every debate sponsor statewide required the candidates to release their tax returns and White refused, Perry's logic would be more reasonable. But this is a precondition that only Perry has set, and, as we recently reported, a term to debate he hasn't made in the past. Plus, it hasn't stopped White from debating: on July 5, White joined Kathie Glass, the Libertarian candidate for governor, at the League of Women Voters forum in Kerrville — the first governor's debate after the primary. Perry was absent.
