This photo of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump has been altered

","""Have Eric Trump’s eyes always looked like that?"" we wondered as we scrutinized a photo of President Donald Trump’s son with his arm wrapped around his brother, Donald Trump Jr.  ""Donald Trump HATES this picture of his idiot sons, so definitely do not share it!"" reads the description of the photo in a 2017 Facebook post that users are again sharing. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Reader, Eric Trump’s eyes have not always looked like that. As both Snopes and Gizmodo reported three years ago, the image was altered. The original photo taken by Getty Images photographer C. Allegri shows the Trump sons in 2005 at Donald Trump Jr.’s wedding reception at Mar-a-Lago.  In the manipulated image shared on social media, Trump Jr.’s eyes appear closer together, his upper lip is bigger and his teeth changed. Eric Trump, meanwhile, has wide set eyes and some extra weight around his chin.  We rate this post Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/may/21/viral-image/photo-donald-trump-jr-and-eric-trump-has-been-alte/

Amid pandemic, polls show support for voting by mail
","Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said that everyone should be able to vote by mail if they want to this year — and that the vast majority of the public agrees with her. Klobuchar in March proposed a bill that gives states more money to handle increased mail-in voting and to make in-person voting sites safer amid a pandemic. She said that she doesn’t want to make everyone vote by mail, but that it is a safer option. The Republican-led Senate has not voted on the bill. ""The voters are with us, the people are with us,"" she said. ""80% of the people want this option and they want to have the polls open early."" (She made that statement in a conversation with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison April 24 and tweeted a portion May 16.) We found that Klobuchar’s figure was close to one reported in a poll by a liberal group. Other national polls have found majority support for voting by mail, though not support levels as high as what Klobuchar cited. ""It is correct to conclude that a strong majority of voters support vote-by-mail options,"" said Janine Parry, University of Arkansas political science professor who was not involved in the poll. Klobuchar noted that more than a dozen states require voters to give a reason for voting by mail. In some states, any qualified voter may vote by mail, while five states conduct all elections entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. While President Donald Trump and some GOP leaders have opposed efforts to expand voting by mail, concerns about the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is expected to increase demand for absentee ballots among people who fear exposure at in-person voting sites. Klobuchar’s bill, which was written with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has no GOP co-sponsors, but some Republican governors and election officials have advocated for more voting by mail, too. RELATED: Does voting by mail lead to higher turnout in red, blue and purple states? It’s not that simple Klobuchar’s spokesman said she was referring to a poll done for the liberal Brennan Center at New York University School of Law. The online poll of 1,550 Democrats, Republicans and independents in March asked respondents, ""Do you agree or disagree that: in the 2020 election, all states should be required to allow vote by mail or unexcused absentee ballots to ensure people can vote with ease and without being in long lines or crowds?"" In response, 78% said they agreed. Support was higher among Democrats (97%) and independents (79%) than Republicans (57%). Polling experts noted that Brennan asked the question in a way that suggests positive reasons for voting by mail, which can lead to higher support among respondents. The question was worded in a way that puts voting by mail in the current context of the pandemic, said Joel Benenson of the Benenson Strategy Group, which conducted the poll for Brennan. He argued that phrasing the question in a generic way doesn’t make sense because the current conversation is about changing policies this year for the pandemic, not permanently.  The phrasing was different from the questions in a poll done for the Republican National Committee. That poll asked voters of both parties and independents for their views on ""mailing a ballot to all registered voters, including those who are inactive, meaning they have not voted in recent elections and not responded to an address verification mailing or have moved."" The results showed 53% opposed that idea.  A separate question from that same RNC poll asked ""And, if your state changed current voting procedures to enact universal vote by mail, would you be concerned about the integrity of the election results and the ability for widespread fraud?"" Sixty-two percent answered yes.  We asked the RNC why it didn’t ask a straight question about respondents’ views on voting by mail. Mandi Merritt, an RNC spokeswoman,  said that Democrats are suing states to make changes to voting by mail such as eliminating signature verification or sending ballots to inactive voters, so ""we felt it was important to gauge public opinion accordingly."" ""You can frame the question in ways that move the percentages up or down in support of mail in voting,"" said John G. Geer, co-director of the Vanderbilt poll (who wasn’t involved in these vote by mail polls). National polls done in April by nonpartisan media outlets or research groups showed between 58% and 72% favoring voting by mail overall. That’s lower than the Brennan poll but still majority support. These polls also showed that support for voting by mail was higher among Democrats than Republicans, mirroring what the Brennan Center poll found.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll found 72% of all U.S. adults supported a requirement for mail-in ballots for this year. The online poll surveyed 1,116 American adults. Pew Research’s web poll of 4,917 U.S. adults found 70% favor allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to this year. Gallup’s telephone poll asked 1,016 voters if they would ""favor or oppose your state allowing all voters to vote by mail or absentee ballot in this year's presidential election?"" Results showed that 64% favor their state allowing all voters to vote by mail or absentee ballot.  AP/NORC found that if the pandemic lasts through November, 60% favor allowing voters to cast ballots by mail without a stated reason. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal telephone poll of 900 registered voters found that 58% favored changing laws to allow everyone to vote by mail. For those who said they oppose changing laws, an additional 9% said they would support changing election laws for the November election amid the coronavirus. Overall, surveys show support for voting by mail, but polling experts offered some important caveats.  There is a difference between supporting vote by mail without an excuse and supporting efforts to automatically mail ballots — or even ballot applications — to all registered voters, said Barry Burden, University of Wisconsin political science professor, who was not involved in these polls.  He noted that while the Pew survey found 70% favor allowing vote by mail, a smaller percentage — 52% — support conducting all elections by mail. The polls could be measuring what pollsters call ""non-attitudes"" — meaning the respondents had not formed an opinion before being contacted by a pollster, said professor Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. ""It’s highly doubtful that many respondents had thought at all about voting by mail before they were interviewed, and the differences in wording of the questions shows how malleable opinions can be,"" he said. ""I’m concerned that these polls are creating public opinion rather than seeking to measure it!"" Health concerns fueled by the pandemic reinforces favorable thoughts about voting by mail, Geer said. ""Citizens, regardless of partisan stripe, favor more participation over less,"" he said. ""It is a general tendency and explains why voting by mail is popular."" RELATED: How battleground states are preparing for the pandemic election’s massive increase in voting by mail Klobuchar said ""80% of the people"" want the option of voting by mail. Klobuchar was citing a poll done by the Brennan Center in late March which found 78% of respondents agreed that all states should be required to allow voting by mail to ensure people can vote with ease and while avoiding lines and crowds.  Klobuchar has cherry-picked a poll by a liberal group that framed the question in a way that portrayed voting by mail as positive, and resulted in higher support than many other national polls. The other national polls showed support between 58% and 72% for voting by mail. We rate this statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2020/may/21/amy-klobuchar/amid-pandemic-polls-show-support-voting-mail/

Did U.S. senators vote to allow access to your internet history without a warrant? Not really.
","A viral Facebook post says Americans missed a big moment in privacy rights. Some provisions of the 2001 Patriot Act — which greatly expanded government intelligence gathering in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks — expired earlier this year amid GOP gridlock. The legislation has drawn criticism over the breadth of surveillance it enables, particularly after classified documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed phone record metadata collected on a massive scale. The U.S. House reauthorized the three lapsed intelligence programs in March 2020, and the U.S. Senate passed its own version May 14 — making changes that sent the bill back to the House. Before final passage, though, the Senate by the narrowest of margins defeated an amendment that would have limited access to internet browser and search histories. This drew the ire of one Libertarian group, whose May 14, 2020, Facebook post on the subject has been shared almost 10,000 times. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). The post from Being Libertarian named the senators who opposed the amendment — including House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson, both Republicans — and said this: ""Here's the list of senators who sold out your freedoms. They all voted for federal agencies to have access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant."" But this statement is misleading in its simplicity. Access isn't as easy or widespread as that implies — or even a new thing. The statement implies this was a vote to enable internet history access without a warrant, but the government has actually been able to do that for nearly 20 years. That was among many powers granted by the 2001 Patriot Act. Section 215 can be used to compel third parties (such as internet service providers) to produce information related to intelligence investigations (not law enforcement investigations). This has long been considered compatible with the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure, since the Supreme Court has said since the 1970s that protection does not apply to records held by third parties, according to Robert Chesney, director of the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin. He noted this interpretation is now ""under pressure,"" but still in place. Section 215 allows government investigators to obtain internet browsing history or search queries, but there are several limitations, Chesney said. For an American, this can only be used to obtain web history related to a counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation. (For a foreign person, any foreign-intelligence purpose can justify access to online history.) The request must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, made up of 11 federal judges from around the country. The court was established by Congress through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to approve electronic surveillance, physical search, and certain other forms of investigative actions for foreign intelligence purposes. The standard of proof to get such approval under Section 215 is somewhere between a subpoena and a search warrant, said Stewart Baker, a former general counsel of the National Security Agency who edited a book on the Patriot Act. ""Like a warrant, it requires the approval of a court (subpoenas often don’t),"" he said in an email. ""But unlike a warrant, the standard for granting access to records under Section 215 is ‘reasonable’ cause to believe the records are ‘relevant’ to a national security investigation."" This is short of the ""probable cause"" standard needed for the court to authorize a wiretap or physical search. The U.S. Department of Justice makes all government appearances in the surveillance court, though they use supporting documentation from the FBI and NSA, Baker said. We should also note the foreign intelligence court has come under fire after recent revelations.  A December 2019 report from the DOJ’s independent watchdog, Michael Horowitz, found ""at least 17 significant errors or omissions"" in warrant applications related to Carter Page, Donald Trump’s campaign adviser. An ensuing review in March 2020 of 29 randomly selected wiretap requests revealed the FBI could not locate supporting documentation for four, and the other 25 each contained ""apparent errors or inadequately supported facts."" In 2019, the court received 1,010 applications for investigative action, of which it granted 688, modified 264 and denied in whole or part only 58, according to its annual report. It’s not clear how often the federal government has used Section 215 to obtain browsing history, NBC News reported on May 15, 2020. They said tech companies are legally prohibited from detailing national security requests they receive. The bill before Congress reauthorizes intelligence gathering that Congress first authorized decades ago through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Senate passed its version 80-16 on May 14, 2020, after voting down two amendments — one to prevent surveillance act authority from being used against Americans and one to prevent the government from obtaining internet browsing and search history without a warrant (the one referenced in the claim). One of the sponsors of the warrant amendment, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, called Section 215 ""the most controversial and dangerous provision"" of the surveillance act. ""There is little information that is more personal than your web browsing history,"" Wyden, a Democrat who sponsored the amendment, told Vox.com for a May 13, 2020, story. ""If you know that a person is visiting the website of a mental health professional, or a substance abuse support group, or a particular political organization, or a particular dating site, you know a tremendous amount of private and personal. … This level of surveillance absolutely ought to require a warrant."" The measure gathered bipartisan support but fell one vote short of passage, 59-37. Such amendments require a 60-vote threshold. All of which brings us, finally, back to the claim that 27 Republicans and 10 Democrats in the Senate ""voted for federal agencies to have access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant."" Firstly, this implies the senators voted to actively allow this, when in fact the vote was against banning it. In other words, they voted to maintain the status quo. The reference to ""your internet history"" implies this is a widespread action allowing some kind of sweeping internet data-gathering, in the vein of the phone datamining Snowden revealed. But Section 215 allows this internet data gathering only in relation to foreign intelligence, international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities investigation. The post also implies unfettered access, when in fact government investigators must get a court to sign off on obtaining this data — even if getting approval requires a lower threshold than a warrant. Finally, the Facebook post leaves readers with the impression this is an unusual allowance. But gathering internet data without a warrant is already widely allowable under basic criminal law. ""Under criminal law, browser history can be obtained if relevant to any criminal investigation,"" Baker said. ""That’s probably the best reason not to adopt this (amendment). It makes no sense to say that no warrant or judicial review is needed to obtain such records in an investigation of securities fraud, but one is needed to investigate and try to stop an act of terrorism."" The House and Senate versions of the surveillance act include a provision specifying Section 215 doesn’t go beyond what can be used in criminal investigations, Baker noted. It says the government cannot seek an order in circumstances where ""a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes."" The page that created the viral post did not respond to requests for comment, and the libertarian group the post credited as a source declined to provide supporting evidence. A viral Facebook post names 37 senators it says voted to allow ""access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant."" There was indeed a vote against requiring warrants, but the fundamental implication in this post is that it enabled widespread and unrestricted access to Americans’ web activity. And that’s not accurate. This data can only be obtained for an American after approval from a federal court, and only if it is related to a counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigation. And this authority is nothing new — this power relative to foreign intelligence was granted almost 20 years ago under the Patriot Act. And similar data is accessible without a warrant in standard criminal investigations as well. So we’re left with an element of truth, but a claim that ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/may/21/facebook-posts/did-us-senators-vote-reveal-internet-browser-histo/

Mask box label is legitimate, but people are misinterpreting it
","Online rumors continue to claim that different face masks are ineffective in protecting against the spread of COVID-19. We recently fact-checked this false claim, yet new versions on Facebook are now pointing to a warning label that appears to be on the side of a box of disposable surgical masks. The label in the image reads: ""This product is an ear loop mask, this product is not a respirator and will not provide any protections against COVID-19 (coronavirus) and other viruses or contaminants."" The photo appears to be legitimate. But the words on the label are being misinterpreted as evidence to suggest that masks are not effective.  One person who posted the picture wrote: ""Gee....wonder how many people are gonna tell me I haven't done my research now? Black and white. Right there. Even the people making the masks know it's all bull.""   But that’s not what this photo shows. This is a misunderstanding about the kind of protection standard masks provide and a misreading of the disclaimer, which isn’t saying the masks are ineffective at limiting the spread of COVID-19. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Certain medical-grade masks, such as the N95 respirator, offer the most protection against viral particles for the wearer because it can filter aerosol particles as small as 0.3 micron. But other masks, like the ear-loop ones in the photo or homemade cloth masks, are effective in reducing the spread of the disease, or what health experts call ""source control."" When you wear these masks it is most helpful to people around you. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend that the general public wear medical-grade masks like the N95 because they are in high demand, and officials say they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients.  As an additional public health measure, the agency recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings to help slow the spread of COVID-19 (emphasis ours): The ""CDC still recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from other people (social distancing), frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms."" Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, wrote an article in the Conversation in favor of universal mask wearing. Howard says that researchers were looking at the wrong question at first – how well a mask protects the wearer from infection – and not how well a mask prevents an infected person from spreading the virus. He said masks function very differently as personal protective equipment versus ""source control."" A photograph of a box of disposable masks shows a warning label that says the masks ""will not provide any protections against COVID-19."" Such disclaimers don’t mean that the masks are ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease, but that they don’t protect the wearer as well as medical respirators such as the N95 recommended for use by health care professionals. Disposable and homemade cloth masks are recommended for people to wear because it protects others around them in case they have the virus and may not be showing any symptoms.  The users sharing this image are making a false interpretation of the type of protection standard face masks provide.

"['Texas', 'Coronavirus', 'Greg Abbott']","
How many coronavirus deaths are people over 65?
","In a press conference on May 5 in which Gov. Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations ""remain at home if at all possible"" and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding. ""We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older,"" Abbott said. Texas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity.  Abbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks. This comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April. With that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65? Looking at the numbers Abbott’s spokesman John Wittman said Abbott’s claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the state’s COVID-19 testing and cases. The data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation. ""The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices,"" said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen. The purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said. Wittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement. ""It alternates almost daily, but it’s generally around that range,"" Wittman said.  As of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated. Of those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so: Ages 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4% Ages 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 % Ages 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8% Ages 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29% Ages 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04% Ages 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06% Ages 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2% Ages 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08% Across the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May. Like Texas’ statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19. ""While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days,"" the NCHS states on its website. The data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. The delay can last anywhere from one week to eight or more. Our ruling Abbott said almost ""75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older."" Of confirmed coronavirus deaths, close to 75% were people within the age group Abbott provided, but he failed to include the caveat that this statistic leaves out more than half of the total deaths that have not yet been investigated.  We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2020/may/21/greg-abbott/how-many-coronavirus-deaths-are-people-over-65/

No, the novel coronavirus was not 'man-made'
","Speculation about the origin of the novel coronavirus has spread online since the beginning of the pandemic, with Facebook posts and tabloids making baseless claims the virus was created in a lab. But it isn’t only social media users who have perpetuated the conspiracy theory the virus was bioengineered. In Illinois, a prominent state politician suggested the same thing: ""This man-made killer — whoever went in there and man-made it, perhaps they should be in there now trying to figure out how to turn this around,"" Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford of Maywood said during a May 15 appearance on Fox 32. ""I don’t believe it’s a natural virus,"" Lightford continued, after the program’s host asked Lightford if she thinks the virus did not occur naturally. ""I believe someone was in cahoots for some reason and I think it just got a little bit out of control and spread a whole lot further than they anticipated."" But to leading experts, the research is clear: the genetic structure of the virus shows it could not have been created in a lab — or be ""man-made,"" as Lightford claimed. An article published March 17 in Nature Medicine says the genetic makeup of the coronavirus does not indicate it was altered. Instead, the researchers who conducted the analysis present two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host, or natural selection in humans after the virus spread from animals. That finding doesn’t rule out the much-publicized theory the virus may have somehow escaped from a lab in China where it was being studied, though the government there has denied this. But what is known makes it clear the virus itself is not the result of human tampering. ""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the article states, using the scientific name for the virus that causes COVID-19. Experts from a number of different research and public health institutions, including the World Health Organization, say the most likely explanation for the virus is that it originated in animals. U.S. intelligence officials and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have also said the science indicates the virus was not made in a lab. When we reached out to Lightford, she acknowledged she had no evidence to support her assertion the virus was created by humans. ""I have nothing to back it up,"" she wrote in a text in response to our call. ""I was generally speaking. Only my opinion."" Lightford said the novel coronavirus was ""man-made."" But research shows the genetic features of the virus rule out the possibility it was created or manipulated in a lab.

No, half of the U.S. workforce has not been 'idled'
","U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop has been one of North Carolina’s most vocal opponents of Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-at-home order. Bishop, a Republican elected in 2019 to represent southwest NC, has attended protests urging Cooper to ""reopen"" the state’s economy. But in an interview on April 24, the congressman made a comment about the U.S. economy that caught our attention. On Spicer & Co., the show of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer on the conservative Newsmax TV, he said ""half the workforce in the country may have just been idled."" Here are his full comments: ""People who are elderly or who have underlying conditions that would subject them to the worst ravages of the coronavirus should take additional measures and, in fact, I don't object to government taking measures to see to it that those people are particularly protected,"" he said. ""But it’s quite another step to utterly devastate the economic landscape in a way — and I don’t know that I’ve seen a figure that better summarizes how bad it is, as the suggestion you just put up — that half the workforce in the country may have just been idled."" Is it true that half of the American workforce has been idled? And what ""figure"" is Bishop referring to? According to Bishop’s spokeswoman, Hannah Hummelberg, the congressman was referring to a New York Times stat that Spicer mentioned earlier in the segment.  ""The number of unemployment claims filed so far is equal to the total workforce, get this, of 25 states,"" Spicer said. (Spicer’s comment comes around the 1:15 mark of this video, while Bishop makes his claim shortly after the 4:30 mark.) Clearly, a chunk of the American population has filed for unemployment. But does it add up to half of the U.S. workforce? No.  By citing the New York Times stat, Bishop tied his definition of ""idle"" to unemployment numbers. So let’s put the Times’ stat in perspective.  There were about 160 million workers in the U.S. around the start of the year. That’s according to experts we interviewed, previous PolitiFact reporting, and numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Obviously, 26 million workers — the New York Times unemployment stat cited by Bishop — is not half of 160 million. So it’s wrong to suggest half of the U.S. is unemployed. And it’s not ""statistically sound"" to equate 26 million workers with ""half"" of the country, said Ryan Bourne, the R. Evan Scharf Chair for the Public Understanding of Economics at the Cato Institute. Cato is a think tank that advocates for free markets. And the New York Times comparison wouldn’t work with just any grouping of 25 states. In California alone, there are 19 million workers. ""Since our population is not spread evenly across the states, the working population of 25 states doesn't provide an estimate of 50% of the national workforce,"" said Tara Sinclair, associate professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. The Times’ stat alone isn’t enough to support Bishop’s claim. So let’s explore other estimates of U.S. unemployment. There are people that unemployment reports don’t account for, such as those who are furloughed or who are working reduced hours.  Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the number of people who filed for unemployment isn’t complete. He said there are several million more people who either could not get their forms in or were ineligible. (In North Carolina, for example, the phone lines at the state’s unemployment office were so busy that many people claimed they couldn’t get through to file claims.) Baker thinks the number of unemployed Americans is somewhere between 20-25%, he said in an May 5 email. ""I would be hesitant to use one much higher,"" he said. CNN estimated that 43 million workers were either out of work or working reduced hours in April alone. Bourne, the CATO expert, said Bishop’s claim would only be valid if considered very broadly.  He referenced a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation that said 55% of workers had either lost jobs, lost pay, lost hours, or been furloughed since Feb. 1.  The definition of ""idled"" is to not work or not do something. It’s a reference to inaction. The Kaiser survey included people who lost pay, but might still be working. ""This, as you can see, highlights the scale of the economic impacts of the virus and response, but is a different claim entirely,"" Bourne said. On April 21, three days before Bishop’s claim, the Pew Research Center published a study on how the coronavirus response affected the wages of American workers. About 28% said they or someone in their household has been laid off or lost their job. When asked if someone in the house had lost their job or taken a pay cut, 43% said yes. Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody’s Analytics, said the workforce can also be judged by the U.S. GDP. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. over the course of a year. It fell 4.8% in the first three months of the year (the first quarter), according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The bureau’s second quarter numbers run through June and are not yet available. Deutsche Bank expects GDP to drop ""nearly 40%"" in the second quarter, according to Business Insider. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office almost mirrors that estimate, expecting a 39% drop. ""Most economists"" don’t expect GDP to dip by 50%, Lafakis said. Moody’s expects GDP to decline 33% at an annualized rate in quarter two. Our ruling Bishop said ""half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.""  Bishop took a stat that’s meant to illustrate the magnitude of unemployment and misused it to falsely say half of the country’s workers are unemployed. The U.S. workforce is roughly 160 million people. We found no official counts or expert estimates showing unemployment has reached half of that figure. Bishop’s claim is only valid if we consider that 26 million people is equal to the working population of a specific group of 25 states, or if we look past the definition of ""idle"" and consider Americans who weren’t laid off, but whose wages were affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

""Please repost this information in as many media as possible to help this important warning to go viral.

On May 17, the account shared this quote attributed to ""Metallica drummer Bob Dylan"" (who bears a startling resemblance to Prince): ""Don’t believe everything you read on the internet about COVID-19."" Microchip implants for health care purposes is not a new idea, but we found nothing to support the claim that the Gates Foundation is spending billions to ensure all medical procedures include microchips. Other fact-checkers, like FactCheck.org and Reuters, have already debunked claims that Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder-turned-philanthropist, plans to use microchip implants against the coronavirus. Research unrelated to coronavirus and funded by the Gates Foundation proposed using invisible dye that could be read by a smartphone to record vaccination history on patients’ skin. The idea was proposed to help strengthen vaccination record-keeping in developing countries. But Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study, told Reuters that ""the quantum dot dye technology is not a microchip or human-implantable capsule, and to my knowledge are no plans to use this for coronavirus.""  Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease scientist at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, previously told PolitiFact that injecting someone with a vaccine containing a small radio-frequency identification technology chip is preposterous.   ""Even the smallest version of RFID chips are rather large that none would ever fit into a vaccine needle — these are very small-bore needles,"" he said.

Did Va. Democrats OK an early release plan for many violent inmates?
","Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, says Democrats in the General Assembly have opened prison gates for the early release of thousands of violent felons. ""VA Democrats authorized for early release over 4,000 violent felons, 60% of which are incarcerated for violent offenses,"" he posted on his Facebook page on April 28.  Freitas repeated the charge that day at a virtual town hall meeting, laying the blame on Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. ""There was one governor’s recommendation that came down where he was advocating for the option of early release for over 4,000 people that have been incarcerated,"" he said. ""Sixty percent of the people that he was advocating be eligible for the program were actually incarcerated for violent offenses."" . We fact-checked the statements by Freitas, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the Seventh District congressional seat held by Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His statements are based on a budget amendment the Democratic-led General Assembly approved on April 22 at Northam’s request. Concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in state prisons, Northam asked the legislature to allow the Department of Corrections to release inmates with less than a year left on their sentences. The emergency leniency does not apply to inmates convicted of capital murder or sexually violent crimes. Freitas did not respond to three requests we made for his source on the number of inmates who would become eligible for early release and the percentage who had committed violent crimes. His information likely came from Del. Robert Bell, R-Albemarle, who got data from the Department of Corrections and shared it with colleagues. Numbers The department said 4,618 inmates will enter the last year of their  sentences by April 30, 2021. Of them, 2,933 - or 64% - are considered violent offenders under parole abolition laws passed by the General Assembly in 1995.  We’ll subtract 172 inmates convicted of sexual crimes and ineligible to go early.  That leaves 4,446 inmates who would be eligible for early release. Of them, 2,761 inmates - or 62% - are legally classified as violent offenders. Among their ranks: 3 were convicted of second degree murder; 65 of manslaughter;  102 of kidnapping; and 1,386 of assault or robbery.   The Department of Corrections uses a more lenient definition of violent crimes for sorting inmates. Under its terms, the offenses of inmates who could be freed early breaks down this way: 1,928 committed violent crimes, or 42%; 1,606 committed property crimes, or 35%; 1,080 convicted of drug-related or public order crimes, or 23%; and  4 inmates’ who are unclassified.   Not all eligible inmates will get out early. The DOC says each eligible person will be screened. Among other things, the department will consider an inmate’s crime, health, conduct in prison, recidivism risk and plans for work and shelter if released. As of May 18, 195 people have been freed early. DOC statistics show as of May 19, 900 inmates and 73 prison employees have tested positive for COVID-19. Five inmates have died from the virus. Freitas, during his town hall podcast said he and other GOP lawmakers are open to an emergency early release of people convicted of ""minor crimes,"" but not violent offenders. Our ruling Freitas says, ""VA Democrats authorized for early release over 4,000 inmates, 60% of which are incarcerated for violent offenses."" He’s talking about a budget amendment the Democratic-run legislature muscled through at Northam’s request to combat a COVID-19 outbreak in prisons. Freitas’ numbers are good, but his statement lacks context. He didn’t mention - in his Facebook post or during his town hall broadcast - that all of these inmates will be less than a year away from finishing their sentence. They’ll getting out soon anyway, regardless of whether they’re granted early release.

The facts on Donald Trump’s claim of 182 miles of border wall construction
","The United States, Mexico and Canada in late March agreed to restrict non-essential travel across their borders to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. President Donald Trump on May 19 was asked whether he’d extend the travel restriction with Canada. Trump responded by saying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade was recently signed, and pivoted to his signature promise of a border wall with Mexico. ""On the Southern border, as you know, the wall is going up, it’s going up very rapidly. We’re at 182 miles,"" Trump said during an event about coronavirus aid for farmers and ranchers. Trump added: ""pretty early next year, we’ll have 450 to 500 miles of wall fully built."" PolitiFact decided to fact-check Trump’s claim that 182 miles of wall have been built. The facts haven’t changed much since we reviewed construction progress in January. Very little of the U.S.-Mexico border has a barrier for the first time. Trump’s claims mainly refer to the replacement of older, dilapidated barriers, not to the addition of a wall in places where none existed before. The barriers going up are harder to get through than previous structures. But they are not the ""impenetrable"" wall Trump promised during his campaign. The White House press office did not respond to our queries for information. But we did get some details from the agency that oversees border security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The U.S.-Mexico border spans nearly 2,000 miles. Before Trump became president, 654 miles had primary barriers. More than three years into Trump’s presidency, that has increased by 3 miles, to 657 miles of primary barriers, according to information provided by CBP. The Southwest border in some places has three layers of barriers, one backing the other; officials refer to them as primary, secondary and tertiary barriers. From January 2017 to mid-May 2020, approximately 187 miles of primary and secondary ""border wall system"" have been built, CBP said. A ""border wall system"" includes steel-bollard barriers, all-weather roads, lighting, cameras and other surveillance technology. Of the 187 miles, only 15 have barriers for the first time. The other 172 miles have barriers replacing dilapidated or outdated designs. Primary barriers: 161 miles with replacement barriers, 3 miles have barriers for the first time. Secondary barriers: 11 miles with replacement barriers, 12 miles have barriers for the first time. Trump claimed that by early next year, 450 to 500 miles of wall would be ""fully built."" CBP Acting Commissioner Mark A. Morgan in late February gave a House committee a more restrained outlook, saying the agency expected to have 450 miles ""completed or under construction"" by the end of 2020. We asked CBP how many more miles of replacement and new barriers it anticipated to have done by the end of the year, but we did not get a response. A fact sheet sent to PolitiFact by the agency details ongoing or planned construction projects; however, it does not specify expected completion dates for each project. Some projects are still in the planning phase and don’t yet have a construction contract. Border enforcement priorities and policies have varied during past administrations, yet a February 2017 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office says that it took a decade for CBP to increase the total miles of primary fencing on the Southwest border, from 119 miles in fiscal year 2005 to 654 miles in fiscal year 2015. Trump said, ""On the Southern border, as you know, the wall is going up, it's going up very rapidly. We're at 182 miles."" There is construction going on at the Southwest border — so far 187 miles have completed projects. But only a small part of that represents areas of the border that previously had no protection. What the administration has mostly done is replace old and outdated designs with newer and improved barriers.

Fact-checking Donald Trump’s claim of ‘best numbers’ at the border
","Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo asked President Donald Trump if he’d use the ""same playbook"" to get the United States economy back on track after disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Trump answered that he’s always being an ""America First"" person and pointed to his administration’s work on Southwest border enforcement as evidence. ""Strong borders. Our border is very strong,"" Trump said during a Fox Business interview May 14. ""We have some of the best numbers we've ever had. Southern border, the best numbers we've ever had."" Trump generally uses that language to refer to a low number of apprehensions at the Southwest border. A few days later, in a May 19 speech, he referred to the numbers being ""the lowest numbers we’ve ever had of people coming in and we’re moving them out as soon as they come in."" We asked the White House for more details but did not hear back. PolitiFact reviewed data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and found that the number of apprehensions is relatively low, but not the lowest ever. Border experts also told us that U.S. policies alone are not the cause of the drop, and that people in foreign countries are also likely taking into consideration the public-health risk of emigrating during a pandemic. Cristobal Ramón, a senior policy analyst with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Immigration Project, said two coordinated trends have decreased the number of people arriving at the Southwest border: policies by the Trump administration and lockdowns in foreing countries, such as El Salvador and Honduras, restricting the movement of people during the pandemic. ""The administration doesn’t seem to recognize that the numbers we are seeing are flukes in history,"" Ramón said. ""This is happening in a very unique context that I think you are not going to fully account for by policies alone."" Immigration experts have told us that people interpret apprehension numbers differently: some might consider high apprehension numbers an indication of effective border enforcement; others might say low apprehension numbers show that U.S. policies are working to deter illegal immigration in the first place. The Trump administration views low apprehension numbers as a sign that the border is under control. Before the pandemic, a cooperative agreement between the United States and Guatemala and the Migrant Protection Protocols program contributed to a decline of border arrivals. The Trump administration in late March invoked Title 42, a section of federal law that allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deny entry to immigrants coming from a country with an outbreak of an infectious disease. Using that law, the administration has been quickly expelling immigrants who arrive at the border, and that is also decreasing the number of people showing up at the border, Ramón said. It’s unclear if Trump’s claim of ""some of the best numbers we've ever had"" was based on a comparison of month-to-month or fiscal years. We also don’t know which years or months his claim is based on. So far this fiscal year, there have been around 207,000 Southwest border apprehensions, according to CBP data. However, that includes March and April expulsions done under the HHS directive, and apprehensions under CBP’s immigration authority. More detailed CBP data shows that of nearly 16,000 Border Patrol enforcement actions in April, about 1,500 were apprehensions under CBP’s immigration authority. The rest were expulsions under Title 42. In March, most of the Border Patrol’s actions were apprehensions, not expulsions. We asked CBP how it determined whether immigrants found in between ports of entry are sent back to their country based on the health department directive or based on CBP’s immigration authority. The agency said that if it made that information public it ""would be exploited by human smugglers."" Year-to-date apprehensions (October 2019 through April 2020) are the lowest they've been compared with same time frames in past years of the Trump administration. Still, nationwide, apprehensions were much lower in the 1960s and earlier years. The number of people encountered by Border Patrol during Trump’s first full months in office in 2017, February to April, was lower than the number encountered from February to April 2020. Camila Townsend, a Distinguished Professor of History at Rutgers University, with expertise in U.S.-Mexico border issues, said it is likely that potential immigrants are aware ""that they have no chance of an asylum hearing"" during this time, and that if they manage to cross illegally, there’s ""almost no chance of getting a job in a world where most businesses are shuttered."" ""They are likely aware that in order to get here and begin to face such problems, they would first have to pass through Central American countries and parts of Mexico with stay-at-home orders, curfews, and few cars or trucks on the road"" to hitchhike with, Townsend said via email. Trump said, ""We have some of the best numbers we've ever had. Southern border, the best numbers we've ever had."" Year-to-date apprehension numbers are the lowest the Trump administration has seen so far, but they are not the lowest compared with past administrations. In terms of monthly data, it is not the lowest the Trump administration has seen. Despite the low numbers, experts said it’s important to keep in mind the context: a global pandemic that has caused lockdowns in foreign countries and increased the public health risk of emigrating to the United States.

Trump falsely claims Michigan illegally sent ballots to all voters
","President Donald Trump’s crusade against voting by mail has put him at odds with the truth again.  This time, he took aim at Michigan’s latest effort to expand access to absentee ballots. ""Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,"" Trump tweeted May 20. ""This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!""  Trump is wrong. Michigan’s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced May 19 that her office was mailing all registered voters an application to vote by mail in the August and November elections, not a ballot.  People who complete, sign and return the application would receive a ballot about six weeks before the election.  The action follows a constitutional amendment to expand access to absentee ballots, which Michiganders supported overwhelmingly in a 2018 ballot issue. We emailed the White House and the Trump campaign to ask for the basis of his claim  and did not get a reply. Trump deleted his tweet about Michigan on the same day and then wrote a new tweet  with mostly the same wording, referring to ""absentee ballot applications"" but still alleging an illegal"" action by Benson. Trump won Michigan narrowly in 2016 and has criticized efforts to expand voting by mail this year, falsely linking it to ballot fraud and arguing that it disfavors Republicans. Benson, a Democrat elected in 2018, responded to Trump on Twitter and in a written statement.  ""Hi I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia,"" Benson tweeted.  Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy All four of those states indeed sent voters applications to receive absentee ballots for their primaries.  Amid the pandemic, some state governments have already changed laws and policies to expand the option of voting by mail.  At the local level, some elections officials in heavily Democratic and Republican counties around the country are mailing voters information on how to apply for an absentee ballot. Election officials say voting by mail can help reduce crowds at the polls and enforce social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19. A recent amendment to Michigan's state constitution guarantees all registered voters the option to vote by absentee ballot for any reason. Michigan voters backed the amendment overwhelmingly in a 2018 ballot issue, along with several other measures to expand voter participation.  That means all voters have the right to vote by mail, ""so it is within the Secretary’s authority, as the chief elections administrator in the state, to mail applications,"" Benson’s spokeswoman, Tracy Wimmer, told PolitiFact. Various entities, including both major parties and advocacy organizations, routinely send absentee-ballot applications in Michigan. Nothing in state law prohibits the secretary of state from mailing out absentee-ballot applications, said Sharon Dolente, a voting rights strategist for the ACLU of Michigan. ""The Secretary of State in Michigan has broad responsibilities for managing elections and it fits within her authority,"" she said. Election officials in Michigan have faced legal challenges to their authority to mail out absentee ballot applications automatically. But Benson’s office said those cases involved actions by local clerks, not the secretary of state, who is the state’s chief election officer. And those challenges were decided more than a decade before the constitutional amendment guaranteeing access to an absentee ballot. The absentee ballot voter application allows voters to check a box to receive absentee ballots for all future elections and has spaces for voters to provide their addresses for receiving the August and November election ballots. Of Michigan’s 7.7 million registered voters, about 1.3 million are on a ""permanent absentee voter"" list, which means their local election clerk automatically mails them applications ahead of every election, Benson wrote in her May 19 press release. It will cost the state about $4.5 million to mail out the applications to every voter, and the state is paying for that through the federal CARES Act. In the May 5 local elections in Michigan, the majority of voters cast ballots by mail. RELATED: How battleground states are preparing for the pandemic election’s massive increase in voting by mail It’s unclear what authority Trump thinks he has to ""hold up funding to Michigan."" The CARES Act and 2020 Help America Vote Act funds made clear federal money could be used to handle increased voting by mail, said Myrna Perez, director of voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center at New York University School of Law. Trump tweeted that Michigan’s ""rogue"" secretary of state sent absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ""illegally and without authorization"" ahead of the primaries and the general election.

Obama campaign movie says auto bailout money had run out when he took office
","
In a new 17-minute campaign movie highlighting President Barack Obama’s accomplishments in office, narrator Tom Hanks walks viewers through the major challenges of the last four years and how the president has handled them.

Osama bin Laden. Iraq. Health care. The collapsing auto industry.

On the subject of Detroit, car company CEOs appear onscreen asking for money in Washington, followed by pictures of empty factories and dire news headlines. The movie talks about the financial pressures on the new president and the unpopularity with the public of more bailouts. But Obama, Hanks says, acted anyway to help American workers.

""He decided to intervene, but in exchange for help the president would demand action. The Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion, and the money was now gone,"" Hanks says.

Then President Bill Clinton appears onscreen to lend his voice.

""He didn’t just give the car companies the money, and he didn’t give the UAW the money,"" Clinton says. ""He said you guys gotta work together and come up, and everybody’s gotta have some skin in the game here. You gotta modernize the automobile industry.""

Chrysler and GM got their first billions in December 2008 under President George W. Bush and received billions more under Obama. So here, we’re checking the movie’s claim that the first round of loans ran out before the second was extended -- that when Obama took office ""the Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion, and the money was now gone.""

Bailout primer

In early December 2008, Chrysler and GM were dangerously close to collapsing. With global credit markets frozen, the companies turned to the federal government for an emergency infusion of money. More than a million jobs were at stake.

Bush authorized initial loans to Chrysler and GM (and their respective financing arms) before leaving office, using money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Chrysler initially received $4 billion, and GM got $13.4 billion in bridge loans meant to keep the companies afloat for a little longer.

Early in 2009, Obama convened a task force to study the companies’ viability. Both were required to submit plans for getting back to solvency, but both failed, the task force determined. In the meantime, they were running short of money again.

A report from the Congressional Oversight Panel details the chronology of the spending, including an additional $6.36 billion that GM received between March and May 2009.

Both companies ended up going through structured bankruptcies, Chrysler in April and GM in June. The Obama administration was instrumental in the manner in which the reorganizations proceeded. Some debt holders were forced to take losses, while the autoworkers union health care trust, which was owed billions in health benefits, took an equity stake, as did the federal government.

Details on the money

The Obama campaign responded to our inquiry with citations of several news stories about when the first loans were disbursed.

* $5 billion to financing arm GMAC on Dec. 29, 2008

* $4 billion to GM on Dec. 31, 2008

* $4 billion to Chrysler on Jan. 2, 2009

* $884 million to GMAC on Jan. 16, 2009

* $100 million to financing arm Chrysler Financial on Jan. 16, 2009

Obama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009. So that adds up to almost $14 billion in auto bailout money before he took office.

Details on the spending

The campaign also sent us reports from early 2009 on where the money was going.

Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research, told the Detroit News in January that ""GM and Chrysler are insolvent. Without federal funding they are bankrupt.""

He added that Chysler needed $6 billion at the time to pay its suppliers for the previous quarter's auto parts, and he said he suspected the full $4 billion loan went towards those payments, the story said. (We reached out to McAlinden for our story but didn’t hear back.)

A Detroit Free Press story noted that GM was spending $7.5 billion per month on car parts at the time the government bailed it out. The Obama campaign pointed out that just a single month’s expenses exceeded the amount GM received from the Treasury by $3.5 billion.

ABC News published a story in April 2009 quoting Neil Barofsky, the TARP inspector general, saying that Chrysler Financial had asked for more funds because ""they had basically used up the $1.5 billion that was lent to them.""

Some context

We ran this statement by Steven Rattner, who headed Obama’s task force through the bailouts. He said it’s accurate that the funds were exhausted.

""It got used up before we really were in the saddle,"" he said.

But he also pointed out that none of the parties involved -- not the Bush administration, the incoming Obama administration or the car companies -- thought it would be enough to bring the automakers back to solvency.

""Nobody thought it was going to solve the problem. This was a interim financing,"" Rattner said. ""This was all something we anticipated.""

A New York Times story from the time said the Bush loan ""gives the companies a few months to get their businesses in order but hands off to President-elect Barack Obama the difficult political task of ruling on their future.""

We also think it’s worth mentioning the implication in the video that the Bush administration did not put enough restrictions on the money. ""He decided to intervene, but in exchange for help the president would demand action,"" narrator Hanks says just before mentioning the Bush loans.

Obama himself has previously said the Bush team handed out billions and asked nothing in return, a statement we rated False.

Keith Hennessey, a former Bush administration official, wrote on his blog in June 2009 about the many restrictions tied to the loans, including that the car companies pay down debt, limits on executive compensation and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. And remember the companies’ viability plans reviewed by Obama’s task force? They were required under the terms of the Bush loans.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign movie says, ""the Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion and the money was now gone."" 
It's important to note that the $13 billion was provided as loans, not as grants, as the wording might suggest.

Referring to the time Obama took office, January 2009, GM and Chrysler by then had received almost $14 billion in bailout money. News reports also reflect that the money was basically used up. So, that much is correct. But the movie ignores the fact that this was not unexpected. The Bush administration’s loans were always just a temporary lifeline, meant to keep the companies operating so the new president would have time to decide what to do long term.

This is important information left out of the movie’s extensive discussion of the auto bailouts. That the $13 billion was gone when Obama arrived was no surprise. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/19/barack-obama/obama-campaign-movie-says-auto-bailout-money-had-r/

Yet we couldn’t help wonder about a statistical claim that Flynn, a former Massachusetts public safety commissioner under then-Gov. Mitt Romney, made on  Feb. 9, 2012.

In the first of what are billed as monthly sit-downs with Milwaukee public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7), Flynn was asked which issues city residents say are most important for police to address.

Reducing ""measurable"" serious crime is a concern of both city and suburban Milwaukee residents, Flynn replied, adding:

""Perversely, in a way, people who actually live in the city recognize an extraordinary amount of our violent crime is highly concentrated among criminals perpetrating violence upon other criminals. It doesn't minimize its importance as a public safety issue; but they recognize that a lot of concerns in their neighborhoods are what we would call quality of life problems or lower-level crime problems.

""For the average resident of this city, they're much more concerned about a burglary than they are about a shooting because 85 percent of our shootings are people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records. It's bad, we've got to solve the crime, we've got to break up the violence. But most folks recognize they're not a likely victim.""

The 85 percent figure caught our eye.

Is it true 85 percent of Milwaukee’s shootings involve ""people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records""?

Flynn spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz said the chief based his comment on a 2011 annual report by the city’s Homicide Review Commission, which annually reviews all types of homicides as well as non-fatal shootings.

The report wasn’t released until nearly a month after Flynn’s radio interview, but he had been told of the findings, said Mallory O’Brien, the commission’s director.

One important note about the 2011 report, before we get to the numbers, in terms of Flynn’s reference to ""extensive criminal record"": It provides complete prior arrest data for only some of the suspects and victims involved in the 2011 shootings. Included are juvenile and adult arrests for felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well as non-criminal ordinance violations, but not minor offenses such as speeding.

So, Flynn is setting a relatively low bar for ""extensive criminal records"" in that not all arrests, of course, lead to convictions or even criminal charges. And because complete prior arrest data are not available for all the people involved in the 2011 shootings, some assumptions are made by O’Brien the study’s author. That being said, O’Brien, a PhD epidemiologist, said her experience in doing the annual reports gives her confidence in making assumptions about the prior arrests of shooting suspects and victims.

So, as the chief himself might say, let’s get to the numbers.

Non-fatal shootings:

In non-fatal shootings in 2011, 97 percent of the 177 suspects and 86 percent of the 473 victims had at least one prior arrest. The report doesn’t say how many.

However, O’Brien said a closer analysis of non-fatal shootings during a six-week period in July and August 2011, when non-fatal shootings increased, found that suspects had an average of 7.5 prior arrests and victims had an average of about six. O’Brien said that based on her past studies, she would expect that the rest of the suspects and victims in the non-fatal shootings in 2011 had a similar number of prior arrests.

So, more than 85 percent of the people involved in non-fatal shootings had at least one prior arrest. And there’s a strong indication, though not complete numbers, that most people involved in the non-fatal shootings had at least several prior arrests.

Homicides:

For all homicides in 2011 -- those involving guns and those that didn’t -- 57 percent of the 72 suspects and 62 percent of the 66 homicide victims had at least six prior arrests.

O’Brien said that based on past studies she has done, most homicides involve guns and it’s unlikely that arrest records would vary greatly between the people involved in shooting homicides versus non-shooting homicides.

So, a clear majority, but less than 85 percent, of the people involved in fatal shootings likely had at least six prior arrests; although, again, the study doesn’t provide hard numbers on that point.

We asked James Alan Fox, a criminology, law and public policy professor at Northeastern University in Boston, about Flynn’s claim. He said from a national perspective, most shootings involve people with an arrest history, although he couldn’t say how extensive that history is for the typical shooting suspect or victim.

Our rating

Flynn said 85 percent of Milwaukee shootings ""are people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records.""

The thrust of his statement -- that the vast majority of shooting suspects and victims have a criminal history, is accurate. But he made a specific statistical claim that isn’t fully supported by the study he cites. And as compared with charges or convictions, prior arrests as a measure of a person’s criminal record is on the lower end of the scale.

In sum, Flynn’s claim was partially accurate, but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.

Chris Christie cut $1 billion in rebates, leading to 20 percent property tax hikes, assemblyman says
","
New Jersey taxpayers are paying 20 percent more in property taxes, thanks to a $1 billion cut in rebates from Gov. Chris Christie, according to state Assemblyman John McKeon.

In a March 4 interview on My9 News’ ""New Jersey Now,"" the Essex County Democrat claimed ""the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found a couple of problems with McKeon’s statement.

Instead of $1 billion, Christie has reduced Homestead rebates by about $660 million since signing the fiscal year 2011 budget, his first spending plan as governor.

That reduction in rebates coincided with a 20 percent property tax increase, but a state official disputed that figure, pointing out that rebates did not directly lower property tax bills in the past.

First, let’s talk about the Homestead property tax credits.

In fiscal year 2011, Christie cut funding for Homestead rebates by $850.4 million. But in fiscal year 2012, Christie increased funding by $189.8 million.

So, during Christie’s tenure, there has been a net decrease of about $660.6 million in Homestead rebates.

But McKeon argued that the governor cut rebates by about $1.5 billion. In addition to the $850 million cut in Christie’s first budget, the funding level in his second budget represented a ""$683 million cut"" from fiscal year 2010, according to McKeon.

We told McKeon he was double-counting the governor’s cut in fiscal year 2011, but he maintained that his statement is ""absolutely true.""

""Said in plain language, had Gov Christie funded rebates at the same level as the (level) in the final year before he took office, New Jersey taxpayers would have had $1.533 Billion dollars more in their pockets,"" McKeon told us in an e-mail.

Now, let’s talk about that property tax increase.

According to the state Department of Community Affairs, the average Homestead rebate was $1,037 in 2009 and $240 in 2011.

After deducting the average Homestead rebates, the bill for ""average net property taxes"" was $6,244 in 2009 and $7,519 in 2011, according to the DCA. That’s a 20.4 percent increase in property taxes between 2009 and 2011.

But the 2009 figure is misleading, DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an e-mail.

Starting with the Christie administration, homeowners receive the rebates as credits on their property tax bills. But previously, the rebates were paid out in the form of checks and not applied directly to property tax bills, Ryan told us.

In other words, although those checks were meant as property tax relief, that doesn’t mean homeowners used them to pay their property tax bills, according to Ryan.

""An eligible homeowners’ property tax bill in 2009 – the actual bill – was not lowered because he/she received a rebate check in the mail,"" Ryan said.

The heading of ""average net property taxes"" is ""leftover from previous administrations that wanted to claim property tax rebates lowered property taxes when they did not,"" said Ryan, adding that state officials dispute that property taxes went up by 20 percent.

McKeon rejected the department’s argument: ""For us to even entertain an argument by the DCA controlled by the Governor that rebates not transmitted by credit shouldn't be counted doesn't even meet the laugh test.""

Our ruling

In a TV interview, McKeon claimed ""the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent.""

But Christie cut about $660 million in Homestead rebates. Following the reduction in rebates, the average net property tax bill went up by about 20 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs.

A DCA spokeswoman claimed the tax hike is inaccurate, because Homestead rebates were not used in previous years to directly lower property tax bills. Still, no matter how the rebates were distributed, their purpose always has been property tax relief.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Georgia', 'Water', 'Kasim Reed']","
Mayor's math on reservoir not wet
","
Atlanta has plenty to offer. Water, a scarce resource in these parts, isn’t one of the selling points.

But don’t fear, Mayor Kasim Reed says. Atlanta has a place that could potentially hold a substantial amount of water.

""We also have, in a park that’s not far from here, an ability to build a reservoir that can hold a 30-day water supply for the city of Atlanta,"" Reed said during a recent radio interview with WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer.

The mayor was referring to the Bellwood Quarry, a 138-acre property in northwest Atlanta, near Marietta Boulevard and Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway. Many people, particularly zombie fans, may recognize the quarry as a backdrop for the hit AMC series ""The Walking Dead.""

Reed was on the radio to sell Atlanta residents on voting for a 1 percent sales tax to fund an ongoing multibillion-dollar effort to improve the city’s sewer system and produce cleaner drinking water. The mayor and O’Hayer talked big picture about the city’s and state’s water challenges, a discussion that prompted Reed to talk about the quarry. Plans for a reservoir are in the early stages, city official said.

For years, Georgia leaders have battled with their counterparts in Alabama and Florida over control of the limited water resources in the region. The ""water war,"" it’s been called.

Maybe, we wondered, Atlantans won’t have any new wrinkles on their foreheads worrying about where their water will come from with the quarry’s development. 

Atlanta officials say that’s a stretch because a reservoir won’t solve all the city’s water needs. Besides, they said, the reservoir would cost about $180 million to build, and there is no projected start date.

More importantly to our fact-checking operation, we wondered whether the mayor’s claim about the quarry’s potential water capacity is a stretch?

 Atlanta bought the quarry for about $35 million in 2006, when Shirley Franklin was mayor. Franklin and city leaders, eager to provide more parkland and green space in Atlanta, wanted to convert the century-old quarry site into a park with a lake. The lake wouldn’t be used for recreational purposes because of the loose rock around the rim and its depth. The entire surface area of the park is 138 acres. The surface area of the reservoir is 40 acres and between 250 and 400 feet deep, according to a fact sheet the city put together in June 2010.

Here’s how the city says creating the reservoir would work:

""The reservoir will be filled with water withdrawn from the Chattahoochee River at the existing water supply intake and pump station facility. It will be designed to operate as an off-line storage reservoir -- where water may be held for an extended period of time before being pumped into the Hemphill or Chattahoochee water treatment plants.""

Atlanta is considering plans to build a deep tunnel to carry water from the reservoir to the Hemphill treatment plant.

""We think [the reservoir plans are] a good idea,"" Sally Bethea, executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, a nonprofit group that works to keep the region’s waterways safe from pollution.

Businesses and residents who use the Atlanta system currently consume 90 million to 95 million gallons of water a day, said Janet Ward, the communications director for the Atlanta Watershed Management Department. The usage can rise up to 100 million gallons a day in the summer, she said. The quarry has the potential to hold approximately 2.4 billion gallons of untreated water, Ward said.

PolitiFact Georgia divided the potential of water it can hold by 90 million gallons of water a day. The result came to nearly 27 days of capacity.

Ward explained to us why the mayor said the quarry could hold a 30-day water supply.

""I think [the 30-day estimate] started when we were in the depths of the drought and our daily usage was more like 85 million gallons a day,"" she said. ""If the mayor said 30, that’s because that’s the figure we’ve been using all along. Since the drought, people’s usage has gone back up slightly.""

Reed’s statement is very close. The 27-day calculation prompts us to provide some clarification to his statement. Our rating: Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/19/kasim-reed/mayors-math-reservoir-not-wet/

Pat Boone says health care advisory board can ration care and deny Medicare treatments
","
Pat Boone gained fame in the 1950s with covers of tunes like ""Tutti Frutti,"" ""Long Tall Sally,"" and ""Ain’t That a Shame.""  Now he’s helping the 60 Plus Association, an advocacy group that bills itself as ""the conservative alternative"" to the AARP,  to recycle material.

Boone is the pitchman in an ad that targets the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, the health reform bill often called Obamacare approved by Congress in 2010. The ad warns seniors of potential dangers in the bill and urges them to call Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

The 60 Plus Association announced it was launching a new campaign on March 12 that would target five Democratic senators, including Brown, on the issue of health care reform.

The centerpiece of the new, $720,000 ad campaign in Ohio, 60 Plus said, is a 60-second spot featuring Boone. In addition to the spot that targets Brown, the campaign also is airing look-alike ads aimed at Sens. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Bill Nelson of Florida, Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.

If the ad looks familiar, it should. It's the same TV spot, recycling a series of claims about the health care reform law, that was part of a $750,000 campaign that 60 Plus aimed at Brown four months ago.

Since the ad is again airing in Buckeye State, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at another one of its claims: that the independent payment advisory board created by the Affordable Care Act ""can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments.""

First though, we’ll touch on some of the ad’s other statements.

In the ad, Boone says that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will cut $500 billion from Medicare. PolitiFact has reviewed that claim several times and rated it Mostly False. A review of the claim from an earlier 60 Plus ad noted, ""the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it attempts to slow the program’s future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase - the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.""

Boone also claims in the ad that the law creates ""a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare to pay for new government programs."" PolitiFact Ohio found that so puzzling and ridiculous that we rated it Pants on Fire.

But what about this claim, that the IPAB ""can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments""?

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act creates the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board to suggest ways to limit Medicare’s spending growth. It can be overruled by Congress. Its appointments will be done in public. It will not make decisions on individual cases.

The board can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.

In the ad, Boone says that the IPAB would ""operate in secret, will have vast powers to reach into our lives, and will have the final, irrefutable say on Medicare policy.""

Rep. Michelle Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican and former presidential candidate, earned a False rating from PolitiFact when she made some similar claims in a debate in October 2011.

The board's members won’t be ""bureaucrats,"" as the ad states. The health care law requires they will be doctors and medical professionals, economists and health care management experts, and representatives for consumers and seniors.

Boone charges that ""this IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments"" and that the board decides ""whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy"" and ""will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans.""

But the IPAB recommendations would not apply to any particular individual. They would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given Boone’s rhetoric, some people could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case.

Experts agreed that the board has no say in whether any individual receives dialysis, chemotherapy or any other treatment. It is barred by Section 3403 of the health care law from making policy recommendations that would block patients from needed care.

""The IPAB is specifically forbidden from making any recommendations that would ration care, reduce benefits, raise premiums or cost-sharing or alter eligibility for Medicare,"" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce Committee last July.

""And all final decisions remain in the hands of Congress,"" she said. ""If Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, it’s Congress’s choice whether to accept those recommendations or come up with recommendations of its own to put Medicare spending on a stable, sustainable path.""

That’s not at all what Boone croons in the 60 Plus ad. His claim that IPAB ""can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments"" isn’t just wrong. It’s also ridiculous.

To that we can say ""Ain’t That a Shame.""

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Kathleen Falk']","
Kathleen Falk says Gov. Scott Walker didn’t balance the budget and presided over a larger deficit
","
Mike Gousha, a veteran political journalist, asked the $3.6 billion question in an interview with Democrat Kathleen Falk, who is seeking to oust Gov. Scott Walker in a likely recall election.

At a Feb. 29, 2012 appearance by Falk at Marquette University’s ""On the Issues"" program, he queried: Democrats criticize how Walker eliminated that big budget shortfall, but how would they have done it?

Falk didn’t answer directly but eventually recounted how as Dane County executive she used innovation, technology, modest tax increases and negotiations with labor unions to find savings.

But this is the part that caught our attention:

""He didn’t balance the budget, as we know,"" Falk said. ""We now have a larger state deficit ...14 months into Gov. Walker’s term than we did when he was elected.""

The claim is one that will likely be tossed around a lot in the coming months, as Democrats try to counter Walker’s boast that he balanced the budget despite that $3.6 billion hole.

So let’s take a look.

There are two aspects to Falk’s claim.

First, was the budget balanced when passed in the summer of 2011?

It was, based on the revenue and spending projections at the time. The  state constitution requires a balanced budget, and it was measured by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper, and other outside experts who agreed it was balanced.

Indeed, though Democrats argued fiercely about how Walker balanced the budget, no one claimed at the time it was not balanced.

At Marquette, Falk said Walker ""didn’t balance the budget, as we know.""

That’s clearly wrong in terms of when the budget was passed.

Falk couches her statement as if Walker’s budget never was balanced. It actually had a very small positive balance when passed.

That leads to the second aspect of the claim: Is the budget more in arrears now than when Walker took office?

Asked to back up the claim, Falk said she is referring to the $137 million budget deficit Walker had to clean up from the last six months of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s final budget.

She’s comparing it to a new shortfall that has popped up only eight months into Walker’s two-year budget.

Indeed, a projected deficit of $350 million has cropped up in the two-year budget that started in July 2011, mainly because tax collection estimates are not coming in at the level the budget anticipated.

Both the $137 million and the $350 million figures are derived from a report by the fiscal bureau, which periodically measures how finances are faring during the time a budget is in place. For instance, in May 2011 the fiscal bureau reported improved tax collection estimates, infusing another $600 million into the current budget. That proved too optimistic.

While the current $350 million is clearly larger, both the Doyle deficit and the new Walker deficit are small -- 1 or 2 percent of the total budget.

In 2011, Walker called the Doyle deficit a ""fiscal crisis"" necessitating a budget-repair bill. That bill contained the controversial collective bargaining limits that helped fuel mass protests and now the recall against Walker.

Much of the new problem, in addition to lower-than-anticipated tax collections, is due to shortfalls in the Medicaid program, based on figures in the February 2012 report by the fiscal bureau.

But there is a difference:

Walker has much more time to fix the new gap than he did in dealing with Doyle’s deficit, which came toward the end of a two-year budget cycle. We’re not yet halfway into the current budget. So in making the comparison, Falk and others are mixing two different time frames.

Walker administration officials have said they may not even need formal legislation to adjust the budget, as they did in early  2011.

In recent years, mid-course budget corrections have become commonplace in Wisconsin politics, in part because the state keeps almost no rainy day fund. Economic ups and downs have also made predicting tax revenue tricky.

In those recent budgets, Wisconsin has also faced a challenge because of cost-of-living increases and past decisions to delay painful cuts and forward obligations on to the next budget. That led to the $3.6 billion shortfall Walker faced and a so-called structural deficit, something Walker’s two-year budget also eliminated, according to the fiscal bureau.

A final note: All of this is separate from the debate over a different measuring stick. Walker did not balance the budget under what is known as GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles. That’s more stringent than the cash-flow approach the state has long used.

Our conclusion

Falk criticized Walker for a deficit that has opened up in his first budget.

She is correct in saying it’s larger than the deficit Walker had to close in his predecessor’s last budget. But her statement that Walker ""didn’t balance the budget as we know"" is wrong.

We rate her statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/18/kathleen-falk/kathleen-falk-says-gov-scott-walker-didnt-balance-/
"['Abortion', 'New Jersey', 'Supreme Court', 'Women', 'Chris Smith']","
Chris Smith says more than 54 million abortions have been performed since U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade
","
U.S. Rep. Chris Smith has garnered attention for his ardent -- and sometimes graphic -- condemnation of abortion.

The Republican congressman, who represents parts of central New Jersey, took to the House floor on March 8 to denounce a new proposal: ""after-birth abortion.""  

During his speech, Smith said: ""since 1973"" -- when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in the Roe v. Wade case -- ""well over 54 million babies have had abortion forced upon them.""  Now, he said, this ""perverse proposal"" for ""after-birth abortion,"" or killing a newborn in all cases where abortion is permissible, has emerged.

PolitiFact New Jersey will leave others to debate ""after-birth abortion."" We decided to look only at Smith’s claim about the number of abortions.

First, let’s note that some abortion rights supporters contest using words such as babies and children in describing unborn fetuses. Jeff Sagnip, Smith’s public policy director, dismissed that argument, saying ""to object to the use of the term ‘babies’ in this context is out of step with common use.""

And it’s clear Smith was referencing the number of abortions since 1973, so that’s what we are fact-checking here.

Sagnip referred us to a report from the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion, that claims there have been more than 54.5 million abortions through 2011.

The committee’s total is based on data collected by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that advocates on issues of sexual and reproductive health.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also collect data on abortions, but states aren’t required to report to the federal agency so the numbers are incomplete in some years. And people on both sides of the abortion debate largely consider the Guttmacher Institute the authority for this type of data.

The institute has tracked roughly 49.3 million abortions through 2008 from surveys of abortion providers.

The National Right to Life Committee estimates the total through 2011 by assuming the number of abortions in 2008 -- about 1.2 million -- stayed  the same. That puts the total near 53 million, a reasonable estimate, according to a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute.

But the committee also adds 3 percent for a possible under-reporting rate, which pushes the total above 54 million.

The Guttmacher Institute found its 1992 survey overlooked some small providers and suggested that the number of abortions was actually between 3 percent and 4 percent more than reported. In its most recent report, the institute said: ""undercounting has likely become more pronounced over the last decade"" because of early medication abortions at facilities that don’t offer surgical abortions.

Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said the Guttmacher Institute ""acknowledges the potential underreporting in our abortion reporting, but we do not adjust the figures to account for underreporting. Rather, we report the actual number of abortions that are reported to us, so we are confident in this figure. We then acknowledge the level of potential underreporting in the reporting of those data.""

Our ruling

Smith said that since 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roe v. Wade, there’s been ""well over"" 54 million abortions.

The Guttmacher Institute has tracked roughly 49.3 million abortions through 2008. If the recent trend of about 1.2 million abortions per year holds true through 2011, it’s reasonable to assume the total is now close to 53 million. Even by that figure, Smith is close.

The Guttmacher Institute acknowledges the potential for underreporting in its data, but does not adjust its figures. The statistic Smith cites relies entirely on the Guttmacher  Institute data, except it adds 3 percent to adjust for the potential underreporting -- a calculation the institute doesn’t support.

Either way, both totals through 2011 are subject to projections and estimates, and for that reason we rate this claim Mostly True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Barry Hinckley']","
GOP Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says 27,000 Rhode Island jobs depend on trade with Canada
","
Benjamin ""Barry"" Hinckley III, the Republican candidate challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, recently criticized Whitehouse's vote in support of President Obama's decision to delay approval of the Keystone XL pipeline between Canada and Texas.

The $7.6-billion pipeline would bring crude oil from oil sand deposits in Canada to American refineries and, supporters say, create thousands of private-sector jobs.

In a March 12 news release, Hinckley said the pipeline would not cost taxpayers anything and would ""strengthen economic ties with our ally Canada.""

""According to Hinckley, the impact is not just on Mid-Western construction jobs but also on jobs right here in Rhode Island,"" the news release said. ""More than 27,000 Rhode Island jobs depend on trade with Canada, and Rhode Island sells more to Canada than to the state’s next six largest export markets combined.""

The debate over the Keystone pipeline extends from Alberta to Washington, D.C. But one question hits close to home: Does Rhode Island really have 27,000 jobs that depend on trade with Canada?

We asked Hinckley what he based that statement on, and his campaign’s executive director referred us to a fact sheet from the Canadian government. The document’s first sentence states that ""27,600 jobs in Rhode Island depend on Canada-U.S. trade.""

The document also features a photo of Governor Chafee and Patrick G. Binns, Canada’s consul general to New England, and mentions two Rhode Island businesses owned by Canadian firms: Ocean State Power, in Burrillville, owned by the TransCanada Corporation, and TD Bank, a subsidiary of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has four Rhode Island branches.

And it states, ""In 2010, bilateral trade flows worth $1.4 billion and 27,600 state jobs created by that trade helped to promote strong ties between Rhode Island and Canada. The state’s largest foreign market was Canada, which purchased about 30 percent of Rhode Island’s world-wide exports, more than the state’s next six largest foreign trading partners (Mexico, Germany, Turkey, China, Singapore and the United Kingdom) combined. The tourism account added another $36 million to local economies on both sides of the border.""

So, Hinckley’s news release quoted the Canadian government document almost verbatim.

But we wondered where the jobs number actually came from.

We contacted Hani Nasser, deputy spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., who said that every couple of years the Canadian government hires economists and trade experts to produce a study of U.S.-Canada trade. He said updated figures will come out in a few weeks, but he provided the latest study, which was published in 2010 and uses 2008 data.

The 22-page study reports that total U.S. trade with Canada ""generated U.S. output worth $470 billion in 2008.""

So what about jobs? ""We estimate that 8 million net U.S. jobs, or 4.4 percent of total U.S. employment in 2008, depend on trade with Canada,"" the study says.

What about Rhode Island jobs? A table provides a state-by-state breakdown, attributing 27,648 Rhode Island jobs to trade with Canada in 2008. ""These jobs include those directly involved in export to and imports from Canada, as well as supporting jobs in states with little or no direct trade with Canada,"" the report says.

And what is the source of those state-by-state jobs figures? ""Authors’ estimates,"" the table says.

The authors -- economists Laura M. Baughman and Joseph Francois, who head a consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. -- explain in the study that they arrived at those estimates using a model ""commonly used to estimate the economy-wide and the sector-specific impact of trade policy changes.""

They say they analyzed what would happen if U.S. trade with Canada stopped to derive ""output and employment"" that exists only because of the trade. Then, they break it down state by state.

We wondered whether anyone in Rhode Island had an actual count of jobs that depend on trade with Canada.

""We don’t have data we would need to verify this,"" said Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. But she referred to Bryant University’s Chafee Center for International Business.

The Chafee Center’s associate director, A. Ray Thomas, said he knew of no such tally. But he said, ""Since it came from consul general of Canada, that’s certainly a credible source."" And he said, ""That’s the way jobs are calculated. It’s no different than how the government estimates how many jobs are created by the federal stimulus. They use formulas.""

The estimate does not mean that 27,000 Rhode Islanders work for Canadian companies, Thomas said. Rather, those people might be working for companies that, for example make jewelry sold in Canada or businesses that benefit from Canadian tourists, he said. He provided a table showing that Canada is, by far, the leading recipient of Rhode Island exports, followed by Germany, Mexico, Turkey and China.

Our ruling 

Hinckley’s news release cited almost verbatim a statistic from a Canadian government fact sheet, based on a study by economists.

Hinckley didn’t mention that the figure is an estimate, rather than an actual tally.

But local experts say they know of no such tally and economists often make these kinds of estimates in analyzing trade and employment issues.

So we rate Hinckley’s claim True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/18/barry-hinckley/gop-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-27000-rho/

Barack Obama film says health care law aided 17 million kids with pre-existing conditions
","
A new film from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign makes the case that his health care law has expanded coverage and stopped insurance companies from denying benefits to people because of previous illnesses.

We’re checking several claims from the film, including this one, that ""17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition.""

It’s true that the law prohibits excluding children with pre-existing conditions from private health insurance, effective six months following enactment. (Adults with pre-existing conditions get new protections that aren’t as strong.)

We found problems with both the number of children affected by this provision and by how that number is used.

The number

It comes from an analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services. It used a list of serious health conditions to create two estimates of how many Americans would run into trouble with private insurers in the individual market if they ever needed to obtain insurance after a break in coverage.

The first and more limited estimate counts the people who would likely be denied coverage outright if the new health care law is overturned (or was never passed). The second and more expansive estimate adds cases in which the applicant might be offered a more expensive policy or one that excludes the pre-existing condition in question.

In the big picture, the study found that ""as many as 82 million Americans with employer-based coverage have a pre-existing condition, ranging from life-threatening illnesses like cancer to chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma, or heart disease.""

Specifically looking at children, the study found that for the more limited definition -- one that would be expected to result in outright exclusion from coverage -- would affect 5 percent of minors. The broader definition, which could include policies that cover everything but the pre-existing condition or full coverage for a higher price, would affect 24 percent of children.

""Translating these percentages into numbers of people, there are 4 to 17 million children under age 18 with some type of pre-existing condition,"" the HHS analysis said. So the film is cherry-picking the high end of that range.

It’s also worth noting that the film has stripped some important context from this number. The film said that due to the new health care law, ""17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition."" That’s the higher of the two figures -- by a factor of more than four -- and one that includes cases in which the child isn’t actually denied, but in which the family has to pay higher premiums. For those situations, it’s not really accurate to say that they’ve been ""denied"" coverage, but rather that they are forced to pay more for coverage.

How the number is used

The phrasing the film uses -- ""17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition"" -- is open to interpretation.

To watch the film, it’s easy to think that 17 million children have been freed from the shackles of pre-existing conditions and are now able to purchase coverage as a result of the law. But that’s not what the statistics used to back up this claim actually say. Most of those 17 million children already have insurance.

The HHS study sampled the national U.S. population -- both insured and uninsured -- and looked at how many Americans in various age groups would be at risk of having a pre-existing condition that would pose barriers in the insurance market if they were currently uninsured and were seeking insurance on the individual market.

For various reasons, including access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, the number of children nationally who were both (a) uninsured before the passage of the law, and (b) had a pre-existing condition that posed a barrier to their obtaining insurance is almost certainly a whole lot lower than 17 million. And it’s probably a whole lot lower than 4 million, too.

We couldn’t find precise figures on this, but we can triangulate a bit.

The same study says that ""the number of people who both have a pre-existing condition and are uninsured ranges from 9 to 25 million -- or as much as 46 percent of the uninsured. Among non-elderly people with some type of pre-existing condition, about one in five, or 19 percent, is uninsured.""

Apply that percentage to the range of estimates and you get 760,000 to 3.2 million children who are uninsured due to pre-existing conditions.

But even those estimates are probably too high. The likelihood of having a problematic pre-existing condition is not equal for all ages.

According to the same study, children have pre-existing conditions either at one-fifth the rate of the population at large (using the first, narrower measurement) or one-third the rate of the population at large (using the second, broader measurement).

If you multiply these rates by our previous estimate of uninsured children with pre-existing conditions, the numbers fall further -- to 160,000 on the low end and 1.1 million on the high end. That's a lot lower than 17 million.

One additional point. The study argues -- and we wouldn’t deny -- that in the absence of the law, pre-existing conditions would be a big problem for people who ""become self-employed, take a job with a company that does not offer coverage, or experience a change in life circumstance, such as divorce, retirement, or moving to a different state.""

But the film would have been more accurate if it had described the impact of the law as offering a backstop for people who have pre-existing conditions, whether they have no coverage or if they for any reason lose or give up their coverage in the future.

Our ruling

We find this claim problematic on several levels. While the law does serve as a backstop for those at risk of being denied coverage, the film cites the higher of two equally plausible estimates, cherry-picking a number that’s more than four times as high as the smaller estimate. And it glosses over a key difference: The study focused on people who could potentially be helped by the law if they found themselves uninsured in the future, not on those who actually were uninsured and were blocked from getting coverage by pre-existing conditions today. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-says-health-care-law-aided-17-mi/

Barack Obama film touts coverage for 2.5 million young Americans
","
The Road We’ve Traveled -- a 17-minute film from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign -- touts his achievements in health care, saying that the Affordable Care Act has substantially expanded coverage for millions of Americans.

We’re checking several claims from the film, including one that ""2.5 million young adults now have coverage.""

The law requires insurers to provide dependent coverage for children up to age 26 on all policies. The goal is to prevent young adults from becoming uninsured when their parental or college plans would otherwise run out. This provision took effect in September 2010.

We found support for the film’s statistic in a Health and Human Services analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey, a longstanding survey conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey found an 8.3 percentage point increase in insurance coverage for the 19-to-25 age group between the third quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2011 -- from 64.4 percent to 72.7 percent. The analysis then multiplied 8.3 percent by 29.7 million -- the number of people nationally in that age group -- to come up with the number 2.5 million.

We’ll note that the original CDC study, using slightly different methodology, found a smaller number. Using annual and semi-annual figures rather than quarterly numbers, the number grew by 1.3 million.

The HHS analysis makes the case that, for various technical reasons, its method is superior. We think both estimates are reasonable, and while the 2.5 million figure got more traction in the media, we also think it’s worth noting that the underlying federal study offers an alternative -- and smaller -- number. In essence, the film cherry-picks the higher number. So the statement is accurate but needs clarification, which fits our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-touts-coverage-25-million-young-/

Did Oregon add 9,000 state workers while revenue dropped by $4 billion?
","
PolitiFact Oregon enjoys receiving the newsletters of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point. He’s written about China, federal timber reimbursements, and most usually, state spending. He is co-chairman with Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, of the House side of the Joint Ways and Means Committee.

Richardson’s newsletters often include statements worthy of a fact check, such as this one about state workers receiving a catch-up raise in 1981. (Inflation was so high then it wasn’t really a catch-up.) A recent newsletter made us wonder, once again, about the size of state government:

""The rising costs of state payroll expenses must be brought in line with the state’s revenue resources. According to Public Employment Retirement System (PERS) records, in 2006 Oregon had 38,000 employees and by 2011 the number of employees had increased to 47,000,"" he wrote. ""Oregon finds itself in a conundrum. While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion.""

Numbers. Drool. Are those employee figures correct? Did the revenue forecast really drop by $4 billion? And, most importantly, is it fair to juxtapose the two?

Richardson said in a voicemail left at PolitiFact Oregon Central that Democrats built a government that we can no longer afford. ""They expand government because their philosophy is that government can help more people,"" he said. ""Mine is that that may be true, but you run out of money after a while.""

In his newsletter, Richardson cited the Public Employees Retirement System, which produces a report every year that lists the number of employees for public employers in Oregon. Richardson correctly cites the numbers attributed to the State of Oregon.

But we decided to go further, because we’ve always been puzzled by the number of workers in state government.

We pulled figures from the retirement system, and also from the Department of Administrative Services, which handles the executive branch of state government, and the Oregon University System. We tried to get the best apples-to-apples comparison, asking the agencies to weed out temporary workers and to focus on people eligible for retirement.

We came up with a very odd table. 
See the problem? If you add the executive branch and higher education numbers, the number of employees increased 9 percent, or nearly 4,000 people from fiscal year 2006 to 2011. If you look at the retirement system figures, it increased 23 percent, or by 8,800 people.   

Also, note that the 2005-06 retirement system number is much lower than that provided by the executive department and university system. Part of the reason for the discrepancy, says PERS spokesman David Crosley, is because university employees can opt for another retirement plan. Otherwise, he said the agency could not not explain the difference in growth.

Let’s turn to the revenue shortfall. Richardson is correct that the revenue that the state estimated it would bring in dropped by $4 billion in that time, from $19.2 billion in March 2008 to $14.8 billion today.

But we also want to point out that for all of 2007 and much of 2008, the forecast hovered around $19 billion. The forecast released in November 2008 was the first to show a drop, and then revenue tumbled from bad to worse.

The executive branch went up, then down, in hiring from mid-2008 to mid-2011, with an overall growth of 0.3 percent. The real increase was in the number of university employees over the same period, 6 percent growth.

Why? Well, when jobs are scarce, more students go to school. And when more students enroll, colleges and universities need more people to teach. That 6 percent growth in hiring corresponded with an enrollment growth from 86,500 to 96,960. (The Office of Economic Analysis has detailed posts on the topic.)

And while some of these new hires may end up in Oregon’s retirement system, remember that they’re financed in large part by student tuition, which isn’t state tax money.   

Finally, we’re going to throw one last batch of numbers at you, this time from the Legislative Fiscal Office, which tracks all branches of state government as well as the universities. 
We give you this additional information not to make your head hurt, but to give you different ways of viewing growth in state government. The increase in ""full-time equivalent"" budgeted positions is 5 percent, which is not as high as the 23 percent growth recorded by PERS.

We contacted Richardson one last time, and shared our findings. He said he doesn’t have insider information as to why some numbers are higher or lower. But it doesn’t matter to him. The larger point holds: Government is not doing enough to limit costs when revenue is down. State universities, he said, could use technology and other tools to deliver classes more efficiently rather than increase tuition.

""They should not be doing more of the same,"" he said.

We can’t fault Richardson for using one set of figures to highlight growth, even though other sets suggest the growth has not been as steep. For some taxpayers, that we have more than 48,000 employees in state government and state universities is probably horrifying enough.

Richardson’s underlying point that employment grew during a recession is accurate. In fact, the number of state and university employees is higher than that reported by the retirement system, as of June 30, 2011.

But we downgrade our ruling for two reasons.

The university system, state executive branch, and legislative fiscal office do not report the same magnitude in employee growth that’s reported by the retirement system. The 2005-06 starting point is low when compared with the other sources. We’ve asked the retirement system to explain, and they cannot find an answer.

Also, if some of the increase can be attributed to increased demand at state universities -- where students in large part pay for the new hires --  it seems unfair to blame it all on Democrats’ inability to save. At the very least, that’s an important detail readers should know.

For those reasons, we find his statement that the state added 9,000 employees while revenue dropped $4 billion to be partially accurate, but missing important details. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/16/dennis-richardson/did-oregon-add-9000-state-workers-while-revenue-dr/

Rep. Frank Wolf says fewer workers are supporting more Social Security beneficiaries
","
U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf said the longevity of Americans is placing a strain on Social Security.

""In 1950, the average American lived for 68 years and 16 workers supported one retiree. Today, the average life expectancy is 78 and three workers support one retiree,"" Wolf said on Feb. 17 before voting against a 10-month extension of the Social Security payroll tax credit.

We wondered whether Wolf was correct about the life expectancy tallies and the ratio of the number workers supporting each Social Security recipient.

Let’s start with life expectancy:  A 2006 Congressional Research Service report said that from 1949 to 1951, the U.S. life expectancy was 68.1 years. The most recent data from the Centers for Disease control show that in 2010, the average life expectancy was 78.7 years old. So Wolf is right on this front.  

What about the numbers of workers supporting a Social Security recipient?

Dan Scandling, Wolf’s spokeman, pointed to an April 2011 fact-check from our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia that examined a similar claim made by Mark Warner, D-Va., about the worker-to-retiree ratio in 1950 compared with today.

The story referenced historical data from the 2010 Social Security Trustees report. We looked at the latest trustees report from 2011 to get the ratio of workers to retirees on Social Security.

In 1950, there were 48.28 million workers paying into the system and 2.93 million receiving benefits. That works out to 16.5 employees for every Social Security recipient back then. In 2011, the latest year in which data was available, there were 157.8 million workers paying into Social Security and nearly 55 million receiving benefits. That comes to 2.9 workers for every retiree, close to Wolf’s number.

The decline in the ratio is driven by a number of factors.

Henry Aaron, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in the early years of the system, many workers such as farmers and state and local employees weren’t eligible to receive benefits. Over the decades, more people from more professions have been admitted into the system. In the 1950s and 1960s, the eligibility age to receive Social Security payments was lowered from 65 to 62.

And basic demographics are at play.

""The ratio changed because Americans are living longer and retiring earlier,"" Bob Pozen, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said in an e-mail. ""Moreover, the baby boomers -- a big demographic wave -- are starting to retire.""

The Social Security Administration, in its 2011 trustees report, projected that unless changes are made, trust funds supporting the system will be exhausted in 2036 and full benefits would no longer be paid on a timely basis.

That doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to deal with the projected shortfall.

For the system to remain whole for the next 75 years, the Social Security Administration suggests the payroll tax into the system could be increased, benefits could be reduced, or some combination of the two approaches could be implemented.

Our ruling

Wolf said that 60 years ago, the average life expectancy was 68 years at a time when 16 workers supported each retiree on Social Security. Today, he said, the life expectancy is 78 and three workers support one retiree.

He’s right on the numbers and highlighting a demographic challenge the Social Security Administration acknowledges is placing greater demands on the system.

David Rivera ""allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act,"" said Luis Garcia
","
Members of Congress are generally wealthier than the people they represent, and some leave office with fatter bank accounts than when they started. Could their growing riches be a result of access to special information that allowed them to make lucrative trades in the stock market?

Those were questions that 60 Minutes tackled in a November 2011 report inspire by the book Throw Them All Out, by Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The book’s thesis is that members of Congress are using inside information to buy and sell stocks at a profit, using advantages that ordinary investors don’t have.

The 60 Minutes report helped breathe life into a bill largely ignored by Congress for years, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act. Suddenly, nearly everyone in Congress was in support of banning themselves from insider trading. The Senate and House passed different versions in February.

Bipartisanship at its best? Hardly.

Democrats argue that the legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House is too watered down. That argument has reverberated down to a Florida congressional race.

Luis Garcia, a Miami Beach state representative and a Democrat, is trying to unseat U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami. In a Feb. 15, 2012, press release, Garcia attacked Rivera’s vote on the STOCK Act to suggest that Rivera is soft on public corruption.

Garcia said Rivera ""allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act that would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit."" We should note that Garcia’s claim was similar to claims in a press release sent by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just a few days earlier.

Rivera is the subject of a criminal probe by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service related to $510,000 in undisclosed payments from a gambling enterprise to a company owned by his mother. 

Here, we will fact-check Garcia’s claim that Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act about public corruption and on those who peddle insider information. In a related report, we will check another claim from Garcia, that Rivera received a $5,000 contribution from U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., who is under a House ethics investigation related to his stock trades.

Roots of the STOCK Act

Insider trading is illegal for everyone, including members of Congress -- even without the STOCK Act. But independent investigations by journalists and academics show suspicious patterns of trading by members of Congress. Fueled in particular by the 60 Minutes report, members wanted to pass legislation specifically for Congress, so there is no uncertainty about the matter.

While newspaper articles have often focused on the trades of individual politicians, some believe the problem could be more widespread. Alan Ziobrowski, a business professor at Georgia State University, found that senators’ purchases outperformed the overall market, according to his 2004 paper on the topic. His research showed ""senators trade with a substantial informational advantage....The results suggest that senators knew when to buy their common stocks and when to sell,"" he wrote.

In testimony about the STOCK Act in December, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement director Robert Khuzami said that under current law pursuing insider-trading charges against a member of Congress, ""is without direct precedent and may present some unique issues."" (Here’s more analysis about the complications of a federal agency investigating Congress.)

In 2006, a version of the STOCK Act was introduced after the Wall Street Journal reported that Tony Rudy, chief of staff to then House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, engaged in hundreds of stock trades from his computer at the Capitol. The bill never received a vote. It was reintroduced in 2007 and 2009 but drew little interest.

Before the 60 Minutes report aired on Nov. 19, 2011, the STOCK Act had nine co-sponsors. After it aired, it got than 200 within a few weeks. Rivera signed on in December.

Fighting over the STOCK Act

It’s at this point, when it looked like the STOCK Act might have an actual chance of passing, that the real battle began.

On Feb. 2, 2012, the Senate approved an amendment calling for the ""public corruption prosecution improvements"" that was intended to give prosecutors more tools to go after corrupt public officials, including stiffer sentences.

The Senate version also included new requirements for ""political intelligence consultants,"" people who monitor actions on the Hill and sell the information to investors. The concern was that the consultants receive nonpublic information from members of Congress, so the Senate required them to disclose their activities the way that lobbyists do. The Senate approved the bill 96-3.

Over in the House, Republican majority leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., unveiled his own version, which stripped out the public corruption amendment and the requirement that political intelligence consultants disclose their activities.

Democrats and watchdog groups criticized Cantor’s bill as weak -- but so did a Republican senator who zeroed in on the elimination of the political consultant provision.

""It’s astonishing and extremely disappointing that the House would fulfill Wall Street’s wishes by killing this provision,"" said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, in a statement. ""If Congress delays action, the political intelligence industry will stay in the shadows, just the way Wall Street likes it.""

Still, House Republicans added new clauses to the bill and said they were strengthening it. They called one of those sections the ""Pelosi provision""; it included stricter rules for members participating in public offerings. The 60 Minutes investigation reported that U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., participated in Visa’s initial public offering while a bill about credit cards was pending.

Several groups that advocate for government transparency have called for a stronger version of the law including the Sunlight Foundation (which called the House version ""STOCK Act Lite"") and Common Cause. 

The House approved their version on Feb. 9 in a vote of 417-2. News reports in early March indicated that the Senate might accept the House’s version of the bill.

Whatever one thinks of the particulars of the House version, its passage might still serve as a warning for Congress about insider trading, said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice who prosecuted securities fraud.

""The real effect of the STOCK Act is to put on notice prominently everyone on Capitol Hill and in the federal government that using material non-public information to buy or sell securities, or to tip off another person to do so, is a violation of federal law, and that they have a duty to keep confidential such information,"" said Frenkel in an email.

Rivera’s role

We asked Garcia directly what he meant by saying Rivera ""allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act."" What did Rivera do specifically that allowed the House version of this legislation to go forward?

By his ""yes"" vote, Rivera allowed it, Garcia said.

""He voted for the law,"" Garcia said. ""If you are voting for that law you are allowing that law to go on.""

We checked to see if Rivera took any public action to encourage a stronger STOCK Act. We searched news reports and Rivera’s office website and could not find anything beyond a single ""week in review"" press release.

Garcia’s statement -- that Rivera ""allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act"" -- makes it sounds like Rivera had some sort of power to stop Republican leaders from recrafting the bill, perhaps thanks to a committee post or close ties to leadership. In fact, that’s not the case. Rivera doesn’t have any powerful committee role connected to the act and is a member of separate House committees on foreign affairs and natural resources.

Meanwhile, Cantor has kept his distance from Rivera at times. In 2011, a Cantor spokesman said Cantor had concerns about investigations into Rivera. When Cantor held a fundraiser in Miami in February 2011, Rivera wasn’t in attendance.

Our ruling

Garcia claimed that ""Congressman David Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act that would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit."" 
It’s true that Rivera voted for a version of the bill that removed provisions related to corruption of public officials and on political intelligence consultants. But Garcia doesn’t offer any evidence that Rivera ""allowed"" it to happen other than voting for it. The statement makes it sound like Rivera had some sort of powerful role in making the legislation coming to pass. Actually, Rivera himself is under investigation -- and not exactly the guy House leaders would turn to when crafting legislation about ethics.

David Rivera took a $5,000 donation from Spencer Bachus who is under investigation, says Luis Garcia
","
Miami Beach state Rep. Luis Garcia says that U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, took money from a peer accused of insider trading.

""Last week, Congressman David Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act that would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit. Rivera has received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading, and whose behavior is the target of the STOCK Act,"" said Garcia, a Democrat, in a Feb. 15 campaign press release. 
In a related report about whether Rivera ""allowed"" Republican leaders to soften the bill, we examined in detail the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which passed the Senate and House in February. Although insider trading by members of Congress is already illegal, the STOCK Act is a response to newspaper reports and academic research that raise suspicions that politicians on Capitol Hill use their unique access to information to make lucrative trades.

The bill is intended to make it crystal clear that members can’t inside trade, and it requires them to disclose their transactions within 30 to 45 days.

In this item, we will explore whether Rivera received a $5,000 contribution from Bachus, who is under investigation for insider trading.

For questions about the campaign donation, Rivera’s congressional office spokeswoman referred us to a generic email address for Rivera’s campaign, and we did not get a reply. We also tried to reach Rivera directly but were unsuccessful.

First, some background about Rivera. A longtime state legislator, Rivera was elected to Congress in 2010 and now faces re-election in 2012. Rivera is the subject of a criminal probe by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service related to $510,000 in undisclosed payments from a former dog track to a company owned by his mother.

The press release noted that Rivera received a contribution in 2010 from Bachus’ Growth and Prosperity Political Action Committee. The PAC’s report filed with the Federal Election Commission showed that it gave to multiple congressional campaigns, including $5,000 to Rivera’s congressional campaign on May 13, 2010 (Rivera’s FEC report shows that he received the donation June 24, 2010.)

The Center for Responsive Politics shows a summary of donations by Bachus’ Growth and Prosperity PAC -- it spent about $724,000, for the 2010 cycle. The contribution to Rivera’s campaign was not among the top recipients or vendors.

In November 2011, 60 Minutes aired a report inspired by the book Throw Them All Out, by Peter Schweizer, which cast a spotlight on Bachus, R-Ala., and his trades during the 2008 financial crisis. 
""While Congressman Bachus was publicly trying to keep the economy from cratering, he was privately betting that it would, buying option funds that would go up in value if the market went down,"" the 60 Minutes report stated. ""He would make a variety of trades and profited at a time when most Americans were losing their shirts.""

The Washington Post reported on Feb. 9, 2012, that the Office of Congressional Ethics had launched an investigation of Bachus, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, over possible violations of insider-trading laws. Bachus ""has been a frequent trader on Capitol Hill, buying stock options while overseeing the nation’s banking and financial services industries,"" the Post stated, explaining that it was the first investigation of its kind of a member of Congress. The Post wrote that the OCE has found probable cause that insider-trading violations have occurred.

The Post report was based on anonymous sources, which we cannot independently confirm or refute. However, we’ve seen nothing that refutes the Post’s key findings. And Bachus himself released a statement on the matter.

""I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight,"" Bachus said in a statement. ""I respect the congressional ethics process. I have fully abided by the rules governing members of Congress and look forward to the full exoneration this process will provide.""

Among the examples cited in the Post article: On Sept. 18, 2008, Bachus participated in a closed-door briefing with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. Paulson wrote in a book that they discussed the high likelihood of decline across the entire economy if drastic steps weren’t taken, but Bachus denied that he received any insider information. The next day Bachus made trades that earned him profits.

""The Office of Congressional Ethics has requested information and I welcome this opportunity to present the facts and set the record straight,"" Bachus said in a statement quoted in the Post report. Bachus’ spokesman did not respond to PolitiFact Florida.

Facing a primary challenge on March 13 (which Bachus won), Bachus defended himself in an ad in which he blamed ""liberal Washington reporters"" and ""Obama’s Democratic allies"" and claimed that ""news reports are clear. The attacks are false."" The ad shows a headline from The Hill which quoted a former federal judge and SEC head, tapped by Bachus to review the allegations, as saying that he is innocent. Two former SEC chairman also said in a guest editorial that the allegations are ""laughable."" 

""If Mr. Bachus attended a meeting in which the troubled state of the economy (and how to deal with it) was discussed, that hardly was a state secret at the time of the meeting. Moreover, immediately after the meeting, the organizers disclosed what had been discussed,"" stated the editorial.

So Bachus’ PAC gave money to Rivera’s campaign in May 2010 for a race he won that year, and nearly three years later the Washington Post reported that Bachus was under investigation.

Our ruling

Garcia said that ""Rivera has received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading."" 
Technically, the donation came from Bachus’ PAC and not Bachus as an individual, but that isn’t a key difference in this case. More significantly, the donation was made in 2010, years before news broke about the recent investigation. We should also note that although Bachus has acknowledged providing information to the ethics office, their findings have not been made public. Obviously, we don’t know what its findings will be. But in a literal sense, Garcia’s claim about the donation is accurate. But it omits the additional information that the donation was made before Bachus was under investigation.

Texas Democratic Party says Texas has 668 Latino elected Democrats, 60 elected Latino Republicans
","
Heads up: Another Bush is raising his profile.

As noted in a March 3, 2012, Texas Tribune news article, attorney George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, has been pitching afresh for a group he helped found, the Hispanic Republicans of Texas.

""Politics is in my blood,"" the Tribune story quotes Bush as saying in a story about the group's political action committee.

But Rebecca Acuña, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, sounded skeptical of the PAC’s chances of helping Republican Hispanics advance. Acuña told the Tribune: ""They are delusional if they think they’re making any inroads with Latinos. In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party.""

Do Hispanic Democratic elected officials so greatly outnumber their Latino Republican counterparts in Texas?

Looked entirely like it -- at first.

To our inquiry, Acuña sent us portions of a 2011 directory of Latino elected officials compiled by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which describes itself as the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials.

The chart provided by Acuña says that of 2,520 Hispanic elected officials in Texas in January 2011, 668 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans, matching the figures aired to the Tribune. Two school board members were counted as Independents.

According to the chart, 496 elected Latino officials in Texas held nonpartisan offices, mainly serving in municipal government or on school boards, and another 1,294 Latino elected officials, also mostly serving on school boards or in municipal offices, were listed as ""no party stated.""

And how does NALEO gather all this?

A methodology section of the 2011 directory says the NALEO Educational Fund has regularly attempted to tabulate Latino elected officials since 1984. For the 2011 check, NALEO staff contacted each identified official by phone or fax to ask whether they were indeed Latino, the group says.

""The phone verification process proved invaluable,"" the methodology section says. ""Many individuals having Spanish surnames were in fact, not Latino. Conversely, other individuals with non-Spanish surnames were identified as being Latino.""

Rosalind Gold, a senior director for the NALEO Educational Fund, told us in a telephone interview that how officeholders self-identify has proved pivotal. ""We very much rely on self-identification in determining who is and who is not Latino,"" Gold said.

By email, Martha Recio, a NALEO research assistant, confirmed the figures cited for 2011.

At our request, NALEO also composed a chart showing its identified party breakdowns for Texas Latino elected officials for 2001 through 2011.

The group’s determinations of party affiliations have been incomplete because, Gold told us, so many local offices are filled in non-partisan elections; such candidates do not run as party nominees. In each of the years, at least 68 percent of the Latino elected officials tabulated by NALEO were not identified by party affiliation.

Also, Gold said, if the group could not verify an officeholder’s party membership by telephoning their office, it did not attempt to do so by tapping other sources. NALEO doesn’t have resources to do that, she said. Sometimes, too, Gold said, an officeholder declined to discuss his or her party membership.

We asked Gold if it’s fair to make comparisons limited to its counts of Republican and Democratic Latino elected officials when most of the group’s identified Latino elected officials are not identified by party. Gold replied that this is the kind of context NALEO provides when discussing its counts. ""We say that of the elected officials we were able to verify affiliation for, here is the party breakdown,"" she said.

Back to the Texas counts: Among officeholders tabulated as Democrats or Republicans, the share of Democratic elected officeholders dropped from 32 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2010 before reaching nearly 27 percent in 2011. The relative share of Latino Republican officeholders was .7 percent in 2001, escalating to .9 percent in 2010 and 2.4 percent in 2011, according to the group.

With so many party affiliations not nailed down, we wouldn’t blame anyone for ruling out comparisons of results for different years. That misgiving aside, though, it looks like the ratio of elected Hispanic Democrats to Republican Latinos in Texas has narrowed. The NALEO counts suggest there were nearly 45 Hispanic Texas Democrats per Republican counterpart in 2001, 34 in 2005 and 11 in 2011.

Our ruling

The Texas Democratic Party’s spokeswoman correctly cited two figures from the 2011 NALEO directory suggesting that Latino elected Democrats in Texas greatly outnumber their Republican counterparts.

Still, this claim is missing substantive context -- that NALEO did not determine the party memberships of most Latino Texas officeholders. If this were done, the Democratic-Republican ratio might change.

Pat Boone says IPAB rations care to pay for 'wasteful' spending
","
Pat Boone is best known for his hits of the 1950s like ""Love Letters in the Sand"" and ""I Almost Lost My Mind."" But the song he’s been singing lately about Medicare is turning into a moldy oldie.

Granted, Boone doesn’t literally sing in the ads he’s done as national spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, a conservative political group that focuses on older Americans. But he’s got distortions of the 2010 health care law on high rotation.

The latest ads feature Boone criticizing prominent Democrats who supported the health care law, including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson.

Here’s part of Boone’s criticism; it focuses on the law’s Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB:

""This IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending. Your choices could be limited and you may not be able to keep your own doctor. ... Washington politicians, like Bill Nelson, are ignoring the problem, putting their own re-elections first. Call Sen. Nelson. Urge him to support real Medicare reform and protect our seniors.""

The ad makes several claims, but here, we’re going to specifically fact-check Boone’s claim that the IPAB ""can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending.""

The 2010 health care law created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unwilling or unable to slow the increasing costs of Medicare, the federal program that pays for seniors’ health care. In years past, growing Medicare spending has been an ongoing concern of the federal government, as well as analysts on the left and the right.

Under the health care reform law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed pre-set targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendations within a set time, IPAB’s recommendations automatically go into effect. (For a more detailed explanation of how this would work, we recommend this April 2011 report from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation.)

We should emphasize here that IPAB recommendations would not apply to any particular individual, but would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given Boone’s rhetoric, some people could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case.

Still, the IPAB has become one of the more contentious points of the health care law; even some members of Congress who voted for the overall health care law don’t like the IPAB. Recently, Congress held hearings on repealing the board.

The hearings were organized by opponents of the IPAB, but people who testified raised concerns that IPAB’s powers are so limited that it’s only real recourse is to reduce payments for doctors and other health care providers, and that could up putting pressure on patient care. We should note that these concerns are also present under the current system, in which Congress takes a more active role.

Boone calls the members of the IPAB ""15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats."" Rather than career government workers, the law says IPAB members shall include people with national recognition for health care expertise, including ""different  professionals, broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural representatives."" (Board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.) On the point of accountability, we’ll just repeat that Congress retains the power to overrule any IPAB recommendations, though there are special rules in place so that the recommendations cannot be filibustered or otherwise delayed. 

The IPAB has restrictions on what it can recommend in the name of cost savings. It can’t raise rates, drop beneficiaries or ration care. Here’s the exact language from the law itself:

""The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.""

Boone says the IPAB seeks to reduce Medicare spending so the government can spend money on other ""wasteful"" things. But the IPAB is intended to slow Medicare spending if its growth exceeds pre-defined targets. It’s also capped on how much it can reduce spending: It can recommend measures to bring Medicare within specific cost-savings targets and no more.

The board was created to address rapid health care inflation. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize that as a problem. Conservatives have their own plans to limit Medicare costs, primarily by moving Medicare to private insurance companies and giving seniors voucher-like premium support to help buy health coverage. We’ve debunked attacks on their ideas, too.

When we asked for back-up for the ad’s claims, a public relations firm for the 60 Plus Association sent us links to generic news coverage that didn’t prove the ad’s claims. We also asked the ad’s target for comment; a spokesman for Nelson made the point that the IPAB claims have been widely debunked.

We’ll strike up the band here to play our favorite song: Be very cautious when you hear political ads with scare tactics concerning Medicare. The distortions abound on all sides.

Our ruling

Boone said, ""This IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending."" Actually, the law specifically states that the board cannot ration care. The board doesn’t look at individual patients or deny individual treatments. Instead, it makes system-wide recommendations to rein in the future growth of Medicare spending, and it makes those recommendations within limited parameters. It also was created to stop runaway spending growth within the Medicare program itself, not to divert money to other budget items.

Democrats say more than 1 million signatures were submitted to recall GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker
","
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin declared on Jan. 17, 2012 that it had submitted to the state elections board more than 1 million signatures on petitions to recall Republican Gov. Scott Walker.

That figure -- far exceeding the 540,208 signatures of ""eligible electors"" needed to force Walker into a recall election -- was proudly proclaimed by Democratic chairman Mike Tate in an online video.

""I can announce that your grassroots movement, right now, is delivering to the Government Accountability Board over 1 million signatures collected to recall Scott Walker,"" he said. ""This represents nearly double, or 185 percent, of the total required. It is simply breathtaking.""

The party said it had submitted more than 1 million signatures even after removing an undisclosed number that were duplicates, illegible or seemingly fake.

It repeatedly cited the figure, including at a news conference, in a blog post and in statements. So did other groups such as United Wisconsin, which participated in the signature gathering, and the web site RecallScottWalker.com.

So did commentators and reporters.

But until the Government Accountability Board reviewed the petitions, there was no official account of just how many signatures had been submitted.

The key question, of course, is whether there are 540,208 valid signatures. The board is continuing its review, although even Republicans expect there will be enough valid signatures for a Walker recall election to be held later in 2012.

Nevertheless, many readers have asked us about the eye-popping 1 million claim, noting that it has become an awful catchy shorthand for success.

On March 12, 2012, the Government Accountability Board announced that 931,042 signatures had been submitted to recall Walker.

That’s a lot of signatures, but not 1 million.

On the day the GAB announced its official figure, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter asked state Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski in an email why there was a difference of nearly 69,000 between the number of signatures the party announced and the number counted by the elections board.

Zielinski replied he didn’t know, then backtracked, calling the ""over 1 million"" claim an estimate.

Said Zielinski: ""Nobody knows how many signatures were submitted because of the sheer volume and the way the signatures were counted in the closing days. That's why we estimated our total.""

But the number was never presented as an estimate.

What’s more, the party and United Wisconsin said they created their own database of the signatures before submitting them to the state board.

(Tea party groups have released what they say is a searchable databases of recall petitions filed against four Republican state senators, and have said they would release one for the Walker. A Journal Sentinel review of a random sampling of 500 Walker recall signatures found that 15 percent of them could not be verified, indicating there still would be enough valid signatures to force an election.)

We emailed Zielinski the day after the state board announced its figure, to see if he had anything more for us to consider.

He said the party stands by its more than 1 million claim, but again called it an estimate. He also said the board’s count doesn't include ""rehabilitated signature affidavits and may not have included thousands of signatures where Rebecca Kleefisch signatures were mixed with Scott Walker signatures.""

The board has counted 842,860 submitted signatures on petitions to recall Kleefisch, the GOP lieutenant governor, in what essentially is a joint effort to remove both Walker and Kleefisch from office.

We asked Government Accountability Board spokesman Reid Magney about Zielinski’s comments.

The board’s count of 931,042 is the ""raw number"" of signatures submitted by the Walker recall committee, Magney said. So, it would include ""rehabilitated"" signatures -- those that were put on a petition that contained a minor flaw and which the Democrats attempted to correct with an affidavit. Because no challenges were filed against any signatures, the GAB staff did not review the correcting affidavits.

As for mixing petitions, Magney said that approximately 200 signatures on Kleefisch recall petitions were mistakenly included with petitions seeking to recall Walker, and they would have been counted in the raw number of Walker signatures, but those signatures would have been later struck by the staff. About 95 Walker recall signatures were mistakenly included with Kleefisch petitions, he said.

Bottom line: Nothing Zielinski cited calls the board’s 931,042 count into question in any serious way. Conversely, he provided no evidence to show that more than 1 million signatures were submitted.
