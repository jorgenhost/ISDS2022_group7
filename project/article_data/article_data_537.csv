Mark Shields: GOP's 2010 statehouse gains eased rules for gun buyers
","If the polls are to be believed, most voters are approaching the upcoming midterm elections with less zest than in the past. Republicans hold the enthusiasm edge over Democrats, but their advantage is about half as big compared to 2010, when they made major gains at the state and federal levels. Still, Republicans are poised to do well and liberal columnist Mark Shields warned about the consequences of GOP victories. ""When the Republicans swept all these statehouses and state legislatures (in 2010), they did two things,"" Shields said on Oct. 10 on PBS’ Newshour. ""They made it easier to buy a gun and tougher to vote."" The part about gun purchases caught a reader’s ear and she asked if Shields had it right, so in this fact-check, we see what happened to the laws about buying guns after 2010. To cut to the chase, relatively modest changes took place in few states. But we found no evidence that Republicans across the country made sweeping changes to make it easier to purchase a firearm. According the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states saw at least one legislative chamber or a governorship shift from Democratic to Republican control. Within that group, we found just three instances of new laws that you could say made it easier to buy a weapon. (There are examples of states relaxing rules on carrying concealed weapons and the places where guns are allowed, but Shields specifically spoke about it being easier to buy guns.) Out of 16 states, only Michigan, Ohio and Florida relaxed some rules on gun purchasing. We'll explain the changes in each state. Changes in Michigan, Ohio and Florida Michigan emerged from 2010 with Republicans in charge of everything -- the governor’s office and both the House and the Senate. With large majorities in both chambers, they did away with the state system of requiring handgun buyers to get a purchase permit. Until then, a person who wanted to buy a handgun had to correctly answer at least seven out of 10 questions on gun safety. If they managed that, they got a card that they could take to a gun dealer and buy a weapon. Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said doing away with the purchase permit made little difference. ""The Brady background check remained in effect,"" Howard said. ""If you didn’t pass the Brady test, they didn’t sell you the gun."" But on a gun owner’s online discussion board, the end of the purchase permit was well received. A Michigan user called ""Mike the Greek"" was surprised to see notice of the relaxed rules in the window of his local gun store. ""Not sure if this is everywhere,  but it sure makes it easier for some people to buy!"" he wrote. Looking around at other states, according to records kept by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Ohio passed a law in 2011 that allowed people convicted of misdemeanor drug offenses to purchase firearms. In the midterm election, Republicans had taken the governor’s office and the Ohio House. In Florida, where the governor’s office also changed hands (from an independent to a Republican), counties were barred from imposing their own waiting periods on firearm purchases. (Most of the discussion in creating the Florida law was centered around where people could carry weapons, not about purchasing firearms.) Experts on both sides agree Laura Cutilletta is senior staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Cutilletta said there was no significant easing of gun buying rules. ""There were certainly some laws that affect purchase, but they are not the majority by any means,"" Cutilletta said. Joseph Olson, a retired professor of law at Hamline University, and former board member of the National Rifle Association, also saw little change. ""A few states made it more difficult in some instances but almost all states did nothing regarding this issue,"" Olson said. Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, told us the same thing. A couple of notes: • In 2012, Virginia repealed the restriction against the purchase of more than one handgun in a 30-day period. However, 2010 had no effect on the party balance of power in Virginia. • A review of state gun laws passed after the December 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., found that states with full Republican controll accounted for nearly three quarters of the changes that enhanced gun rights, mainly easing the rules for carrying weapons. But again, those change are distinct from the rules for buying a gun. Our ruling Shields said that when Republicans took control of state legislatures in 2010 they made it easier to buy a gun. Out of 16 states won by the GOP, three passed laws that relaxed the rules for some gun buyers. The experts we reached said the changes were modest and not as widespread as Shields implied. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD76900>],/factchecks/2014/oct/16/mark-shields/shields-gops-2010-statehouse-gains-eased-rules-gun/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Americans for Prosperity']","
Americans for Prosperity says workers are getting high-paying mining jobs because of Scott Walker
","The state law that aims to help Gogebic Taconite move ahead with an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin stands as one of the most important pieces of legislation passed under Gov. Scott Walker. The bill -- which the company helped shape -- sped up the permitting process and made other changes to state laws to encourage development of the mine, a project billed as potentially bringing thousands of jobs to a sparsely populated part of the state with high unemployment. Gogebic has said that construction of the mine and its related processing plants and infrastructure would create 3,000 jobs. Once operating, the mine would employ about 700 people, with a projected 2,834 total jobs created from related businesses. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group, reminded voters of Walker’s support for the mine in a flier mailed to voters in early October with the headline: ""Wisconsin is back to work."" Next to a image of a mining helmet, the flier states:  ""Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs."" The statement carries a footnote to Senate Bill 1, the mining bill sought by Gogebic and approved by the Republican-held Legislature and Walker in 2013. Taken together, that suggests a boom in jobs related to the iron ore mine. But we heard a different explanation when we asked AFP’s Wisconsin office for backup. ""We didn’t indicate any specific type of job,"" said David Fladeboe, state director for Americans for Prosperity Foundation-Wisconsin. ""We simply stated that the mining economy is allowing folks to get good high-paying jobs."" He added: ""Many jobs have been created both directly and indirectly because of the iron mine and even more have been created thanks to sand mining."" Wait. Sand mining? In addition to the footnote citing the iron mining bill, the mailing specifically cited ""Northern Wisconsin’s mining economy,"" and made no mention of sand mining. Let’s take a closer look. Gogebic moving slowly Let’s start with the iron ore mine, a proposed $1.5 billion project in Iron and Ashland counties. Field work on the sprawling site in the Penokee Hills got underway in early 2014. Roads were built and rock samples were taken. But in August 2014, Gogebic announced a delay. Saying more preliminary work needs to be done, the company pushed filing of its planned application back from spring 2015 to fall 2015. Once an application is filed, state regulators have a year to consider it. And then there are the promises of legal challenges from environmentalists and the Chippewa Indians who oppose the project. So we are early in the process. Even though there’s no mine, some miners -- technically they’re operating engineers who run heavy equipment --  are working at the site, said Gogebic spokesman Bob Seitz. They’re building roads and extracting and crushing rock samples. ""We’ve had maybe 10 operators working up there at any given time,"" said Terry McGowan, president and business manager of Operating Engineers Local 139, the union involved. Those workers are paid about $37 an hour. So that’s 10 miners. To be sure, the mine’s impact would extend beyond those wearing hard hats and would boost other jobs in the local economy. Fladeboe from Americans for Prosperity made that argument in an email exchange with us. Seitz said Gogebic has spent $1.25 million in Iron and surrounding counties so far in 2014. That covers local salaries, consulting fees, motels and lodging, equipment, vehicles, meals, offices and local well drillers and equipment operators. ""From spring through the summer, we averaged over 20 people per day physically on the site,"" Seitz said. The company’s office in Hurley has six workers. He pointed out that ""$1.25 million dollars invested in a county with 5,700 people with household incomes among the lowest in the state supports a lot of jobs."" Sand mining growing In backing his statement, Fladeboe argued there has also been a boom in the number of sand mining jobs in Wisconsin. That wasn’t part of the original claim, but it is accurate. There are sand mines operating in about 20 counties in western and northwestern Wisconsin, and the state Department of Natural Resources says there are now 140 mines, processing plants and rail sites for sand mining in the state. That compares with five mines and five processing plants in 2010, shortly before Walker took office. A study released in September 2014 by environmental groups -- the Civil Society Institute's Boston Action Research, the Environmental Working Group and Madison-based Midwest Environmental Advocates --  predicts that sand mining will continue to grow and perhaps expand to as many as two dozen other counties. The nearest sand mine to the proposed Gogebic mine, though, is about 120 miles south. Did the passage of SB1, which focused on the iron mine, contribute to the sand mining boom? Fladeboe argues yes. But the bill itself doesn’t make any reference to sand mining. Here’s how the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau described it: ""This bill creates new statutes for regulating iron mining and modifies the current laws regulating metallic mining so that they cover only mining for non ferrous minerals."" McGowan, the union leader, said the mining law sent a signal that makes all kinds of mining more acceptable. But he noted ""frac sand mining was taking off before"" the bill was passed. Our rating A direct mail flier from Americans for Prosperity says that ""Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs."" It cites the bill aimed at the iron mine as its evidence. But that mine is far from being constructed or open. About ""maybe 10"" well-paid operating engineers have worked there. To be sure, there’s been a boom in the state’s sand mining industry. But that’s not the subject of the statement. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA82780>],/factchecks/2014/oct/16/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperty-says-workers-are-getting-high-/
"['Corporations', 'Income', 'State Budget', 'Wealth', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Scott Walker's ""tax plan"" favors corporations, rich over average taxpayer, Mary Burke says
","In a Mary Burke TV ad released Oct. 8, 2014, the narrator begins by asking: ""What’s $11 buy you in Wisconsin? How about a pizza?"" Sounds good. We're hungry. Then the ad quickly turns to one of Burke's key campaign themes -- that Gov. Scott Walker favors big business and the well-to-do over average folk. Under Walker's ""tax plan,"" the narrator continues, ""the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year."" The ad ends with ""Scott Walker -- Millions for them, pizza for you."" Doesn't sound quite as tasty any more. Burke’s reference to a ""tax plan"" suggests Walker has had only one, when there have been several measures affecting income and property taxes. And, notably, she expresses each dollar amount differently -- a small per-month figure for the average taxpayer, versus a large lump sum for corporations and a large per-year figure for millionaires. So let’s slice up Burke's claim into its three pieces and see what we have. Average taxpayer: $11 per month When the narrator speaks about the average taxpayer and Walker’s tax plan, a footnote appears on the screen referencing the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, and a date: July 28, 2014. But the footnote doesn’t give the viewer a clear idea of what Burke is citing -- or that it just provides a partial picture. A memo issued by the bureau on that day details two state income cuts signed into law by Walker in 2013. It says a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 to $50,000 will save an average of $133 in 2014. That comes to about $11 per month. Walker’s campaign, meanwhile, noted that the same memo pegs the average savings -- rather than the savings for the average taxpayer -- slightly higher, at $189 per year. That would be about $16 per month. The larger point, however, is that besides income tax cuts, Walker has approved a number of property tax relief measures. These are ignored by Burke, who made a broad claim but then supported it only by citing reductions in one type of tax. When Walker claimed that his various income and property tax cuts amount to $322 in the 2014 tax year for the average family, our rating was Mostly True. That comes to about $27 per month. We found that the income and property tax cuts would save the median-income family at least that much in 2014, although not every average family would save that much, particularly if they are not property owners. Corporations: $610 million Burke overstates the second part of her claim -- that corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. That figure is based on another fiscal bureau memo, which calculates tax savings over Walker’s full four-year term. The memo describes those tax reductions as being ""targeted to businesses,"" not necessarily corporations, which suggests large operations. In other words, some of the tax cuts apply to small businesses as well. For example, $126 million of the $610 million comes from reducing the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Businesses organized like limited liability companies -- whose shareholders pay the firm's tax as personal income tax -- benefit from the reduction. Millionaires: $1,400 per year The third part of Burke’s claim goes back to the 2013 income tax cuts. The fiscal bureau estimated that people with an adjusted gross income of $300,000 or more would see a tax decrease averaging $1,402 in 2014. It’s worth noting that the $133 decrease for what Burke described as the average taxpayer was a reduction of 8 percent, while the the reduction for millionaires is 2.32 percent. And, again, she uses an annual figure for the millionaires, but a monthly one for the average folks. Our rating Burke said that under Walker's ""tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year."" The $11 refers only to income tax cuts, when in fact the typical taxpayer has also enjoyed property tax reductions. The $610 million applies to small businesses as well as corporations. And it’s correct that millionaires got at least $1,400 per year in tax reductions. In short, the claim uses different figures that when mashed together are misleading. For a statement that is partially accurate, but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

"['Debates', 'Energy', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist says Jeb Bush signed law letting Duke Energy collect advance fees
","While Fangate was the talk of Wednesday’s gubernatorial debate, there were other moments, too -- like when Charlie Crist slammed the door on Gov. Rick Scott’s accusations that Crist was the one who let utility companies charge customers for unbuilt power plants. ""Charlie signed legislation that allowed companies like Duke (Energy) to pass on costs for power plants that were never built,"" Scott said during a discussion of energy policy. Crist cut his Republican opponent off immediately. ""That’s not true. That was Jeb Bush,"" he said to applause from the crowd in Davie. This claim has come up before, when the Republican Party of Florida ran a campaign commercial that said Crist ""made it easier for Duke to take your money."" We rated that False. What Crist said at the debate is accurate. History lesson This attack centers on the Crystal River nuclear plant and a planned nuclear plant in Levy County that was never built. Duke Energy (which merged with Progress Energy in 2012) fumbled 2009 repairs to the existing Crystal River facility and planned to break ground on the Levy project, but never did. Because of a 2006 energy bill, SB 888, both Duke and Progress were allowed to charge Florida’s 1.7 million Duke customers an ""advance fee"" to pay for those plants before any work got under way. In 2013, Duke decided to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fixing it, leaving a bill of about $1.7 billion from repair work and other expenses. The company also spent about $1.5 billion on the Levy County project, then canceled it, demanding more and more advance fee money. The Florida Public Service Commission ruled in an October 2013 settlement that customers would be on the hook for $3.2 billion in expenses, while insurers would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest. A year later, under pressure from consumers and environmentalists, the PSC ordered Duke Energy Florida to credit $54 million back to ratepayers. Now that we know how the story ended, let’s return to SB 888, which is the legislation that allowed companies to charge advance fees to begin with. The bill passed the Legislature overwhelmingly and was signed on June 19, 2006, by then-Gov. Jeb Bush. That was well before Crist -- who was attorney general at the time -- was serving in the governor’s office. He ran and won that fall, taking office in January 2007. Scott said at the debate that people should go to one of his websites, FactsForFlorida.com, to see the bill Crist signed, so we looked. But just as the state GOP cited in its commercial, the bill on that site was HB 7135, a 2008 amendment to the original law allowing the advance fee. The site Scott mentioned read, ""2008: Charlie Crist signed a law expanding the Nuclear Cost Recovery Act, allowing utilities to pass on the costs of transmission lines and other construction to consumers."" However, Duke Energy never received any advance fee money as a result of this particular amendment, since there were no transmission lines or construction costs involved for either project. Crystal River was an existing plant, and the Levy project never got out of the planning stages. ""The problem with that argument is that, to the best of our knowledge, Duke never recovered any money related to transmission lines,"" said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy. ""Even though Gov. Crist signed the omnibus energy bill, the provision Scott refers to never played a role in the costs now being borne by Duke Energy customers."" There’s a different company that stands to benefit from the amendment Crist signed, however: Juno Beach-based Florida Power & Light Co., with 4.4 million customers in Florida. That’s because in May, Scott and his Cabinet approved FPL plans to erect 88 miles of giant transmission lines for two new reactors in Miami-Dade’s Turkey Point facility, over the protests of residents and local officials. Our ruling Crist said former Gov. Bush signed legislation allowing utility companies to charge customers for power plants that were never built. Scott and Republicans point to a 2008 amendment that Crist signed into law, but this amendment never led to any charging of customers for either facility at issue -- the Crystal River plant or the uncompleted Levy County plant. Instead, the operative law was signed in 2006, when Bush -- Crist’s Republican predecessor -- was governor. And ironically, it’s Scott whose decision has allowed a utility company to potentially benefit from the measure Crist signed. We rate Crist’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB4AC40>],/factchecks/2014/oct/16/charlie-crist/crist-says-jeb-bush-signed-law-letting-duke-energy/

Scott says 3,000 teachers lost jobs under Crist
","Republican Gov. Rick Scott is a fan of attacking former Gov. Charlie Crist’s record on jobs. At an Oct. 15 debate between the candidates -- the second debate of the campaign -- Scott repeatedly said 832,000 Florida jobs were lost during Crist’s term. (We’ve previously rated that claim Half True.) Crist swatted away Scott’s critique, arguing that the recession was to blame for those job losses. He said he took federal stimulus money that ""helped us make sure we didn’t have to fire 20,000 school teachers."" (We’ve rated that claim Mostly True.) Scott retorted by saying Crist was responsible for killing thousands of teacher jobs as he focused his attention on other career opportunities. ""He spent all his time trying to be vice president and then running against Marco Rubio for the Senate,"" Scott said. ""3,000 teachers lost their jobs when Charlie was governor."" When Scott used the same statistic in a June ad, we rated it Mostly False. Here, we will review the evidence on whether 3,000 teachers were laid off under Crist and, if so, whether he was to blame. How Florida cut education during the recession In the years leading up to Crist winning the governor’s office in 2006, the Florida economy was booming, pushing up funding for education. The K-12 budget when Crist took office was nearly $18 billion, including state and local dollars. But in 2007, Florida’s tax collections sagged as the national and state economy crumbled. The Legislature held a special session in September to determine how to fill a $1.1 billion hole in the $71 billion state budget. Education and health care, two of the largest expenses, ended up taking huge hits. In 2008, the state continued to suffer from a recession, and that led to more cuts. Republican leaders rejected Crist’s call to expand Lottery games and a property tax hike to pay for schools. Ultimately, lawmakers cut K-12 by more than $300 million. Democrats, the minority party in Tallahassee, and the teachers’ union opposed the cuts. ""We all want to do more,"" said Crist, a Republican at the time, at the end of the session. ""You just do the best you can."" Amid shortfalls, the Legislature continued to slash the budget in 2009. But then the state got some help from the federal government. In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- the $787 billion federal stimulus bill that supporters credit with saving jobs of teachers and other government workers nationwide. Crist accepted the funds, and state data indicated that about 19,000 full-time equivalent jobs for instructional personnel were preserved.  Republicans cite report for teacher layoff numbers The ad attacking Crist for 3,000 teacher layoffs relies on a September 2009 report by the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research that tallied jobs shed from state and local governments during the recession. The report includes a list that shows the lost teacher jobs in Florida added up to about 3,700. Here’s the problem with the way the ad uses that report: It doesn’t explain that it was based on news articles about layoffs or potential layoffs. The report explains that caveat clearly: ""This list shows press accounts of government planned job cuts. In some cases, the cuts may not have actually been implemented because of subsequent budget adjustments. Also, the job losses may have been met through attrition rather than actual layoffs."" For example, one article cited in the report stated that Miami-Dade, the state’s largest district, ""cut nearly 1,000 teaching positions."" But the Miami Herald reported that many teachers were moved into other jobs, and a district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that no teacher was laid off. Broward initially cut about 400 teachers, but rehired about 75 percent of them. While Marion County announced it would cut about 500 workers, the stimulus ""saved us from having to lay a single person off in 2008 or 2009,"" a school district spokesman told PolitiFact Florida. Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties -- none of which were cited in the report -- didn’t lay off any teachers. (The report only addressed about 15 percent of Florida’s school districts.) School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data showed 3,282 fewer teachers in the fall of 2008 compared to 2007 -- roughly a 2 percent decline. There was a smaller drop the next year. It’s fair to assume that some of those declines were due to layoffs. However, the districts don’t say how many of the declines were due to layoffs and how many were for other reasons, such as retirements, voluntary career changes or firings for cause. ""There were some layoffs during the steep downhill dive of the state economy, but there was a strong effort in school districts to avoid teacher layoffs,"" said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. In some districts that meant other support workers -- such as custodians or bus drivers -- absorbed the bulk of the layoffs, she said. Our ruling Scott said that ""3,000 teachers lost their jobs when Charlie was governor."" The claim omits some key points. The number was derived from media reports about possible layoffs; not all of them materialized. Also, the claim glosses over the fact that Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs. Finally, Crist was not solely responsible for teacher layoffs. Crist and the Republican-led Legislature signed off on budget cuts amid a national recession -- something no single politician is personally responsible for. Clearly, some teachers were laid off statewide, but there's a lack of evidence that it amounted to 3,000 positions. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD0D480>],/factchecks/2014/oct/16/rick-scott/scott-says-3000-teachers-lost-jobs-under-crist/
"['Medicaid', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist says Medicaid expansion could lead to 120,000 jobs
","Democrat Charlie Crist has criticized Republican Gov. Rick Scott for the state’s failure to expand Medicaid. During the second governor’s debate, which was held on Oct. 15, 2014, at Broward College, Crist said of Medicaid expansion, ""In addition to the $51 billion it would bring to the state over the next 10 years, some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs. That's the right thing to do."" That’s nearly double the number of new jobs that Crist cited this summer. If Florida expands Medicaid, would that lead to 120,000 more jobs? Studies about Medicaid and jobs Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility, with the federal government paying 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The expansion would have led to 800,000 to 1 million additional Floridians signing up for Medicaid. (That’s mostly due to new Floridians who would be eligible and also because some who are already eligible but haven’t signed up would enroll for the program after publicity.) Scott initially opposed Medicaid expansion but switched his position in 2013 when he came out in support of it. But Scott didn’t lobby the GOP-led Legislature, which ultimately rejected the expansion. He hasn’t talked about it much on the campaign trail. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven’t used in the past. Extra revenue will allow health care facilities to hire new workers. But the number of jobs predicted in each study varies depending upon the methodology. We only found one study that went as high as the 120,000 number Crist cited in the debate. And that study was conducted by a supporter of the expansion. Crist was citing the Florida Hospital Association’s 2013 analysis that predicts about 120,000 jobs. The association commissioned the study done by University of Florida researchers. During the debate, Crist didn’t specify any time frame. Direct jobs accounted for about one-third of the jobs, while the remainder included suppliers or secondary spending, such as when a doctor buys a new house or car. Other studies cited much lower figures for job growth. For example, Moody’s, a financial analysis firm that doesn’t have a position on the health care law, last year predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs over 10 years in Florida. The White House Council of Economic Advisers projected 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017 in Florida. That study was part of the Obama administration’s promotion of the Affordable Care Act. The White House study relies in part on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which some residents got Medicaid through a lottery. Research showed people in Medicaid got preventative tests such as mammograms, cholesterol screening and pap smears compared to the control group. The White House predicts that Medicaid expansion would allow tens of thousands of Floridians to get those preventative tests. Experts weigh in on studies So why the massive differences on the job predictions? The numbers vary based on different economic models used and other assumptions. PolitiFact Florida interviewed several experts on the studies after the first debate, held on Telemundo, when Crist made a similar claim about new jobs from expanding Medicaid. Dan White, the senior economist who authored the Moody’s study, said that the hospital association study appears to assume that everyone who signs up under the Medicaid expansion will generate new spending. But at least some of those people who would have signed up for Medicaid were already accessing some medical services -- albeit inefficiently in emergency rooms. ""They are treating all the money coming into Medicaid expansion as new medical spending in Florida, but some of those people are already spending money,"" White said. ""The crux of our analysis is shifting who is paying for it. It might be true that those people support 120,000 jobs, but maybe 10,000 to 30,000 are new jobs."" Some experts on Medicaid expansion told PolitiFact Florida that an infusion of federal dollars for Medicaid expansion would lead to some job growth, but they questioned pinpointing a specific number. ""Pumping federal dollars into the state is likely to be stimulative, but an exact job calculation (given the many concurrent policy changes) is difficult,"" Harvard professor of health economics Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact Florida. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s impossible to make a jobs prediction. ""I would guess there would be some short-term employment gains, but the long term would be more problematic as bills become due,"" he said. ""But even in the short term, I am skeptical of both the size and precision of this estimate."" Though most of the experts we interviewed agreed that there would be some job growth, University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan argues that increasing Medicaid will reduce employment because people will no longer need to work full-time to get health insurance. ""Medicaid makes it less painful to have a low income, so people have less incentive to take actions to prevent their incomes from getting low,"" he previously told PolitiFact. ""Not everyone acts that way, but enough do that a Medicaid expansion would depress employment nationally."" Our ruling Crist said ""some studies indicate"" expanding Medicaid would ""create about 120,000 jobs."" Crist was referring to one study done for the Florida Hospital Association, a supporter of Medicaid expansion. That study predicted about 120,000 new jobs. There have been several studies that predict job growth related to Medicaid expansion, with one study putting the figure as low as 10,000 jobs. Crist cherry-picked the study with the highest statistic and omitted that it was done for an association that supports the expansion. Most economists and Medicaid experts say that it’s likely that the infusion of federal cash would lead to some jobs, but it is difficult to pinpoint the number. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB11700>],/factchecks/2014/oct/16/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-medicaid-expansion-could-lead-1/

In a TV ad, Wendy Davis said Greg Abbott took a hefty campaign donation before siding with a hospital against patients injured and killed by a drug-taking surgeon. Davis, the Fort Worth state senator and Democratic gubernatorial nominee, consistently depicts Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican choice for governor, as an unethical insider beholden to powerful interests. The narrator of the ad, titled ""Operation,"" says: ""He was a Texas surgeon, performing operations while reportedly using cocaine. Two people died, others were paralyzed. Doctors spoke out,"" the narrator says, ""but the hospital did nothing to stop him. Families and victims sued the hospital. ""Then, weeks after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution from the hospital's chairman, Greg Abbott got involved, using his office to go to court -- against the victims."" Abbott solicited and accepted the donation, we confirmed, and the state intervened in lawsuits pitting patients against the hospital, though he got involved to defend a state law. Senator’s backup By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said Davis based her claim in part on a July 30, 2014, news story in the Dallas Morning News stating that not long after the chairman of the board of the Baylor Health Care System, which owns the Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano, donated $250,000 to Abbott’s campaign, Abbott weighed in on federal lawsuits against the hospital where a neurosurgeon allegedly had done damage to patients. News report and interview of donor We confirmed from Abbott’s campaign finance filings with the state and an interview with the board chairman and donor, Temple businessman Drayton McLane, that McLane donated $250,000 to Abbott’s campaign in January 2014. That donation, the News story said, came after McLane gave the campaign $100,000 in 2013. Before the six-figure contributions, the story said, McLane’s biggest donation to Abbott had been $25,000. Abbott’s campaign recorded the $250,000 donation as arriving Jan. 23, 2014 -- the very date one of the relevant federal lawsuits were filed against the hospital. Then again, we realized with a nudge from Petkanas after this article initially appeared, one of the several lawsuits was filed Dec. 27, 2013, weeks prior to McLane's contribution. His $250,000 check, a photo of which McLane’s office emailed to us, was dated Jan. 21, 2014. The News story said Abbott and McLane had each told the paper the two had not discussed the lawsuits. McLane also said he didn’t know about the case before contributing the $250,000, the paper said, and he stressed he had no personal financial interest in the nonprofit hospital system; the chairman’s post is unpaid. By phone, McLane told us he’s known Abbott since before Abbott, originally a Houston lawyer, won election as a Harris County state district judge in 1992 and gave the $250,000 after Abbott asked him for a large contribution. McLane said he hadn’t spoken with the Republican nominee since. Asked what he expected for the eye-catching contribution, McLane said: ""I’m not expecting to get anything back. I believe in strong good government. Unfortunately, on both sides, there are heavy contributions."" On top of not knowing about the lawsuits described by Davis before making his donation, McLane said, he hadn’t long been chairman of Baylor Scott & White Health, which owns the Plano facility, having become chairman when healthcare systems merged in October 2013; McLane previously chaired Scott & White Healthcare. Abbott in court As noted in the News, the federal suits against the Baylor system and Plano hospital challenge the constitutionality of a state law requiring the plaintiffs to prove Baylor acted with actual intent to harm patients -- which the suing plaintiffs/families call an impossibly stiff burden. Petkanas of Davis’ campaign provided copies of several lawsuits filed on behalf of patients and families, each one alleging a neurosurgeon, Christopher Duntsch, was permitted by the Plano hospital to perform surgeries under the influence of illegal drugs and alcohol, causing harm. Those suits also challenge action by state lawmakers in 2003, while overhauling laws regulating lawsuits seeking damages,  to delete a definition of ""malice"" in the law, hence ""eliminating a common-law right arbitrarily in light of the purposes of the statute leaving only an impossible condition before liability will attach,"" the lawsuits say. A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, Lauren Bean, emailed us the state’s nearly identical March 24, 2014, filings in three plaintiff challenges to the law. In the filings, the state said it has a statutory right to intervene in a case when the constitutionality of a state law is at issue. On March 31, 2014, a week after the state filed its request, U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis granted the request to intervene ""for the purpose of defending the constitutionality of Texas law,"" Solis wrote. His order said no parties to the litigation objected. It’s undisputed an attorney general may seek to get involved in a federal suit to defend a state law, but some lawyers told us it’s up to the official to do so -- or not. Attorney Kay Van Wey, who represents some plaintiffs in the suits against the hospital, said by email Abbott’s move was unusual and unreasonable, though she didn’t object, she said, because there is no legal way to do so; we didn’t divine what she meant by that. Van Wey further said Abbott ""is defending a law that essentially gives immunity to hospitals for credentialing dangerous physicians. The law, as it now stands, denies access to the courts for good, taxpaying Texas citizens, who through no fault of their own, were butchered by a highly dangerous surgeon. ""Even if we prove the hospitals were grossly negligent in hiring and retaining a dangerous surgeon,"" Van Wey said, ""...it isn't enough under the current state of the law. In Texas, we have to prove ‘malice,’ meaning we have to prove the hospital had a subjective intent to harm the patient. That is considered to be an impossible standard. It is clearly an erroneous and completely unfair law. He didn't have to intervene in our lawsuits. He chose to."" The News story quoted Bean saying McLane’s contributions played no role in his decision to intervene in the suits. Besides, Bean said, the ""state is not defending the hospital or the doctor in this case — or their alleged conduct. If the hospital or doctor have violated the law, then they will be held accountable, and nothing in the state’s court filings opposes the plaintiffs,"" patients and families, ""on that front,"" she said. Bean gave us the agency’s full response sent to the News. In it, Bean said the state ""will not be putting on any defense of any action by the hospital or any doctor. The state will not put on any evidence or make any argument whether the hospital’s actions or the doctor’s actions violate the law. The state does not condone, support or defend the actions of the hospital or doctor. The only thing the state will argue is that the law is not unconstitutional."" Outside lawyers An Austin lawyer who helped write the 2003 change told us he believes the attorney general was bound to defend the revised law as Abbott is doing. Michael Hull emailed: ""The AG intervention is consistent with federal and state law. The AG is defending the constitutionality of a statute. His office has not taken a position on the facts alleged in the petition nor has the AG chosen to defend the hospital or the doctor."" Hull later said such constitutional challenges are rare, ""but when challenges do occur, it is common for the AG to defend the constitutionality of the statute."" Hull and Michael Guajardo, the Dallas president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, each pointed out any litigant is required to notify the state of a federal challenge to a state law’s constitutionality We asked if that formal notice touched off Abbott’s intervention. Not so, Bean said, adding the attorney general’s office has no record of receiving the notice, which court filings say was sent by certified mail. Instead, Bean said, Jonathan Mitchell, the state solicitor general, learned of the suits from a March 10, 2014, news story in the Texas Lawyer magazine. Petkanas, told we hadn’t uncovered proof the McLane donation prompted Abbott to enter the lawsuits, said by email the ad didn’t assert a cause and effect -- only that McLane gave his campaign donation before Abbott intervened. Our ruling Davis said that weeks ""after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution"" from a hospital board chairman, Greg Abbott went to court against victims of a drug-taking neurosurgeon. Davis’ statement needs clarification – that Abbott’s intervention was limited to defending the constitutionality of Texas’ tort-reform laws. That makes this statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Workers', 'Joni Ernst']","
Joni Ernst praises Iowa economy, compares it to weak U.S. wage trend
","During an Oct. 11, 2014, debate, Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley -- who are facing off in one of the nation’s most pivotal Senate races -- sparred over the economy. At one point in the debate, Ernst compared ""Washington, D.C., ways"" with ""Iowa values."" She pointed to ""records of failure coming from this administration, and followers like Congressman Braley, versus our Iowa values and the way we have conducted business in the last four years. With my good supporter, (Republican Gov.) Terry Branstad, we have implemented strong economic policy here in Iowa -- lower taxes, reduced job-killing regulations, and a balanced budget, and we are putting more of our hard-working Iowans back to work with new, good-paying jobs. Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent."" But we wondered: Is her statistical comparison between Iowa and the United States valid? We took a closer look. (Ernst’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) 'Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States.' On the first part of the claim, Ernst has a point, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal government’s official source of data about personal income. In the most recent quarter for which data is currently available -- the second quarter of 2014 -- personal income in Iowa increased by 2.4 percent over the previous quarter in Iowa. Only three states had faster growth -- Nebraska (2.7 percent), North Dakota (2.7 percent) and Idaho (2.5 percent). But some context serves to undercut the significance of this achievement. The statistics for such short periods of time tend to be ""noisy"" -- that is, the numbers bounce around a lot. As an illustration, let’s look at the statistics for the couple of quarters before the 2.4 percent increase. Moving backward one quarter at a time, personal income growth in Iowa clocked in at -0.6 percent, -0.5 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.0 percent, and -0.2 percent. This paints a very different picture of personal income growth in Iowa. To effectively detect genuine trends, you need to study a longer period of time. Let’s take a look at how Iowa did for full-year periods rather than quarters. Between full-year 2012 and full-year 2013, Iowa had the 18th-highest percentage change in personal income among the 50 states, which is quite a bit weaker than the fourth-place finish Ernst cited. Iowa fared even more poorly between 2011 and 2012, when the state ranked 43rd nationally. This, too, is quite a different picture than the one she painted in the debate. 'Nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years … by 2.7 percent.' Not if you look at median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly wage nationally in 2013 -- the most recent full year available -- was $776, up from $671 in 2008. Once you adjust the 2006 figure for inflation in 2013 dollars, it works out to be $775.37 -- meaning there was basically no change at all between 2006 and 2013. It’s virtually the same if you inflation-adjust the data for 2005 -- there’s no significant change in median weekly earnings between 2005 and 2013. ""What I always say when writing about wage developments, at least after the number of employed Americans started rising again in 2010, is that real wages are basically flat,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Meanwhile, the comparison Ernst offered -- of strong Iowa growth amid national stagnation -- is flawed, for two reasons. • She’s comparing two different statistics. Personal income and real wages aren’t the same thing. Real wages are a component of personal income, but not the only one. They are derived from separate data sources, and they use very different methodologies. • She’s comparing two different periods of time. You can’t simply compare the most recent quarter with the past eight years and get a meaningful contrast. It’s comparing apples and oranges. All this said, Ernst does have a point: Real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years then they have nationally. If you start the clock in 2005, real wages in Iowa increased by 1.6 percent by 2013, and if you start the clock in 2006, they increased by 1.8 percent by 2013. And she also has a point that stagnant real earnings growth over eight years is nothing to be proud of, even if she exaggerates by blaming this situation on Braley. (Lots of factors shape the economy beyond just one minority-party member of Congress.) Our ruling Ernst said that ""Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent."" Iowa did rank fourth nationally in personal income growth, but only for the most recent quarter, and when compared to earlier quarters, this high rate seems like a statistical anomaly. Meanwhile, she’s wrong that real wages declined by 2.7 percent over the past eight years, although she does have a point that Iowa did somewhat better on this score than did the nation as a whole. Equally problematic, Ernst’s comparison between Iowa’s economy and the nation’s is questionable because it appears to compare quarterly data for one statistic to eight years of a different statistic. Economists say this isn’t a sound method. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE3F8C0>],/factchecks/2014/oct/15/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-praises-iowa-economy-compares-it-weak-u/
"['Criminal Justice', 'Wisconsin', 'Republican Party of Wisconsin']","
Wisconsin GOP says Susan Happ took $180,000 from a defendant she offered deferred prosecution
","Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for attorney general, has criticized rival Susan Happ for not turning to a special prosecutor to handle a case involving a man with whom she had a financial relationship. The Republican Party of Wisconsin has offered much tougher criticism of Happ, the Jefferson County district attorney and Democratic nominee for attorney general. The party blasted Happ in two radio ads, which make a lot of charges in quick fashion, making them hard to fully absorb. But the GOP summarized it this way in a news release tied to the second ad: ""As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000 from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution."" Is the claim accurate? Background on the case The news release refers to the prosecution of Daniel J. Reynolds, who initially faced felony charges filed by Happ’s office alleging first-degree and second-degree sexual assaults of a child. Ultimately, her office signed off on a plea bargain, approved in March 2014 by a judge, that included a deferred prosecution agreement. If Reynolds stays out of trouble and gets the recommended treatment, the charges will be reduced to disorderly conduct. Real estate records show Happ and her husband had signed a land contract with Reynolds to sell a piece of property to him for a total of $180,000 over three years. Nobody disputes those events, which form the basis for portions of the GOP claim. Happ says she recognized the conflict of interest and took steps in her office to handle it. When asked for backup, the GOP pointed to the timeline of events as evidence of a ""quid pro quo"" -- something that is given or taken in return for something else, our dictionary says. But there are big problems with the way the party describes the sequence of events and Happ’s knowledge and actions. Indeed, the claim makes it sound like Happ ""took"" $180,000 from a defendant after he was charged, then recommended light punishment for him. Here is a closer look at the sequence: Records show the monthly payments under the land deal were two months from completion when the Jefferson Police Department asked Happ’s office in March 2012 to review its request for charges against Reynolds. So there was an ongoing financial relationship at that time. But the land deal was signed more than three years before Reynolds was charged on May 21, 2013, and it ended in May 2012 -- before he was charged, but while the case was being reviewed. The GOP portrays the sale as a ""shady"" deal with a child predator. According to the criminal complaint that was eventually filed, the assaults occurred between 2001 and 2005. So if the complaint is right, the defendant was a child predator before the land deal in 2009. But records indicate the police investigation began in October 2011. So, Reynolds was not yet charged or under investigation at the time the land deal was initiated. And no one has presented evidence that Happ, elected district attorney in 2008, knew that Reynolds was allegedly involved in assaults until the matter came to her office in 2012. There are other issues. The $180,000 figure cited by the GOP was owed to both Happ and her husband, according to the contract. But the property in question was owned by Happ’s husband before the two were married in March 2009. Reynolds was a tenant in the building at some point. Happ told us she signed the land contract because it’s marital property, but that as a practical matter, she and her husband keep their assets separate and that payments from Reynolds went to her husband. Still, she said, ""marital property is marital property,"" and she understands the conflict of interest was still there. The GOP also says Happ offered Reynolds a deferred prosecution deal. The deal was made by her office, but court records show that the case was assigned to and handled by one of her assistant DAs, Monica Hall. Happ says that, following Supreme Court ethics procedures, she screened herself off from decisions or any involvement in the case when she recognized Reynolds’ name on the referral from the police department. An official at the state Office of Lawyer Regulation, citing that screening procedure, said on Oct. 13, 2014 there was no indication of an ethics breach by Happ. The agency received a complaint in September 2014 about Happ’s handling of the case from the victim of the assaults. A final note. The GOP claim suggests Reynolds got off too easy -- a feeling the victim shares, based on her complaint to the Office of Lawyer Regulation. Happ said on a radio show that she believes from the general details she knows that the case was handled properly by the assistant DA, whom she described as ""tenacious and well qualified."" Our rating The Republican Party said, ""As district attorney, Susan Happ took $180,000"" in a ""shady"" land deal ""from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution."" The adequacy of Happ’s response to a conflict of interest is up for debate, but the GOP stretches and distorts the timeline of events to create a highly misleading attack without evidence to back up the idea that Reynolds got a sweetheart deal by paying $180,000.

"['Georgia', 'Poverty', 'Women', 'David Perdue']","
Perdue claim on women in poverty off mark
","A key strategy for Republicans running in this year’s midterm elections has been to slam their Democratic opponents as surrogates of President Barack Obama. It’s a tactic that GOP nominee David Perdue has employed repeatedly in Georgia’s closely watched U.S Senate race, including last week when he and Democratic opponent Michelle Nunn shared the debate stage in Perry. When asked about his stance on minimum wage and how to create jobs, Perdue told a huge and at times raucous crowd that Nunn was trying to ""tear down"" his business career to detract from her support of Obama. ""She supports the economic policies of this administration, one that put 4 million women in poverty in six years,"" Perdue said. Other Republicans have made similar claims this year as both parties vie for the female vote and control of the U.S. Senate. We decided to pull out the Truth-O-Meter to check: Have 4 million women really fallen into poverty in the last six years? We began by asking Perdue’s camp for its evidence. Spokesman Derrick Dickey said Perdue’s comments relied, in part, on an August 2014 post on the Georgia Federation of Republican Women’s website. The post stated that nearly 4 million women had fallen into poverty since Obama was elected in 2008. The campaign also was drawing on similar public comments by U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, though both McConnell and Cruz used slightly smaller estimates of 3.7 million, Dickey said. We reached out to the staff of both senators and heard back immediately from Don Stewart from McConnell’s office. Stewart pointed us to data from the U.S. Census Bureau (table 7) showing that there were 22.131 million females living below the poverty line in 2008, the year President Obama was elected, and 25.840 million in poverty in 2012. That is an increase of 3.7 million (over five years, not six as Perdue said). But that data counts all females -- including children -- which is not what most people think of or how Merriam-Webster defines women. Among women 18 and over - the ones in those jobs Perdue was discussing in the debate - the poverty rate went up by 2.8 million between 2008 and 2013, according to Census figures. Looking at the data starting in 2009, when Obama took office and could affect policy, the increase drops to 1.5 million, Census data show. Two facts missing from those numbers further complicate the data, according to William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. One: the number of all women increased in those periods due to population growth. That ""accounts for most of the increase in poverty in women over either the 2008-2013 or 2009-2013,"" Frey said. Two: The Great Recession ticked up the poverty rate for everyone, not just women, between 2010 and 2012. Last year, the poverty rate went down overall for the first time since 2006, before Obama took office. For working-age women, those between 18 and 64, there was a rise in the poverty among adult women of about 991,000 between 2009 and 2013. The Census Bureau calls those figures ""statistically insignificant."" So where does this leave us? Perdue last week said Michelle Nunn ""supports the economic policies of this administration, one that put 4 million women in poverty in six years."" He bases it, in part, on U.S. Census Bureau data first collected in 2008, when Obama wasn’t even in office. The Census Bureau data shows 3.7 million more females in poverty in 2012 than in 2008. But when you talk just about women -- adult females over 18 -- the increase is 2.8 million. That’s far too big an increase but also far too far from 4 million to be called accurate. We rate the statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE53240>],/factchecks/2014/oct/15/david-perdue/perdue-claim-mark/
"['Congress', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
John Cornyn says his office sends back budgeted money every year
","On the Sept. 7, 2014, edition of ""Inside Texas Politics,"" a Dallas news program, WFAA-TV reporter Jason Whitely said to Sen. John Cornyn: ""A recent survey caught our attention that showed you have one of the most expensive offices in the Senate -- in the top five, behind Feinstein, Boxer, Ted Cruz, I believe, and you’re in there, spending $3.7 million last year; the average is about $2.5 million. ""Why is your office so expensive to run?"" ""Texas is a big state,"" Cornyn replied with a grin. ""You’ll notice that... the ones with the largest budgets are the biggest states. And representing 26 million people... it costs money. So we try to conserve the money that we spend -- we send money back every year, try to live within those conservative means -- but the fact of the matter is, I’ve got a job to do and I’m going to do it the best I can and--"" Whitely: ""--you send money back every year?"" Cornyn: ""Yeah, we do."" An Aug. 5, 2014, news story in The Washington Post, drawing on research by the Sunlight Foundation, said that between April 2013 and March 2014, the offices of U.S. senators from California, Texas, Florida and New York spent more than offices of other senators. The story said Cornyn’ s office, spending $3.7 million, ranked fifth behind California’s Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cornyn's backup We were curious about Cornyn’s claim he doesn’t spend all the money budgeted for his office. To our inquiries, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie provided figures and pointed out a 2014 report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service noting senators receive funding allowances covering official office expenses including staff, mail, travel to and from their state and Washington, D.C., equipment and other goods and services. And, according to the report, each senator gets some office funding based on their state’s population and distance from the capital. Each senator’s resulting expenditures are specified in a report issued every six months as well, which initially made us think it would be easy to gauge whether Cornyn has returned office funding every year since he joined the Senate in 2003. Commence gnashing. By email, Brandewie sent a chart showing what he described as the average amount of money unspent by Cornyn’s office each year: $308,488. He followed up with a chart showing what he described as the office’s unspent balances for each fiscal year, ranging from $19,824 as of the end of September 2005 up to $656,577 at the end of September 2010. Brandewie also pointed out his cited figures on pages of twice-a-year reports on Senate office spending.  Source: Drew Brandewie, press secretary, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (received by email Oct. 9, 2014) Senate expenditure reports We initially failed to match the provided figures with entries in the six-month reports published by the Government Printing Office (which we paged through at the Texas State Library) partly, it turned out, because the reports list how much money an office didn’t spend in a line-item with a mysterious label. By email, Brandewie counseled that in all but one of the year-ending expense reports, summary line-items titled ""Resc/Withdrawals"" reflect authorized funds the senator’s office didn’t spend. (""Resc/Withdrawals,"" we suspect, is short for Rescissions/Withdrawals; a rescission, according to a Senate web page, is the cancellation of a budget authority previously provided by Congress. Got that? It will be on the final.) The report covering fiscal 2003, folding in about nine months of Cornyn’s first year in the Senate, shows a zero for his office’s entry. But, Brandewie said, that doesn’t mean Cornyn tapped out his office budget. Instead, in that year’s reports, unspent money was entered on a different line, labeled ""Transfers,"" Brandewie said. Senate financial clerk Generally, Brandewie said, he based his answers about the expense reports on information provided by Chris Doby, the Senate’s financial clerk, who earlier told us by phone he couldn’t discuss Cornyn’s particular office expenditures. Doby also said it’s not uncommon for a Senate office to end a year with money unspent. Doby also said that if a Senate office doesn't spend all its authorized funds, the leftover money isn't immediately transferred to the U.S. Treasury; it's available for two years longer. Later, we asked Brandewie if the two-year lag basically enables a senator to both return funds and continue tapping those dollars. Brandewie, citing Doby, said leftover funds may only be spent on expenses from the year they were initially budgeted. So, he said, ""a member cannot use funds from one year to pay for expenses from another. The funds are fixed, finite and do not roll over from year to year,"" the Cornyn aide emailed. Our ruling Cornyn said his office sends budgeted money back every year. We rate this claim True based on figures provided by Cornyn’s office that also appeared in public office expenditure reports, albeit connected to hard-to-decipher labels.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB1B340>],/factchecks/2014/oct/14/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-his-office-sends-back-budgeted-mo/
"['Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'No Tax For Tracks']","
Greenlight Pinellas opponents say residents will never be able to vote on tax again
","When it comes to discussing the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative, two things are certain: Taxes and citizens complaining about taxes. If the measure passes on Election Day, the county’s sales tax would go up 1 cent. So an opposition group has made the alleged unfairness of it all a cornerstone of their campaign. No Tax For Tracks, a grassroots group opposed to Greenlight Pinellas, said in an email to voters that not only is the switch from a property tax for the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority to an increased sales tax unfair, it’s going to last forever. ""They call it a ‘tax swap,’ but PSTA's revenue will increase from $32 million per year to $148 million per year,"" the email reads. ""Any financial dictionary will tell you that this is not a ‘tax swap’, this is a revenue increase of over 300 percent! And the tax is permanent, we never get to vote on this again."" The group has notably been mindful of its wording here, because they have said in the past that the swap was a ""300 percent tax increase."" We rated that False, because that number would be the change to the PSTA operating budget, and not any individual taxpayer. Will the tax swap be permanent, though? We decided to find out. The swap The countywide transportation plan aims to expand bus service by adding routes and extending hours, but also would add a 24-mile light rail line between St. Petersburg and Clearwater. In order to pay for the changes, the county’s sales tax would go up from 7 percent to 8 percent, becoming the highest tax rate in the state. Some things, like medicine, groceries, and certain agricultural and manufacturing startup equipment, would be exempt from the sales tax, and the increase would be limited to the first $5,000 of major purchases. This would replace the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority’s current county funding through a property tax.  Greenlight Pinellas is different from something like Penny for Pinellas, the county's 1-cent capital improvement tax. The Penny for Pinellas has to be reauthorized by voters every 10 years. Here, the interlocal agreement the PSTA and the county commission created for the plan does not specifically guarantee a future vote on the sales tax increase.  The ""tax swap,"" as Greenlight Pinellas organizers call it, would boost the authority’s budget from about $34 million to as high as $120 million to $130 million, PSTA calculates. If voters approve the change in November, the change would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. Any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line or other major alteration, would be subject to a referendum. The property tax technically wouldn’t go away, as the PSTA needs the state to approve its elimination. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill in 2012 that would have done this, getting rid of the property tax and replacing it with the increased sales tax if voters choose. Now, if Greenlight Pinellas passes, the PSTA would set the millage rate to zero and start collecting the sales tax. The property tax could be eliminated by the Legislature in the future, but the fact that it would still exist on property tax bills has led No Tax For Tracks to speculate this could lead to double taxation. Greenlight Pinellas rules say PSTA can’t have both sets of tax revenue.  The new sales tax itself stays in place ""until repealed,"" as the ballot language for Nov. 4 says. No Tax For Tracks argues that repeal won’t ever take place, because of how the PSTA and Pinellas County agreed to fund the project. The interlocal agreement says the surtax money can only be used to fund Greenlight projects, PSTA chief development officer Cassandra Borchers told us. It also specifies that the county has to continue to fund PSTA operations and maintenance. There are ways for the tax to be rescinded written into the agreement, however. If the plan isn’t implemented as promised or in the time frame allotted, if the money from the sales tax is used for something other than the Greenlight plan, if there is a payment default or some unforeseen calamity in the future, the tax can be reduced or terminated. It also is slated for review in 50 years, and every 20 years thereafter. But overall, it won’t be easy to stop the tax once it starts. That’s because the tax money is going to pay for a major construction project. Jewel White from the Pinellas County Attorney’s Office said there are clauses written into the contract that allow for decades of guaranteed tax money in order to secure financing for capital projects, like more buses and the proposed light rail line. Unless one of the triggers to end the sales tax is met, the county commission likely wouldn’t examine the issue, White said. Because the sales tax is under the same ordinance that governs initiatives like Penny For Pinellas, it has to be put to voters to be enacted, she said. After that, options for repeal are few. Pinellas residents could ask the commission to address the issue, but that would probably not get any results either, White said. Residents could not force the commission to put the issue back on the ballot. ""Certainly, anyone can approach the commission at any time,"" she said. ""Once money gets bonded, though, it’s pretty hard to undo."" No Tax For Tracks activists also said these steps are wholly improbable, because if the county ended the tax, they would have to find some way to continue to pay its obligations to PSTA. Borchers agreed that just ending the sales tax or reinstituting the property tax -- which would bring in much less money for the operating budget -- would result in major problems. ""You couldn’t just stop it without some consequences,"" Borchers said, noting that not only is the operating budget at issue, there is a lot of promised state and federal money tied up in the plan. ""You’d have to pay back all those grants."" Our ruling No Tax For Tracks said the Greenlight Pinellas 1-cent sales tax ""is permanent, we never get to vote on this again."" There is no clause or provision in the proposal that allows for another vote. However, saying the tax is ""permanent"" also goes too far. While it is certainly likely that the sales tax would be in place for the foreseeable future if passed, the tax has a review clause set for 50 years from now. The long time frame is because the taxes are dedicated to paying for major long-term construction projects like light rail. As to whether the county commission would ever bring the question back to voters, it’s improbable but not impossible. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Alison Lundergan Grimes says raising the minimum wage would lift a million people out of poverty
","The minimum wage is one area where Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes has gone on the offensive against Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky’s race for U.S. Senate. Grimes, now the Kentucky secretary of state, backs a Democratic effort to raise it to $10.10 an hour. In the Oct. 13 Kentucky Senate debate, McConnell, running for a sixth term in office, explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by claiming that a Congressional Budget Office report says ""you will destroy between half a million and 1 million jobs (by raising the federal minimum wage)."" ""That’s not the way to grow our economy,"" he added. But Grimes retorted that McConnell was cherry-picking data from the report. ""The full story of the CBO report is it would help lift a million — over a million — Americans out of poverty,"" she said. We looked at McConnell’s assertion in a separate fact-check and said it was Mostly True. The report said job losses would likely range from ""a very slight reduction in employment"" to 1 million, with a mid-range estimate of 500,000. But what did the CBO say about the other side the ledger, the people who would be boosted out of poverty by a minimum wage hike? We decided to take a look. President Barack Obama has called on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016. In the succeeding years, increases to the minimum wage would be tied to inflation. There are 23 states with minimum wages already above the federal minimum wage, while the remainder of the country (including Kentucky) either sets the minimum wage at $7.25, links the state minimum wage to the federal amount or specifies no minimum wage at all. Eight states have minimum wages set to increase to at least $10, but in most cases that would not happen until later than 2016. So this increase, if passed, would affect most of the country. In 2016, the federal poverty level is expected to be $24,100 for a family of four. By the CBO’s estimate, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion. That’s enough to move 900,000 of approximately 45 million people living below the federal poverty level above that threshold. But it’s not quite what Grimes said. While she initially said ""a million Americans"" she quickly corrected herself to say raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift ""over a million Americans out of poverty."" The actual figure is close to a million, but definitely not ""over"" it. Grimes’ campaign told us after the debate that the candidate misspoke both times and meant to say ""nearly a million."" The CBO estimate of 900,000 people is a net figure. That means it factors in not only the people who would move above the poverty line if the minimum wage went up to $10.10 an hour, but also those who would move below it. How would someone move below the poverty line if the minimum wage went up? As we noted earlier, the CBO estimates that somewhere between a few people and a million people could lose their jobs as a result of a minimum wage hike. Some businesses might have to cut back on employees to pay the increased wages of other workers, which could have a ripple effect on the economy resulting in about 500,000 lost jobs by the end of 2016. So, it’s possible that more than 900,000 people would be lifted out of poverty, it’s just that some of them are offset by people moving into poverty as a result of the increase in the minimum wage. The CBO report does not say how many of the 500,000 lost jobs would move people into poverty, and it’s presumptuous to put any number on it. If one person in a family loses a job as a result of a minimum wage hike, it doesn’t always mean the family is now living in poverty. The lost job could be that of a teenage child or one parent in a two-income household. And either way, the net figure — 900,000 — is the most important number that tells the full story. Overall, Grimes is right that there’s another side to the CBO report that McConnell’s comments do not highlight. As the report noted: ""The increase in the minimum wage would have two principal effects on low-wage workers: The large majority would have higher wages and family income, but a much smaller group would be jobless and have much lower family income."" Our ruling Grimes said that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would lift ""over a million Americans out of poverty."" The report she sites actually puts the net figure slightly less than a million, at about 900,000. Grimes’ campaign later said she misspoke but our job is to check what the candidates tell the voters at the time. The stat Grimes actually said is close but not quite on the ball. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE61A40>],/factchecks/2014/oct/14/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-raising-minimum-wage-/

Mega pastor John Hagee wants to jail women who use God’s name during sex? That’s fake news
","A fake story about a televangelist who wants to criminalize enthusiastic pillow talk shows that sometimes humor and the news can make strange bedfellows.

He also is CEO of Global Evangelical Television. ""John Hagee calls for ‘prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse’,"" reads the headline on the story, in which Hagee denounces blasphemy.

As part of its efforts to fight fake news, Facebook flagged the story as potentially being false. And the story is very false, even though it’s not immediately apparent on many the websites that have shared it. Hagee is a controversial figure for his past remarks, which include criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court striking down same-sex marriage bans as ""judicial tyranny"" and saying the Holocaust was part of God’s plan to drive Jews from Europe. But he never said women should be jailed for invoking the almighty while having sex. Not that we can prove, anyway.

"['Health Care', 'Missouri', 'Roy Blunt']","
Roy Blunt leaves out the context of Missouri's health insurance coverage
","As a Republican-controlled Congress continues to advance plans to defund and eventually dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, Missouri’s  Sen. Roy Blunt has once again echoed his reasoning for supporting a repeal. ""This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges,"" the Republican said in a Jan. 11 press release. ""Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options."" It’s not the first time Blunt has mentioned the numbers, which his office noted were from HealthCare.gov (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ website where individuals can enroll in health care). As insurance providers pull out of markets and premiums rise around the country, the health care exchange is certainly facing substantial changes. Even in that context, though, Blunt’s figures paint a drastic picture for Missourians, and we wanted to fact-check his statement. 97 out of 114 counties On the numbers, Blunt is correct. Ninety-seven Missouri counties will only have one insurance provider offering coverage on the health care exchange this year, according to data compiled and released by the official exchange provider, HealthCare.gov, and synthesized by the Missouri Hospital Association and the Kaiser Family Foundation. Fifteen counties and the city of St. Louis will have two providers, and two counties that include large swaths of Kansas City will have three. In 2016, 112 Missouri counties and the city of St. Louis all had at least three insurance providers participating in the health care exchange. No county had only one. The reduction in coverage is primarily the result of two major insurance providers exiting the individual state exchange at the beginning of the year. The providers, UnitedHealth Group and Aetna (known in Missouri as Coventry Health Care), are both staying in the state in other markets, but have opted out of participating in the exchange. ""I wouldn’t say it’s impacting care as much as it’s impacting the ability to choose the provider you want,"" said Dave Dillon, vice president of public and media relations at the Missouri Hospital Association. In essence, he explained, it’s possible for an individual not to have the option to choose a plan that would allow them to visit their regular doctor. With this lack of choices, Dillon said, ""clearly the incentive between insurance companies to compete in cost just isn’t there."" During the open enrollment period, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, nearly 250,000 Missourians enrolled in some form of insurance provided by the health care law. Metropolitan areas continue to have choice One notable feature of Missouri’s insurance exchange in 2017 is that all of the counties in the state’s two metropolitan hubs, Kansas City and St. Louis, will continue to have more than one provider. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, of Missouri’s roughly 6 million residents, about 63 percent live in the 17 counties and one city that will continue to have at least two provider choices. Nationally, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the trend is similar. Of exchange enrollees living in metropolitan areas, 62 percent will continue to have a choice of three or more providers while only 18 percent will have the option of only one provider. For those living in rural areas, the numbers are almost reversed. Forty-one percent of those enrolled in the exchange living in rural areas will have only one provider option while 29 percent will have three or more options. The out-of-pocket price In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent"" — is also statistically accurate, according to the Missouri Hospital Association and the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, it does not accurately portray the out-of-pocket price Missourians will face in 2017. While premiums are on the rise in Missouri, as they are in the rest of the country, so, too, are the tax credits designed to offset the cost that the consumer bears. Speaking on the increases in price on the exchange this year, Dillon said, ""The individual was not exposed to the full cost of the increase of the sticker price."" The rhetoric surrounding premium increases often looks only at the sticker price and not the out-of-pocket price, he said. Again using data from HealthCare.gov, the Missouri Hospital Association compiled the costs of premiums both before and after the tax credit in the 10 Missouri health insurance marketplace rating areas. Looking strictly at the second lowest-cost silver plan, which is the plan used by HealthCare.gov to determine the financial assistance an individual or family may receive, eight of the ten counties will see an out-of-pocket monthly price of $26.52. Data for the other two counties was unavailable. So while premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan in each of the eight counties rose in 2017, the out-of-pocket cost saw a change of less than one percent — less than a dollar. Our ruling Blunt said: ""This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent."" Blunt’s figures are misleading. Both of his claims use cherry-picked figures that excluded the necessary data to accurately represent the state of the health care exchange in Missouri. Although most counties only have one insurer participating in a health care exchange, a majority of Missourians have more than one option. And while premium costs have seen a dramatic rise, so have tax credits meant to blunt the impact of higher costs. Blunt’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['Jobs', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Gov. Rick Scott says cutting Enterprise Florida will hurt rural areas
","Florida Gov. Rick Scott and House Speaker Richard Corcoran are at war over the future of state agencies that promote tourism and provide corporate incentives to recruit jobs. In an unusual venting session with reporters in Tallahassee on Feb. 7, Scott attacked House Republicans for proposing a bill that would kill Enterprise Florida and Visit Florida. (Since that time, Corcoran has proposed slashing Visit Florida’s budget but not kill it.) ""When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida, they are hurting our poorest communities. They're hurting our rural communities,"" said Scott, a Republican. We went in search of evidence to determine if Enterprise Florida helped rural communities. (Scott also mentioned poor communities, but that is more difficult to assess without a definition, so we set that aside for now.) It’s possible that some of the companies offered incentive deals would have created jobs anyway. And experts told us that these job gains cited by Scott’s administration are small, even for counties with lower populations. Enterprise Florida’s hot water, explained There is evidence that deals by Enterprise Florida, a quasi-governmental agency largely funded through tax dollars, don’t always amount to jobs. In January, a joint report by the state Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability and the office of the state’s chief economist criticized many of the programs. They either ""underperformed,"" had been ""unable to achieve job goals"" or had ""inadequate reporting requirements,"" according to the report. Most of the incentives money was awarded to existing Florida businesses that have over 1,000 employees, according to the report. Chief economist Amy Baker told state legislators in January that nearly 70 percent of state-level incentive and investment programs lost money during the past three years. We wanted to know the picture for rural areas. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, which tracks created jobs, sent us data showing 2,048 jobs had been created in rural counties as a result of Enterprise Florida incentive projects since Scott took office. There are some caveats about this data — including a 12- to 18-month lag for companies to report the number of jobs created and for the state to confirm the numbers. Here are a few examples of incentive projects (some with familiar, big-store names): In Taylor County, an agreement with Buckeye Technologies resulted in 38 jobs and state spending of $7.4 million as of 2013. In Columbia County, an agreement with Target resulted in 257 jobs and the state spending nearly $1.8 million as of 2012. In Gilchrist County, an agreement with Ice River Springs Marianna, a bottled water manufacturer, resulted in 35 jobs and the state spending $69,900 as of 2013. In Jackson County, an agreement with Family Dollar Services, Inc. resulted in 440 jobs and the state spending about $2.3 million as of 2012. The department also sent data showing that private-sector employment in most rural counties increased between 2010 and 2016, with Columbia County leading the way. The growth mirrored the state and national economy as the country recovered from the recession. Unanswered question: Did incentive money create jobs? Even though some jobs in rural counties did materialize, Scott can’t prove that they were created only as a result of Enterprise Florida’s involvement. ""It is never valid to point to aggregate economic trends as a way of justifying incentive programs, because incentives are too small and touch too few employers to be a credible cause of broad employment trends,"" said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a labor-funded resource center that tracks subsidies. We tried to get to get an idea of how many new jobs in rural counties could be the result of government assistance, and Moody’s analyst Kwame Donaldson offered to crunch the numbers. (He defined rural counties as those which don’t include one of the 22 metropolitan areas. That means Donaldson counted 23 counties while the state counted 29.) By Donaldson’s count, there were 48,000 more jobs in rural counties since January 2011, a 25 percent jump. The growth was higher than growth in metro areas, he added. The state claimed responsibility for 2,048 jobs — or around 5 percent of 48,000. That’s not significant compared with the natural growth of rural areas, Donaldson said. ""Florida’s rural counties have had an exceptional level of job growth, and if 95 percent of this growth occurred without state intervention, than the rural growth rate would have been exceptional even without the Enterprise Florida projects,"" he said. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at business-backed Florida TaxWatch, said he believes the state Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida help rural areas. A small economic development project can go a long way for impact in a small county, he said. ""But if it is ‘enough’ or if taxpayers are getting a positive return on rural efforts is hard to answer,"" he said. To the workers and their families who have those jobs, they are significant, said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. ""Relevant to the size of Florida’s economy overall the number may seem small,"" he said, ""but compared to the size of some of these rural communities they matter much more."" However, a state report by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida shows that very few of incentive programs affected rural or poor areas of the state. Of 107 projects with executed agreements in 2015-16, five programs were in distressed areas that include rural and urban communities. ""These projects have committed to create 408 new jobs and are expected to invest more than $110 million into these areas,"" states the report. Note that is a commitment to create those jobs -- they haven’t necessarily materialized. While Scott claims that Enterprise Florida has helped poor and rural communities, Florida’s job growth rate has lagged behind the national average between 2007 and 2015, which overlaps with Scott’s tenure and his predecessor Gov. Charlie Crist, according to an analysis by the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times shortly before the presidential election. (The newspapers are partners behind PolitiFact Florida.) During the same time period, the poverty rate increased in the majority of Florida counties at a greater pace than the nation. The Times/Herald did a comprehensive review of Scott’s overall jobs record in 2013 and found despite promises of millions of tax breaks and incentives, few of the promised jobs materialized. Our ruling Scott said, ""When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida ... they’re hurting our rural communities."" There have been some jobs created in rural areas through Enterprise Florida projects. Those jobs certainly help those workers. But Scott’s claim over-hypes the consequences of ending Enterprise Florida’s incentives for rural communities. Job gains through Enterprise Florida projects have been relatively small compared with overall job growth in those counties. Nonpartisan reviews of incentive programs don't prove that rural communities rely on Enterprise Florida for economic stability. Finally, Scott can’t prove that the jobs would not have materialized without the state money. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC86180>],/factchecks/2017/feb/22/rick-scott/war-florida-house-about-enterprise-florida-gov-ric/
"['Legal Issues', 'Supreme Court', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Tammy Baldwin changes views on how quickly to act on a Supreme Court nomination
","Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin was one of many U.S. senators who abruptly switched from offense to defense in the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The contrast has been particularly sharp when it comes to Supreme Court nominees. Baldwin, a Democrat, was a vocal supporter of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee, but was quick to push back against Trump’s nomination of Neil Gorsuch. When Garland was nominated in March 2016, Republicans moved to block his nomination, which prompted the ire of Democrats. Baldwin declared: ""It’s the constitutional duty of the president to select a Supreme Court nominee, and the Senate has a responsibility to give that nominee a fair consideration with a timely hearing and a timely vote."" Baldwin also tweeted in May 2016 that Garland deserved ""an up or down vote,"" adding the hashtag #doyourjob. Since the Republican-led Senate never held a confirmation hearing or vote for Garland, the seat remained open for Trump to fill. He announced Gorsuch as that pick Jan. 31, 2017. Two days later, Baldwin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she would support a filibuster to block the Gorsuch nomination, would vote against the Senate action required to block a filibuster and would vote against Gorsuch if he made it to a final vote. Is that consistent with her position on Garland’s nomination that the Senate should vote for a nominee in a timely manner? We thought that was a question for the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. Not all votes created equal The Garland and Gorsuch nominations came up in dramatically different contexts — one a nominee late in a lame duck presidency, the other immediately after a highly divisive campaign. Baldwin — like most other senators — switched sides between the two nominees. In an email, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus said the senator’s position is consistent because she supported a hearing, a committee vote and a floor vote for both nominees. But the voting claim isn’t quite that simple. Figuring this out means diving into Senate rules of procedure. When the minority party filibusters an initiative, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours. For cloture to pass, it must be supported by 60 of the 100 senators. That creates a higher threshold for nomination. Gorsuch would otherwise need only a majority to be approved — and the Republicans hold that majority. Cloture is unusual but not unprecedented, having been used four times for Supreme Court nominees since 1968. Kraus said Baldwin is consistent because she ""supports"" a cloture vote, even though she would vote against Gorsuch in that vote. But cloture is a maneuver executed by the majority party (Republicans in this case), so Baldwin’s ""support"" for that is both unnecessary and irrelevant. (Cloture and the 60-vote threshold itself could also become irrelevant if Republicans choose to use what has been termed the ""nuclear option,"" a parliamentary procedure by which they can use majority votes to override the requirement for a supermajority, effectively overcoming a filibuster with just 51 votes. Democrats did this to push through Obama’s lower court appointments in 2013, but it hasn’t been used for a Supreme Court nominee.) Baldwin said during the Garland process the Senate should give him ""fair consideration,"" and she pledged the same thing to Gorsuch in a statement issued the day of his nomination. Two days later she announced plans to vote against Gorsuch, before meeting with him or participating in any hearing process. Gov. Scott Walker labeled Baldwin a hypocrite on Twitter for telling others to meet with Garland but deciding on Gorsuch before meeting with him. But Kraus said Baldwin had reviewed the backgrounds and records of Gorsuch and other finalists before Trump’s announcement. He said that allowed time to give fair consideration before deciding she would oppose Gorsuch due to a ""record of ruling against disabled students, against workers and against women’s reproductive health care."" Our rating When Baldwin’s party put forth a Supreme Court nominee, she advocated for a ""timely vote"" and an ""up or down vote."" A common-sense interpretation is that she wanted a final nomination vote, where passing meant being approved by the Senate. But now that Baldwin is in the minority and facing a Republican nominee, she is supporting a filibuster that creates a roadblock to reaching that final vote. Her claim to ""support"" a cloture vote makes no sense since that isn’t up to her party — cloture would be pushed by Republicans and is only needed if Baldwin and other Democrats pursue a filibuster. And that cloture vote would only advance the process, not result in a final decision on Gorsuch. That’s what we call a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFE2CC0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/22/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-changes-views-how-quickly-act-suprem/

How have U.S. sanctions impacted Russia's economy?
","Since President Donald Trump took office, the Russian military has patrolled the U.S. East Coast with a spy ship, buzzed an American warship with a fighter jet in the Black Sea, and defied an arms control treaty by deploying a new cruise missile. These sorts of military exercises aren’t far out of the ordinary, but they have drawn more attention than usual amid heightened concern about Trump’s ties to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin is testing Trump’s response, just as any country would when its adversary gets a new leader, said CNN national security commentator Anthony Tata, a former Army brigadier general and novelist. Another explanation, Tata said, is Putin is trying to divert attention from Russia’s struggling economy. ""Putin is our enemy, there’s no question about that, and his country is imploding,"" Tata said on CNN Feb. 19. ""The sanctions that we put on them for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine, so they could get more natural resources down there … have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well."" Speculation abounds regarding whether Trump might roll back sanctions against Russia or soften the U.S. position on Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, so we were curious about Tata’s claim that the sanctions have damaged the Russian economy. Tata has the general trend right — Russia’s economy is struggling, no question — but his numbers are slightly off. Additionally, experts said sanctions may have impacted the Russian economy, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices worldwide. Numbers are close Tata claims 50 percent drops for both Russia’s currency and gross domestic product since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, a region of Ukraine. Former President Barack Obama's administration first launched sanctions against Russia in response in March 2014. The European Union soon followed with its own sanctions. Separately, Obama imposed additional sanctions in late 2016, after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russian actors interfered in the U.S. presidential election. Starting with Russia’s currency, the ruble has lost significant value since the 2014 sanctions were put in place. In February 2014, one ruble was worth about 2.8 cents. Then the value dropped steeply over the next couple years, reaching a low point of about 1.2 cents per ruble in January 2016. That’s an approximately 57 percent drop. However, despite the fact that the sanctions remain in place, the ruble has steadily creeped up over the past year, reaching a value of 1.7 cents per ruble as of Feb. 21, 2017. That’s about 40 percent less than the value before the sanctions went into effect. Russia’s GDP has also fallen over the past couple years. Tata specifically mentioned 2014-16. Russia’s GDP was  $2.053 trillion (in U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to the World Bank, dropping to $1.331 trillion in 2015 — a drop of about 35 percent. Adjusted for inflation, however, the drop was more like 3.7 percent because of the struggling ruble. Russia’s 2016 GDP is not yet available, but the Russian government has reported very little change from 2015. Effect of the sanctions The U.S. sanctions against Russia targeted specific individuals, firms and sectors close to Putin. For example, they froze U.S.-held assets that belong to some major Russian companies and banks. Experts had mixed opinions about the extent of the sanctions’ impact on Russia’s economy compared with other factors, notably falling oil prices. Declining oil prices worldwide since 2012 are the primary reason for Russia’s economic woes given the country’s dependence on oil revenue and exports, said Susanne Wengle, a University of Notre Dame professor who studies Russia’s political economy. The Russian government’s revenue is tied to oil prices, so a struggling oil industry significantly affects both the private and public sector, Wengle said. In its long-term budget projections, Russia assumed oil prices above $100 per barrel, but in 2016, prices sometimes dropped below $30. If the sanctions weren’t in place, ""the Russian economy would likely have struggled just as much,"" she said. Beyond oil, Russia strained its budget by intervening in Crimea and depleting its reserves during the global financial crisis in 2008-09, said Sarah Wilson Sokhey, a University of Colorado, Boulder, professor who studies Russian politics and its economy. Although Sokhey doesn’t think the sanctions have had a huge impact on the economy as a whole, she said certain individuals who do international business or who import certain products, especially foods, have taken a hit. For example, Russia banned importing European cheeses as a counter-sanction, so local cheesemakers had to make their own brie instead of getting it from France. ""It’s not a trivial thing,"" Sokhey said of the sanctions. ""The Russian government would like to get rid of them, but it’s not something that is seriously hurting them or leading to widespread discontent."" Mitchell Orenstein, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert on the political economy in Eastern Europe, said he believes sanctions have significantly impacted the Russian economy by massively limiting foreign investment in Russia. The sanctions exacerbate the oil crisis by limiting Russian access to technology and capital. ""Sanctions are certainly a big part of the economic decline in Russia, which explains why President Putin has made it such a high priority to get rid of sanctions,"" Orenstein said. ""It makes it much less attractive for companies to do business in or with Russia."" The International Monetary Fund has said international sanctions and the oil price drop were ""dual shocks"" to the Russian economy. The organization estimated that all sanctions against Russia for its activity in Ukraine, as well as Russia’s own counter-sanctions, could reduce inflation-adjusted GDP by up to 1.5 percent. For a more thorough rundown of economic analyses regarding the impact of sanctions on Russia, see this Feb. 17, 2017, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. In an email, Tata told PolitiFact that he did not mean sanctions are the only cause of Russia’s economic problems. Rather, he was making a broader point that Putin is trying to shift eyes away from his country’s economic issues. ""Of course, there are other factors, but Putin despises the West in part because of the sanctions,"" he said. Our ruling Tata said, ""The sanctions that we put on (Russia) for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine ... have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well."" Russia’s ruble fell more than 50 percent in the year following the start of sanctions in 2014, but it started to regain value in 2016. There are no GDP figures yet for Russia in 2016, but from 2014 to 2015, it fell by about 35 percent. It seems a drop in oil prices are the main driver of Russia’s problems. But sanctions play at least some role — though it’s hard to evaluate exactly how much given the country’s oil crisis.   Tata is right that Russia’s economy has struggled in recent years, though his numbers are a little off. More critically, sanctions are only part of the reason for Russia's economic troubles. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA2DC00>],/factchecks/2017/feb/21/anthony-tata/how-have-sanctions-impacted-russias-economy/

Muslims offended their kids have to sing the national anthem? That was an Australian controversy
","A series of Internet posts implying that Muslim parents don’t want their kids to sing the national anthem has continued to cause a stir, mostly by not making it clear to readers that the controversy is actually years old — and in Australia. ""Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem,"" read the headline on a post we first saw Feb. 20, 2017, on LadyLibertysNews.com. Facebook brought it to our attention as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear its news feeds of fake news. The post was one of many others across cyberspace that discussed how an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children must sing the national anthem. Though some choppy grammar and poor editing made it difficult to know what was a direct quote, we gleaned that a Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman named Unthman Badar said the national anthem was part of a concerted effort of ""forced assimilation"" of Muslims by Australian officials. But the post included two deceptive photos of schoolchildren standing at attention before an American flag in a classroom. Let’s be clear: There is a controversial pro-Islamic group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir, and their spokesman Uthman Badar (note the spelling difference) did say Muslim children should not sing the national anthem. But what’s not entirely clear from the story is that this happened during a contentious meeting about the strain of Islamic citizens assimilating into Australian culture, held in Sydney on Nov. 1, 2015. ""This imposition of values is manifest in matters such as the insistence of senior government ministers that Muslim children sing the national anthem – an anthem which reflects a particular, disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values ... Why should they be forced to sing it?"" Badar said, according to news reports. (Watch his speech above; the relevant portion starts around the 9:50 mark.) ""It is nothing less than forced assimilation ... sought to be justif­ied by exaggerated fear of a security threat,"" he added. The Australian anthem reads: Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;
We've golden soil and wealth for toil;
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in nature’s gifts;
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history's page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair Beneath our radiant Southern Cross,
We'll toil with hearts and hands,
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands,
For those who've come across the seas
We've boundless plains to share,
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia fair. The LadyLibertysNews.com story did mention that the story was about Australia, but you had to read carefully to see that. Their post on Facebook was even more deceptive. It includes the caption, ""If you're offended by our beautiful flag, representing the blood that has been shed defending this great country, you can go back to the hell hole you came from!!"" The LadyLibertysNews.com Facebook page includes a picture of President Donald Trump taking the oath of office and is written from an American perspective. To the site’s credit, when we contacted them via Facebook message about the post on Feb. 20, they conceded the photo choice was incorrect. Shortly thereafter, they changed the images to a single photo of the Australian flag. As of this writing, they have not amended their Facebook post, which had been shared more than 13,000 times. Our ruling A blog post claiming that Muslims are offended ""their kids have to recite national anthem"" linked to a deceptively edited post that includes images of children standing at attention before an American flag. In reality, the genesis of the story is not from America but Australia, where a spokesman for an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children should be forced to sing the Australian national anthem. The post, which has been altered after we inquired, is definitely misleading but not altogether fake. It also comes from 2015, which isn’t mentioned in the post being virally shared.

Did John McCain violate Logan Act with call to Australian ambassador?
","U.S. Sen. John McCain’s attempt to smooth over a contentious phone call between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was against the law, according to several bloggers. But their ire toward the Arizona Republican relies on a hard-to-establish link to a highly politicized law that no one has ever been convicted of violating. ""McCain caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country,"" blared the Facebook headline on several Internet posts critical of the senator on or after Feb. 3, 2017. The social media site flagged at least one undated example as part of its efforts to squash fake stories in users’ news feeds. In this case, the post isn’t fake in that details were made up, rather just inaccurate in how the details are portrayed. The posts reference an initial phone call Trump made to Turnbull on Jan. 28. That call allegedly turned sour when Trump balked over an agreement former President Barack Obama struck to take in 1,250 refugees that Australia held in offshore detention centers. But the ""highly illegal phone call"" that McCain made was on Feb. 2, when he contacted Australian ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey to assure Hockey of McCain’s ""unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance."" ""I asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote,"" McCain said in a statement. That caused an uproar in some corners of the Internet. Several websites repurposed or made reference to an undated post that appears to originate at AngryPatriotMovement.com, which carried the same headline about McCain breaking the law. The post linked to a Feb 3 BizPacReview.com article that said McCain was ""undermining"" Trump, and said McCain’s call to Australia’s ambassador ""might be a violation of the Logan Act."" ""The Logan Act says ANY citizen of the United States who ‘without permission of the United States’ either directly or indirectly ‘commences or carries on correspondence’ with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to ‘influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer’ in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years — or both,"" the AngryPatriotMovement.com post read. But really, McCain wasn’t ""caught"" doing anything. His office put out the press release about contacting Hockey. And the Logan Act isn’t necessarily a law designed to root out near-treasonous behavior, the way the blogs make it sound. The Logan Act dates back to 1798, when a Pennsylvania state legislator named George Logan went to France to negotiate a peace settlement over debts with the United States during the French Revolution, according to the Washington Post. You’ll recall Paul Giamatti agonizing over the issue in HBO’s John Adams. Adams’ Federalist Party had opposed Logan’s efforts, so they passed a law that said private citizens couldn’t work on foreign policy issues without the government allowing it. No one has ever been charged with a crime under the Logan Act, but its name comes up from time to time, usually when a lawmaker has contacted a foreign official for some purpose the opposing party doesn’t like. Some brought up the act when U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., went to Syria as Speaker of the House to attempt to wheel and deal with President Bashar al-Assad in 2007. It also was mentioned when 47 Republican senators wrote a letter to Iran in 2015 to try to scuttle Obama’s nuclear treaty. It even came up when Trump, as the GOP presidential nominee, asked Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails last year. It’s highly doubtful that McCain, who has made a habit of serving as a foil for Trump, actually violated federal law. Stanford law professor Michael McConnell doubted the Logan Act could be used to keep a senator from talking to a country’s envoy about foreign affairs, which senators often do. ""So far as publicly available information indicates, Sen. McCain spoke with the Australian ambassador to assure the nation of his own unwavering support — not to influence any ‘measures or conduct,’"" McConnell told us in an email. Our ruling Bloggers claim McCain was ""caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country."" The claim reads as if McCain tried to break federal law by influencing a foreign official, perhaps by secrecy. That’s not the case at all, but a reader wouldn’t get that impression.

Do most mass shootings happen in gun-free zones?
","In the wake of mass shootings at the Pulse night club in Orlando and at the Fort Lauderdale airport, Florida lawmakers are expected to act on a series of bills to expand where people can carry their guns. The bills would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry their guns in places such as airports, schools, college campuses, police stations and polling places. Florida leads the nation in conceal-carry permits with more than 1.7 million permits. Republican House Speaker Richard Corcoran supports expanding the list of where permit holders can carry their guns, possibly as a way to avert future attacks. (So does President Donald Trump, who promised to get rid of gun-free zones in schools and military bases.) ""Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit,"" he told CBS4 Miami’s Jim DeFede on Feb. 12. (By ""arenas"" Corcoran seemed to be referring to places in general, not sports arenas.) Corcoran argued that people who commit mass shootings say they chose certain areas because they ""knew nobody had guns."" That raises an interesting question, but it’s separate from the focus of this fact-check: whether most mass shootings happen in places where concealed carry permits don’t apply, or ""gun-free zones.""   Corcoran was citing research from a pro-gun advocate who reached that conclusion. But anti-gun advocates have argued that the data isn’t so clear cut; they see other patterns in the statistical evidence. Overall, the evidence remains murky and depends on how researchers define ""gun-free"" or ""mass shooting.""   Varying definitions of mass shootings Corcoran’s spokesman said he was referring to the numbers of mass public shootings compiled by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott’s research has been quoted by those who support expanding gun rights, but academics often attack his research as flawed. His book More Guns, Less Crime has been a subject of ongoing academic and policy debates as well numerous fact-checks. His book argues that crime data over multiple years shows reductions in crime in states that have ""right to carry"" laws. But many other academics have said his work doesn’t account for other factors that influence crime rates, and that he manipulates the data to reach his conclusions. The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that ""no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data."" Before we delve into the numbers compiled by Lott, we will explain why it’s complicated to make sweeping claims of mass shootings in gun-free zones. There is not an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting -- even the federal government has cited various criteria at times. FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer pointed to a 2012 law setting the threshold for a ""mass killing""  as three or more people killed, but another report by the federal Congressional Research Service says that  ""mass murder"" has been defined generally as a threshold of four or more deaths. Lott points to the types of shootings the FBI included in this study of active shooter situations, but that study clearly says it isn’t covering all mass shootings. Lott said he included mass shootings in which four or more were killed that occurred in public, and he excluded those that occurred within the commission of another crime such as an armed robbery. Lott’s data showed that between 1988 and 2015, about 3.8 percent of mass shootings occurred in areas where guns were allowed. Everytown for Gun Safety found that among 133 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015, 70 percent took place in private homes while 13 percent took place in ""gun-free zones,"" where carrying of concealed guns were prohibited. Another 17 percent took place in public areas where the carrying of firearms are allowed. Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has disagreed with Lott’s findings, pointed to research by Louis Klarevas, a professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In Klarevas’ book Rampage Nation, he said that Lott has used too loose a concept of gun-free zones. Klarevas disagrees with gun advocates who define a ""gun-free zone"" as simply an area that bans private citizens from carrying a gun.   For example, Lott characterized Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard, military sites attacked by gunmen, as gun-free despite the presence of armed security. ""There’s an obvious logical problem with such a conceptualization: How can a place be a gun-free zone if guns are present?"" Klarevas writes. ""The implication is that rampage shooters are only deterred by armed civilians, not by armed guards and cops. But that’s an absurd suggestion."" Klarevas uses three definitions: he refers to ""gun-free zones"" as places where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, and there aren’t armed personnel stationed on the property. He calls ""gun-restricting zones"" as places where civilians can’t carry guns, yet armed security is routinely present -- such as military facilities or certain college campuses. He refers to places that allow civilians to carry guns as ""gun-allowing zones."" Using these categories, Klarevas examined 111 shootings since 1966 in which six or more people had been killed in each incident -- regardless of whether it occurred in a public or private location or if it was in the commission of another crime. He found 13 took place in gun-free zones and five took place in gun-restricting zones. That means that the majority occurred in areas where there was no evidence that private guns were prohibited. Since Klarevas includes mass shootings in private residences or during the commission of another crime, that means that he counts several additional incidents that aren’t factored in by Lott. For example, as a mass shooting in a ""gun-allowing zone,"" Klarevas counts a gunfight between two rival biker gangs in Waco,Texas, in 2015 that left nine people dead. So that’s an example of a shooting that wasn’t in a gun-free zone that is omitted from Lott’s calculations. The two also disagree on how to characterize whether guns were allowed at certain locations. Lott says that the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon was in a gun-free zone and points to a school policy that bans possession of firearms ""except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations."" Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis previously told PolitiFact Florida the school’s gun-free policy didn’t apply to students with a valid permit. ""UCC was never designated as a ‘gun-free zone’ by any signage or policy,"" she said. ""Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus."" Our ruling Corcoran said, ""Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit."" Corcoran cites research by an advocate for gun rights who used a strict definition to define places where guns were not allowed. In reality, there are places where concealed weapons are permitted, places where police or security officers openly carry weapons, and places where concealed weapons are not permitted. Additionally, there are different ways to define mass shootings. We found that advocates for more gun control analyzed the data and reached different conclusions. Our assessment is that it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the motivations of the perpetrators of mass shootings or whether they are influenced by gun restrictions. We rate Corcoran’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3a9f4fdc-aed8-4f53-9794-18cf41d2bea7",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA87D00>],/factchecks/2017/feb/21/richard-corcoran/do-most-mass-shootings-happen-gun-free-zones/

What’s missing from Amtrak’s claim that we rely ‘more than ever’ on trains
","Amtrak CEO Wick Moorman spoke in front of a Senate subcommittee earlier this week. Per usual, he was lobbying for more federal funding for Amtrak, which operates at a loss every year and claims to need more money to service its aging infrastructure.    Philadelphia knows about the importance of Amtrak as much as any city. Not only does Amtrak have offices here, 30th Street Station is the third-busiest station in the country, and the failure of the company to implement positive train control contributed to the deadly crash of Amtrak 188 in 2015 in Frankford. In this plea to get more funding, Moorman called on the rising need for train travel in America. ""More than ever,"" he said, ""our nation and the traveling public rely on Amtrak for mobility.""   Are we really more reliant on Amtrak than ever?   First of all, the Amtrak era began in 1971, long after the heyday of trains in the 19th century and earlier in the 20th century. During World War II, for example, nearly 10 times as many passenger miles were accumulated annually as were the last few years. But Moorman specified Amtrak, so we’ll only check from 1971 on. And in terms of total passengers, Amtrak has never been more popular. Ridership hit a record 31.3 million in fiscal year 2016. It was 30.8 million in 2015, and since 2010 ridership has topped 30 million each year but has not increased each year.   That’s only one statistic, though. Another way to measure the frequency of travel on Amtrak is passenger miles, and the most recent data for passenger miles shows the train system trending slightly downward. For fiscal year 2016, 6.5 billion passenger miles were traveled on Amtrak. That’s one million fewer miles traveled than the previous year and two million fewer than Amtrak projected for the year — but still about one billion more than Amtrak had in 2000. Trains were also emptier than in the previous year, with a 50.9 percent average load in 2016, compared to 51.3 percent in 2015. Another way to gauge the public’s reliance on Amtrak would be to compare its passenger miles as a percentage of overall passenger miles of similar travel options. And according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Amtrak is taking up a smaller share of those miles when sized up against airline passenger miles and highway bus miles. The Congressional Budget Office has measured Amtrak against these two other forms of transportation in past reports. In 2014, the most recent year the Department of Transportation has available for the three options, Amtrak’s passenger miles represented .7 percent of miles traveled. That’s a negligible amount lower than in 2010, but higher than in 2000. It’s lower than in 1990, when Amtrak passenger miles accounted for 1.2 percent of total passenger miles traveled across bus, air and train in the United States. There’s been a similar decline in Amtrak’s share across the same time period when you take into account all highway passenger miles and not just bus. This would indicate that despite Amtrak’s recent growth in passengers and steady rate of passenger miles traveled per year, the service is being used for a smaller percentage of overall travel than in years past.         We asked Amtrak’s media relations team for clarification on Moorman’s comment but never heard back.   Our Ruling In a plea for more federal funding, Amtrak CEO Wick Moorman told a Senate subcommittee, ""More than ever, our nation and the traveling public rely on Amtrak for mobility."" In terms of passengers, Amtrak has never been more popular. Its ridership reached a record 31.3 million in 2016. But the train service is lagging in other ways. The number of passenger miles traveled on Amtrak in 2016 was 6.5 billion, fewer than the previous year and fewer than what Amtrak projected. Passenger miles traveled on Amtrak also represent a smaller share when compared to highway bus and air miles traveled than in the past.

Donald Trump in Florida laments 'what's happening last night in Sweden.' But nothing happened
","Defending his immigrant travel ban at a Feb. 18 campaign rally, President Donald Trump referred to several places that have taken in a large number of refugees and have recently been attacked. Trump mentioned well-documented terrorist attacks in Europe alongside an apparently sinister occurrence we had not heard about — in Sweden. ""We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany. You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,"" Trump said at the Melbourne, Fla., event. ""Sweden? Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. ""You look at what's happening in Brussels,"" he continued. ""You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris."" Was there an immigrant-linked incident in Sweden the night before Trump’s rally? Call it the ""Bowling Green massacre,"" part II. Sweden has let in a large number of immigrants and refugees. But we couldn’t find any evidence that indicates Sweden’s immigration policy is causing the types of problems with terrorist incidents that Trump suggested — and we couldn’t find any record of an attack by terrorists or immigrants in Sweden on the night of Feb. 17, or any night recently. So, what really happened in Sweden on Friday? Not much. Swedish officials were quick to share their dismay of Trump’s comments on Twitter. ""Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound,"" Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister, said on Twitter. Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj One of the country's official Twitter accounts, @swedense, shared tweets from a verified account controlled by a different person each week.  ""Nothing happened here in Sweden,"" one tweet read.  Wonder what #lastnightinsweden was really all about? This week's @sweden tells it straight. pic.twitter.com/e3UNiFiifF Sweden's Aftonbladet tabloid snarkily summarized the news from the evening of Feb. 17 in English in response to Trump’s claim. Among six news stories highlighted: a man set himself on fire in Stockholm, a popular Swedish singer had technical difficulties during a performance, and harsh weather closed roads in northern Sweden. We scoured international reports from the LexisNexis database and still came up short on attacks or anything particularly newsworthy. In addition to Swedish officials, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Foreign Ministry told the Associated Press on Feb. 19 that the Swedish government was not aware of any ""terror-linked major incidents"" that occurred on the night of Feb. 17. We wondered what Trump could have been referring to. The White House did not respond to our query. Some reports linked Trump’s comment to a clip that aired on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show Feb. 17. Carlson interviewed Ami Horowitz, who directed a documentary about Sweden and refugees. ""Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already,"" Horowitz said during the interview.   Shortly after this fact-check published, Trump issued a response on Twitter that confirmed he was going off of a Fox report on Swedish immigration. My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden. It’s unclear what attack Horowitz was referencing, but there are a few notable Sweden attacks worth mentioning. In October 2016 in the city of Malmo, a Syrian national targeted a mosque and community center with a Molotov cocktail. No one was killed, and this attack was cited by the White House in its list of 78 incidents ""under-reported"" by the media (even though each was covered). And back in 2010, suicide bomber Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly struck central Stockholm. The perpetrator, an Iraqi-born Swede, died and injured two others. The most recent example of an attack in Sweden happened in early January 2017, though it wasn’t linked to immigrants or refugees. Three neo-Nazis attacked an asylum-seeker center with homemade bombs. The incident left one person injured, according to reports. Sweden’s immigration policy Until recently, Sweden had welcomed immigrants and refugees. The Nordic country has taken in more than 250,000 refugees and immigrants applications since 2014, according to the Swedish Migration Agency. Between 2014 and 2015, asylum applications doubled in Sweden from about 81,000 to 163,000 as more Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and unaccompanied minors sought entry. In 2016, that number dropped dramatically with Sweden only processed about 29,000 applications. Because of the large number of refugees taken in 2015, the Swedish government announced it would be changing its policies to encourage people to seek refuge in other countries. Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the Swedish Institute, told the New York Times he was perplexed by Trump’s insinuation. ""I do not have a clue what he was referring to,"" Selin told the New York Times. ""Obviously, this could be connected to the fact that there has been a lot of negative reporting about Sweden, since Sweden has taken in a lot of refugees."" He recently completed a study looking at the negative news reports about Sweden’s intake of refugees. It concluded that the news reports were ""highly exaggerated and not based in facts,"" he told the newspaper. Sweden found support via Twitter from their Finnish neighbor. ""Dear @realDonaldTrump, Sweden is immigration friendly, international & liberal,"" said Alexander Stubb, the former prime minister of Finland. ""One of the most prosperous, richest, safest places on earth."" Dear @realDonaldTrump, Sweden is immigration friendly, international & liberal.

Sen. Bob Menendez says immigration raids 'not business as usual'
","Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez says recent sweeps by federal authorities of immigrants living in the country illegally are ""striking fear"" in immigrant communities because they have not been limited to criminals, a category President Donald Trump labeled as his top priority. ""The raids are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens,"" the senator from New Jersey said in a video posted on his Twitter account Feb. 13. ""And because the administration eliminated the Obama administration’s enforcement priorities — where the first and top enforcement were criminal aliens to be deported, then secondly recent border crossers, and then the third and final tier was anybody else — because they did away with that enforcement priority list, now anyone who they come upon who may be undocumented ultimately gets picked up and sent away."" To the so-called party of family values: Tearing immigrant families apart is NOT the answer. #ICERaids pic.twitter.com/hVASZprcFw Trump campaigned on promises to deport immigrants illegally in the country, prioritizing the removal of those who have been convicted of crimes or pose threats to national security, such as drug dealers and murderers. Is Menendez accurate in claiming that recent immigration sweeps are not business as usual and include people without criminal convictions? We found that recent operations are routine, but they also included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Trump’s executive order prioritizing removals Less than a week after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that directed the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize for removal a broad range of people, including individuals convicted of crimes ""involving moral turpitude"" (such as murder); engaged in terrorist activities; convicted of any criminal offense; charged with any criminal offense, even if the charge has not been resolved; with final orders of removal; and individuals who commit acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense. Trump’s priorities ""sweep far more broadly,"" and ""do not set up an internal hierarchy to indicate which categories should be emphasized when resources are short — as they always are,"" said David A. Martin, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Virginia and immigration expert, in an analysis for Vox. The executive order basically takes the broadest possible definition of ""criminal alien,"" said Martin, a former principal deputy general counsel at DHS, in an interview with PolitiFact. In the later years of Obama’s administration, the top priority for removal were threats to national security, border security, and public safety; ranked as a second priority were individuals convicted of misdemeanors, recent immigration law violators and individuals who had ""significantly abused"" visa programs; the lowest priority were individuals who had been issued a final order for removal on or after Jan. 1, 2014. Prior to outlining those priorities in November 2014, Obama was labeled by immigrants’ rights activists as ""Deporter-in-Chief"" because his administration had deported more than 2 million people. ICE targeted operations across the country In the early days of the Trump administration, elected officials and media outlets have reported that hundreds of immigrants were arrested in cities across America, including people who immigrant rights advocates say don’t fit Trump’s prominent descriptions of public safety threats. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement Feb. 13 that said an agency within his department, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, last week conducted a series of targeted enforcement operations in multiple cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, which led to the arrest of more than 680 people. About 75 percent of them had been convicted of crimes that included but were not limited to homicide, aggravated sexual abuse and drug trafficking, the statement said. The operations also targeted ""individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges,"" Kelly said. The targeted operations have been common practice for many years, he said. An ICE spokeswoman provided PolitiFact fact sheets for targeted operations in recent days and also highlighted previous operations under the Obama administration that focused on arresting criminals living in the country illegally. A December 2012 Congressional Research Service report on interior immigration enforcement said ICE’s National Fugitive Operations Program targets included at-large criminal aliens and ""fugitive aliens who have not been convicted of a crime."" As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted, fugitive operations in fiscal year 2010 (Obama’s first full fiscal year) led to 35,774 arrests. In fiscal 2011, there were 39,466 arrests. Still, Menendez’s office pointed to parts of Kelly’s statement that said 75 percent -- not 100 percent -- of those arrested were criminal aliens and to the line saying that among the arrested were individuals who had violated immigration laws. To further contrast Trump and Obama’s policies, the senator’s team also referenced a recent deportee, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. The 35-year-old woman had been living in Arizona and had a deportation order, but instead of removing her from the country, the Obama administration required her to check in periodically as they focused on deporting violent criminals, the New York Times reported. She was arrested during her last check-in with ICE and deported Feb. 9. ICE said they removed Garcia de Rayos because she had a felony conviction and a deportation order. The Mexican national had used a fake Social Security number for employment and pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, according to the Washington Post. A day after Menendez’s claim that recent immigration sweeps ""are not business as usual,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in an MSNBC interview Feb. 14 said he had been told by ICE that there were people arrested who had no other violation besides being in the country unlawfully. ""But some of them were caught up wrong place, wrong time. They're going after somebody, somebody else was in the apartment and they got taken up,"" Garcetti said. On Feb. 15, Reuters reported that a 23-year-old Mexican man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, who had been granted deferred deportation protection during the Obama administration was detained by immigration authorities Feb. 10 in Washington state. ICE told Reuters that Ramirez was arrested ""based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety."" Ramirez’s lawyers told the news agency he had been pressured by ICE agents ""to falsely admit affiliation."" Ramirez’s detention was not connected to the recent targeted enforcement actions, ICE said. He was arrested when officers went to a home to take into custody another person, a previously deported convicted felon. Our ruling Menendez said that recent immigration raids ""are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens."" Deportations are being conducted on a broader basis than before. But his statement gives the impression that there are widespread deportations of law-abiding people. For the most part, deportations are still focused on people who committed other crimes. Menendez’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. Overall, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bebb6ca-9052-404a-a8b1-fd006c70c1cb",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAABB900>],/factchecks/2017/feb/17/robert-menendez/sen-bob-menendez-says-immigration-raids-not-busine/

Are 27 million people trapped in modern slavery?
","If the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker, R-Tenn., has one special cause, it is ending modern slavery. In December, he won passage of a law that uses $50 million in federal money to seed a private foundation aimed at ending forced labor and human trafficking for the sex trade. ""It's illegal in every country in the world, including ours,"" Corker said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Feb. 15, 2017. ""But, today, 27 million people, as we speak on this program, are enslaved."" That’s a big number, and we looked into the research behind it. Corker acknowledged that hard data is, well, hard to find. ""Many human trafficking and modern slavery victims are part of a hidden population, which unfortunately makes it almost impossible to count with 100 percent accuracy just how many human beings are trapped around the world,"" Corker told us. ""Fortunately, there are numbers of well-respected organizations that have done extensive work on this issue and give us a general sense of the magnitude of the problem."" One advocacy group Corker relied on is End It, which cited estimates ranging from 20 million to 45.8 million. That’s quite a span, which suggests considerable differences of opinion as to what constitutes slavery and how to measure it. Siddarth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told us the 27-million figure has been in circulation for years. Kara gives more weight to the lower estimate of 20.9 million from the International Labor Organization’s 2012 report on forced labor. That study found that 4.5 million people were trapped by sexual exploitation. Another 14.2 million were locked in work that ranged from mining, to agriculture, to domestic service and manufacturing. The situation is complex. They found that people such as migrant workers can move in and out of forced labor. In Kara’s view, the truth lies between 20 and 40 million, and ""closer to the International Labor Organization metric, I believe."" A key architect of the high-end estimate is Kevin Bales, professor of contemporary slavery at the University of Nottingham in England. Bales works closely with the Australian anti-slavery organization Walk Free to produce the Global Slavery Index. The index includes in its definition of slavery the same conditions as the International Labor Organization, but adds in child soldiers, child brides and other forced marriages. Bales told us ""the 45.8 million number is by far the most accurate."" It is based, he said, on surveys and statistical models that have been checked against multiple measures. But many long-time researchers of modern slavery strongly criticize the methods behind the Global Slavery Index. ""The trouble with this potentially admirable effort is that the data on which these tables rely is usually second-hand and often of seriously poor quality,"" wrote Neil Howard, a fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. Howard studies labor exploitation in the West African nation of Benin, one of the highest-ranked trouble spots in the index. In an op-ed in the Guardian in 2014, he said the reality is different from the story told in the index. ""I worked with teenage boys who were said to be victims of trafficking and apparently forced from Benin to the artisanal quarries of Abeokuta, in Nigeria,"" Howard wrote. ""The adolescent boys I interviewed willingly migrate to the quarries as part of a highly structured migrant network providing labor for the Beninese expatriate community that runs the quarry economy."" However, even ardent critics of the larger figures in the index still describe a problem that afflicts millions of people. Joel Quirk, professor of political studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told us the overreach for hard data is rooted in the ""huge market demand for numbers amongst journalists, government officials and the general public."" At the end of the day, Quirk said, ""I would generally go with tens of millions"" of people living in some form of slavery. Our ruling Corker said 27 million people are enslaved worldwide. He acknowledged that it is difficult to put a precise number on modern slavery. We found that different estimates defined slavery in different ways and used different methods to arrive at a number. Estimates range from 20 million to 46 million. Among the experts we reached who question the higher estimates, we heard that Corker’s figure is in the right range.

Gov. Rick Scott paints fellow Republicans as job-killers for Enterprise Florida, Visit Florida votes
","Gov. Rick Scott is painting fellow Republicans as job-killers for their support of a bill that would decimate the state’s agencies for tourism promotion and business incentives. Scott has escalated his feud with House Speaker Richard Corcoran by calling out legislators on their own turf for votes in committee to dismantle Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida. Scott credits these two groups for helping usher 1.2 million private-sector jobs into the state since he was elected. In his view, a vote to eliminate the agencies is a vote against jobs. At a stop of the ""Fighting for Florida’s Jobs"" tour in Flagler Beach, Scott targeted the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast. ""Your politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs,"" Scott said Feb. 13 to business leaders and constituents at Vessel Sandwich Co. ""That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said."" Scott continued, ""He said, 'I will sponsor the bill to eliminate marketing for tourists.' He sponsored the bill to do that and to get rid of Visit Florida."" Scott is using the jobs argument a lot lately (though not for the employees who work at the agencies). • ""When they want to say we don’t want to do any more marketing for Visit Florida, what they are saying is that we don’t need any more jobs in tourism."" (Miami Herald) • ""It’s pretty clear, if you’re not caring about people’s jobs you must be caring about something else,"" he said. ""I care about people’s jobs. What else can it be?"" (Miami Herald) • ""How can anybody say they don’t want to help a poor family get a job?"" (Miami Herald) His attack against Renner misrepresents Renner's view. There is no record of Renner saying exactly that his area doesn't need more jobs. Scott press secretary Kerri Wyland said Scott’s point is focused on the effect of Renner’s proposal. ""By choosing to sponsor this job-killing legislation, Rep. Renner is telling families in the counties he serves that the area does not need more jobs,"" she said. Renner doesn’t see the legislation as a crusade against jobs. He jokingly offered $100 to anyone who heard those words come out of his mouth. When he introduced the bill, Renner brought up a philosophical difference with Scott about the fairness of economic incentives, arguing the money could be better spent to benefit more people. ""We should be taking the hundreds of millions of dollars we’re spending on the privileged few — those few companies that are able to navigate the system — for broad-based tax reform,"" Renner said Feb. 8 at the House Careers and Competition Subcommittee meeting. ""Tax reform that benefits all businesses, small, medium and large, and if we do that we will continue to be one of the leading states in the country for job growth."" In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Renner said he prefers tax money to be invested in public safety, infrastructure and education — not marketing campaigns (see ""Sexy Beaches"") or incentives. He’s also disappointed in executives for awarding bonuses and increasing salaries of executives with state dollars. As for the jobs situation in Renner's area, the unemployment rate for Flagler County (home to Flagler Beach and Renner's Palm Coast) has been slightly higher than the state average but not alarmingly so. In December 2016, the Florida rate was 4.9 percent, compared with 5.4 percent (preliminary) in Flagler. That's down from the county's 12.3 percent rate in December 2010, before Scott took office. Scott may be hoping the legislation is a turnoff in Renner’s district, but he has some competition from the other side. Americans For Prosperity Florida started mailing fliers to Renner’s constituents, urging them to continue to support Renner’s efforts to dismantle a ""rigged"" system. And on Feb. 15, a video was posted on the Florida House of Representatives YouTube page. It uses clips of news reports about failed projects and ends with President Ronald Reagan. ""I am sure he was speaking figuratively when he said that we're not in favor of jobs,"" Renner said of Scott. ""The Florida House is full of people who believe in jobs and prosperity for everyone."" Our ruling Scott said, ""Politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs. That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said."" That is not exactly what Renner said, and it misleads voters about the issue. Renner supports legislation to eliminate funding for Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which Scott says will cost Florida jobs -- ergo, Renner supports losing jobs. Renner, naturally, sees it differently. He thinks the money would be better devoted to tax cuts. The picture is far more complex than the broad brush Scott paints. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBA50C0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/17/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-paints-fellow-republicans-job-kille/

Did 11 people get $22 million from Wisconsin's GOP-backed manufacturing and agriculture tax credit?
","Wisconsin Democrats have been ripping a tax break they say unfairly benefits the rich. Their target: A manufacturing and agriculture tax credit put in place by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature. This was the criticism leveled Jan. 30, 2017 by state Rep. Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, on ""Capital City Sunday,"" a public affairs show on WKOW-TV in Madison: ""The credit disproportionately benefits people who are the wealthiest in our population: 75 percent of the credit goes to those who make over $1 million. In fact, 11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million (in) credit. "" Similar attacks about 11 wealthy individuals were made in TV interviews earlier in the month by other Democratic state lawmakers, including Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca of Kenosha and by state Rep. Dianne Hesselbein of Middleton. Let’s check Hintz’s claim that ""11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million"" in credits from the program. A note before we dig in: Hintz’s statement could be read to mean 11 individuals who each make over $30 million each got a $22 million credit. But it’s clear from Hintz’s prior statements he meant 11 individuals who each make $30 million got a total of $22 million in credits. Previous attack The manufacturing and agriculture tax credit was inserted by Republican lawmakers into Walker’s first state budget, which was adopted in 2011. The credit didn’t take effect until 2013 and wasn’t fully phased in until 2016. It gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent. The credit’s benefit to the rich became an issue in the 2014 congressional race between Democrat Mark Harris and Republican Glenn Grothman, which Grothman won. Harris claimed that as a state senator, Grothman pushed through the credit and that once it was phased in, ""someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income"" will pay ""less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage."" Our rating was Mostly True. We found that some factory owners who earn up to roughly $2.5 million from production income would owe less in state income tax on that income than a full-time worker who earns minimum wage. But is the tax so tilted that it overwhelmingly benefits 11 people? The evidence Hintz provided us a January 2017 memo he requested from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The memo reported on figures provided by the state Department of Revenue. According to the memo: Based on income tax returns filed for tax year 2015, it’s estimated that in tax year 2017, a total of 10,613 claimants will take manufacturing and agriculture credits worth $227 million. (A claimant can be an individual or a married couple.) Included are 11 claimants who each have an income of $30 million or more. Their total credit is estimated at $22.2 million. (The 11 aren't identified.) Casey Langan, a spokesman for the Department of Revenue, confirmed the accuracy of the figures in Hintz’s claim. But he pointed out they are estimates and added: ""Large incomes would reflect large amounts of production activities and therefore attract a sizable credit. These claimants are business owners who are stimulating Wisconsin's economy."" A vice president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce has praised the credit, saying it allows manufacturers ""to compete effectively by essentially allowing them to operate tax free in Wisconsin."" In contrast, the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project says the estimated $299 million in lost income tax revenue in fiscal 2017 from the credit is ""giving a higher priority to giving tax cuts for the best-off"" rather than making investments in schools and universities. The tax credit earned Walker a Promise Kept on our Walk-O-Meter for his campaign pledge to cut manufacturing taxes. It also helped him get a Promise Kept on a pledge to review all tax policy to lighten burden on farmers and Promise Kept on a promise to reduce taxes on employers. Our rating Hintz said ""11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million (in) credit"" from Wisconsin's manufacturing and agriculture tax credit. The figures are essentially solid, coming from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau estimates that 11 claimants (individuals or married couples) who each earn over $30 million will share a total of $22 million in credits. But those are estimates, for 2017, not credits actually received.

Rauner right about cost of lawmakers' four straight pension holidays
","Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has been pushing for changes to the state’s pension funds since he first began running for governor in 2013. His proposed FY 2016 budget suggested moving all state employees into a pension plan with lower benefits. He moved away from that approach once the Illinois Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that sought changes to pension benefits. He hasn’t, however, stopped blaming the Illinois General Assembly, with its Democratic majorities, for contributing to the state’s mushrooming pension debt. As he launched an extended media crusade this year, Rauner said legislators who approved pension contribution breaks from 2005 to 2009 cost state workers and taxpayers billions. ""The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005,"" Rauner wrote in Springfield’s Capitol newspaper, ""costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate."" For several years now, Illinois has had the dubious distinction of having the worst pension debt in the nation. Illinois’ current debt was listed at $129.8 billion in November by the state General Assembly’s bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability.  We decided to dig in to Rauner’s claim that reducing payments cost billions and was like borrowing at high interest rate. Borrowed time A 2013 settlement Illinois officials made with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission confirms the reduced pension payments for the four years in question, said Laurie Cohen, senior analyst with the Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability at the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance research group. The SEC said that despite state claims that pension holidays would be offset by increased fund contributions from 2008 to 2010, a 2005 amendment allowed lawmakers to skip increasing contributions to make up for the pension contribution holidays. The SEC settlement document underscores Rauner’s claim that the delay in contributions exacerbated the state pension funds’ condition. ""Although the State disclosed the basic fact of these reduced contributions,"" it reads, ""the State did not disclose that each of these deviations exacerbated the Structural Underfunding, deferred contributions further into the future, impaired the ability of the State to meet its pension obligations, and negatively impacted the State’s creditworthiness."" Daniel Hertz, a senior policy analyst with the progressive Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, agreed Rauner’s claim was supported by the facts. In an email, Hertz said, ""The legislation Rauner referenced did have the effect of reducing pension contributions below what they otherwise would have been for four years, and that additional underfunding was, essentially, borrowing that increased costs down the line."" According to a 2006 COGFA report, Hertz said, ""the net effect of the law was to increase pension payments from the State by $6.8 billion between FY2006 and FY2045."" Our ruling In an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate. The General Assembly’s own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions. The SEC said the move aggravated the funds’ condition and ability to meet its obligations and worsened its creditworthiness. A 2006 report said the underfunding required $6.8 billion more in payments.

NC's Dan Forest wrongly claims Gov. Roy Cooper will create 'Look But Don't Touch' bathroom policy
","After Gov. Roy Cooper introduced a proposal repealing House Bill 2, one of the law’s biggest supporters spoke up. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest – who has already announced he wants to run for governor in 2020 – said Cooper’s strategy to repeal HB2 ""will risk the safety of our people to achieve a radical social policy agenda."" HB2 said people can only use the bathrooms of their birth gender (not their gender identity), and it banned cities and counties around North Carolina from creating rules related to bathroom access or discrimination protections for LGBT people, or raising the minimum wage. We previously found that there’s no real history of safety problems associated with transgender-friendly bathroom rules. However, Forest’s claim doubled down on such concerns. ""If Governor Cooper's proposed bill for repealing HB2 becomes law, it will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms,"" Forest said in a written statement. ""Heterosexual men will be able to access women's showers and bathrooms by simply posing as a transgender individual. They will be able to watch women and children shower, or shower next to them. As long as the man doesn't touch them, assault them or film them, no legal protection would be afforded the offended woman or child. Nothing."" That’s a shocking claim. We found it’s also not based in reality. What happens if HB2 gets repealed We should note one thing right off the bat: Forest issued his statement on Cooper’s bill before the bill was filed, basing his claim simply off what Cooper said in a press conference. That means we won’t use the bill itself to examine Forest’s claim. Instead, we’ll use the facts that existed at the time – including that Cooper had proposed repealing HB2 and strengthening criminal penalties for certain crimes committed in bathrooms. His statement implies Cooper proposed letting transgender people use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. That’s not true. In reality, Cooper suggested a return to the status quo that North Carolina used for centuries, in which there were no laws about bathroom access. We asked Forest spokesman Jamey Falkenbury if Forest thought that North Carolina had a ""state-sanctioned ‘Look But Don’t Touch’ policy"" for all that time. Falkenbury said Forest was instead making the assumption that, once HB2 is repealed, cities and counties will rush to pass transgender-friendly bathroom rules. We can’t see the future, and neither can Forest, although Falkenbury did correctly point out that ""with HB2 repealed there would be no legal mechanism to block those ordinances."" Yet even if that did happen the decision is up to local governments, and the rules would only apply locally. That’s hardly a ""state-sanctioned"" policy, contrary to Forest’s claim. Law enforcement doesn’t lack power We looked into legal protections for two different possibilities: What powers law enforcement will have under the situation Cooper actually proposed, as well as under the situation Forest believes might happen. That first one is easy. There are a number of laws the state can use to protect people from the kinds of acts Forest described. There might be more, but at least six could apply: Trespassing, stalking, breaking and entering, indecent exposure, secret peeping and sex offender restrictions. And since HB2 contains no civil or criminal penalties for violations, repealing it wouldn’t take away any legal protections. If the sexual predators in Forest’s scenarios are also convicted sex offenders, the state has laws to give them additional punishments for re-offending, or even for simply being near places kids go – including pools, schools and other places with the kind of shared facilities Forest is worried about. And in 2015, before HB2 passed, UNC-Chapel Hill law professor Jeff Welty wrote about what could happen to people go into the wrong bathroom. Welty said there’s ""a strong argument"" for trespassing and ""a reasonable argument"" for breaking and entering. He also cited a 2008 trial in which a 15-year-old boy in Greenville was convicted of trespassing for barging into his school’s girls’ locker room. The boy was also charged with secret peeping but wasn’t convicted, as he was anything but secretive in causing a scene. So all that debunks one of Forest's concerns, of a man watching women undress with no legal consequences if HB2 is repealed. There absolutely would be legal protections. And Forest’s more extreme scenario, of men being able to undress or shower with women, is even more ludicrous. North Carolina’s indecent exposure law would apply, and would lead to felony charges if children were present. Trying to see the future But what about if a city took advantage of the HB2 repeal and allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify? Let’s examine the possibilities. We began by asking why Forest ignored Cooper’s proposal for stronger penalties for bathroom crimes. That was intended as an olive branch to Republicans; it also caused the liberal, pro-LGBT groups Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC to oppose Cooper’s proposal. Falkenbury said it’s because Forest believes those laws would become meaningless. If a man claimed he was feeling like a woman at that particular moment in time, Falkenbury said, the law would be powerless to stop him. Again, we should point out Cooper never proposed allowing transgender people into restrooms based on their gender identity – and he has refused to publicly support other Democrats’ proposals to do so – but we’ll look into it anyway. Forest can’t possibly have any North Carolina-specific proof, since nowhere in the state has ever had transgender-friendly bathroom rules (Charlotte tried to, but HB2 became law first). But Falkenbury did point to an incident in Seattle, which does have transgender-friendly bathroom rules, in which a man walked into a women’s locker room at a pool. People complained, and he was kicked out of the locker room by pool staff despite claiming he had the right to be there. But that example actually goes against Forest’s point, since the man was removed. And the Washington Human Rights Commission, a part of the state government, reaffirmed the decision to kick him out. ""If a business has a reasonable belief that a person is in the wrong place, there is no rule that states that the person cannot be questioned and required to leave,"" the commission said. The man in that situation was never charged with any crimes, but neither we nor Forest can say what might happen in a similar case in North Carolina. There’s simply no precedent here. But Forest’s more worrisome scenario, in which a man undresses or showers with women consequence-free, is clearly implausible. Even in a hypothetical North Carolina city with a transgender-friendly bathroom rule, that would absolutely be illegal. The state law against indecent exposure gives only one exception: If the nudity occurs someplace where it's incidental (like a locker room) and it happens in front of only people of the same sex. Since local ordinances can’t override state law, no city’s bathroom rules could change that fact. The law only cares about anatomy, not gender identity. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Dan Forest said that Cooper’s HB2 repeal bill, if it passes, ""will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms"" with no laws in place to protect women from predatory men. In reality, there are at least half a dozen laws protecting people from the type of scenarios Forest wrongly said would become consequence-free. Cooper even suggested creating stronger penalties for some of them. Forest defended his claim by saying cities would start letting transgender people in bathrooms of the gender with which they identify. That's not what Cooper proposed, however.
