Michele Bachmann says food prices for barbecues up 29 percent because of Barack Obama
","
Presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann probably wasn't around to enjoy the burgers at your Memorial Day barbecue, but she's very concerned about how much you paid for them.

In an interview on New Hampshire Now on WKXL-AM in Concord, N.H., Bachmann sympathized with the plight of grillmasters everywhere by noting that the price of cook-out items have skyrocketed. And she laid the blame at the feet of President Barack Obama.

""If you threw a barbecue yesterday for the Memorial weekend, it was 29 percent more expensive than last year because Barack Obama's policies have led to groceries going up 29 percent,"" she said.

Anybody who has bought hamburger lately knows how prices have increased. But did you pay 29 percent more for your Memorial Day meal? And is the president to blame?

Bachmann's campaign did not respond to our inquiries for the source of their figures, but Internet searches took us to a New York Post article titled ""That cookout will cost you 29 percent more this year.""

The May 24 story reported that hosts of a typical Memorial Day cookout, which includes a menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, lettuce, tomatoes, potato salad, ice cream and coffee for 12 people, would spend an average of $199 – about 29 percent higher than May 2010.

Lettuce prices have increased 28 percent during that time, reporter Paul Tharp wrote in the story. ""Want tomatoes on that burger?"" Tharp wrote. ""It'll cost you 86 percent more than last year.""

But the 29 percent was based on New York-area prices.

Tharp told us in an e-mail that his team got the prices of the selected items at New York area grocery stores and compared them to the May 2010 and May 2011 regional prices listed in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index.  The CPI is the country's most widely used measure of inflation.

""The BLS came up with the price histories, and our onsite price-checks in supermarkets provided the latest price updates,"" Tharp said.

These numbers showed the average increase at about 29 percent, he said.

But PolitiFact found the national numbers were much lower. According to last month's CPI survey, the price of ground beef has jumped 13.6 percent since May 2010. Frankfurters have increased by 8 percent; coffee by 16 percent; lettuce by 7.8; tomatoes by 2.4; and ice cream by 5.6 percent. Potatoes, the main ingredient in potato salad, has increased by 15.9 percent since May 2010. (The CPI survey doesn’t measure potato salad).

We averaged those increases and came up with 9.9 percent -- a substantial increase, but much lower than the 29 percent that Bachmann claimed.

Overall, food has increased by 3.6 percent from last year, according to the CPI listings.

Is Obama responsible for the increase in food prices?

Not much. Industry experts told us that food prices are affected by many different factors ranging from weather, energy costs for transportation and production, and supply and demand.

Bill Cook, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that environmental conditions, including dry cattle pastures in parts of the United States and droughts in Colombia have affected the price of products like beef and coffee.

An increase in the wealth of countries across the globe, especially China and other Asian nations, has boosted the demand for food, driving up costs, Cook said.

Experts told us that the occupant of the White House doesn't have much impact on the price of food.

""Although policies can have an impact on food prices, it seems to be the case that most ups and downs in food prices over the years are a function of the underlying supply and demand factors that go into the system,"" said Ephraim Leibtag, deputy director of research for the federal Economic Research Service's food economics division.

Lately, high energy costs have also played a big role.

The price of fuel, used to process and transport food, has risen dramatically. On May 30, regular gas averaged about $3.74 per gallon across the country – about $1 more than May 30, 2010.

President Obama has acknowledged the cost of high gas prices. Last month, he announced efforts to conduct lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, as well as to extend drilling leases off the Gulf of Mexico and off the Alaskan Coast.

But analysts say the president isn’t to blame for the high oil prices.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that tracks energy prices, credits political events in the Middle East and Africa, as well as changes in inventory levels and improving economies across the globe among the factors contributing to the price of crude oil.

""Oil prices are responding more to fundamentals in the marketplace, as well as the economic downturn,"" said Mary Welge, a senior editor with Oil Price Information Service, an industry news publication. ""I can't remember the last political decision pertaining to oil companies that might have had a real influence on oil prices.""

Our ruling

Bachmann says Obama is to blame for a 29 percent increase in Memorial Day barbecues, but she's way off on both counts. Her figure comes from a New York Post article that relied on prices in the expensive New York metro area; national figures show the increase was much lower, about 9.9 percent. And she blames Obama for the increase when experts say he and his policies have little, if any, impact on food prices. We find her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809688C980>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-food-prices-barbecues-29-per/

Michele Bachmann says Barack Obama has ""released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve""
","
During a June 26, 2011, interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Rep. Michele Bachmann -- a Minnesota Republican who was one day away from officially announcing a bid for the presidency -- criticized President Barack Obama’s recent decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

The reserve is a complex of four sites near the Gulf Coast that holds ""emergency supplies of crude oil"" owned by the U.S. government. On June 23, the Obama administration announced that it would release 30 million barrels of oil from the reserve, to ""offset the disruption in the oil supply caused by unrest in the Middle East,"" according to the Energy Department. U.S. allies promised similar actions.

On Face the Nation, Bachmann took aim at this policy. Her comment came as she responded to host Bob Schieffer’s question about the accuracy of some of her past statements as judged by PolitiFact. Schieffer specifically referenced a Truth-O-Meter item in which we gave Bachmann a Pants on Fire rating for saying that there had been only one offshore oil drilling permit during the Obama administration.

Here’s a portion of the exchange between Schieffer and Bachmann:

Bachmann: ""It’s ironic and sad that the president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve because the president doesn’t have an energy policy.""

Schieffer (overlapping): ""Do you think that was a good move?""

Bachmann: ""He has a politically correct environmental policy.""

Schieffer (overlapping): ""Was that a good thing?""

Bachmann: ""It was a very bad move. It pu t-- it has made the United States more vulnerable. There’s only a limited amount of oil that we have in the Strategic Oil Reserve. It’s there for emergencies. We do not -- the emergency that we have is the fact that ... the president of the United States has failed to give the American people an energy policy. Here’s the good news that a lot of Americans don’t even realize. We are the No. 1 energy resource-rich nation in the world according to the Congressional Research Service. But the president of the United States has unfortunately put American energy resources off limits.""

Several readers asked us to check Bachmann’s statement that ""the president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve,"" suggesting that Bachmann was incorrect in using the word ""all"" to describe the release. So we decided to look into it.

We turned to the administration’s official announcement. Here’s an excerpt:

""U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced today that the U.S. and its partners in the International Energy Agency have decided to release a total of 60 million barrels of oil onto the world market over the next 30 days to offset the disruption in the oil supply caused by unrest in the Middle East. As part of this effort, the U.S. will release 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR is currently at a historically high level with 727 million barrels.""

So the release of 30 million barrels accounts for just over 4 percent of the current holdings in the reserve -- nowhere near ""all"" of it.

It's possible Bachmann meant to say, ""the president released oil"" or ""some oil"" from the reserve, in which case she would have been accurate. (We reached out to Bachmann’s staff, but they did not respond to our inquiry by publication time.)

However, we saw no effort by Bachmann to correct any misimpression from her comment, either in the Face the Nation interview or elsewhere. In any event, we give significant weight to the actual words a speaker says -- and viewers watching the interview would have been led to believe that Obama had released all the oil in the reserve. We rate Bachmann’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2B280>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-barack-obama-has-released-al/

Allen West says military spent $115 million in first 36 hours in Libya
","War is hell. War is expensive. And we can attempt to quantify just how expensive it is.

That's what Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West, an Army veteran who now represents part of Broward and Palm Beach counties, did in a June 20, 2011 interview on Fox News. 

West has been critical of the U.S. military actions in Libya launched in March. In a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article on June 23, West was quoted as saying ""We can't keep committing U.S. military to 'protect innocent civilians'; they're exhausted."" He went into more detail on Fox News in response to a question about whether President Barack Obama would have gotten authorization from Congress to launch the operation, West responded: 

""Well, the thing is this. You have got to be able to explain what the mission is. And being 22 years in the United States military, we have seen three different missions being stated. First of all, we're going to protect innocent civilians. Kind of hard to do that from 30,000 feet. The next thing, we say we're going to go in and attack the military capability of (Moammar) Gadhafi. Really hard to do between the vehicles of the rebels and his vehicles. And now we want to take Moammar Gadhafi out of power. There are means by which we can restrict and constrain and kind of temper Moammar Gadhafi without coming back again and having a third combat operation. And you want to talk about the economics of this, in the first 24 to 36 hours, you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each."" 

For this Truth-O-Meter item, we wondered if West got his numbers right. How much does the Tomahawk cruise missile cost and did we spend $115 million in the first 24 to 36 hours on missiles in Libya? 

And what if anything can we draw from that initial cost?

Navy spokeswoman Amanda Greenberg told us in a June 23 interview that a Tomahawk cruise missile costs approximately $1.1 million. During the first 24 to 36 hours, 110 were fired by Coalition forces -- the majority by the U.S, she said. That math works out to about $121 million.

West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano directed us to a March 23 article in the National Journal which states: ""On the first day of strikes alone, U.S.-led forces launched 112 long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which cost about $1 million to $1.5 million apiece, from ships stationed off the Libyan coast. That totaled $112 million to $168 million. Since those first strikes, U.S. and British forces have launched at least another 12 Tomahawk missiles. The Defense Department typically buys about 200 Tomahawks a year. While the military likely can put off buying new missiles for months, it will ultimately need to boost planned procurement rates to refill its stockpile.""

The tab in Libya continues to rise. That's a concern among Democrats and Republicans who have opposed the conflict that the Obama administration entered without seeking Congressional authority. Whether Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution is the topic of a separate June 22, 2011 article on PolitiFact.

The White House said in a report that as of June 3, the cost of the Libya operation was about $716 million. By Sept. 30, or 90 days into the conflict, that figure is expected to rise to about $1.1 billion. West's numbers about the first day and a half are clearly on target or close enough. But what do they mean? We interviewed four experts including Gordon Adams, a professor of foreign policy at American University who was associate director for national security and international affairs at the federal Office of Management and Budget in the 1990s. We also interviewed Zack Cooper, senior analyst at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments who co-wrote a report in March about the costs of a no-fly zone in Libya published before the conflict started. Our additional experts were James Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. 

None of our experts quibbled with West's numbers. But some said the cost from the first day and half doesn't shed much light on the big picture.

""His numbers are right but it doesn't mean anything,"" Adams said, because the government already bought those missiles and would ultimately use them somewhere.

""We've already got them in the inventory -- it's not a new expenditure,"" Adams said.

The government won't necessarily replace each Tomahawk missile that it used in Libya, Adams said. And that initial cost ""doesn't tell you anything"" about how much will ultimately be spent because we don't know how long the operation will continue or the operational tempo.

Cooper's report estimated the initial and longer-term costs of creating different types of no-fly zones. For a limited no-fly zone covering mostly northern Libya, the report estimated upfront costs between $400 and $800 million and ultimately between $1.18 and $3.4 billion over six months.

""The initial costs in these sorts of operations are typically higher in the first stages of the operations because more expensive munitions are being used and there are a high number of targets at the outset of combat operations,"" Cooper said in an e-mail.

It's not helpful to compare the cost in the first day and a half in Libya to other conflicts, Cooper said. For some broader conflicts where the initial start-up time is at least multiple days and can include troops on the ground, it's harder to pinpoint the costs compared to the cost of dropping a certain number of bombs and multiplying the cost of each bomb. For other conflicts including some of the no-fly zones ""they start small and sort of build so initial costs may be relatively small but costs over time may be large.""

""I think the Libya situation is anomolous,"" Cooper said. 

So can we draw any meaning from the costs in Libya the first 36 hours?

""The cost of the first day or first couple of days was largely Tomahawk missiles and maybe some other munitions, but for the most part that's why it was so expensive,"" Cooper said. ""The cost in the long term of a no-fly zone is typically fuel and operational costs so the two are very different. The upfront cost of imposing a no-fly zone are typically substantially higher than the week-to-week cost of flying planes above Libyan territory.""

On Fox News West said that the United States launched about $115 million worth of missiles within the first day or day and a half in Libya. That's about $6 million less than the figure we received from the Navy. And West didn't note that some of the Tomahawks were fired by U.S. allies. But still, close enough. But there are a couple of caveats -- namely, that the U.S. already had those missiles in stock, so it doesn't represent new spending. And initial costs in a military intervention are always higher, experts told us. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2B2C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/allen-west/allen-west-says-military-spent-115-million-first-3/

Harry Reid says Hispanic unemployment 'ticking down' from all-time high
","
During an online chat with the Washington Post on June 22, 2011, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was asked about unemployment among Hispanics.

A questioner asked, ""Sen. Reid, Hispanic unemployment is currently 11.1 percent, vs. 9.1 percent the national average. What have/are Democrats doing to generate jobs in our community?""

Reid responded, ""Just this week in Las Vegas, we inaugurated a transportation center at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Hispanics make up a large portion of the Nevada labor force. And the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which we passed last Congress, provides additional tools to protect Latinos from job discrimination. Hispanic unemployment has been ticking down from an all-time high of 13.9 percent because of the policies we’ve implemented. But we want to accelerate this trend. ...""

We wondered whether Reid was correct that ""Hispanic unemployment has been ticking down from an all time high of 13.9 percent because of the policies we’ve implemented.""

We see four checkable facts within this sentence. We’ll take them one by one:

Is 13.9 percent unemployment for Hispanics the highest rate ever?

No. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Hispanics -- the measure economists typically use, and which has been calculated since 1973 -- it exceeded that level once in 1975 (14.3 percent) and 12 times during the 1982-1983 recession, reaching as high as 15.7 percent. In fact, Hispanic unemployment ran higher than 13.9 percent for an entire year, from July 1982 to June 1983.

Did Hispanic unemployment reach 13.9 percent after the onset of the recent recession?

Again, no. It reached as high as 13.2 percent in November 2010.

Has Hispanic unemployment ""been ticking down"" in recent months?

It depends on your definition of ""ticking down.""

If you start from the November unemployment 2010 peak -- seven months ago -- it’s fallen from 13.2 percent to 11.9 percent. That supports Reid’s view.

However, it’s taken a zig-zagging route to get there. In fact, the last three months of that time period -- March, April and May 2011 -- have shown an upward trend, from 11.3 percent to 11.8 percent to 11.9 percent. Looking at those numbers, you could easily argue that Hispanic unemployment is now ticking upward.

Is it appropriate to say that whatever change there has been in Hispanic unemployment is ""because of the policies we’ve implemented""?

As we’ve argued before, attributing credit or blame for employment statistics is a tricky business. Presidential and congressional actions have some effect, but broader economic factors -- from the global economic picture to energy prices to the state of private credit markets -- play a significant role.

Complicating matters further is the question of when to draw the line. Hispanic unemployment rose over the course of 2009 from 9.9 percent to 12.8 percent, and in 2010 from 12.5 percent to 13.0 percent. How do you balance these Hispanic unemployment rate increases -- when Obama had Democratic control of both chambers of Congress -- with the arguably more favorable pattern since the 2010 elections, when the Republicans won control of the House?

Because of the trickiness surrounding this question, we feel it’s a stretch for Reid to ascribe credit to the Democrats for recent Hispanic job gains -- if, in fact, you conclude that there was any ""ticking down"" of Hispanic unemployment in the first place.

Reid’s office defended its statistics. For starters, they said they were using non-seasonally-adjusted statistics -- raw numbers published by BLS that are not tweaked to account for cyclical variations across the span of a calendar year. So we checked those too.

Using these numbers, Reid is right that 13.9 percent is the peak number since the last recession began (in January 2010). But that still isn’t the record -- Hispanic unemployment went as high as 16.9 percent in February 1983 using non-seasonally-adjusted numbers.

How about the trendlines? The pattern since the start of 2010 has zig-zagged a bit, but since the start of 2011, the rate has indeed ticked down -- from 13.2 percent to 12.5 percent to 11.9 percent to 11.2 percent and finally to 11.1 percent in May.

So that provides some support for Reid’s claim. But is it really fair to use non-seasonally adjusted numbers?

We asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. He noted that Reid’s questioner used a non-seasonally adjusted number when he noted that Hispanic unemployment was currently at 11.1 percent. But Burtless added that Reid should not have followed the questioner’s lead in using non-seasonally-adjusted rates -- because they are not appropriate for longterm, multi-month comparisons.

Burtless said it’s acceptable to use non-seasonally-adjusted numbers when comparing, say, January 2010 to January 2011, or comparing black unemployment in January 2011 to Hispanic unemployment in January 2011. But once you start comparing figures from different months, you need to use seasonally adjusted figures to get an accurate assessment.

In the context of Reid’s exchange, Burtless said, seasonally adjusted numbers ""provide the most informative and useful kind of comparison.""

Based on such advice, we think it is misleading for Reid to use non-seasonally-adjusted numbers.

As for the question of whether Democratic policies helped bring down Hispanic unemployment, Reid’s office argued that there’s a disproportionately large number of Hispanics in the construction industry, and given that the Democratic-backed stimulus bill invested in construction projects, Hispanics should have benefited disproportionately.

That may be true, but if so, those job gains should have been reflected in the broader unemployment rate pattern. And as we’ve noted, the trendlines in those statistics are mixed.

So where does this leave us? It’s problematic that Reid used an inappropriate measurement of unemployment, that he ignored a significantly worse recession for Hispanic employment in 1982-1983 and that he exaggerated the impact that Democratic policies have had on the Hispanic jobs picture. On the upside for Reid, Hispanic unemployment is now lower than it was in late 2010 or than it was a year or two ago, though the number has bounced around, and unemployment has risen incrementally over the past three months. The big-picture decrease in Hispanic unemployment provides enough evidence for Reid to salvage a rating of Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B91140>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-hispanic-unemployment-ticking-down/

U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown's campaign warns there is a Republican plan to end Medicare
","
Some claims are so popular that no matter how often they get debunked, politicians or their campaigns can’t stop using them. A current favorite: Republicans plan to end Medicare.

U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s re-election organization, Friends of Sherrod Brown, is the latest group to utter this claim. In a fund-raising solicitation sent by e-mail June 20 on behalf of Brown, Sarah Benzing, campaign manager for the Ohio Democrat, said exactly that: there is a Republican ""plan to end Medicare.""

In fairness, this was but one small part of her e-mail to potential donors.

Benzing spent far more time criticizing Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer who has filed candidacy papers to run against Brown. She noted that Mandel, a Republican, recently had a private fund-raising reception with Washington lobbyists. Mandel avoided talking with the press on this trip, as he has on other occasions, and this was the gist of Benzing’s fund-raising e-mail.

Writing in a guy-walks-into-a-bar style, she began her pitch: ""A guy walks into a DC lobbying firm... While he’s in town, he stands up an Ohio reporter and continues to refuse to discuss his position on the Republican plan to end Medicare or allegations that he used taxpayer money to campaign."" By the end of her e-mail, she said, ""Ohioans won’t stand for his stonewalling, and when he tries to drown out their concerns with attacks bought and paid for by these shadowy operatives and DC lobbyists, we’ll be ready to respond."" She asked for ""$5 or more to help us fight back against Josh Mandel’s corporate lobbyist friends.""

Perhaps we should be flattered that Benzing based much of her e-mail on our reporting about Mandel. The Plain Dealer provided details of Mandel’s Washington trip in its political blog on Cleveland.com, and Benzing repeated them and credited the newspaper. The Plain Dealer also operates PolitiFact Ohio, and in the interest of full disclosure, the reporter writing this very PolitiFact item is the same reporter who wrote the Cleveland.com piece on Mandel. We’re just calling ‘em as we see ‘em.

And we see a problem with the Brown campaign’s claim, because Republicans have not said they want to end Medicare. PolitiFact has noted this several times, and many political operatives are aware of the issue and its broader debate.

About that debate: House Republicans and many in the Senate support a proposal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to convert Medicare into a ""premium-support payment"" program starting in 2022. In other words, people retiring then would sign up for private health insurance plans, with Medicare paying those plans to provide coverage.
There would be a middle man rather than direct payment from the government to the doctor, as Medicare is currently structured.

Proponents and critics disagree as to whether a voucher system would be good or bad and about the perils of doing nothing. The Congressional Budget Office says the Ryan plan would end up costing seniors more out-of-pocket for health care than they pay now. But we are dealing here with the more basic issue of Benzing’s claim: that Republicans plan to end Medicare.

If you are 55 years or older already, it would not change. And if you are younger, the Ryan plan would leave you with a different Medicare system, but one in which the government still played a big role in your health coverage.

This has been rehashed repeatedly.

From our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin on June 10: ""Moreover, we’ve established that, although it’s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan’s plan, they would still have health care.""

From PolitiFact Virginia on June 9: ""Would the plan really end Medicare? The Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and future seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. But to say it would end Medicare, as the DCCC e-mail does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors -- current and future -- would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year.""

From the national PolitiFact on May 25: ""Seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year although at a rate not expected to match the rise in medical costs. The government would still play a critical role in directing the program and setting standards.""

From PolitiFact Wisconsin on April 11: ""To be sure, the plan would change Medicare, significantly, starting in 2022. But for those who turn 65 before then, there would be no changes at all, even after 2022. And for the others, Medicare would change -- dramatically -- but it would still exist.""

Why, then, did the Brown campaign say that the Republican plan would end Medicare? Benzing sent us three sources for the statement. The first was a Wall Street Journal article on April 4 that, according to Benzing, said the Ryan plan ""would essentially end Medicare."" The Journal article, however, didn’t quite say that.

It said: ""The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills.""

Changing the payment method is not the same as ending the entire program.

Her next source was a Kaiser Health News article from April 4 that said, ""A premium support model would fundamentally change the way that Medicare works by limiting the amount of money the federal government spends on medical services for seniors and the disabled. Currently, Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that the government must help finance every doctor visit and medical service that an individual needs.""

There’s little question about a fundamental change -- but that, too, is not the same as killing Medicare, especially since the program would remain unchanged for people who retire before 2022.

Finally, she listed a Kaiser Health News article from April 5 that said seniors would pay sharply more for their Medicare coverage under Ryan’s plan. It provided estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. ""For example, by 2030, under the plan, typical 65 year olds would be required to pay 68 percent of the total cost of their coverage, which includes premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs, according to CBO.  That compares with the 25 percent they would pay under current law, CBO said.""

Benzing cited the article accurately. It should be mentioned, however, that Medicare trustees don’t see the current rate, generous though it may be, as sustainable past 2024. Some other form of savings, cost sharing or revenue-raising methods may be inevitable.

""Ask anyone who will pay twice as much out-of-pocket under the Republican plan if it's still Medicare,"" Benzing told us when we asked about the plan-to-end-Medicare claim. ""Ask anyone who thought they were going to have guaranteed coverage and now won't if it's still Medicare.""

Those are questions of degree. Change of some kind is likely -- so will that mean death to Medicare?

Certainly not for millions of current retirees and baby boomers now over age 55. For everyone else, the Ryan plan might better be defined by using another political chestnut, namely, the end of ""Medicare as we know it"" -- a cliche, perhaps, but one with enough qualification to keep the claim out of the hot seat.

The Brown fund-raising pitch had no such qualification. No matter how often it's said, this still remains true - that the unqualified end-of-Medicare statement is not accurate.

And on the Truth-O-Meter, that means the statement still garners a rating of False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809702DE40>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/sherrod-brown/us-sen-sherrod-browns-campaign-warns-there-republi/
"['Abortion', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia']","
NARAL says McDonnell's agenda costs state federal sex ed money
","
NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia recently unveiled a video that uses a montage of numbers to criticize Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell’s stance on funding for sex education programs.

Among the claims: ""$400,000 -- approximate cost to Virginians to fund ineffective abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. $2.5 million -- federal funding for comprehensive sex education programs Virginia lost due to McDonnell’s political agenda.""

Are NARAL’s numbers and claims correct? We asked Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, for sources of the information.

Let’s start with the statement that abstinence-only education costs the state $400,000. Keene said that’s a reference to match money Virginia provided to receive a federal grant for abstinence-only sex education.

The payment allows Virginia to participate in the Title V Abstinence Education Grant Program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program promotes abstinence until marriage to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases.

Last September, HHS announced Virginia would receive an $889,973 grant for abstinence education for fiscal 2010.  States have until Sept. 30, 2012, to spend the money. The federal cash pays for 57 percent of the cost of abstinence programs approved by HHS.

Participating states are required to provide the remaining 43 percent of cost. The match money can come from a variety of sources including from state coffers, foundation dollars and in-kind donations.

Virginia was required to come up with about $670,000 to match the grant.

Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said in an e-mail that the state is paying $382,688 towards the match. The rest is coming from in-kind contributions and community organizations awarded contracts to implement the sexual abstinence programs.

So NARAL is near the bull’s-eye in claiming Virginia is paying an ""approximate"" $400,000 for abstinence-until marriage programs.

Caldwell noted that the state received federal abstinence education funding under previous governors going back to the 1990s.

But in 2007, Democratic Governor Tim Kaine cut the state’s funding for abstinence-only education. McDonnell reversed that decision last year.

At the same time, McDonnell chose not to seek money from another federal grant program that  teaches students about contraception in addition to abstinence -- the Personal Responsibility Education Program.

Unlike the federal abstinence-only money, the comprehensive sex education grant requires no match. McDonnell’s refusal to participate drew criticism from NARAL and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia.  

That brings us to the second part of NARAL’s claim, that Virginia lost $2.5 million in federal money for comprehensive sex education under McDonnell. As a source, NARAL cited an HHS 49-page announcement of the PREP grant, which was created under the 2010 health care reform law.

The HHS synopsis shows Virginia was estimated to receive a total of $2,593,487 during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. That’s close to NARAL’s number.

But NARAL is greatly understating its case. States that didn’t apply for the grant in fiscal 2010 and 2011 are not eligible to seek funding for the 2012-2014 fiscal years. So Virginia potentially missed out on much more than $2.6 million. Estimates for 2012-2014 allotments are not available, said Kenneth Wolfe, an HHS spokesman.

Let’s recap:

A video by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia said that abstinence-only programs pursued under McDonnell have cost the state about $400,000. Meanwhile, the group says the state missed out on about $2.5 million in federal funding for comprehensive sex education.

It’s true the state spent about $400,000 for a federal abstinence-only grant. And it’s true that the McDonnell administration did not apply for a comprehensive sex education grant that would have sent almost $2.6 million to Virginia during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. Because Virginia is now ineligible to apply for the comprehensive grant through 2014, the state will wind up declining a much greater amount of money than NARAL claimed.

We won’t penalize NARAL for understating its case. Its statement is True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096658140>],/factchecks/2011/jun/27/naral-pro-choice-america/naral-says-mcdonnells-agenda-costs-state-federal-s/

Deal says ""substantial"" number of probationers hired for shortage able to handle farm work
","
Gov. Nathan Deal’s plan to use probationers to ease the state’s farm labor shortage has farmers wondering whether these new workers can take the heat. Literally.

Temperatures soar into the 90’s in Georgia’s fields. Harvesters spend hours in the sun stooping, bending and carrying heavy baskets of fruits and vegetables.

Hispanic immigrant workers, some here illegally, usually take on this backbreaking labor, but farmers say they’re leaving the state because of the state’s tough new immigration laws. Probationers taking their place have trouble lasting even one day, according to media reports.

WABE-FM (90.1) host Denis O’Hayer asked Deal about the probationers during a June 16 interview.  

""From a practical point of view, does that say to you that this experiment may not work?"" O’Hayre asked.

""Well, there’s no question it is difficult and hard work. I think you know that when you get into the field,"" Deal replied. ""But our reports are a substantial number of them were actually able to finish the work.""

Opponents of Georgia’s recent immigration crackdown often complain that most Americans don’t want or can’t handle field work and other jobs performed by legal and illegal immigrants.

So, we wondered, have a ""substantial number"" of Georgia’s probationers really been able to withstand a full day’s work in the fields?

Probationers are offenders who serve their sentences outside of prison. Generally, they must be employed to meet the terms of their probation.

The DOC supervises about 8,000 probationers in South Georgia, the heart of the state’s agricultural industry. Some 2,000 of them are unemployed, according to the department.

Deal’s pilot program started the week of June 13, soon after a survey by the state Department of Agriculture determined that farmers were short 11,080 workers. By then, the vegetable harvest season was already ending and growers complained crops were rotting in the fields.

The pilot program invites low-risk, non-violent probationers to work voluntarily in the fields for $7.25 an hour or more. As of June 20, two farms in Sumter and Colquitt counties have hired probationers as part of the pilot, and the probation office in a third county, Echols, is also participating.

We asked Deal’s office for proof that a ""substantial"" number of probationers finished the work. A spokeswoman directed us to the Georgia Department of Corrections, which has joined with the state departments of Labor and Agriculture to run the pilot project.

Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan emphasized the pilot program is just getting started. Many qualified probationers have yet to be told about it, and it’s too early to say how well they fill the state’s farm labor needs.

Hogan gave few specifics on worker turnover, saying the numbers are still being collected and reviewed. But she says that when the program began June 13, the number of participants each day was in the single digits. As of June 20, ""10, 11 or 12"" were showing up for work.   

During the first week, an average of seven probationers worked each day in Sumter County, Hogan said. An average of five or so were repeat workers.

We contacted the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association for more information. Both farms participating in the pilot project are part of the group, which opposed the immigration crackdown.

Executive Director Charles Hall stressed that it’s too early to pass judgment on the pilot program. Growers may be unable to tell how well it works until after the fall harvest.

""This may be a good alternative. It may be a partial solution,"" Hall said. ""It will take us some time to work through.""

In Sumter County, the program began Monday June 13, when three probationers showed up for work, Hall said. None of them returned the next day.

On Tuesday, two arrived and worked all day.

One of them returned Wednesday, and nine new recruits joined him. Six of the 10 probationers who showed up worked most of the day.  

In Colquitt County, the program started June 18, Nine of 11 probationers made it through the work day, Hall said. Five returned the next day.   
Since then, Agricultural Commissioner Gary Black has said publicly that the program has had mixed results so far. Black told WXIA-TV 11 and Georgia Public Broadcasting that only two farms had signed up and a number of probationers weren’t returning to work. He remained ""cautiously optimistic"" the program could be refined for the fall harvest.

The Associated Press reported similar problems. Probationers came to work without gloves and other protective clothing. They couldn’t keep up with the Hispanic crews and wilted in the heat.

Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield said that the number of probationers who stick it out still count as substantial.

""Given that we aren’t trying to fill all our agricultural labor needs with probationers, the turnout has been substantial for a few farms in South Georgia, and we’re working hard in conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture, Corrections and Labor to expand the program,"" Mayfield wrote us in an email.

Let’s sum up.

Deal said ""substantial"" number of probationers ""finished the work,"" but this claim has serious shortcomings.

You could argue that since 7 out of 14 probationers returned the next day for more work, the program had a 50 percent success rate. To some, 50 percent might seem ""substantial."" The work is difficult and newbies often drop out.

But the pilot program was designed to place some of South Georgia’s 2,000 unemployed probationers in the state’s 11,000 empty harvesting slots. Participation rates of potentially eligible probationers is so low that it’s premature, and even bit misleading, to say that ""substantial"" numbers of probationers have finished the work.

""Substantial"" numbers of probationers have yet to even participate in the program.    

Deal was misleading. But we’ll be generous and give him some credit for the fact that half of the pilot’s 14 participants returned to the fields for more backbreaking labor.

State Sen. Tom Kean Jr. says New Jersey’s taxes caused 190,000 residents to leave in 2009
","
State Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. has taken aim at the New Jersey Supreme Court after its latest ruling in the state’s school funding saga.

Kean (R-Union) criticized the justices for deciding that the state must dole out an additional $500 million to 31 low-income school districts and said the GOP won’t let taxpayers foot the bill.

""Republicans have been clear: we will not raise taxes on the most highly taxed people in America to pay for another wrongheaded decision by the Supreme Court,"" Kean said in a news release on May 24. ""The state’s tax burden has, according to census figures released today, cost our state another 190,000 residents in 2009.""

Is it true the state's famously high taxes are driving people away? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check.

Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said Kean’s statement was partly based on a May 23 article in the Asbury Park Press. The story, citing new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, stated that nearly 190,000 New Jersey residents left the state in 2009.

The story further explained that about 136,000 residents moved into New Jersey during the same period, creating an ""estimated net loss of 53,744 residents out of 8.7 million.""

The statistics come from the Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey on state-to-state migration.

According to the data, 189,956 people moved from New Jersey to another state or Puerto Rico in 2009. During that time frame, 136,212 people moved into the state, for an estimated net loss of 53,744 residents.

Because the numbers are from a survey, they are estimates. However, a survey statistician with the Census Bureau told us that the margins of error on the data aren’t large enough to significantly impact what the numbers show: New Jersey lost tens of thousands of residents in 2009.

So, Kean got the number of New Jersey residents who left the state largely correct, but he did not account for the 136,212 people who moved here.

Now, we need to determine how many New Jersey residents left because of high taxes.

Bauer pointed us to a study by Boston College that found $70 billion in wealth left New Jersey from 2004 to 2008.

The report attributed that loss of wealth more to the decline of wealthy households moving into New Jersey than the increase of wealthy households leaving the state. The report also found, through an analysis of federal data, that the two major reasons behind the moves were changes in employment and family matters.  The report also covers a different time period than what Kean referenced.

Bauer said Kean’s assertion about the tax burden ""certainly wasn’t intended as a monolithic statement,"" and that any attempt to construe it as such ""is just splitting hairs.""

He provided no other evidence to prove taxes drove tens of thousands of New Jerseyans out of the state. ""The senator has known people"" that left the state because of taxes, Bauer said. ""Everyone has anecdotal evidence.""

""If you take issue with the [statement’s] wording,"" he said, ""I apologize.""

Surveys by the pro-business Tax Foundation show that New Jersey’s tax burden is, well, burdensome. New Jersey takes seven spots on the Washington, D.C.-based group’s top 10 list of counties paying the highest median property taxes from 2005 to 2009. The group also ranks the state and local tax burden in New Jersey as the highest in the nation for 2009, the most recent year the group reviewed.

But what impact did taxes have on the state’s population?

American Community Survey data doesn’t include information on what motivated New Jersey residents to leave the state or what attracted out-of-state residents to move here.

Nationwide, the Census Bureau found that more than 40 percent of people moved between 2009 and 2010 because of housing-related reasons, such as moving to a new home, about 30 percent cited family concerns and 16.4 percent said employment needs prompted their move. The agency doesn’t break down those numbers to the state level.

So we asked some experts for their opinions.

James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said that while a ""whole range of factors"" go into a decision to move, ""certainly New Jersey is an extraordinarily expensive place to live and taxes are part of that burden.""

""Whether it’s residential property taxes, sales taxes and the like, it does constitute a push factor,"" he said.

Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at the Bloustein School who co-authored a 2007 study with Hughes that analyzed New Jersey migration patterns, said the number of residents moving out of state from New Jersey has dropped in recent years, an assertion supported by American Community Survey data from 2006 to 2009. He attributed the slowdown to the lack of job opportunities elsewhere and the collapse of the housing market.

Still, he said,  ""certainly taxes in general affect people’s decision"" to move, but the ""causes are many and complex.""

""Taxes are definitely not the only factor. But they are one of the factors,"" said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. ""Some people want to live in a high-tax, high-service state.""

Douglas Massey, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, co-authored a 2008 report on migration into and out of New Jersey. It found that low-income individuals impacted by New Jersey’s high cost of living were driving up the number of residents moving out of state. ""It was more jobs and real estate than tax burden,"" Massey said.

""New Jersey is a high-value, high-wealth state that attracts professionals,"" Massey said. ""They are willing to pay the high taxes because of the amenities in the state of New Jersey.""

Now, let’s get back to Kean’s statement.

Kean said that New Jersey’s tax burden pushed 190,000 residents out of the state in 2009.

The figure matches estimates from the American Community Survey, but Kean ignores the tens of thousands of people who moved into the state during the same period.

And even Kean's spokesman acknowledges that high taxes are not the sole reason residents left New Jersey. Bauer produced no solid evidence that even a substantial share of the approximately 190,000 people left because of taxes.

It's a powerful line to claim that people are fleeing the state because of high taxes. But we find insufficient evidence it is true. We rate the claim False.

Rep. Cicilline says WIC costs $100 per person and 18 percent of people in his district depend on it
","
Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline has been arguing against cutbacks in social programs proposed by the Republican majority, a campaign he has highlighted in a YouTube video posted on June 15 and available on his website.

It shows him speaking on the floor of the House a day earlier opposing a reduction in funds for the WIC program, which stands for Women, Infants and Children. WIC provides nutritious food to low-income women who are pregnant or have recently delivered a baby, and children under age 5 who might not be getting nutritious meals.

""If the majority [Republican] party has their way and denies necessary funding to a critical safety net for some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens, nearly 1,000 women, infants and children in Rhode Island's First District will be denied the assistance they need to survive,"" said Cicilline. ""WIC represents the most basic obligation we have to our fellow citizens most in need -- food and nutrition. On top of that, it's an incredibly cost effective program, serving nearly 10 million Americans each year and costing less than $100 per person. In my district, more than 18 percent of residents suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet.""

We wondered whether 18 percent of the residents in the 1st Congressional District were actually on the WIC program, a number that seemed high. It seemed even higher when we considered Cicilline's statement that 10 million Americans are covered by the WIC program -- about 3 percent of the U.S. population. That would mean the people in his district are six times more likely to have WIC coverage than the rest of the country.

We were also surprised that the program might be so inexpensive. You can't buy a lot of groceries for $100 a year.

So we asked Cicilline's office for the congressman's sources.

It didn't take long to discover that the $100 figure was wrong.

His staff sent us to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, where staffer Minh Ta said Cicilline had relied on a dollar amount that the caucus had miscalculated. Because the program cost $6.4 billion last year and covered 9.2 million people, the actual amount was nearly $700 per year per person.

""Honest mistakes are made,"" said Ta.

Then there's the number of people covered by the program. Rounded properly,  the number should be 9 million, not nearly 10 million as Cicilline asserted on the House floor.

And what about the statement that ""more than 18 percent of residents [in the 1st Congressional District] suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet""?

Last March, the Food Research Action Center (FRAC) in Washington, D.C., analyzed data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a 2010 survey in which more than 352,000 people -- including 1,396 in Cicilline's district -- were asked: ""Have there been times in the past 12 months where you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?""

According to FRAC, 18.0 percent of the people in the United States and 18.4 percent in Cicilline's district responded ""yes,"" an indication that they suffered from ""food hardship."" That matches Cicilline’s ""food insecurity"" number.

But is it really true, as Cicilline asserted, that these people depend on WIC to make ends meet?

FRAC said it didn't know how many in the food hardship group were on WIC.

So we turned to the Rhode Island Department of Health, which administers the program locally.

Spokesman Annemarie Beardsworth said the department didn't have a breakdown of WIC recipients by congressional district because it lists its data by community and Providence is divided between two congressional districts.

A total of  9,858 Providence residents receive WIC, some in Cicilline’s district, some in U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s district. Outside of Providence, 10,665 people are covered by WIC in the communities Cicilline represents.

Even if we assumed that every WIC recipient in Providence lives in the 1st District, that would  total 20,523 people, or 3.9 percent of the 524,000 residents in the 1st District, a far cry from the 18.4 percent cited by Cicilline. If Providence's WIC recipients were evenly divided between Cicilline’s and Langevin's districts, the percentage drops to 3.0 percent.

So the percentage cited by Cicilline's was at least four and a half times too high.

Katie Vinopal, a policy analyst for FRAC, explained why the number of people with ""food hardship"" is larger than the number of WIC recipients. The food hardship questions ""can be capturing elderly people,"" she said. ""We can be capturing people who can't get on the WIC program [because they're adult males, children over age 4 and women who are not pregnant or new mothers]. We're also capturing people who are income ineligible.""

For someone to say that people suffering from food insecurity depend on WIC to make ends meet ""is not right,"" said Vinopal.

While we were at it, we looked at Cicilline's assertion that the proposed GOP cuts would remove a critical safety net for ""nearly 1,000 women, infants and children in Rhode Island's First District.""

To back that up, the congressman's office sent us a June 8, 2011, news release from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It warned that 200,000 to 350,000 women and young children could lose their WIC benefits next year. In Rhode Island, it said, the estimate ranged from 600 to 1,000.

But because the 1st District covers about half the state's residents, the numbers Cicilline quoted for his district should have been closer to 300 to 500.

Not only that, the page of the news release that Cicilline's office didn't send us -- we found the original online -- makes it clear that the threat to WIC beneficiaries isn't just from the proposed Republican cuts. It's also from rising food costs. The low national estimate of 200,000 presumes a 2-percent rise in prices; the high estimate of 350,000 assumes a 5-percent increase.

We asked Zoe Neuberger, coauthor of the center’s study, whether budget cuts or projected food price increases played the biggest role. She said that, based on the information at the time Cicilline made his comment,  if the Republican cuts were approved and food prices did not increase, 150,000 low-income women and children will lose their food assistance.

So the direct effect of the proposed Republican cuts in Cicilline's district extrapolated to about 225 women and children, not 1,000. Food price increases would account for another 75 to 275 cases.

The day after we heard from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Cicilline spokewoman Jessica Kershaw wrote us to report that the congressman had misspoke when he said 1,000 would be affected. ""He meant to say that those 1,000 Rhode Islanders could be from across the state  -- not just his district,"" she wrote.

""What’s most important -- and what the Congressman sought to stress in his remarks -- is that there are too many people who are going hungry and cannot afford enough food for their household and he strongly opposes cuts to programs that benefit the people who need those programs the most,"" Kershaw said.

That's the message behind Cicilline’s statement. We certainly understand that people going hungry because they can’t afford food is a serious problem.

But the bottom line is that Cicilline, in making an impassioned argument for a program meant to address the issue got most of the checkable facts in the statement wrong.

Eighteen percent of the people in his district do not depend on WIC to make ends meet -- it's no higher than 3.9 percent.

The cost of the WIC program is not $100 per recipient per year -- it's closer to $700.

The number of Americans covered by the program isn't nearly 10 million -- it's closer to 9 million -- a relatively small error, but wrong, nonetheless.

And if the GOP cuts were to take effect, the number of people affected in his district wouldn't be close to 1,000 -- it would be more like 225.

They say that two wrongs don't make a right. We say that this many Falses in 46 seconds warrants a Pants On Fire!

Rick Perry says Texas accounted for 48 percent of U.S. jobs created after recession's end
","
In an unannounced June 14 appearance on the Fox News Channel, Texas Gov. Rick Perry strolled through another celebration of the state’s economy.

His 35-second cameo shows host Glenn Beck and Perry, who is not introduced, walking from a chalkboard past the camera as Beck asks: ""How many jobs did you create, percentage, during the recession?"" Perry replies: ""Since June 2009, about 48 percent of all the jobs created in America were in Texas. Come add to it.""

""Thank you; would love to,"" says Beck, whose show is leaving Fox.

After Perry walked off camera, Beck imitated Star Wars’ Obi-Wan Kenobi, waving his hand across his face and saying: ""I have no idea who that man was. That’s not the candidate you were looking for.""

We recognize that job-gain boasts can overreach. An example: Perry’s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-08 were in Texas. We rated that False because it was based on statistics from the 14 states in which job gains outnumbered job losses, and disregarded any jobs created in the other 36 states where losses outnumbered gains.

Per the governor’s recent claim, his office and the Texas Workforce Commission each attributed the 48 percent figure to research touted by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve. The Fed compared the number of jobs in Texas and the nation in April 2011 to the number of jobs in June 2009, the month marked by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the end of the recession that started in December 2007.

Workforce commission spokesman Mark Lavergne forwarded a June 14 email from Jerrod Vaughan, an assistant to Richard Fisher, president and ceo of the Dallas Fed, elaborating on Fisher’s recently telling the Wall Street Journal that Texas accounted for 37 percent of post-recession net job gains nationally, by one calculation, or 45 percent by another.

The Journal article says the Texas economy has averaged 3.3 percent annual growth over the last two decades, compared with 2.6 percent for the nation over all.

Vaughan’s email says that when the Dallas Fed compared its internally adjusted Texas employment totals to national survey employment figures, the Texas share of the whole was 47.8 percent--hence, we see, the figure Perry gave Beck.

Pia Orrenius, a senior economist at the Dallas Fed, told us the calculation came from subtracting the number of Texas jobs in June 2009 (10,287,000) from the jobs as of April 2011 (10,524,000) and determining the 237,000 increase accounted for nearly 48 percent of the 496,000 jobs gained nationally over that period. She said the national job figures were drawn from the federal government’s national payroll surveys.

Then again, Orrenius suggested the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. ""Long before Rick Perry"" became governor, she said, ""we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting  things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month."" She listed as favorable factors the state’s range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China.

Experts we contacted agreed Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth, though they stressed there are various ways to arrive at the state’s share of the nation’s rebound.

Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, initially advised by email that by the bureau’s count, Texas had 265,300 more jobs in April 2011 than in June 2009. Using the Dallas Fed’s equation, this suggests Texas accounted for about 54 percent of the nation’s net job growth over the period. Why the difference: The Dallas Fed checks the bureau’s monthly employment estimates against employers’ unemployment compensation tax filings once a quarter; the bureau only does so annually.

Abbot said, though, she prefers to judge ""recoveries thus far"" by comparing specific state or U.S. current employment levels with their peak employment prior to the recession. Texas, she said, has nearly recovered all the jobs lost in the recession. Its nearly 10.6 million jobs as of April ran 0.9 percent below its August 2008 peak employment level of more than 10.6 million jobs. In contrast, Abbot said, the U.S. employment of 131 million in May 2011 fell 5 percent below the peak U.S. employment of nearly 138 million in January 2008.

Chris Edwards, director of tax policy for the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called the Fed’s comparison fair, but said he’s skeptical every time a leader touts economic gains when it’s unclear how they stoked the gains. ""Reporters should ask the governor specifically what policies he put in place to create the much-better employment growth,"" Edward said, adding that he sees as a negative move changes in business taxation Perry signed into law in 2006 to help cover cuts in school property taxes.

Likewise, Bob Lerman, a fellow in labor and social policy at The Urban Institute in Washington saw no flaw in the Fed’s calculation. But at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, researcher Kathryn Edwards called Perry’s statement misleading because the Fed’s research reflects only the 31 states with net job gains over the post-recession period.

Jobs were created in the other states, Edwards pointed out, though more jobs were lost. It would be accurate, she said, to say Texas accounted for 27 percent of jobs gained in states with net job gains. For the same reason, Lee McPheters, an economist at Arizona State University, said the Fed’s statistical comparison is misleading.

McPheters wondered too why the cited comparison starts in June 2009 when the actual national low point in terms of employment was February 2010, because employment keeps falling after a recession ends. Applying the Fed’s methodology to the the later time frame, Texas accounted for only 18 percent of the jobs created from February 2010 into April 2011, he said.

Finally, we consulted Bernard Weinstein, an economist at Southern Methodist University familiar with the state’s economic ups and downs. ""One can quibble over the numbers as well as the methodologies and time frames used to calculate Texas' job gains,"" Weinstein said by email. The big picture, he said, is that Texas has fared better than other big states since the recession and indeed over the past 20 years, for reasons including, he said, ""enlightened"" leadership, demographics and the resurgent energy sector.

Our take:The strength of the Texas economy, compared to many other states, isn’t in dispute. However, there are many ways to slice and dice employment statistics. The calculations behind the 48-percent boast may cover a less meaningful time frame while not weighing any jobs created in states with net job losses.

"['Economy', 'Texas', 'Better Austin Today']","
Political group says Austin has had highest cost of living among big Texas cities under City Council Member Randi Shade
","
A mailer that reached voters just before the June 18 Austin City Council runoff made pocketbook claims about the state capital, suggesting residents couldn’t afford another three-year term for incumbent Randi Shade, who was then defeated by challenger Kathie Tovo.

Topping the leaflet’s charges: Under Shade, who joined the council in 2008, ""we have had the highest cost of living of any large Texas city.""

Jeff Jack, chairman of the Better Austin Today political action committee, which sponsored the mailer, told us the No. 1 conclusion was based on information posted on the city-data.com website. He said Austin has lately had a cost-of-living index of 94.8 on a scale where the national average is 100. The Austin result, he said, exceeds the indexes on the site for Dallas, Houston, El Paso, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Arlington, Laredo and Plano.

""We were just trying to find a site that gives reasonable comparisons,"" Jack said.

And why is Shade at fault? Jack said there’s blame to go around, but Shade’s votes to build water treatment and biomass energy plants and have the city spend money on water and wastewater lines to the Formula One race track being built east of the airport helped keep costs high. So did her failure to support a city homestead exemption on property taxes, he said, or a remedy for reported under-valuation of commercial property for tax purposes.

""The leadership of the council with regard to fiscal responsibility has to start somewhere,"" Jack said.

We looked up his cited website. It showed Austin with a January 2011 cost-of-living index of 94.8, as Jack said. The next-highest big Texas cities were Dallas and Fort Worth, both at 94.4, followed by Arlington at 94.2. The least costly big Texas city was El Paso, at 83.2, according to the site.

Noting the site does not say how the indexes were reached, we emailed the site’s administrators and didn’t hear back.

Separately, we asked Austin’s city demographer, Ryan Robinson, for guidance on the local cost of living. He referred us to the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, whose vice president of research, Beverly Kerr, told us many communities participate in regular surveys gauging the cost of living around the country.

Kerr was referring to a composite cost-of-living index managed by the Virginia-based Council for Community and Economic Research, a nonprofit. According to council information, the index ""measures regional differences in the cost of consumer goods and services, excluding taxes and non-consumer expenditures, for professional and managerial households in the top income quintile"" and is ""based on more than 90,000 prices covering 60 different items for which prices are collected quarterly by chambers of commerce, economic development organizations, and university applied economic centers in each participating urban area."" Finally, it’s ""based on six component categories – housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services.""

Kerr forwarded the council’s composite index results for Texas cities for the first three months of 2011 and its annual indexes for 2007 through 2010, a period covering Shade’s council years and the year before.

On a scale where 100 is the national average, Austin’s index was 93.4 in this year’s first quarter. Two big Texas cities had higher indexes: Arlington (93.5) and Dallas (95.8). Similarly, in 2010, Austin had the third-highest cost of living index among the state’s big cities, 95.5. San Antonio’s index was 95.6, the one for Arlington was 99.3.

In 2009, though, Austin ranked No. 1 among the state’s big cities, at 96.5. In 2008, it landed narrowly second with an index of 95.5 to San Antonio’s 95.6. And in 2007, Austin led the state’s big cities, at 94.5.

We sought out Dean Frutiger, project manager for the council’s cost-of-living index, who noted that the most expensive city in Texas appears to be less costly than the national average. Austin’s costs, he said, are ""still way below the national average. What’s the big deal?"" 
Then again, Frutiger said, it may be significant to any Texas comparisons that the index doesn’t consider property taxes, which are a big deal in the state.

So we made a run at seeing how property taxes in Austin stack up compared to those in the state’s other big cities.

The Texas state comptroller’s office nudged us to its web page showing 2009 property tax rates for every government unit in every county. We combined the 2009 rates for Austin, the Austin school district and Travis County and compared that to similar combined rates in the big cities of Arlington, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. Austin’s combined rate of $2.044 came out the lowest of the seven cities; next-lowest was San Antonio’s combined rate of $2.137 with the highest proving Fort Worth’s $2.441.

Upshot: Austin’s cost of living has consistently run ahead of most of the state’s other big cities, but Austin wasn’t No. 1 in the latest three-month period or 2010.

This statement includes another troubling facet. It’s illogical to pin the relative cost of living on a one-term council member. In this instance, it would make just as much sense to say Shade personally drove down the cost of living.

"['New Jersey', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Piers Morgan']","
CNN’s Piers Morgan says Gov. Chris Christie’s “poll ratings have been going up”
","
CNN host Piers Morgan has joined the chorus of national voices asking Gov. Chris Christie if he’ll make a bid for the White House in 2012.

Although Christie said he wouldn’t, Morgan pressed him on the issue.

""Here's the thing. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to run this time. I mean, you've got the economy in tatters. Your record on that is pretty strong. You're admired for it. Your poll ratings have been going up,"" Morgan said in an interview with Christie on ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that aired June 14.

Really? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check if Christie’s poll ratings are increasing.

The publicist for ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" declined comment on Morgan’s claim.

We looked at two measurements with enough data available to compare over time: the governor’s job approval and favorability ratings -- and found that recently, the governor’s ratings have not increased.

Polls on job approval ratings conducted by Quinnipiac University, Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind and Monmouth University interview registered New Jersey voters.

Quinnipiac’s polls show Christie’s job approval rating climbed from 44 percent in June 2010 to 52 percent in February, before falling to 47 percent in April and then to 44 percent in June. Those polls had a margin of error between 2.4 and 2.7 percentage points.

PublicMind polls also show a recent decline. They put Christie’s job approval rating at 52 percent in the beginning of March 2010 and at 43 percent by the end of that month. By January it had climbed to 53 percent. By April it had dropped to 51 percent and in May it fell to 44 percent. The margins of error on those polls are between 3.5 and 4 percentage points.

Monmouth University/NJ Press Media polls showed the governor’s job approval rating at 42 percent in April 2010, 49 percent in February and 46 percent this May. Those polls had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

According to Rasmussen Reports polls, which survey likely New Jersey voters, Christie’s job approval rating was 53 percent in April 2010. In September 2010 it jumped to 57 percent. But a May poll shows it has leveled back off at 53 percent. Those polls had a 4.5 percentage point margin of error. Rasmussen is widely considered Republican-leaning.

Ben Dworkin, director of the the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, noted that a poll is ""just a scientific model of a particular moment in time"" and that if a poll goes up or down a point or two ""it can also be considered statistically the same thing."" But, he said, if done well, polls can offer a pretty accurate portrayal of the public’s mood.

Dworkin also said that when people discuss whether poll ratings are increasing, ""they are talking about from one poll to the next,"" unless they say otherwise.

We then spoke to the heads of three polling institutes to get their analyses of the data.

Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute, and Peter Woolley, the executive director of PublicMind, both said Christie’s job approval ratings are not increasing.

Scott Rasmussen, founder of Rasmussen Reports, said the governor’s job approval ratings have been ""pretty steady"" since he took office.

We also looked at the governor’s favorability rating -- a measurement that focuses more on personal attributes than policy issues. We found two institutes that tracked that rating over time. PublicMind showed a drop from 47 percent to 40 percent between the most recent surveys and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University showed a very slight dip. Both polling institutes show the rating going down when compared over a longer period of time.

Let’s review. Morgan said Christie’s poll ratings ""have been going up.""

Polls measuring the governor’s job approval and favorability ratings all show a dip in the numbers among the most recent surveys.

If we look at the same polls over a longer time frame, they show Christie’s ratings have remained relatively steady -- but staying even isn’t growth

For these reasons, we rate Morgan’s statement False.

"['State Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Texas', ""Martin O'Malley""]","
Democratic Governors Association chief says Texas Gov. Rick Perry relied on stimulus more than other governors to close 2010 budget gap
","
The day after Texas Gov. Rick Perry filled in for Donald Trump at a gathering of New York Republicans, Democratic Governors Association Chairman Martin O’Malley of Maryland poked at Perry’s anti-Washington message. 
Suggesting that President Barack Obama is tackling the nation’s economic problems with ""responsible budget cuts"" and ""smart investments,"" O’Malley added: ""As the governor who relied most on stimulus funds to close his state’s budget deficit in 2010, Rick Perry surely understands the value of the president’s investments."" 
Perry was No. 1 in using federal stimulus aid to make the budget balance? 
It’s no secret that Texas, like other states, leaned heavily on stimulus aid in 2009, when lawmakers wrote the 2010-11 budget. Earlier this year, we rated Mostly True Obama’s statement that Perry ""helped balance his budget with about $6 billion worth of federal help."" State budget-writers in 2009 used $6.4 billion in stimulus aid, accepted by Perry, to help pay for programs over the next two years that historically had been financed with state revenue. 
O’Malley’s assertion, in contrast, focuses on how stimulus dollars were allocated in the first year of the state’s biennial budget cycle. 
To back up the statement, a Democratic Governors Association spokeswoman pointed us to a news article on CNN.com titled ""Texas’s love/hate relationship with Washington’s money."" The article says that Perry ""likes to trumpet that his state balanced its budget in 2009 while keeping billions in its rainy day fund"" but adds that Texas couldn’t have pulled that off without Washington’s help. ""Turns out Texas was the state that depended the most on those very stimulus funds to plug nearly 97 percent of its shortfall for fiscal 2010,"" the article states, citing the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
The conference, which says online that it does research and advocacy for lawmakers in every state, included the 97 percent statistic in a July 2009 report on state budgets. The information was collected through a NCSL survey that, among other questions, asked states about ""the major actions they took to close (fiscal year) 2010 budget gaps"" and the relative share of the gap that each addressed. 
Stimulus aid proved a popular solution; without it, ""state fiscal problems would have been even more severe,"" the report said. Among the 25 states that reported using stimulus money ""as part of their solution,"" the report says the states depending most heavily on these funds were Texas (where the aid ""represented 96.7 percent of the total solution"") and Nebraska (""88 percent of the total solution""). 
We noticed a wrinkle. The NCSL analysis draws on information from just 35 states. Asked which states they are, Arturo Perez, director of the conference’s fiscal affairs program, told us by email that he couldn’t say. ""We do not have the ability to identify which states were part of the original data set"" because the database has been updated since the report was produced, he said. 
The report gives information for all 50 states in only one category: budget gap figures for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. For 2010, the report says, the Texas ""budget gap"" was $3.3 billion, or half ""of an overall shortfall of $6.6 billion"" for the 2010-11 biennium. 
Todd Haggerty, a policy analyst for the Denver- and Washington-based group, told us that the Texas information in the report was provided by the state’s Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. John Barton, a spokesman for the board, explained that the $6.6 billion biennial budget gap was calculated by subtracting available state revenue from what lawmakers actually spent. The stimulus money covered 96.7 percent of the difference, he said. 
Remember, that $6.6 billion is a two-year figure. For the 2010 budget gap, the Legislative Budget Board split the number in half and reported that the same percentage was filled by stimulus funds that year: 96.7 percent. The Legislature didn’t make any significant cuts or raise taxes in order to balance the 2010-11 budget, Barton said. 
We sought other studies that could help us assess the accuracy of O’Malley’s claim but came up short. 
Next, we tried to find out why Texas’ reliance on stimulus funds to balance its 2010 budget was higher than that of the other states in the NCSL report. 
We got this response from Mike Leachman, assistant director of the state fiscal project at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington: ""It’s true that Gov. Perry relied on stimulus funding (to balance his budget). He accepted the vast majority of the stimulus money, just like any other governor, and that allowed Texas to avoid most or all of the cuts that otherwise might have needed to happen in the current budget cycle. But what’s not true is that he depended on it more than other governors. Every governor accepted virtually all of the stimulus money."" 
Because the stimulus funds that helped states balance their budgets were keyed to such factors as population, Medicaid spending and unemployment rates — and not the size of a state’s budget gap — big states such as Texas generally had more at their disposal. (Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier made the same point in an email conversation with us.) 
How much a state relied on stimulus dollars to close its budget gap depended on the size of its shortfall, Leachman said. His point: The smaller the gap, the larger the amount that could be closed with stimulus dollars. 
Texas had a relatively small shortfall in 2010 — 10.7 percent of the state’s general revenue budget, according to the center’s data — compared with other states. (Only six states had smaller budget shortfalls by percentage of the state’s general fund budget, according to the center's data.) 
By contrast, in states with relatively large shortfalls — for example, New Jersey, whose 2010 budget gap constituted about 40 percent of its general fund budget, according to the center’s data — stimulus funds alone were not enough to balance the budget. In February 2009, then-Gov. Jon Corzine said stimulus dollars would cover only about half the 2010 gap, according to a Salon.com article. And in California, where the budget gap was more than 50 percent of the general fund budget, stimulus funds accounted for less than 15 percent of the total budget ""solutions,"" according to an October 2009 report by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. 
On average, states closed about a third of their 2010 shortfalls with stimulus funds, Leachman said. The remaining holes were closed by cutting spending, raising taxes and fees, tapping reserve funds and using one-time funding sources. 
We circled back to the Democratic Governors Association, explaining our findings. Spokeswoman Lis Smith stood by O’Malley’s statement. 
So, what about our rating? 
Based on available information, O’Malley’s claim is accurate, though the survey backing up his claim did not include results from 30 percent of the states. It’s possible that some of them relied on stimulus dollars to close their 2010 budget gaps to the same degree that Texas did — or greater. O’Malley’s statement also ignores the mathematical reality that Texas received a greater-than-most share of stimulus dollars to plug a budget shortfall that was smaller than most.

"['Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Social Security', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Fitzgerald']","
Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says half of state residents are “on some kind of government handout”
","
Addressing the Wisconsin Republican Party’s annual convention on May 21, 2011, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, reflected on the transformational 2010 elections. The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor’s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.

""That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can’t ignore,"" Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.

""Our government is growing too fast, too big; it’s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.""

One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state’s residents -- receive a ""government handout?""

That’s a lot of Wisconsinites.

We asked Fitzgerald’s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss’ claim ""looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.""

That’s not much of a defense.

Welhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today:

""A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929.""

That all may be true. But it’s off point.  

The article indicates what percentage of Americans’ overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.

We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.

Welhouse didn’t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.

The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.

We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here’s what we found: 

Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.

If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.

But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald.


We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a ""government handout.""

All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.

The article cited by Fitzgerald’s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.

Here’s the bottom line:

Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents ""is on some kind of government handout."" He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.

We rate Fitzgerald’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B4240>],/factchecks/2011/may/26/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says health care reform has hampered hiring by driving up business costs
","
Congress passed a health care bill last year with twin goals of insuring more Americans while putting the brakes on runaway medical spending. We’ll see if those goals are achieved sometime after 2014 when the main provisions take effect. Until then, all we have are projections.

Sen. Rob Portman, however, focused recently on the here and now.  Even before the big provisions kick in that will expand health coverage to nearly all Americans, Portman says he is hearing from employers that their premiums are rising because of the law, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And those rising costs are making it harder for them to hire new employees, he says.

""The legislation which Washington passed last year has made it more difficult to hire because it’s increased the cost of hiring someone,"" Portman told reporters on May 3, when he unveiled a ""Jobs Plan"" that included a proposed rollback of the health law.

A few days later, Portman said small businesses have told him health care reform is already driving up their costs. ""People are telling me 15- and 16-percent premium increases,"" he said.

Some provisions of the health care law did take effect last fall and early this year. Employers now must enroll employees’ dependent children, if the parents wish to add them, until they are 26 years old. New policies must pay for preventive care without tapping the employee’s deductible. And health plans cannot cap the lifetime value of medical care they will cover.

Each of these might seem like it would make insurance premiums jump. ""It’s a basic principle of economics: If you add more things, it will cost more,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby.

Yet conservative business groups and liberal advocates alike say that generally, those increases have been small. Adding a 24-year-old to your health coverage might require you to get a family plan if you only have individual or spousal coverage, so your employer would have a higher cost if it pays for part of your insurance. But young adults typically don’t use a lot of medical services and have very low health care costs.

Similarly, full coverage of preventive care is only required for new policies.

As for the lifting of lifetime limits on what a plan will pay, Bill Robertson, president of the Concord Benefit Planning Agency, a benefits consultant from Lake County, near Cleveland, told us that rarely happens now since the caps tend to be a $1 million or more. ""I’ve been in business 36 years,"" he said. ""I have cumulatively insured 50,000 people. I have seen one claim go above the cap.""

Altogether, these new requirements added an average of 2.5 percent this year to the cost of employer-provided health insurance, according to modeling by the Lockton Benefits Group, a division of Lockton Cos., a large, privately held insurance brokerage.

A study last fall by Mercer, an international consulting firm, put the average cost increase attributable to the immediate changes at 2.3 percent, with small companies (under 500 workers) averaging 3 percent and large companies (5,000 or more workers) 1.9 percent.

Finally, the Ohio Department of Insurance, which regulates insurers and must approve many rate hikes, says premiums have risen about 15 percent, but only 2 to 3 percent is due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act.

We asked Portman to elaborate on his claim. He mentioned a Congressional Budget Office study that, he said, predicted 800,000 fewer people in jobs as a result of the health care legislation.

That’s after 2014, however, and the study did not actually state this number of jobs. Instead, congressional Republicans extrapolated the number -- variously cited as 650,000 or 800,000 -- during a hearing in which the CBO director was testifying. Separate analyses by PolitFact,FactCheck.org, and The Washington Post all found problems with the GOP’s interpretation. The CBO never said these jobs would be lost due to higher cost for employers.

Rather, the CBO discussed a small reduction in the amount of labor in the economy, some of which would be caused by people leaving the workforce because they will no longer need to hold onto a job just to maintain their health insurance.

PolitiFact ruled that a claim nearly identical to Portman’s, based on the CBO report, was False. Portman, however, told us that he based his claim on more than the CBO study. As he has said several times recently, this is what Ohio business owners are telling him. He provided us with names.

Fredon Corp., a family-owned precision machining company in Mentor, has 78 employees and avoided layoffs during the economic downturn, said Alyson Scott, the chief financial officer. Now it plans to start hiring.

Rising health insurance costs do make hiring a bigger challenge, she said. ""It absolutely goes to your overall expenses,"" she said.

The company used to face annual premium hikes of about 10 percent -- increases the insurance industry attributed to inflation, an aging population and high use of medical services by all Americans. But Fredon was quoted a 22.6 percent hike for this year for the same Medical Mutual of Ohio coverage that it had in 2010.

""They said they have no idea what’s going to happen in the future and they have to cover their costs,"" Scott said.

Fredon’s insurance broker, Lisa Dimberio Nelson of Right Track Benefits, negotiated the increase down to 15 percent, said Scott, whose account was confirmed by Nelson.

""What the carriers are telling us,"" Nelson said, ""is that it’s the mandates."" They say ""it’s not our fault, it’s the mandates,"" she said.

Yet Fredon plans to expand its workforce anyway. So did higher premiums really have an effect?

Absolutely, said Scott. It won’t prevent hiring, but it has caused the company to reassess ""how much we’re hiring, and at what stage.""

We contacted Medical Mutual and asked about rate hikes necessary to cover the mandates of the Affordable Care Act.

""At this point, health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing and it is too early to determine the future impact as the major provisions of the legislation do not take effect for nearly three more years,"" said Ed Byers, Medical Mutual’s spokesman. He was at a loss to explain why Fredon and its broker had the clear impression that a big part of its increase was due to health reform mandates.

Portman’s office recommended other companies to us, too. Three of them agreed to interviews: PR Machine Works in Mansfield, Mound Laser in Miamisburg, and Rebsco Inc. in Greenville.

Zoi Romanchuk, vice president of PR Machine Works, said premiums rose just 3 percent this year at her 55-employee company, but she expects a big increase next year. The company saw a 30 percent increase in 2009, which predates health reform. She said that other companies tell her they got hit with 30 percent and 40 percent hikes this year.

Has this effected hiring at her company?

""Not yet,"" she said.

Mound Laser President and CEO Larry Dosser said premiums rose 20 percent this year, after experiencing premium increases in the low single digits for his 30-employee company. The company used to pay 100 percent of its workers’ policy costs but dropped its share to 90 percent, Dosser said.

Ninety percent of Mound Laser’s work involves making microscopic parts for manufacturers in the medical device industry, which will face a special tax starting in 2013 to help offset health reform’s costs.

The White House says the tax won’t hurt because the medical device industry will prosper from new patients gaining health insurance, but Dosser fears it could force his customers to move overseas, impacting his business.

So is Mound Laser slowing its hiring?

Not at all, Dosser said. It plans to grow to about 50 employees by the end of the year, ""because I refuse to be dictated to by those kinds of policies.""

Then there’s Rebsco, a metal fabrication design and manufacturing company. It faced a 23 percent premium hike for insurance on its 20 employees, but held it down to 10 percent to 12 percent by raising the deductible. That means that workers, too, got hit with higher out-of-pocket costs, according to Tyeis Baker-Baumann, the company’s president.

Has it affected hiring?

It has in the sense that every new expense hurts, Baumann said. Her company could use two or three more workers, but ""we’re not going to (hire) at this point,"" she said. ""We’ll put that discussion off for as long as possible.""

Why are employers under the impression that health care reform is to blame for double-figure rate hikes? Gary Claxton, vice president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and an authority on the insurance marketplace, offered this theory: ""If you were an insurer and you wanted to blame someone else, wouldn’t you blame the government?""

So how do we assess Portman’s statement?

We have the CBO report, which would point toward a rating of False.

We have assessments from the insurance industry and regulators, which put the premium increases attributable to the new law around 2.5 percent.

And we have the companies Portman cited.

Fredon Corp. says it has not cut hiring, but is reassessing how much. Its insurer insists health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing.

PR Machine Works is still hiring.

Mound Laser is not slowing its hiring because that would be a capitulation.

And Rebsco will delay new hiring because every new cost hurts -- including insurance.

After looking at considerable amounts of data and studies, talking with industry and association experts and phoning people who run small companies, we found that Portman’s statement had some elements of truth. But there were too many critical facts pointing the other direction, too many misleading or confused assumptions about the cause of double-digit premium hikes -- and too few actual lost jobs or slowdowns attributable to health reform -- for the Truth-O-Meter to point in any other direction than Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975ADEC0>],/factchecks/2011/may/26/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-health-care-reform-has-hamper/

Randi Shade says several council candidates in last 15 years have come back from larger deficits than hers
","
Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, suggesting history’s on her side, says past elections show she can rebound in her June runoff against Kathie Tovo, who nearly unseated her May 14.

Five days after initial balloting that gave Tovo 46 percent and Shade nearly 33 percent, Shade told reporters ""the margin between me and my opponent on Election Day was just over 4,000 votes... there have been several examples over the last 15 years where candidates have made up larger vote deficits than mine to win in a run-off.""

Several?

In the four-person Place 3 race, Shade trailed Tovo by 4,316 votes,.

After leaving a message with Shade’s camp, we hunted for comparable comebacks over the 15 years Shade referenced. In those years, according to the city’s online database summarizing City Council election results, five second-place finishers in general elections won their runoffs: Beverly Griffith (1996); Bill Spelman and Willie Lewis (1997); Raul Alvarez (2000); and Jennifer Kim (2005).

However, only two closed a first-round gap of more than 4,000 votes. Spelman bested Manuel Zuniga after trailing by 8,813 votes in their initial race. Kim overtook Margot Clarke after Clarke ran 7,771 votes ahead in the general election. The other runoff victors earlier ran behind by about 1,100 to nearly 2,100 votes.

Austin consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter, agreed that just the two candidates rebounded after lagging by more than 4,000 votes. He said Spelman is the sole council hopeful in the period who bounced back from a greater percentage deficit than the nearly 13.5 points separating Shade and Tovo in this year’s general election, though Kim was behind about 13 points in her first round. 
Shade spokeswoman Lynda Rife told us: ""The meaty part (of Shade’s statement) is there’s precedent for coming back."" 
Littlefield also noted that three of the comeback candidates drew a greater number of votes in the second round than they got facing crowded fields in their general elections--though turnout was diminished. Kim’s vote haul increased 21 percent, Spelman’s runoff total bumped up 41 percent and Griffith enjoyed a 71 percent improvement.

Anything could happen in the Tovo-Shade runoff; we’re not making predictions.

Throw-granny-from-the-cliff ad says Paul Ryan plan would privatize Medicare
","
Amid discussion of the Medicare overhaul proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., an ad created by the Agenda Project, a liberal group, cut through the clutter quite dramatically -- though with critics saying it was literally over the top.

The ad, set to ""America the Beautiful,"" shows a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair toward a scenic overlook. At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the sights. But then the man picks up the pace, veers past warning signs and rushes toward a cliff. When he reaches the edge, he tips over the wheelchair, and the woman falls dramatically over the ledge. The man walks calmly away.

The ad contains no dialogue, so its point is made through a series of superimposed statements. ""In 1965, Americans made Medicare into Law. Today, Medicare provides the health insurance for 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans on Medicare live on less than $28,000 a year. Now, Republicans want to privatize Medicare. Is America beautiful without Medicare?""

We decided to check two claims in this ad. One, which we’ll look at in a different item, is whether the Ryan plan would leave the country ""without Medicare."" The second, which we’ll investigate here, is whether the Ryan budget proposal would ""privatize Medicare.""

First, we’ll provide a summary of the Ryan plan, which was passed by the House in a near-party-line vote and which has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach.

Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes.
   
Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government,  although they would receive ""premium support"" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money.

The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners.

In analyzing the claim that Ryan's plan privatizes Medicare, we see at least three questions to consider, based on our discussions with a range of policy experts:

How do you define ""privatization""?

When we contacted Erica Payne, the founder and president of the Agenda Project, she defended the use of ""privatization"" by arguing that under the current system, the purchaser is the government and the vendor is the health provider, while under the Ryan plan, the purchaser would be the patient and the vendor would be the insurance company.

""Because the choice of vendor is now in the hands of an individual who will in essence ‘shop’ for an insurance plan provided by a private company, this change will have the effect of transforming Medicare into a private insurance system,"" Payne said. ""As such, we conclude that this plan seeks to ‘privatize’ Medicare. Supplanting a government system that pays directly for benefits with a plan that inserts private companies into the exchange of goods and services seems like a fairly standard interpretation of the privatization concept.""

Is she right?

There are actually a number of definitions of privatization, but Steven Berry, a Yale University economist, said that at least one common definition does seem to fit what he calls ""Ryancare.""

In what Berry says is an oft-cited 1988 law journal article, Paul Starr, a liberal professor of sociology and public policy, wrote that one acceptable definition of ""privatization"" is, ""Instead of directly producing some service, the government may finance private services, for example, through contracting-out or vouchers.""

While the Congressional Budget Office has followed Ryan’s lead in calling the subsidies ""premium supports"" rather than ""vouchers,"" Berry said the definition still applies.

""The Ryan plan takes some functions the government currently provides and transfers these to private sector insurance companies, providing a government subsidy to pay for the private sector services,"" he said. ""Ryan is clear about this -- he thinks the private sector will do a better job in these activities as opposed to the ‘monopoly’ government agency. This is a traditional argument in favor of this kind of privatization.""

Is Medicare fully public now?

In many important ways, Medicare is a public program today. Payments to doctors are made with government money, collected through mandatory tax assessments. There’s a large bureaucracy called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that sets standards for the program and carries out enforcement.

But Robert Moffitt, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, points out that Medicare -- despite its reputation as an exemplar of single-payer health care -- has some noteworthy aspects that are more accurately considered private.

""The entire Medicare delivery system -- doctors, hospitals, home health care agencies, nursing homes, hospice care facilities -- are almost all private agents or institutions,"" Moffitt said. ""Exceptions would include county or public hospitals that are reimbursed for treating Medicare patients.""

In addition, most Medicare enrollees have supplemental insurance to cover costs the program doesn't, and most of this supplemental coverage is either bought on the private market or secured through employers. The Medicare Advantage program, which accounts for roughly a quarter of Medicare enrollees, is run by private insurers using Medicare funds. About 60 percent of seniors are enrolled in private drug plans in the Medicare Part D Program.

Finally, the federal government already administers Medicare through private contractors, usually large private insurance carriers that process Medicare claims.

So while the Ryan plan would shift the needle further toward the private sector than it is today, it’s important to remember that Medicare today is not simply a government program without a private-sector role.

How much of a government role would remain under the Ryan plan?

Ryan’s spokesman, Conor Sweeney, emphasizes that under the proposal, Medicare will retain significant government aspects.

""The government continues to collect payroll taxes to fund Medicare for future seniors,"" Sweeney said. ""It provides financial support to guarantee that future seniors are covered. And it tightly regulates the plans among which future seniors get to choose, so that they are protected from discriminatory pricing. Under our plan, Medicare remains a government program dedicated to help fulfill the health security for America’s seniors. The real question on Medicare is not whether government should be involved, it is how much power should the government have over individual health care decisions?""

Several economists with experience in privatization issues told us there’s enough evidence to call the Ryan proposal a privatization plan.

""I would have to say that (privatization) is a correct characterization of the plan's operation,"" said Ellen Dannin, a Penn State law professor. ""It isn't private in the sense that a mom-and-pop store is private but, rather, it would operate more or less as a regulated and heavily subsidized private industry. Because someone reaching the age for enrollment in Medicare after the bill's threshhold date would have no ability to enroll in Medicare (as currently structured), their best and only option seems likely to be taking the plan's payment and enrolling in a private plan provided by an insurance company.""

Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist, said that the Ryan plan would clearly shift the duties for paying expenses from a federal agency to a private insurance company. The act of the government providing regulatory oversight, he said, isn’t the same as the government providing a service.

Noll added that confusion on this issue may stem from an imprecise understanding of how Medicare actually works. ""Health care and insurance are separate services,"" he said. ""Medicare always has relied on privatized health care. What's being privatized in the Ryan plan is health insurance services.""

So where does this leave us?

It’s true that under the Ryan proposal, the government will retain important duties in running Medicare. But ""privatization"" does not have to mean that the government has nothing further to do with the enterprise. Under longstanding definitions, privatization could take place without the government giving up its right to regulate a privately provided service, such as an electric utility. That said, we think it’s fair to note that Medicare already provides some types of coverage through private insurance now, so the shift toward the private sector prompted by the Ryan plan would be more a question of degree than kind. On balance, we conclude that the idea that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would ""privatize Medicare"" is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D9FD00>],/factchecks/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-ad-says-paul-ryan-plan-would-pr/

We looked at this question before, in relation to an ad run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats’ campaign arm. In part, the ad claimed that by passing the proposal in the House, Republicans had ""voted to end Medicare."" In conjunction with other misrepresentations, that formulation earned the ad a rating of Pants on Fire.

We concluded that, while the Ryan plan represents a dramatic change in Medicare, it was not a proposal to ""end"" Medicare. Seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year although at a rate not expected to match the rise in medical costs. The government would still play a critical role in directing the program and setting standards.

Many Democrats criticized our ruling, arguing that the Ryan proposal would change the program so fundamentally -- revoking its status as a government-run, single-payer system -- that the plan ends Medicare. As Erica Payne, the founder and president of the Agenda Project, put it, ""While it is true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet, a rose with no petals is just a thorny stick.""

But we disagree, because dramatically changing a program is not the same as ending it.

When we contacted Payne for her view, she said that PolitiFact drew the wrong conclusion from the ad’s use of the phrase ""without Medicare."" To Payne, the question asks a broader philosophical question rather than making a statement about the Ryan plan.

The ad ""seeks to broaden the discussion around this specific issue by posing a question of national philosophy,"" Payne said. ""‘Is America beautiful without Medicare?’ is a question all Americans should be discussing. In these budget-challenging times, it is critical to examine what we value most, and which of those things that we value are actually critical to our national pride, indeed to our identity. ... A lawmaker who believes our country is as ‘beautiful’ without Medicare would probably be more likely to support gutting the program to a shadow of its former self.""

We understand her argument, but we think a reasonable viewer -- especially having just ""seen"" an old lady being dumped over a cliff -- would take away a more concrete meaning to the question, namely that the Ryan plan ends Medicare. Because we found other problems in the DCCC ad that we did not find in the Agenda Project ad, we’re not giving this particular claim a Pants on Fire rating. But the notion that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country ""without Medicare"" merits a rating of False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097911C80>],/factchecks/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-asks-what-country-would-be-with/

Gov. McDonnell says U.S. debt shrank in comparison to GDP for decades after World War II era
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell used some historical context to argue the national debt is on an unsustainable arc.

""After World War II, we (had) just about 100 percent of GDP tied up in debt, but over 30 years there was a reduction in the debt until the 1980s,"" McDonnell said in a video interview posted online May 20 by Human Events, a conservative website.

With all the talk about the U.S. hitting the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling recently, it’s hard to imagine an era when the government actually reduced its borrowing load in proportion to the national economy.  

We wondered if McDonnell was right.

The governor was talking about U.S. debt as a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product, which is the value of all goods and services produced in the nation. Economists say the percentage is important because it measures a nation’s ability to support its debt.

After World War II, did that percentage slide down in the U.S. until the 1980s?

Before we get into the numbers, it’s helpful to point out at that the U.S. national debt is made up of two components. The biggest chunk is publicly held debt owed to investors, the Federal Reserve as well as state and local governments that have purchased U.S. securities. The second piece is debt held by government accounts, mostly trust funds for Social Security, Medicare, military retirement and other programs.

We asked the governor’s office where the information for his statement came from.
Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, sent us a Congressional Budget Office table showing the level of publicly held debt as a percentage of GDP from 1790 to 2000. That graphic shows a relatively steady drop from the post-World War II peak to around 1980.

To get an idea of how the debt level changed each year between the mid-1940s and the 1980s, we also examined historical tables on the Office of Management and Budget’s website.

Let’s start with 1946, the year after World War II ended. At the end of that fiscal year, the Gross Federal Debt -- the total of public and government debt -- was 121.7 percent of GDP, its highest ever. That went on a general decline over 35 years, although there were about a half dozen times when the debt’s share of GDP rose year-to-year before dropping off again. In 1979, debt amounted to 33.2 of GDP.

If you look at just publicly-held debt as a percentage of GDP, it followed  the same trajectory. It’s highest proportion of GDP was also in 1946, when it was 108.7 percent of the nation’s economic output. That also fell off gradually until 1979, when publicly held debt was 25.6 percent of GDP.

So either way you count the debt -- total debt or just publicly-held debt -- McDonnell is correct that as a share of GDP it dropped over the roughly 35-year span between World War II’s end and the 1980s.

The total national debt as a percentage of the GDP rose during the 1980s and fell in the late 1990s. But since 2001 it’s been on the rise. Total debt is projected to be 102.6 percent at the end of the 2011 fiscal year, according to the OMB.

McDonnell warned that U.S. debt total is on its way to ""record levels."" As a percentage of GDP, the total debt still has a way to go before hitting its record level of 121.7 percent in 1946.

Measured only in dollars, the national debt for the most part has been rising since the end of World War II.

The total national debt was $270.1 billion in 1946. It increased fairly consistently to its current level of roughly $14.3 trillion on April 30, 2011.

Let’s review.

McDonnell said that since the end of World War II, the national debt as a percentage of GDP went down over a roughly 30-year period until the 1980s.

McDonnell is correct that the debt, when measured as a percentage of the country’s GDP, was on a downward trajectory during that time.

Cain mistakes Declaration of Independence language for Constitution
","
In case you had doubts, Herman Cain left no room for interpretation. He is running for president.

Cain said it twice during his Saturday rally at Centennial Olympic Park announcing his run. Videos on the large television screen repeated it. And the celebration had all the fixin’s of a presidential bid.

There were American flags. Red, white and blue balloons sailed into the air. A video of Cain, wearing a cowboy hat and striding past a farm, recounted his humble upbringing.

There was also a requisite reference to the words of our Founding Fathers:

""We don’t need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States,"" Cain said. ""We need to reread the Constitution and enforce the Constitution.""

""And I know that there’s some people that are not going to do that. So, for the benefit for those that are not going to read it because they don’t want us to go by the Constitution, there’s a little section in there that talks about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

""You know, those ideals that we live by, we believe in, your parents believe in, they instilled in you. When you get to the part about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, don’t stop right there, keep reading.

""’Cause that’s when it says that when any form of government becomes destructive of those ideals, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it. We’ve got some altering and some abolishing to do.""

Cain’s exhortation sent your PolitiFact Georgia team scrambling for a closer look at the U.S. Constitution.

The bit about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness wasn’t there. We did a computer search of its text to make sure. Nada.

Constitutional history scholar and University of Pennsylvania professor Richard R. Beeman came to our assistance via email. That phrase is in the second paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration of Independence, which was written in 1776, 11 years before the Constitution was drafted during the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

Beeman agreed with Cain that we don’t need to rewrite the Constitution and it’s more important that Americans read it.  

""It might be a good thing if Mr. Cain would undertake that task,"" Beeman said.  

That language about abolishing government? It’s in the third paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, Beeman added.

Oops.

We asked Cain’s campaign to respond. A spokeswoman said he sometimes mentions the Constitution and Declaration of Independence at the same time.

""Quite often, he references them together when speaking of his appreciation for the work of our Founders,"" she said.

The language of the two documents can be easy for your average Joe to confuse.

But confusing the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is no small mistake, especially for a candidate for president, said Donald E. Wilkes Jr., a University of Georgia law professor.  

The Declaration is a statement of beliefs. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land.

""No court makes a legal decision based on the Declaration of Independence,"" Wilkes said.

With his first speech as a bona fide candidate, Cain joins a long, bipartisan line of presidential hopefuls who have succumbed to foot-in-mouth disease.

They include Cain’s foe, President Barack Obama, who accidentally said there were 57 states during the 2008 campaign and U.S. Sen. John McCain, who said in an interview he was unsure how many houses he owned.  

Welcome to the 2012 presidential election season, folks.

Cain earns a False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097030480>],/factchecks/2011/may/25/herman-cain/cain-mistakes-declaration-independence-language-co/

Tim Pawlenty says that as governor, he kept Minnesota off list of 10 highest-taxed states
","
When Tim Pawlenty announced his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he touted his record as a two-term governor of Minnesota.

He portrayed himself as a fiscal conservative and said he had been successful at lowering Minnesota’s tax burden.

""For decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest-taxed states in the country,"" Pawlenty said. ""I actually did it.""

To check his claim, we turned to statistics from the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group that has assembled annual studies of state taxes for decades.

The foundation tracks tax burden rankings among the 50 states going back to 1977. The foundation combines state and local tax burdens by counting items defined as taxes by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal statistical agency.

A ranking of 1 means the heaviest tax burden, while 50 means the lowest.

1978: 10th
1977: 10th

(The 2009 figures are the latest available.)

Now let’s take a closer look at four key questions:

-- Did Pawlenty keep Minnesota out of the top 10? Largely, yes. Under Pawlenty, Minnesota ranked in the top 10 highest-taxed states for only one of the seven years where data is available. It never ranked lower than 17th, but that’s still enough to make this part of Pawlenty’s claim mostly accurate.

-- Was Pawlenty the first governor to push the state out of the top 10? No. Pawlenty did indeed stand firm against tax increases, but his immediate predecessor, third-party Gov. Jesse Ventura, was really the first to cut income and property taxes, said David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn.

According to the Tax Foundation data, Minnesota was out of the top 10 for three of the four years Ventura served as governor. Pawlenty largely continued this achievement, and he presided over an even lower ranking for his first three years in office. But Ventura deserves some credit for making it happen initially.

""The major momentum occurred under Ventura,"" Schultz said.

-- Did Pawlenty achieve the lower ranking on his own? No. As in other states, Minnesota's tax policies are shaped by negotiations between the governor and the legislature. So any credit, or blame, for tax policy should be shared between the governor and the legislature. The Minnesota Senate was controlled by the Democrats during Pawlenty’s entire term. The Minnesota House was Republican-held for the first four years of Pawlenty’s term and Democratic-held for the final four years.

-- Had Minnesota been in the top 10 highest-taxed states for decades? Basically, yes. Prior to Ventura, Minnesota ranked lower than 10th for only three years out of 22, under governors of both parties. And during those three years, Minnesota barely edged out of the top 10, ranking 11th.

We should note that an Associated Press fact check came to a different conclusion than we did. The AP wrote that ""Minnesota remains among the 10 worst states in its overall tax climate, according to the Tax Foundation. In its 2011 State Business Tax Climate Index, the anti-tax organization ranks Minnesota 43rd, making it the eighth worst state. The ranking slipped from 41st two years earlier. The index considers corporate, individual, sales, unemployment insurance and property taxes.""

However, we see nothing in Pawlenty’s statement to suggest that he was talking only about business taxes. The data we used encompass a broader variety of taxes. When we asked Richard Morrison, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, to check with his group to see which measurement seemed more appropriate for Pawlenty’s comment, he agreed with us. So we’re sticking with our measurement.

So to recap, we conclude that Pawlenty did have an almost perfect record of keeping Minnesota out of the top 10 list for highest-taxed states. And he’s right that three of his predecessors, in both parties, failed to achieve what he did to any significant degree. But when he says that ""for decades before I was elected, governors tried and failed to get Minnesota out of the top 10 highest taxed states in the country,"" he ignores that Ventura achieved this in the three years before Pawlenty became governor.

George LeMieux rips Sen. Bill Nelson for Senate's budget failure
","
Update: This item was originally posted on May 20, 2011, with a ruling of Barely True. After additional reporting, the ruling was revised to Half True and republished on May 24. 
George LeMieux has been rapping his former colleague, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, in videos and campaign websites lately. LeMieux, the Republican appointed by then-Gov. Charlie Crist to fill out Mel Martinez's last 16 months in the Senate, is running on his own for a Senate seat in 2012.

In a recent video, he criticized Nelson for supporting health care reform and amnesty for illegal immigrants. He also blasted Nelson for supporting earmarks such as a $225 million ""Bridge to Nowhere"" in Alaska (we rated that Mostly True). And LeMieux insisted that he had never requested a single earmark during his short time in the Senate (we gave that one a Half True).

Now, LeMieux's linking Nelson to the Senate's failure to approve the usual annual budget.

In a tweet on May 19, 2011, LeMieux wrote: ""750 days since Bill Nelson & the Democrats in the Senate passed a budget. How can this be justified?"" 

Has it really been two-plus years since the Senate approved a budget? We decided to find out. We looked at the budget process first, then at what has happened in the past two years and finally at Nelson's role. We e-mailed LeMieux to ask him to elaborate beyond the 140 characters allowed by Twitter, but we didn't hear back.

Background on budget resolutions

For background on what ""passing a budget"" means, we turned to explanations offered previously by our PolitiFact National colleagues. Congress today follows a budget process based on the 1974 Congressional Budget Act.

That process calls for a budget resolution, passed first by the Senate Budget Committee, then by the full Senate. The resolution, says Jason Peuquet, staff analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think tank, is ""an internally binding document that defines for a period of at least five fiscal years totals of appropriation levels and outlays, federal revenues, and the resulting surplus or deficit in the budget.""

The House and Senate usually approve budget resolutions in the spring. If the chambers disagree, they work out a compromise. It's not a show-stopper if they don't approve a budget resolution, because the actual appropriation of money to all the departments and agencies in the government is a separate process.

If no resolution is approved, it becomes a talking point for the minority party -- in this case, for the Republicans. (In fact, Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, also a Senate candidate in 2012, also tweeted May 19 about the 750 days.) The inability to pass the resolution illustrates the discord in Congress and reflects poorly on the majority party. 

We should add two points. First, the budget resolution is not a bill. It outlines Congress' intent, but it doesn't go to the president or require his signature. Second, the past two years are not the first time we’ve had trouble getting a budget approved.

Since 1983, the two chambers have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. On three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007), the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.

Budgets for 2010 and 2011

We turn next to what has happened in the past two years. The Senate passed a budget resolution in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year. The final action was April 29, 2009, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service. That vote was 53-43, with all the Republicans and three Democrats voting against it.

That was the last budget resolution the Senate approved. Fast-forward to May 19, 2011, and that's exactly 750 days later. That’s the time-frame LeMieux is referencing.

From the Democrats’ viewpoint, the 2009 resolution covered the budget for the year ending Sept. 30, 2010. So Adam Jentleson, deputy communications director for Majority Leader Harry Reid, R-Nev., calls the 750-days figure ""tremendously misleading"" because it’s been only 231 days from the start of the fiscal year to LeMieux’s tweet. Remember, though, what LeMieux said was 750 days since the Senate ""passed a budget,"" not ""since we had a budget.""

So the number of days in LeMieux's tweet is correct. What has been Nelson's role in the budget haggling since then?

Nelson did his part in 2010 for a budget resolution as a member of the Senate Budget Committee. ""In April 2010, that panel by 12-10 passed a budget resolution for fiscal year 2011. Nelson voted for it,"" said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. ""Every member of LeMieux's political party voted against it.""

In the full Senate, the budget resolution introduced in 2010 by Budget Committee chairman Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota went nowhere. The  Democrats (and two independents who caucused with them) were in the majority at the time, 59-41, so they had the 51 votes needed to pass a budget.

If they had the votes, why didn’t Democrats pass a budget in 2010? We asked Jentleson in Majority Leader Reid's office to explain.

""At a time when Democrats’ top priority was creating jobs and getting our economy back on track, Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people’s time with pointless political votes, even as our economy continued to struggle in the wake of the financial crisis,"" Jentleson said. ""Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people’s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families.""

For example, Jentleson cited other 2010 laws passed with at least a little Republican support. He mentioned a jobs bill to give businesses incentives to hire more workers, passed 68-29 on March 17 with support from 11 Republicans, including LeMieux; another bill providing incentives to businesses, passed 61-38 on Sept. 16, 2010, with LeMieux and one other Republican supporting it; and the Dodd-Frank bill to overhaul financial regulation, passed 60-39 with support from three Republicans.

His point is that a complete lack of bipartisanship on the budget would have damaged the prospects for other bills.

Jentleson also points out that a budget vote is a ""completely open amendment process."" So any senator can offer any amendment -- and any number of amendments -- and they will be considered germane and require a vote. Democrats feared that Republicans could, if they chose to, use that method to stymie any budget vote. 
That explanation, though, doesn't wash with Republicans, nor with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. He says budgets are historically partisan affairs, and he looked up the last four Senate votes on them. The budget for FY 2010 didn't get a single Republican vote in 2009. The budgets for FY 2009 and 2008 passed with only two Republican votes for each. And for FY 2007, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, not one Democrat voted for it.

His explanation for the failure to pass a budget in 2010: Politics. Democrats didn't want to be seen as big spenders prior to the 2010 midterm election, so they didn't vote at all.

Budget for 2012

This year, with Republicans in control of the House and with a bigger minority in the Senate, the highest-profile budget plan for fiscal year 2012 is coming from House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan.

It passed the House on April 15. A vote is expected in the Senate this month, McLaughlin said. But forecasts are that the measure will fail in the Senate.

The other main hope for a budget, expected from a bipartisan group called the ""Gang of Six,"" ran aground just last week when a key member, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., backed out of the negotiations. Conrad, the budget committee chairman, issued a statement May 19 saying that Democrats were close to an agreement but would delay ""because of the high-level bipartisan leadership negotiations that are currently under way.""

From the Republican side, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and the ranking Republican on the committee, responded that ""as Democrats retain the majority in the Senate … it is their responsibility … to publicly present their budget to the American people."" There's the tit-for-tat talking points again.

What the analysts say

We checked again with Peuquet from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""It has technically been 750 days since the Senate last passed a budget resolution,"" he said. That makes the Democrats appear irresponsible, he said, but they have continued to allocate dollars as needed through other spending bills.

""But the larger picture is that lawmakers in Congress and the administration have so far not enacted a long-term fiscal plan to stabilize and reduce the debt,"" Peuquet said. ""That is the true metric of fiscal responsibility, and there is plenty of blame to go around for both parties as to why our fiscal outlook is so dire.""

Ellis, from Taxpayers for Common Sense, added: ""The blame for that (failure to pass a budget) always falls at the feet of the majority -- Democrat or Republican. The majority rarely gets any support (from the minority) for their budget resolution; it is a partisan affair. So last year, the Democratic majorities were concerned about schisms in their caucus and talking about spending money. It was an abdication of responsibility.""

Ellis added: ""But to say it was Sen. Nelson's fault is a big stretch. If he was budget chair or in leadership, it would be different.""

Our ruling

The number of days since a budget passed the Senate, 750, is correct. LeMieux's implication, though, is that Nelson and the Democrats in the Senate get the full blame. The truth about the stalled budget process is that it is a function of partisan politics on both sides, not just the Senate Democrats.

"['Baseball', 'Florida', 'Evan Longoria']","
Rays 3B Evan Longoria's spectacular, barehanded catch has become a must-see on YouTube
","
The video, if you haven't seen it, is amazing.

Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Evan Longoria is talking to a television reporter along the first-base line. Their backs are facing the baseball diamond, and the two are standing about 125 feet from home plate -- where a fellow Ray is taking batting practice.

The teammate sprays a line drive directly at them. Instinctively, Longoria wheels around his head and torso, extends his right arm and catches the ball barehanded.

The television reporter gasps, Longoria shakes off the pain in his hand and tosses the ball back toward the pitcher's mound. ""Keep it on the field,"" he says, nonchalantly.

The :24-second clip was first posted on YouTube May 6, 2011 by MrSprts12 and has since been viewed more than 3.8 million times. 
The biggest question: Is the video real? Or is it fake? 
PolitiFact Florida decided to take a break from politics to put the now viral video -- and the Rays superstar third baseman -- to the Truth-O-Meter. 
At first glance, the catch seems improbable. And to baseball fans, maybe even impossible. But baseball players have made amazing barehanded grabs before. In 1989, then San Francisco Giants outfielder Kevin Mitchell snared a fly ball off the bat of St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith with his bare right hand. And in 2005, New York Mets third baseman David Wright dove over his shoulder to catch a pop fly barehanded. Mitchell and Wright were in the middle of games, we should note, and saw the ball coming. Longoria had almost no time to react. 
We know several details about the video's origins, as explained by Longoria himself to the St. Petersburg Times' Marc Topkin and the Tampa Tribune's Roger Mooney. 
Longoria said the clip was filmed near the end of spring training, after Longoria spent nearly six hours filming a commercial for Gillette. Longoria said the video was shot at McKechnie Field in Bradenton, the spring home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He claims it's authentic.

The video -- ""It's still real, by the way,"" he said -- was shot with a handheld camera in one take in about five minutes, after the Gillette commercial wrapped.

""Unbelievable, huh?"" Longoria, a spokesman for Gillette who has filmed other ads, said. ""It's funny when you talk about things going viral; it really does once it gets on things like Twitter and YouTube. It goes from a small snowball to an avalanche quickly.""

Let's go back to the tape.

Because there are several things that don't add up.

In the video there are four Gillette logos visible -- two behind home plate and two on a roof facade over the third-base bleachers. But those logos aren't part of McKechnie Field in real life, Trevor Gooby, the Pirates' director of Florida operations, told a reporter for Patch.com. The logos were added digitally and included in the final video that was posted on YouTube.

Next, there is the user who posted the video, MrSprts12. The user created his YouTube account May 4 and has only uploaded the Longoria video. The user lists his company as Gillette.

Then there's the reporter and the video graphic identifying Longoria. There is no television station symbols or letters on the video, and the reporter is holding a microphone without a ""flag"" that identifies the station where the reporter works. Perhaps even stranger, we could not find the video posted on any news site. (Surely, a TV station would love to claim the video as theirs.)

A strong circumstantial case that the video is doctored.

But we wanted to keep looking. We asked Topkin -- who has covered baseball for the Times since 1987 -- what he thought of the video. From Detroit, where the Rays were playing the Detroit Tigers, Topkin said he believes it to be a well-crafted fake.

Topkin noted several things that aren't typical during a batting practice session. There is no cage surrounding the batter to catch foul balls or stop pitches that aren't hit. There's also no screen protecting the batting practice pitcher. There are no coaches in the video hitting ground balls and no other fielders on the baseball diamond to track down any hits.

And there's more. The batter, after hitting a ball right at Longoria and the reporter, isn't heard yelling for them to get out of the way. And though Longoria makes a miraculous catch, the batter returns immediately to his batting stance like nothing even happened.

The cameraman doesn't warn the reporter or Longoria either.

And  there's the frame-by-frame analysis of the video. If you watch closely enough, the ball is falling toward the ground as it approaches Longoria and the reporter. But in the last frame -- right before Longoria catches the ball -- it appears to move upward again.

""Simply put, once the ball has started into a downward trajectory, it cannot then again head upwards without an external﻿ force,"" wrote YouTube user meltingsmoke, one of several thousand people to comment or question on the video's authenticity. ""That clearly happens just before the ball is 'caught.' (It's) not the same ball and (its) trajectory is all wrong."" 
The Times has been asking readers online if they thought the catch was real or fake. The vast majority, though not all, say it's a hoax. 
With the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting the video is a fake, we asked Gillette spokesman Michael Norton if the company would put the mystery to rest. ""The video was filmed while on location for a Gillette Fusion ProGlide commercial,"" Norton told us. ""We'll leave the 'is it real?' debate up to the viewers.""

At PolitiFact, we're ready to make the judgment call for you. From computer-added Gillette signage, to the reaction of the cameraman and the batter, from the way major league teams conduct batting practice, to the video evidence, this viral YouTube video is a clever piece of advertising. And fiction. Longoria is a good sport -- and spokesman for Gillette -- for saying the catch is real. But we're not buying it. We say Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D79540>],/factchecks/2011/may/24/evan-longoria/rays-3b-evan-longorias-spectacular-barehanded-catc/

Group opposed to light bulb law claims consumers are being pushed to compact fluorescent light bulbs that are environmentally unsafe
","
A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs.

""The Democrats have already voted to BAN our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of DANGEROUS fluorescent light bulbs,"" writes Alan Gottlieb, chairman of AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates.

In another fact-check, we looked at the first half of this claim, that Democrats voted to ban incandescent light bulbs (and rated it Pants on Fire). In this item. we'll address safety issues regarding the curly-shaped compact fluorescent light bulbs and whether the small amount of mercury contained in them presents an environmental hazard in homes.

First, let's take a look at the arguments in the AmeriPAC letter and attached arguments from the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund.

The letter claims people will be required to ""throw away"" their existing incandescent light bulbs when the new law takes effect (a claim we rated Pants on Fire), and replace them with more expensive (a claim we rated Barely True) compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) bulbs that are ""supposedly"" ""environmentally safe.""

""I say 'supposedly' because the one thing the CFLs are not is 'environmentally safe,' "" wrote Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise.

The letter then relays an anecdote that has made Maine housewife Brandy Bridges a poster child of the anti-CFL movement.

""Just ask Ellsworth, Maine housewife, Brandy Bridges, who dropped and shattered a compact fluorescent light bulb on the carpeted floor in her daughter's bedroom,"" the CDFE letter states. ""Aware that CFLs are potentially hazardous, Bridges called the local Home Depot store to ask for advice. Home Depot told her that the CFL contained mercury and advised her to call the Poison Control hotline. Now remember, this is the replacement to the electric light bulb you've used for your whole life. You know...you drop one on the floor. It breaks. What do you do? Get a broom and dust pan and sweep it up. What happened when Brandy Bridges called the Poison Control hotline?

""The hotline had her contact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP sent Andrew Smith, a toxicologist, to her home. He sealed the room with plastic and told Bridges it would cost about $2,000 to clean up the mess from the one toxic $3 CFL device that broke on her floor.""

But when a CNN reporter followed up on her story in Sept. 3, 2009, he concluded that the fear engendered by the story was largely overblown.

Maine officials said they gave Bridges some bad advice and eventually came to her house and cut out the carpet.

""When contacted about the Bridges case, Maine officials said the advice to get a professional hazardous waste cleaner and remove the carpet was given before a policy on fluorescents was fully developed,"" the CNN story states. ""They no longer tell people to call a hazmat crew or remove rugs, unless the homeowner is particularly concerned.""

Maine environmental officials, who continue to be enthusiastic supporters of CFL use, also studied the issue of mercury emissions from broken CFLs and published recommendations on how to clean them up if they break. For example, they recommended using index cards or playing cards to pick up broken pieces of the bulb (don't vacuum it up, as that can spread the mercury dust). Then, place the waste in a glass jar and take it to a recycling center. They also recommend ventilating the room for several hours by opening windows.

""Our advice, if you have one of them break, just clean it up and get it out of the house,"" said toxicologist Dr. Deborah Rice of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""There's no question that mercury is a toxic substance. But the amount of it in CFLs is very small.""

She also tells people not to put CFLS in rooms where a small child might be likely to knock over a lamp.

The CDFE letter also cites an April 3, 2011, San Jose Mercury News story that begins:

The nation's accelerating shift from incandescent bulbs to a new generation of energy-efficient lighting is raising an environmental concern -- the release of tons of mercury every year.

The most popular new light -- the curlicue, compact fluorescent light bulb, or CFL -- accounts for a quarter of new bulb sales and each contains up to 5 milligrams of mercury, a potent neurotoxin that's on the worst-offending list of environmental contaminants.

Demand for the bulbs is growing as federal and state mandates for energy-efficient lighting take effect, yet only about 2 percent of residential consumers and one-third of businesses recycle them, according to the Association of Lighting and Mercury Recyclers.

""If the recycling rate remains as abysmally low as it is, then there will certainly be more mercury released into the environment,"" said Paul Abernathy, executive director of the Napa-based recycling association. ""Until the public really has some kind of convenient way to take them back, it's going to be an issue.""

However, CDFE does not include a later passage in the Mercury News article that presents a counterweight to concerns raised about small levels of mercury in CFLs:

Even with mercury worries about CFLs, they still ultimately lead to fewer mercury emissions than incandescent lights, according to the California Energy Commission. Although the old-style bulbs contain no mercury, they're often powered by coal-fired electricity plants -- which release mercury as a pollutant. The end result is about 40 percent less mercury emissions per bulb when using energy-efficient CFLs, according to EPA figures.

The fact is that incandescent light bulbs result in much more mercury being introduced into the environment, because they require four times as much electricity to operate, and much of that electricity comes from coal-fired power plants that emit mercury into the air, said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

""If you are really concerned about mercury,"" Horowitz said, ""you should really be buying CFLs even though they have small amounts of mercury in them.""

Claims about CFL safety concerns are ""wildly exaggerated,"" he said.

""They have extremely low levels of mercury, that's true,"" Horowitz said. ""But it is still in the bulb when you use them. When you are finished with them you should recycle them.""

And there are now many more places to recycle spent CFLs than there were just two years ago, he said. For example, Home Depot and Lowe's both allow people to bring their spent CFLs there for free recycling, even non-customers. And, he said, CFLs generally have about half as much mercury in them as they did just a few years ago.

Besides, he said, there is nothing in the law that requires people to buy CFLs. Light bulb companies have also developed halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency requirements; and LED technology is another option. Neither of those types of bulbs contain mercury.

It's misleading to warn about the small amount of mercury in CFLs without also noting that less efficient bulbs require more electricity and result in more mercury in the environment, said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

""They tell, shall we say, part of the story,"" Nadel said.

The tone of the letter is clearly designed to heighten fears about CFLs in an effort to bolster an argument about government over-regulation. Mercury is, in fact, a toxic substance, and CFLs contain a small amount of mercury (a fraction of the amount contained in a mercury thermometer). But government and environmental officials say the risk they pose is very small, particularly if the light bulbs are disposed of properly and cleaned up properly if one shatters. Moreover, the warnings fail to acknowledge that there is a price to pay for sticking with less efficient traditional incandescent light bulbs. Those bulbs require far more electricity to operate, and, if they are powered by coal-fired power plants, result in even more mercury emitted into the environment. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096970180>],/factchecks/2011/may/24/ameripac/group-opposed-light-bulb-law-claims-consumers-are-/

Louie Gohmert says Gov. Rick Perry is begging for Coast Guard to patrol two border lakes
","U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, sounded downbeat about President Barack Obama’s commitment to securing the U.S.-Mexico border May 10, the day the president spoke on immigration policy in El Paso.

In an interview on the Georgia-based Martha Zoller Show, Gohmert pointed to two lakes that straddle the border, Falcon Lake and Lake Amistad.

Gohmert went on to say he'd recently visited with Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ""they've been begging for the federal government to give us some Coast Guard help"" on the lakes because Texas is ""having to do what the federal government will not and try to patrol the lakes but they, the drug cartels, have spotters, they watch where these guys are; we need Coast Guard down there protecting our border. You’ve got people being smuggled, drugs being smuggled and the president will not lift one finger here to see there is protection.""

Never mind the president’s fingers; has the state of Texas begged for Coast Guard help on the lakes?

The lakes are man-made reservoirs about 200 miles apart on the Rio Grande; the international boundary runs down the center of the river channel. According to Alan Cox, superintendent of the Amistad National Recreation Area, Lake Amistad, 12 miles northwest of Del Rio, has had no cartel-tied deaths.

But on Falcon Lake, about 40 miles east of Laredo, an American jet skiier was gunned down last fall. Stratfor, an Austin intelligence firm, subsequently speculated that the man, who had been viewing Mexican ruins with his wife, was murdered by low-level members of Los Zetas, a drug trafficking group, who were trying to protect the smuggling corridor.

As reported by The Houston Chronicle in October, the ambush by three boatloads was the fifth reported confrontation with ""pirates"" on the border lake since the spring. It was the first involving a shooting death, followed by a gun chase extending to the U.S. side.

More recently, the San Antonio Express-News reported that on May 8 Mexican marines patrolling the lake killed 12 presumed Zeta drug gang members in a battle that erupted after the military discovered an island drug encampment.

When we sought backup for Gohmert’s statement, his office pointed us to Perry’s Aug. 9 letter to Obama urging additional federal resources to combat ""increasing violence"" on the border. His three-page letter termed insufficient the approved deployment of ""just 286 National Guard personnel"" on the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border and revisits Perry’s request for the federal government to send 1,000 National Guard troops to Texas and fly unmanned aircraft on the border.

His letter does not mention the Coast Guard.

Next, Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us the state has not asked the federal government to send the Coast Guard to the lakes. But, she said, Perry has spoken to members of Congress ""about getting Coast Guard (personnel)"" on the lakes. ""It’s pretty damn obvious the governor has been pretty adamant about getting additional (border) resources... however they send them down, that’s great,"" Cesinger said.

In an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesman Adam Fetcher did not speak directly to Texas seeking Coast Guard help on the lakes. He said, though, that the Coast Guard works with the Border Patrol to ""conduct periodic patrol operations in the (border) area and surge(s) as needed.""

Fetcher specified that the Coast Guard, drawing on personnel based in Corpus Christi and other South Texas locales, conducts periodic operations on Falcon Lake, but he did not mention security on Lake Amisted. Cox later told us the Coast Guard conducts joint lake patrols on Lake Amistad with the National Park Service about four times a year.

Cox said one reason there have been no deaths on the lake linked to the illegal drug trade is the presence of many law enforcement officers: The Border Patrol has 20 agents assigned to the lake, the park service has 17 agents and the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department maintains eight game wardens out of nearby Del Rio, he said.

Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez, whose jurisdiction includes Falcon Lake, said by email he was unaware of any request by Gohmert for Coast Guard patrols on Falcon Lake, though he said they would ""do good... and are needed."" Gonzalez said the Coast Guard already comes to the lake ""once in a while... not very often"" because, he speculated, of budgetary limits.

Our sense: It’s possible Perry has informally talked to some House members about putting the Coast Guard on the lakes--where that force already periodically ventures. But he’s made no formal direct request to the government. That’s far from ""begging"" for Coast Guard deployment.

We rate Gohmert’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FE380>],/factchecks/2011/may/24/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-gov-rick-perry-begging-coast-gu/

Cain said food stamp program use up under Obama
","
With the fire of a Baptist preacher, Georgia’s newest presidential prospect warned a crowd of thousands that the country has gone astray under President Barack Obama.

""We have become a nation of crises,"" Republican Herman Cain shouted during his Saturday announcement at Centennial Olympic Park that he’s running for president.

""Look at the facts. Don’t listen to the rhetoric,"" he said. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment.

""Forty-seven million people on food stamps,"" Cain said. ""That’s 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over.""  

Food stamps? your PolitiFact Georgia scribes wondered. What’s with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately?

Last week, the state’s other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called ""the most successful food stamp president in American history"" because ""47 million Americans are on food stamps.""

We ruled Gingrich’s statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame.

Cain, a former radio talk show host and Godfather’s Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to ""look at the facts."" PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him.  

Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries.

The most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available.

Cain’s numbers aren’t quite accurate, but he’s close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high.  

The number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, February’s count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969.

Obama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration.

Cain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, he’s close, but not quite right.

Whether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear.

The rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell.

The number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama.
   
Another reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two.
   
Cain’s accusation against Obama was not as barbed as Gingrich’s, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the president’s feet. We therefore give the presidential candidate a Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097705B00>],/factchecks/2011/may/24/herman-cain/cain-said-food-stamp-program-use-under-obama/

Policy Matters Ohio's Amy Hanauer says four of every 10 Ohio children qualify for subsidized lunches
","
Whether overhauling Ohio’s collective bargaining law or proposing dramatic budget cuts, Republican Gov. John Kasich’s agenda has drawn thousands of protesters to the Statehouse this year.

Amy Hanauer of the liberal think tank Policy Matters Ohio delivered a speech at the Statehouse on May 5 – the day the GOP-controlled Ohio House of Representatives passed the budget – that focused on the working class and the government policies that have damaged it.

""To give a sense of how families are struggling, a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch,"" said Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio.

The statistic is effective because it’s easy to understand.

Free or reduced-price school lunches are directly linked to poverty, and 40 percent seems like a high number of Ohio students who qualify for the subsidy. PolitiFact Ohio decided to look into Hanauer’s claim to see if she has her facts straight.

Before we were able to reach Hanauer, Internet research produced news reports from this year about subsidized lunch statistics in Ohio. A story The Columbus Dispatch published February 13, citing statistics from the Ohio Department of Education, reported that four out of 10 Ohio students receive free or reduced-price lunch through a federal program for low-income students.

We called the Department of Education for the statistics used in the story. A department spokesman handed over data it received from the National School Lunch Program, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The National School Lunch Program provides cash subsidies to public and private schools across the country to serve free and reduced-price lunches to eligible children.

The data, collected in October and released in February, shows 825,469 Ohio students received free or reduced-priced lunch out of 1,876,355 students who attend Ohio schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Of those students participating in the program, 716,084 receive free lunch and 109,385 received reduced-price lunch.

Based on those numbers, about 44 percent of students at Ohio schools participating in the federal subsidized lunch program qualify for the benefit – exceeding the four-in-10 ratio Hanauer cited.

But are there Ohio schools that don’t participate in the federal subsidized lunch program? If so, the overall percentage of Ohio students getting free or reduced-priced lunch could drop below 40 percent.

We checked back with the Department of Education to get the total number of students in the state. There are about 2,042,538 students in Ohio, according to the department. So we plugged the new total into our calculation (825,469 students getting subsidized lunch divided by 2.04 million kids) and the result was 40.4 percent – equal to a 4-to-10 ratio.

So Hanauer was correct in citing the ratio of Ohio kids getting a subsidized lunch. She also called the statistic a record. How does that stack up?

Similar data from the Department of Education was readily available dating back to 2002. Since 2002, the highest percentage of students receiving subsidized lunch was, in fact, in 2010.

In 2009, which saw the second-highest participation, 42 percent of students at schools participating in the federal program received subsidized lunch (compared to 44 percent in 2010).

Hanauer’s speech was spot-on about the ratio of kids receiving subsidized lunch.

As for calling the ratio a record, neither the Department of Education nor the USDA provided data that showed a higher percentage in the past.

We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B1A680>],/factchecks/2011/may/24/amy-hanauer/policy-matters-ohios-amy-hanauer-says-four-every-1/

Providence Mayor Taveras says the city's teacher union contract is one of the longest in the U.S.
","Bigger isn't necessarily better. Quality is sometimes better than quantity.

Providence Mayor Angel Taveras alluded to that when the city's teachers' contract came up for discussion during the May 15 edition of WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers"" program, which was taped May 12.

Host Tim White was asking about problems in the School Department and the difficulty of getting rid of bad teachers, citing the case of one woman who was put on paid leave after being accused of drinking on the job and taking students home with her to do her housework.

""From your perspective,"" White asked, ""is the villain here an overly restrictive union contract that makes it hard to terminate teachers, or is it bad management that fails to cross the T’s and dot the I’s and get things done?""

""I think it's both,"" the mayor said. ""I think it's both in the sense that the contract is very restrictive. It's one of the longest in the country and needs to be changed. That's one thing. But the second thing about it is that we also need to follow through. And some of these things, in terms of following through, they're not easy. But they're necessary. …  And that's not just in terminations, but overall.""

We were intrigued by his statement that the teachers' contract is ""one of the longest in the country.""

We asked our usual question -- ""Is that true?"" -- but it also prompted us to ask, ""Who would keep track of something like that?""

So we contacted Taveras' office.

Taveras spokesman David Ortiz said the mayor misspoke. He meant to say that it's one of the longest in Rhode Island, not the nation.

Asked why the contract length matters, Ortiz said in a statement: ""The contract is complex and contains many constraints on management.""

""For example, the contract has language that now creates the shortest teacher work year in the state, the shortest school instructional day permitted under state regulations, zero mandatory professional development hours built into baseline salary, a requirement that teachers be paid at $25 per hour for professional development, and 20 sick days that are allowed to accrue if unused,"" said Ortiz. ""The mayor's position is that the constraints built into the current contract are a barrier to education reform.""

Ortiz sent us to the website of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, which has copies of contracts from 32 local school districts.

He opened them in a Microsoft Word file and did a word count -- not a precise gauge, but close enough. We did the same and came to the same conclusion he did. Providence's teachers' contract is the second-longest in the database, at 31,888 words, or about 90 pages(depending on the formatting). Only the Central Falls contract is longer, at 33,014 words, or roughly 97 pages.

To put that in context, the contracts in Warwick, Exeter-West Greenwich and West Warwick are in the 25,000- to 30,000-word range.

New Shoreham and Little Compton have the shortest agreements -- both under 9,000 words or under 30 pages or so.

But is it possible that Providence's is one of the longest nationwide?

We found a PDF file of the latest contract covering the Los Angeles school system. It runs 349 pages -- nearly four times longer than Providence's 90 or so pages. Boston's is more than 250 pages.

Robert Walsh, executive director of the National Education Association of Rhode Island, which does not represent Providence teachers, said the contracts in Worcester and Springfield are well over a hundred pages.

Having a long contract ""is an interesting but possibly meaningless distinction,"" said Walsh, because a contract may simply carry over a lot of provisions that are no longer relevant or may act like a personnel handbook. And a contract ""that is longer and clearer may be easier to maintain than one that is short and pithy.""

But Timothy Duffy, executive director of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, had a different view.

""The bigger the contract, the bigger the opportunity for a grievance to be filed,"" Duffy said. As both sides keep adding to an agreement, ""there are probably provisions that conflict with one another"" and there are probably more cases in which the school committee has given up some of its management rights to the union.

In any event, it seems clear that Providence's teachers' contract is far from one of the longest in the nation, and Taveras' office was quick to say that the mayor misspoke.

If he had said it was one of the longest in Rhode Island, we would give him a True. But his statement was far more sweeping than that, so we rule his statement False.

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Kurt Browning']","
Flexibility in early voting means possibly less hours to vote
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott's elections chief is defending changes to election law that shrink the number of days for early voting by arguing that polling places will be open the same number of hours they are now.

Yes, fewer days, Secretary of State Kurt Browning wrote in a May 23, 2011, guest column in the St. Petersburg Times. But longer hours on those days.

HB 1355, which Scott signed into law May 19, cuts the number of days of early voting from 14 to 8, makes it harder for third-party voter registration groups to register prospective voters and requires voters who change their address from one county to another on the day of an election to cast a provisional ballot, which would then be reviewed by the county canvassing board.

Browning and Republicans who supported the law say the changes will better protect the state's voting system against fraud. Democrats say the changes are an attempt to suppress voter turnout.

""To combat voter fraud, reduce the burden on poll workers and provide needed flexibility to local election supervisors, the number of days polls remain open has been reduced from 14 possible days to eight days, even as the total number of hours available for early voting will remain the same,"" Browning wrote in a column titled ""Florida's early voting remains at 96 hours.""

""The result is that working voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they haven't been able to do in the past,"" he wrote. ""That added flexibility will enable more people than ever to take advantage of early voting. And, if an election supervisor finds it's not absolutely necessary to keep all of his or her polling places open a full 12 hours a day, which isn't unusual for rural areas, he or she has the flexibility to save taxpayer money by not employing poll workers that aren't needed.

""Critics of the new election law suggest there will be less time to vote. That is just not the case. Now, more than ever, voters have more options to choose from in order to take advantage of early voting.""

In closing Browning wrote: ""Today, the following remains true: Early voting remains at 96 hours, with greater flexibility for counties ... "" We wanted to see if Browning is right.

Before HB 1355 became law, statutes required that early voting begin 15 days before and end two days prior to an election, or 14 days overall. Further, statutes required that supervisors provide eight hours of early voting during weekdays sometime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and a total of eight hours during each of two weekends. Over the 14 days prior to a Tuesday election -- two weekends and 10 weekdays -- that means that supervisors had been required to conduct early voting for a minimum of 96 hours.

The law that Scott signed changes several provisions of the early voting requirements.

The new version requires that early voting begin 10 days before and end three days prior to an election, or 8 days overall. The new statute says early voting must be available for six hours each of the eight days, and no more than 12 hours per day at each polling site.

We'll repeat that -- under the new law, early voting must be available six hours a day for eight days, or a total of 48 hours, and can be available for up to 12 hours a day for eight days, or 96 hours.

In other words, local supervisors of elections will have the ability to cut the number of hours of early voting in half. They will, however, have to increase the number of hours of early voting on weekends from 16 to 18 hours.

What will local supervisors choose to do?

For many, it's too early to say. In Pinellas County, Republican Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark said the longer early voting days would be more convenient for people who want to vote before or after work. But Clark also has been critical of early voting, saying in 2008 that early voting ""does not increase voter turnout,"" just ""election costs."" Clark spokeswoman Nancy Whitlock said the Pinellas supervisor is not against extending early voting hours as allowed by the new law, but has yet to adopt an early voting schedule for the 2012 elections.

But in Jacksonville and Duval County in northeast Florida, Republican supervisor Jerry Holland told voters not to expect 12-hour-a-day early voting, according to the Florida Times-Union. ""The 12 hours is just not practical for us,"" Holland said.

Another point about Browning's column. He wrote that a result of the new law is ""that working voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they haven't been able to do in the past."" But that already was happening, at least in Miami-Dade County. There, during the 2008 election, the supervisor staggered the eight-hour window of early voting between the first and second weeks. In the first week, early voting sites opened at 7 a.m. (the earliest they could open allowed by law). In the second week, early voting sites opened later so they wouldn't close until 7 p.m. (the latest they could stay open). Gov. Charlie Crist ultimately issued an executive order in 2008 requiring that all early voting sites stay open for 12 hours on weekdays.

Browning spokesman Chris Cate said Browning will work to ensure that nearly all medium and large counties in Florida use all 96 hours of early voting available to them.

""Every county that anticipates a high voter turnout during early voting, which applies to nearly every medium-to-large county in the state, will use all 96 hours of early voting made available. Voters can be confident of this fact,"" Cate e-mailed PolitiFact Florida. ""Secretary Browning can also confidently say this because he will work with the appropriate supervisors of elections to make sure of it.

""The only locations where early voting sites could possibly be open for less than 12 hours a day would be in rural counties, where voters don’t need all 12 hours a day to vote,"" Cate continued. ""It would be a waste of local taxpayer dollars to force supervisors of elections to keep early voting locations open where nobody is trying to vote."" 
In a follow-up e-mail, Cate was more blunt, saying that he doubts ""the writers of the new law considered that a supervisor of elections for a large county (like Duval) might have such a lack of foresight that they wouldn’t open their early voting sites for the full 12 hours."" Cate noted that supervisors are required to inform Browning's office of their plans 30 days ahead of time, giving Browning an opportunity to convince them to alter their schedule if necessary. 
The new law also allows Browning to provide ""written direction and opinions to the supervisors of elections on the performance of their official duties."" 
That flexibility in the law may save some smaller jurisdictions taxpayer dollars, but it's also the root of the problem when considering Browning's claim. While he noted in a May 23 op-ed piece that rural counties may schedule less than the current 96 hours of voting, he failed to note that the same option is available to every county in Florida regardless of size. In fact, local supervisors could cut the total number of hours of early voting from 96 to 48 if they chose because it's what the new law allows.

However, they have the ability to keep 96 hours of early voting by increasing voting to 12 hours a day. So a requirement of 96 hours of early voting has been replaced by an option of 96 hours.

We rate this claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C4BC0>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/kurt-browning/flexibility-early-voting-means-possibly-less-hours/

Unions don't have to comply with Obamacare, says Crossroads GPS
","
An ad from the Republican controlled campaign group Crossroads GPS asserts that unions are exempt from the new health care law as a political favor from President Barack Obama. 
The ad shows union leaders and Obama speaking in favor of health care reform, then shows a Fox News anchor asking, ""Is the Obama administration exempting some from complying with the new health care law as a political favor?"" 
Video shows Obama at a political rally, shouting, ""Because we fought together, we had worked together, they walked doors (door-to-door) for me, they made phone calls for me, they turned out the vote for me."" 
Text on the screen then says, ""Over 185 union waivers. All exempt from Obamacare mandate. If unions don’t have to comply with Obamacare, why should we?"" 
We spent a good bit of time looking into this claim, because it’s based on some very wonky details of the new health care law, things like annual benefit limits, phase-ins to 2014 and rules advertised in the Federal Register. We’re going to explain all those details momentarily, but we’ll start by giving you the bottom line: Unions do have to obey the mandates of the health care law like any other organization. And if there’s concrete evidence that they’re getting special treatment, we didn’t find it. 
For simplicity’s sake, we’re going to start at the very beginning, before the passage of the health care law. 
Insurance limits and the new law 
Prior to passage of the health care law, insurance companies could place limits on what they would be willing to pay for a person’s health care per year. A typical annual limit for someone with pretty good insurance might be $1 million, but it could be lower, sometimes much lower. 
If you were never sick, you might not be aware that the limit existed. But it would be a different story if you were sick, particularly if you suffered from something that was expensive to treat, like cancer. One in 10 cancer patients, for example, exhaust benefit limits and have to find more insurance or pay for treatment themselves, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
Low-wage workers were particularly vulnerable to plans with low annual limits. In some cases, annual payouts would be as low as $2,000. Those types of plans are often called ""mini-meds,"" and consumer advocates say they’re almost always a bad deal. 
The health care law phases out annual benefit limits so that people wouldn’t be caught without coverage, according to the HHS. The phase-out started this year, with new rules saying that all insurance plans must offer at least $750,000 in payouts per year. The number goes up every year so that by 2014 no caps at all will be allowed. 
Last year, though, companies started complaining, saying that if they had to meet the new requirements, they would either have to increase premiums paid by their employees or end coverage altogether. The Obama administration didn’t want that to happen, so they started granting waivers to the new rule. The waivers would be granted to health plans annually until 2014, according to the HHS, when people will be able to buy standard health insurance policies using new state-based ""exchanges."" That same year, low-wage workers will be eligible for tax credits to help them buy insurance. 
""It is essential that we make sure that Americans who have insurance today – even if that insurance is highly limited – can keep that coverage until reforms take effect that will increase their ability to choose among comprehensive, affordable insurance options in 2014,"" said Steven Larsen, who oversees the waiver process, in testimony before Congress in March. 
So far, employers like McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Cracker Barrel and O’Reilly Auto Parts have successfully applied for waivers for their health plans. Other approved applicants include Sunview Vineyards of California, Securitas Security Services USA, Mesa Air Group and Dish Network. (See all the approved applications here.) There are also several union health plans, which are the basis for the claims in the Crossroads ad. 
We contacted the HHS and asked for the number of waivers they’ve granted so far. A spokeswoman told us that they have approved 1,372 applications and denied 92. Of the approved applications, 27 represent unions and another 315 represent plans jointly managed by unions and employers. Even if you took the broadest definition possible, counting all the joint plans as union plans, only 25 percent of the waivers have gone to unions. The rest have gone to plans offered by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups. 
To be clear, though, the waivers do not exempt these groups from the health care law. They only allow them to continue offering their current health plans with annual limits until 2014. 
We should note that some Republicans are firm in their opposition to the waivers. Two congressional hearings have been held on why waivers are being offered and if the process is transparent. A law firm for Crossroads GPS has filed a federal lawsuit against HHS, claiming that the agency has not responded quickly enough to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for information about how the waivers are being awarded. The lawsuit says it's seeking ""the criteria to be applied by HHS in deciding whether to grant or deny applications for waiver of the annual limit requirements.""  
On its website, though, HHS said it approves waivers if ""a premium increase is large or if a significant number of enrollees would lose access to their current plan because the coverage would not be offered in the absence of a waiver."" 
Special treatment? 
Consumer advocates, we should note, have mixed feelings about the waivers. ""Our concern with the waiver process in general is that they’re targeted at the very type of health policy that health care reform was meant to get rid of -- extremely low-benefit policies that cost consumers more than they’re worth,"" said Carmen Balber, the Washington director of the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog. 
In fact, we wondered why unions would need waivers, because unions have a reputation for offering good health care benefits. The experts we spoke with said it could be one of two scenarios. In some cases, unions, like companies, may offer policies that come in just under the $750,000 limit. In other cases, union workers get limited benefits while their private counterparts get none. 
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) offered the example of janitors in Houston who are covered by a health plan with an exemption. ""It’s important to remember that the coverage we are talking about are low-cost plans that cover low-wage workers, some of whom have never had health care coverage in their lives,"" said the union in a statement, after we asked about the matter. 
But we can’t say for sure which plans might fit which category, because HHS hasn’t released every detail about the plans that are getting these waivers. The agency releases information about the company offering the plan, how many workers are covered, and the dates of application and approval. But it doesn’t list what the annual limits are or other details of the health plans. 
When we asked Crossroads GPS about the ad, a spokesman cited a lack of transparency in the approval process and claimed that a disproportionate number of waivers were going to unions, because only 11.9 percent of the country is unionized. The Obama administration ""is in the very least giving the appearance that waivers are going to those with political connections,"" said spokesman Jonathan Collegio. 
But Balber said she saw no evidence that unions were receiving special treatment. ""Pretty much anyone who applied, received them,"" she said. ""The claim that this was special treatment falls a little flat. As a consumer organization, we think the waivers were granted too broadly, but HHS was being consistent."" 
We also reviewed the most recent congressional testimony on how the waivers were granted. None of the witnesses provided evidence that there was special treatment. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the administrator of the waivers on the point, specifically asking about complaints from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. 
Cummings: ""Now some critics have suggested that the process by which annual limit waivers have been issued is biased and favors certain groups such as unions. For example, the February 10th, 2010, letter to the secretary, Chairman Issa made this statement, and I quote, ‘The current process gives credence to the perception that bureaucrats are picking winners and losers in a politicized environment where the winners are favored constituencies of the administration.’ Is that accurate?"" 
Larsen: ""That's not true. We do not favor any particular type of applicant, or any applicant from a particular sector, and we've applied the standards that we set out fairly across all the applicants."" 
Cummings: ""Is political support for the Obama administration or health care reform a factor your office uses in evaluating applications for annual limit waivers?"" 
Larsen: ""It is not."" 
Cummings: ""And you understand you're under oath?"" 
Larsen: ""I do, sir."" 
Our ruling 
In ruling on this statement, we understand that the Obama administration would hardly admit to it if it were giving unions special treatment. But looking at the numbers of waivers that have been given to both union and non-union groups, we don’t see any pattern that would support a case for special treatment. The number of waivers are a small sample of all health plans, and many more waivers were given to big companies and corporations. We looked for additional information or evidence on this point and didn’t find it. 
But there are additional problems with the ad. The ad doesn’t mention that the waivers only apply to annual coverage limits, that they’re intended to be in place only until 2014 and that many for-profit companies have received the same waivers. It gives the impression that unions are entirely exempt from the health care law, which they are not. 
Because the ad gives the impression that unions are exempt from the entire law, and because it’s evidence for special treatment is so thin, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F684C140>],/factchecks/2011/may/23/crossroads-gps/unions-dont-have-comply-obamacare-says-crossroads-/
