Have carbon emissions increased under Trump?
","During a House committee hearing on President Donald Trump’s budget proposal, U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky questioned the White House’s acting budget director on major cuts Trump’s plan would make to the Environmental Protection Agency. ""Does this budget propose cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency?"" Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat, asked Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. ""It proposes a cut to EPA by about 26% and we believe that we will still be able to fulfill the statutory responsibilities of clean air, clean water, clean —"" Vought said, before Schakowsky interjected with a claim that caught our attention: ""We’ve also seen in the time that he’s been president, an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way,"" she said. In 2018, PolitiFact rated Half True a claim from Trump’s EPA that greenhouse emissions were down under the president, finding that while emissions were continuing to fall, the rate of decline had slowed during Trump’s first year in office. The data at that time did not show emissions were rising. So we wanted to find out whether more recent figures support Schakowsky’s claim that emissions have increased under Trump, and whether the changes suggest a trend going ""in the wrong way."" Overall, emissions are indeed up from 2016 levels following a spike in 2018. After that, carbon emissions again began to decline. Experts interviewed say those incremental changes may have nothing to do with Trump policies. In response to our inquiry, a spokesman for Schakowsky’s office pointed to reports highlighting a 2018 spike in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions following three years of declines. A report published in May 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion rose 2.7% in 2018. It was the second-largest annual increase since 2000, the group reported, though somewhat smaller than an estimate it made earlier in the year based on preliminary data. The largest increase occurred in 2010 under then-President Barack Obama as the economy began its rebound from the recession, according to the group. In a draft report released this month, the EPA noted a similar uptick in 2018 CO2 emissions, which comprise the vast majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So Schakowsky is correct there was a spike in carbon emissions on Trump’s watch. In 2019, however, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions fell again, according to several recent international reports. And that drop was not a surprise. Indeed, the preliminary Rhodium report for 2018 noted that while the pace of U.S. emissions decline had slowed since 2016, the group did not ""expect a repeat"" increase the following year. To address that point, Schakowsky’s office sent us a Scientific American article speculating the decline identified in one of the international reports could be ""overly optimistic"" and a Washington Post story highlighting the Rhodium Group’s lukewarm preliminary findings for U.S. emissions in 2019. While a significant decline in coal consumption last year helped drive the overall drop, Rhodium noted, the United States made little progress in other areas. By their accounting, net greenhouse gas emissions remained slightly higher in 2019 than at the end of 2016. ""There are low-cost technology solutions to reduce oil and gas methane emissions,"" the Rhodium report said. ""But their deployment at scale requires strengthening regulations that the Trump Administration instead has been weakening."" It’s also worth noting Rhodium did not attribute any of the emissions changes seen so far to the Trump administration, which has made eliminating federal environmental regulations a priority. Instead, both Rhodium and the federal government pegged the 2018 increase to fluctuations in weather, which drove up heating and cooling needs, and to increased economic growth. ""Overall there has indeed been an increase (or at best little or no change) in carbon emissions since Trump has been president,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a climatologist at Texas A&M University, in an email response. ""Whether Trump’s policies have had any significant positive or negative effect on U.S. carbon emissions is a separate question."" Schakowsky said that in the time Trump has been president, the nation has seen ""an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way."" Reports show U.S. carbon dioxide emissions did spike on Trump’s watch in 2018. They fell again last year, but greenhouse gas emissions overall remain higher than they were before he took office.

Facebook post invents false Warren quote on immigration and Tibbetts murder
","The 2018 murder of Mollie Tibbetts, a University of Iowa student, and the subsequent arrest of an undocumented immigrant became a flashpoint in the immigration debate. Strong feelings over the tragedy have targeted Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. One Facebook post highly and misleadingly edited Warren’s comments about the Tibbetts murder. The post includes two pictures of Tibbetts and has this text: ""So Elizabeth Warren was asked about Mollie Tibbetts being murdered by an illegal immigrant….. Her reply was: ‘I know this is hard for her family, but they have to remember that we need to focus on real problems like illegal immigrants not being able to see their kids’ Let that sink in."" Anyone reading that could easily see Warren as dismissive of a murder. But that post chopped up her actual response and changed her meaning. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In a Aug. 22, 2018, interview, CNN anchor John Berman asked Warren this question: ""Mike Pence and the president have suggested the immigration laws need to be stronger so that people like this man who was accused of this murder were not in the country. Your reaction?"" Here’s what Warren actually said. (The bolded words are the ones used in the Facebook post.) ""I'm so sorry for the family and I know this is hard, not only for the family, but for the people in her community, the people throughout Iowa. ""But one of the things we have to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective, that focuses on where real problems are. ""Last month, I went down to the border and I saw where children had been taken away from their mothers, I met with those mothers who had been lied to, who didn't know where their children were, who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children, and there was no plan for how they would be reunified with their children. ""I think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat and I don't think mamas and babies are the place we should be spending our resources. Separating a mama from a baby does not make this country safer."" Out of the 157 words Warren said, the post used 16 (17 if you count its shift of ""focuses"" to ""focus""). It added words she didn’t say, such as ""illegal immigrants not being able to see their kids."" It added small words, such as ""they"" to have her purported quote make grammatical sense and match the meaning the people behind the post wanted to create. The Facebook version omits Warren’s words about focusing ""on people who pose a real threat."" Warren contrasted enforcement that targets those who have or might commit violence, and enforcement that separates small children from their parents — the ""zero tolerance"" policy under the Trump administration in 2018.

Medical masks should be worn with the colored side out
","Don’t take your medical advice from Facebook. It could leave you with the wrong instructions for wearing a medical mask. A Facebook post claimed that a doctor’s office had received the ""proper directions"" from a mask manufacturer on how to wear medical masks. The post includes two pictures of how to wear the medical masks and explains that you should wear the colored side of the mask on the outside when you are sick and the white side on the outside when you are healthy.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The Center for Health Protection, which was established in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak in 2004, also advises wearers to wear the colored side on the outside.  While the Facebook post said that the white side of the mask contains a filter, the center’s illustration of the three-layer design medical mask explains that the white layer is for moisture absorption from your mouth and nose. The San Francisco Department of Public Health’s website also said that ""the colored side of the mask is usually the front and should face away from you, while the white side touches your face.""  So remember: color-side out, whether you are healthy or sick. One more thing: Americans looking to buy a medical mask to protect themselves against the 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, should know it isn’t generally necessary.  The New York Times interviewed medical care professionals that explained that hoarding medical masks because of the 2019 novel coronavirus panic can lead to shortages in hospitals, clinics, and doctor’s offices.

Giant Mekong catfish are not in the Mississippi River
","An Illinois man’s quest to salvage his grandfather’s reputation led him to catch a 736-pound catfish. That’s according to a four-year-old story that has gotten a lot of recent traffic on Facebook, despite its astonishing claim that this massive fish has been swimming in Mississippi waters for at least 114 years. ""Alton resident catches 736-pound catfish in Mississippi River,"" reads the headline on the story from Riverbender.com, which appears to share news and headlines from Alton, Ill.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the story, 114 years passed between the time in 1902 when a man named ""Red Mudger...discovered the biggest catfish ever known to man"" and the day in 2016 when his grandson, Kato ""Mudcat"" Mudger, felt a tug at his fishing line that turned out to be a 170-year-old Mekong giant catfish — the same one his grandfather had seen in 1902. A couple things stand out about this claim: First, the article was published April 1, 2016, making it likely April Fools’ Day fodder. Second, a picture accompanying the story has been doctored. It shows the supposed 736-pound catfish lying on the ground. Next to it, a fisherman’s torso and legs can be seen, giving the viewer a sense of scale for the giant catfish. But the original fish photo was published in a Smithsonian article from Sept. 25, 2015, and credited to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Smithsonian photo shows no sign of a human standing next to the fish and the caption under the picture identifies the fish as a flathead catfish, not a giant Mekong catfish, as the Riverbender story suggests. Flathead catfish are native to the Mississippi River, but they don’t grow heavier than 123 pounds or longer than 5 feet according to FishBase. Mekong catfish can grow to be 650 pounds, which is closer to 736 pounds, but they have never been seen outside of Southeast Asia’s Mekong River. They are endemic to the area and are also categorized as critically endangered.  At PolitiFact, we’ve seen before that people get excited about seemingly giant fish, but we have to categorize this story as a tall (and heavy) tale.

""If the decision is made to not participate in a field trip, alternative educational opportunities are provided."" Students who choose to attend, Loitz said, ""are expected to respect the dress code of the host facility."" The school said ""all students must wear appropriate long pants. Ankles must be covered. Girls must bring wide scarves or hooded sweatshirts for the mosque.""   The blog post correctly reported that but its headline gives a different impression, leading readers to believe that a Colorado school district was requiring all female students to wear a Muslim veil. (As this New York Times story explains, ""hijab"" is not described as an article of clothing in the Koran, but as something like a curtain or ""separation"" that provides privacy.)

"['Agriculture', 'Welfare', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'John Nygren']","
Nygren overreaches on claim Tony Evers tried to raise agriculture taxes
","Wisconsin’s struggling farms were front and center in Gov. Tony Evers’ State of the State address. He celebrated the state’s identity as America’s Dairyland. He bemoaned the loss of family farms in recent years. And he called for a special session of the Legislature to consider a package of agricultural bills. All of which one Republican leader claimed was disingenuous. ""Governor Evers’ sudden concern for rural Wisconsin and our agriculture industry is ironic given that just a year ago he proposed raising taxes on the agriculture industry to pay for expanded welfare programs,"" state Rep. John Nygren, chairman of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, said Jan. 22, 2020 on Twitter and in a later news release. ""No amount of rhetoric can cover his failed record of putting rural Wisconsin and our farmer(s) behind liberal special interests."" The budget claims from the Marinette Republican caught our eye.  Did Evers really try to raise taxes on agriculture to fund welfare? Defending Nygren’s claim, his chief of staff Nathan Schwanz pointed to proposed changes to the Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit. Evers’ budget explicitly changed only half of that credit. He proposed limiting the credit for manufacturing to $300,000 per tax year. But the budget added, ""The Governor also recommends leaving the agricultural portion of the credit unchanged compared to current law."" The changes would have reduced the tax credit — i.e. raised taxes — by a total of $289 million in 2020 and $237 million in 2021. Schwanz said the proposed cut still would have been a blow to agriculture, however, pointing to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo from February 2019. The nonpartisan agency, responding to a request from Nygren, found about 25% of the manufacturing and agriculture tax credits in 2018-19 went to manufacturers ""where agricultural products are the primary input."" Those were manufacturers of food, beverages, tobacco and basic chemicals. So Evers didn’t propose any direct tax increases to agriculture, but his proposed changes for manufacturers would have reduced their income.  Nygren’s argument is that would have then affected agricultural producers by limiting the amount of product manufacturers took in.  Nygren also connected these cuts to welfare. Evers’ proposed budget increased spending for welfare programs, so Schwanz said the proposed cuts to the manufacturing and agriculture credit were among the changes needed to offset that. He summed up the logic this way: ""There is no doubt that the Governor’s budget increased General Fund taxes. There is no doubt that his budget expanded welfare and that these tax increases were needed to pay for it."" So there’s no direct link between the manufacturing tax credit and welfare. That is, Evers didn’t propose earmarking the credit savings for a welfare program. But broadly speaking, a cut in one area does affect the ability to increase spending in another. The manufacturing tax credit is paid from the General Fund, which is used for all manner of welfare programs. It’s an approach to budgeting that is used by fiscal bureau analysts and others, including Evers. For example, in his 2017 annual education address, Evers, then the schools superintendent, said, ""Every dollar we shift from the state coffers to pay for roads, and increasingly, to simply pay for debt, is a dollar we move out of the classroom of a child,"" the Wisconsin State Journal reported in a Sept. 22, 2017 article. Nygren said the governor proposed raising taxes on the agricultural industry to expand welfare programs. It’s not unreasonable to connect tax changes to welfare programs, since both tie into the General Fund and were part of the same proposed budget. Of course, that budget contained a multitude of other changes as well. But Nygren is off base saying Evers proposed raising taxes on agriculture. Evers explicitly left the agriculture side of a tax credit alone, though some agriculture operations could have been indirectly affected since their products are used by manufacturers. That leaves us with a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate Nygren’s claim Mostly False.","[('John Nygren news release, Gov.

"['Health Check', 'Joe Biden']","
Does 'Medicare For All' Cost More Than The Entire Budget? Biden Says So. But Numbers Say No.
","During the Feb. 7 Democratic presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden once again questioned the price tag of ""Medicare for All,"" the single-payer health care proposal championed by one of his key rivals, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden argued that the plan was fiscally irresponsible and would require raising middle-class taxes. Specifically, he claimed, the plan ""would cost more than the entire federal budget that we spend now."" Medicare for All’s price — and whether it’s worth it ― is a subject of fierce discussion among Democratic presidential candidates. But we had never heard this figure before. It caught our attention, so we decided to dig in. Biden’s campaign directed us to the 2018 federal budget, which totaled $4.1 trillion. It compared that amount to the estimated cost of Sanders’ single-payer proposal: between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade. The math, they said, shows Medicare for All would cost more than the national budget. But it turns out, based on the numbers and interviews with independent experts, Biden’s comparison of Medicare for All’s price to total federal spending misses the mark because the calculation is flawed. The numbers Sanders has said publicly that economists estimate Medicare for All would cost somewhere between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over 10 years. Research by the nonpartisan Urban Institute, a Washington D.C. think tank, puts the figure in the $32 trillion to $34 trillion range. We pointed out to Biden’s campaign that comparing 10-year spending estimates to one-year budgets is like comparing apples to oranges. The campaign suggested that if you take 10 times the current federal budget, you get a figure smaller than the estimated cost of Medicare for All over that 10-year window. That calculation would lead you to multiply $4.1 trillion by 10 to get $41.1 trillion. That result is close to the high mark Sanders set for his program’s cost but well above the $34 trillion that Urban researchers projected. Still, that’s not the correct way to formulate a comparison, experts say. ""That’s not good math,"" said Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""That’s taking a 2018 number, and multiplying it by 10, whereas the $34 trillion is a 10-year number that assumes a lot of growth."" What you would need to do is add up the Congressional Budget Office’s projected budget outlays from 2020 to 2029, and compare the sum to the Medicare for All spending figure. So we spoke to Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at Urban’s Health Policy Center, who arrived at the $34 trillion estimate. She ran the CBO’s numbers: The next 10 years of on-budget outlay, the government office projects, add up to $44.8 trillion. To be clear, $34 trillion (34 followed by 12 zeros) is no small sum. It accounts for about 75% of that nearly $45 trillion budget estimate and would represent a bigger single increase to the federal budget than we’ve ever experienced, Blumberg said. That raises one point on which Biden may have some ground. Goldwein argued that you would indeed need significant tax increases to finance the Sanders proposal. But its price tag still would be less than the projected budget. ""If he said [Medicare for All] was as big as the current federal budget, that would be incorrect,"" Blumberg said. Goldwein looked at the numbers another way: Including interest, he found, the federal budget would consume about $55 trillion between now and 2030. Again, that’s more than what Medicare for All would cost during the same period. Big picture: No matter how you slice Biden’s math, his numbers are off. ""If what he said was Medicare for All will cost as much as the entire rest of the budget, that would be fair,"" Goldwein said. But that’s not the same thing. Our ruling Biden argued that Medicare for All ""would cost more than the entire federal budget that we spend now."" This relies on faulty math. Medicare for All would certainly represent a substantial increase to the federal budget. But it would neither match nor dwarf current federal spending overall. We rate this claim False.","[('ABC News / WMUR Democratic debate, Feb. 7, 2019.', 'https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData'), ('Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, ""National Health Expenditure Data,"" Dec. 17, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Congressional Budget Office, ""The Budget and Economic Outlook,"" January 2020.', 'https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-01/56020-CBO-Outlook.pdf'), ('Telephone interview with Linda Blumberg, Urban Institute, Feb. 7, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Marc Goldwein, Center for Responsible Federal Budget, Feb. 11, 2020.', 'https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/dont-confuse-changes-federal-health-spending-national-health-spending'), ('Urban Institute, ""Don’t Confuse Changes in Federal Health Spending with National Health Spending,"" Oct. 16, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Urban Institute, ""From Incremental to Comprehensive Health Reform: How Various Reform Options Compare on Coverage and Costs,"" Oct. 16, 2019.', 'https://www.urban.org/research/publication/incremental-comprehensive-health-reform-how-various-reform-options-compare-coverage-and-costs')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/13/joe-biden/does-medicare-all-cost-more-entire-budget-biden-sa/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Congress', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Texas', 'Veronica Escobar']","
What is an acceptable measure of bipartisanship?
","In the Democrats’ Spanish-language response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso said the president and his allies are ""the biggest threat to our safety and security"" because they are ""unwilling to take action for our country, acting solely in their own interest."" She went on to highlight the actions of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, is openly stonewalling legislation that would help improve the lives of veterans, women, and families – all of us,"" Escobar said, according to an English language translation of her remarks provided by her office. ""House Democrats have passed more than 275 bipartisan bills this Congress, but these bills are gathering dust on his desk.""  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who delivered the Democratic Party’s response in English after the State of the Union, cited similar figures when discussing McConnell’s actions: ""Those three bills, and more than 275 other bipartisan bills, are just gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s desk."" The New York Times called Whitmer’s claim ""exaggerated,"" based on an analysis from Factcheck.org of a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi making the same claim. Escobar’s office shared a list of 291 ""bipartisan"" bills that were approved by the House since the beginning of 2019 but are awaiting action in the Senate, as of Jan. 24. Let’s dive in. No universal definition of ‘bipartisan’ Elizabeth Lopez-Sandoval, spokeswoman for Escobar, said Escobar considered bills as being bipartisan if there was ""at least one Republican vote on the House floor,"" or if the bill was passed by a voice vote and ""has at least one Republican cosponsor."" ""Bills that passed on voice vote but do not have at least one Republican cosponsor were excluded,"" she said. While there is no singular definition of what constitutes a bipartisan bill, the four political experts we consulted for this piece generally agreed that Escobar used a low bar by which to judge cooperation between political parties. Kirby Goidel, director of the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A&M University, said the term ""bipartisan"" has taken on a looser definition in regular usage because it is ""advantageous in terms of public support."" ""It is not unusual to call a bill bipartisan when it only received a single vote from across the aisle, though that runs against our more general understanding of what the term is intended to mean,"" he said in an email. ""It is also easy to imagine individual representatives more willing to compromise because they are Republican representing a Democratic district (or vice versa), so adding one member of the opposition in that context wouldn't strike anyone as ‘bipartisan’."" As an example, he added: ""(U.S. Sen. Mitt) Romney's vote didn't make the vote for impeachment bipartisan."" Goidel said a better definition for bipartisan would be legislation that has ""majority support from both parties."" ""Though ideally we wouldn't include resolutions or other items that generate little or no opposition, because the term also implies that the parties worked together to compromise on an important and potentially controversial issue,"" he said. For the purposes of this fact-check, we’ll rely on counting the votes, since it is tricky to gauge how much collaboration went into each proposal behind the scenes. Jordan Tama, associate professor at American University who is writing a book about bipartisanship, said it is ""less common"" to see a truly bipartisan process in today’s Congress, since members tend to develop legislation within their own party and only look to attract support from the other party after the fact. ""It is more common to see bipartisanship reflected in voting outcomes, even though in many of these cases the legislation wasn’t developed in a very bipartisan method,"" Tama said. ""You can still call something bipartisan if the votes show support from both parties, even if it wasn’t developed through a highly collaborative process."" Members of both parties tend to make claims about bipartisanship based on support from one member of the other party, according to Laura Blessing, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. ""Everybody does this,"" she said. ""This is strategic messaging to a larger audience about the nature of legislation and values of main sponsors in reaching across the aisle, but that doesn’t mean it is a meaningless standard. ""There is a spectrum about how we think of measures of bipartisanship, and if these people want to use this, well, people have done this before and they’ll do it again. It is a reasonable standard, but there are higher ones out there."" Adding up the numbers When a bill comes before the full House, there are two primary ways the legislative body votes: a roll call vote or a voice vote. In a roll call vote, the names of each legislator are read aloud and their vote is recorded alongside their name. When the body passes a measure in a voice vote, members call out ""aye"" or ""nay"" on the question of passage and the presiding officer decides which side prevailed. If there is a dispute over the decision, members stand to get an exact tally of the vote. Of the 291 bills Escobar’s team marked as bipartisan, 116 passed in a roll call vote and 175 passed by a voice vote. Before we get into the votes, here’s a reminder about the party breakdown in the House. There are 232 Democrats, 197 Republicans and one independent. Five seats are vacant. Let’s start with the 116 roll call votes: 71 passed with the support of a majority of Republican members of the House, ranging from 100 votes to 196 votes. Seven bills passed with anywhere from 55 to 93 GOP votes, and 38 passed with fewer than 50 Republican votes — 23 of which passed with fewer than 10 Republican votes. Escobar’s team flagged 175 bills that passed via a voice vote and have at least one Republican co-sponsor. Of those, 63 have Republican sponsors, meaning a Republican introduced the bill, and at least one Democrat as a co-sponsor. Looking at the 112 bills with a Democrat as the sponsor, five have more than 50 Republican co-sponsors and the rest have 32 or fewer Republican co-sponsors. Of those, 95 have fewer than 10 Republican co-sponsors. Tama said he didn’t think it was worth it to split hairs over sponsorships on bills that passed by a voice vote, since that generally indicates that there is support for the bill from both parties. ""You can really only use (a voice vote) when the vast majority of members are going to vote for it,"" he said. ""If you imagine a vote where two parties are polarized, you’d have almost as many voting yes and no — you wouldn’t be able to judge the outcome. I think it is safe to say that all of the voice votes involved bipartisan support, even if we can’t know for sure what the result is."" Overall, the experts we consulted agreed that, given the various definitions of bipartisan, Escobar’s claim was largely accurate but could use more clarifying details. Sean Theriault, a government professor at the University of Texas, said her use of the term bipartisan is fair. ""It’s certainly not telling the whole truth, but a single vote from the other side does indicate that it enjoys support from both parties,"" he said in an email. ""So, of course, we would prefer Escobar to say, ‘275 bills that have received at least support from one Republican are sitting on McConnell’s desk,’ but calling them ‘bipartisan’ is not wrong."" Our ruling Escobar said: ""House Democrats have passed more than 275 bipartisan bills this Congress."" Escobar counted bills as bipartisan if they had at least one Republican vote in favor or at least one Republican co-sponsor. Political experts said that her measurement is not inaccurate, but it doesn’t conform to a general understanding of the term.  Using the higher bar for measuring bipartisan legislation offered by these experts — support from a majority of members of both parties — plus counting legislation that passed on a voice vote, the total comes to 251 bills, which is close to Escobar’s claim. Overall, her statement needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True. Correction: This article has been revised to correct the spelling of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's name.","[('Emailed press release, Democratic Response to President Trump’s State of the Union Delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, Feb. 4, 2020', 'https://www.factcheck.org/2019/12/pelosis-bipartisanship-boast/'), ('Factcheck.org, Pelosi’s Bipartisanship Boast, Dec. 17, 2019', 'No link'), ('C-SPAN, Democratic Spanish Language Response to State of the Union, Feb. 4, 2020', 'https://www.c-span.org/video/?468979-1/democratic-spanish-language-response-state-union'), ('Email interview with Elizabeth Lopez-Sandoval, Feb. 6, 2020', 'No link'), (""El Paso Times, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar's State of the Union rebuttal to be delivered from El Paso, Feb. 3, 2020"", 'https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/03/state-of-the-union-2020-veronica-escobar-spanish-rebuttal-donald-trump-el-paso/4624942002/'), ('New York Times, Fact-Checking Trump’s 2020 State of the Union Address and the Democratic Response, Feb. 5, 2020', 'No link'), ('U.S. House of Representatives, House Practice, 2017', 'https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/fact-check-state-of-the-union-02-04'), ('Email interview, Kirby Goidel, director of the Public Policy Research Institution at Texas A&M University, Feb. 11, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Sean Theriault, government professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Feb. 11, 2020', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPRACTICE-115/pdf/GPO-HPRACTICE-115.pdf'), ('Phone interview with Jordan Tama, associate professor of international service at American University, Feb. 11, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/12/veronica-escobar/what-acceptable-measure-bipartisanship/
"['Education', 'North Carolina', 'Roy Cooper']","
A judge 'ordered' North Carolina to spend more on education, governor says
","North Carolina remains one of the only states in the nation that hasn’t enacted a new budget for this year. That’s partly because Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and the Republican-controlled legislature can’t agree on a plan for public education spending. Amid the stalemate, Cooper just got a new talking point. On Jan. 21, he tweeted: ""The Court has ordered North Carolina to step up significantly its funding for education,"" the tweet says, adding: ""It should begin now with this budget."" Cooper’s tweet provided a link to a story by The News & Observer newspaper in Raleigh. The education budget is usually set by state lawmakers (the House of Representatives and Senate pass a plan, then the governor approves it.) So it might seem odd to the average person that a judge ""ordered"" North Carolina to spend more on education. Is that really what happened? Generally speaking, yes. But don’t expect your kid’s public school to receive a shipment of new resources anytime soon. Cooper’s tweet references the latest development in what’s known as the ""Leandro case."" Here’s a brief history, courtesy of the N&O story: Fast forward to 2020. The case is now overseen by Superior Court Judge David Lee, and he says the state still isn’t providing public school students with a proper education. One thing that may be confusing: Lee’s latest filing is referred to as an order. That is legally what his document is called. And, while Judge Lee did issue a directive to lawmakers, his orders weren’t specific. ""The judge did not enter an order that specifically said ‘the state of North Carolina must appropriate X number of dollars,’"" said Jane Wettach, a law professor at Duke University and director of the school’s Children’s Law Clinic. ""What (the order) did do was say, it’s obligated to do a number of things, essentially to improve to the point of being adequate the education system in North Carolina."" We looked at the order. And, indeed, it states this on Page 4: ""As outlined in greater detail below and in accordance with the Court’s prior rulings, the Court orders the Defendants, in consultation with each other and the Plaintiffs, to work expeditiously and without delay to create and fully implement a definite plan of action to achieve Leandro compliance."" Then on Page 5, Lee says a more specific plan will come later: ""This Court will issue a subsequent order or orders regarding the definite plan of action and its critical components, including the identifications of specific, concrete, definitive actions (preliminarily short-term actions and mid-term and long-term action plans) that will be taken to implement the above seven components and to correct the constitutional deficiencies, so that the State may finally meet its constitutional obligations to North Carolina’s children."" Judge Lee based his order on a report by WestEd, an independent firm brought in to examine North Carolina’s education policies.  The report not only analyzed the state’s spending, but ""further proposes detailed recommendations for increased funding efforts by the State in order for North Carolina's system of public schools to become Leandro compliant,"" said Lindsay Wagner, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan advocacy group: Public School Forum of North Carolina.  In response, the judge’s order tells defendants to craft a plan of action. But ""the order does not explicitly require additional funds, rather it requires that additional resources, ‘if any,’ to meet the requirements identified,"" Ann McColl, an education attorney. The order said a plan of action must include seven components: The judge then notes that it's the ""state’s duty"" — rather than the judiciary’s duty — to implement the necessary programs. The order directs the parties involved with the case to provide Lee with a status report ""no later than 60 days"" of the order, which was signed Jan. 21. McColl noted that the GOP-controlled General Assembly isn’t named as a party to the case. But it could participate in implementing the plan. ""Because the order is to respond with plans for the immediate future (2020) and mid-range and comprehensive plans, there is not a specific order requiring specific action by the General Assembly at this time,"" McColl said. ""At a time when specific steps are submitted to the court and the court approves them, there may be specific actions required of the General Assembly,"" McColl added. ""If the GA does not comply with these orders, the court has some tools – although limited and difficult with a legislative body, to enforce orders."" Cooper tweeted that ""the Court has ordered North Carolina to step up significantly its funding for education."" Judge Lee didn’t give specific instructions for how much lawmakers need to spend on public education. But he did order North Carolina to spend more on its education system.

"['Oregon', 'City Budget', 'City Government', 'Sam Adams']","
Did Sam Adams cut $36 million from the budget?
","
PolitiFact Oregon has been around government budgets long enough to know that they’re hard to decipher. There are add-on packages and inflationary costs, general fund dollars and one-time dollars and all-funds budgets. Numbers by themselves don’t mean much without context.

So, naturally, our ears perked right up when Portland Mayor Sam Adams made this statement in a budget work session shortly after the Nov. 6 election: ""In the last four years we’ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue."" He also tweeted the number Nov. 13and used it again in a year end-interview with the Portland Mercury.  

Sounds gloomy, right? But remember, this is the same mayor who once hooted about a one-time $22 million budget surplus in February 2011, and we found that claim to be Half True. So we wanted to know more about these dollar ""cuts."" We decided to give his statement the full Truth-O-Meter treatment.

We were aided by one of The Oregonian’s Portland City Hall reporters, who immediately pointed out that the $36 million was really closer to $25.6 million because the city had added $10.3 million for new programs over the same period.

In other words, Adams had to ""cut"" as much as he did because he chose to spend money elsewhere. Apparently this was not news to anyone at the budget meeting because Andrew Scott, the city’s financial planning manager, clicked through a PowerPoint presentation with a slide that outlined $25.6 million in ""ongoing shortfall"" and $10.3 million in new program additions.

Now, we bet you’re asking for the definition of an ""ongoing shortfall."" Government budgets don’t stay flat, obviously. The cost of maintaining the same programs goes up every year, sometimes beyond the cost of inflation, whether due to increases in demand for services or steep hikes in health and retirement benefits.

When projected revenue falls short of dollars needed to maintain services, that’s the shortfall. State and local governments can’t print money like the federal government, so they have to fix the shortfall by raising revenue (usually taxes) or cutting services, pay, etc.

Elected officials may always choose to add new programs. But if they don’t have enough money, they have to reduce or eliminate other programs. We call that making choices; we could even call that ""budgeting."" We’ve called out politicians previously for talking about ""budget cuts"" when government has had more money than the year before, just not enough to cover a shortfall and pay for new programs.  

We also bet you’re asking for some hard numbers.

The city’s total annual budget is in the $3.5 billion range, but Adams is talking about the much smaller amount known as the general fund. The general fund includes property taxes and business license fees, but does not include gas taxes, sewer and stormwater charges or water fees.

The numbers vary, depending on how you slice them, from $349.5 million to $472 million in 2009-10, to 352.5 million to $490 million for 2012-13.. But no matter how you look at the numbers, if you compare apples to apples, the figures today are higher, even slightly, than what they were in 2009-10, with ups and downs along the way. In other words, today’s budget is not $36 million less than the 2009-10 budget, which is what the average person probably thinks when the mayor says that he has ""cut $36 million in ongoing revenue.""

Scott, the city’s financial planning manager, disapproves of our simplistic way of looking at numbers. He says that you can’t compare dollars to dollars because that doesn’t account for steep growth in government costs, such as participation in the Public Employees Retirement System or health insurance. The cost of running government doesn’t stay the same from year to year.

He’s right about that, but taxpayers and non-wonks don’t live in a world where buying everything you did the previous year, even if it costs more, is considered spending the same in dollars.

Had Adams just said the city had cut services, he’d be on more solid ground. Of course, he’d also have to mention that the city had added services. But that’s not what the mayor said either.

His statement contains some connection to reality: The city has not been able to spend $36 million that it needed to maintain current services over the four years.

Rick Scott says Florida's economy soured under Charlie Crist
","
Former Gov. Charlie Crist has the Florida political world buzzing about a potential face-off with Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014.

Scott’s response to the hypothetical showdown with the Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat has been simple: Avoid direct comment but point out how Florida hemorrhaged jobs under Crist’s watch.

""The four years before I became governor, the state had lost 825,000 jobs. Unemployment had gone from 3.5 percent to 11.1 percent. We incurred another $5.2 billion, I think, worth of debt,"" Scott said at a Dec. 11, 2012, news conference.

We thought his talking points about Florida’s economy under Crist merited a fact-check. It probably won’t be the last time Scott takes a dig at his predecessor.

In this item, we'll examine Scott’s claims about the unemployed under Crist. We will examine the debt claim in a separate item.

PolitiFact has addressed similar jobs claims about governors in many states. We often find the numbers are right but the blame is exaggerated. The impact of a governor on a state’s economic health is usually pretty small, experts say.

Jobless ranks swelled

Scott’s math on the number of jobs Florida lost during Crist’s tenure is correct if you compare the month before his inauguration (December 2006) with his last month in office (December 2010).

Florida’s workforce contracted from 8,043,000 non-farm workers to 7,217,500 -- a loss of 825,500 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.

The state lost half of its construction jobs during that period, shrinking from 668,600 to 336,400.

Scott has touted the state’s declining unemployment rate under his tenure as a sign of economic improvement. (But a rapidly declining rate is not always worth bragging about, as we noted in this fact-check, because it has been the sign of a shrinking workforce as a result of discouraged workers giving up on finding jobs in the state.)

There’s no denying Florida’s employment situation went from robust to bleak under Crist. In December 2006, the state’s unemployment rate was 3.5 percent. (Remember those days?!) In December 2010, the rate was 11.1 percent.

The state's unemployment rate has inched down in the months since Scott took office. The most recent rate was 8.5 percent in October 2012.

Whose fault is it?

Mark Vitner, Wells Fargo senior economist, said assessing who is responsible when thing go bad -- or when they improve -- is a difficult task. The more pertinent question, he said, is ""What policy action did you try to take to try to mitigate the economic recession or engender an economic recovery?""

""Whether it was luck or whatever, during his tenure Florida’s economy sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" he said. 
We asked Scott's press office for examples of how Crist played a role in Florida's economic downturn. Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in an email, ""Florida's economic improvement and job creation under Gov. Scott is undeniable.""  
Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics who studies Florida, said Crist is not responsible for the state’s economic decline because ""the seeds of destruction"" had already been sown by the time he took office.

Home sales and prices had already peaked in 2005 and 2006. Behind the scenes lurked a number of major issues: mortgage lending to borrowers who couldn’t afford to repay their loans and Wall Street bankers buying those loans and selling them to investors.

""I don’t remember hearing about states in 2004 taking a stand against home building,"" said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida. ""It was bringing in revenue. There was a lot of benefits that the boom side of the housing market created. There were significant costs when we went into bust.""

Added Lafakis: ""That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist.""

The onset of the housing crisis, coupled with the state’s dependence on a constant flow of new residents, meant Florida suffered more than other states, he said.

The wealth of out-of-state retirees ""was eviscerated"" during the recession, he said, making them less able to retire in Florida. And working-age people faced either reduced job opportunities in major metro areas like Tampa and Orlando or could not sell their homes and relocate here, Lafakis said.

""Would it have been different with someone else in office?"" Lafakis said. ""The wheels were already in motion. He (Crist) suffered from the worst timing that you could pick.""

And unlike the federal government, the state government cannot run deficits in an effort to stimulate the economy because of balanced budget requirements. States basically ""have to ride it out,"" Snaith said.

Our ruling

Scott is right about the grim jobless figures: The state’s employment picture worsened almost as soon as Crist became governor and did not let up.

But Scott misses the mark for implying the state’s recession was the result of a poor handling by Crist. Florida’s economy tanked largely as a result of the housing market crisis, a tornado of issues over which Crist had little to no control.

We rate Scott’s statement Half True.

Sherry Sylvester says personal-injury trial lawyers have accounted for over 80 percent of Texas Democratic Party's contributions for over a decade
","
It’s a Texas axiom that trial lawyers fuel Democratic politics.

Still, we were struck by a claim by the spokeswoman for Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which advocates litigation limits.

In a Dec. 2, 2012, opinion column in the San Antonio Express-News, Sherry Sylvester said Democrats will not regain ground in statewide elections until the party changes its financial backers and rejects policies routinely pushed in support of personal-injury trial lawyers, whom she called ""the primary funders of Texas Democrats.""

The ""personal-injury"" descriptive applies to cases in which a plaintiff says injuries occurred due to the actions or negligence of another person or entity. The American Bar Association says most personal-injury cases arise from automobile accidents, though the label also extends to medical malpractice and other events.

Sylvester further wrote: ""Personal-injury trial lawyers not only have provided over 80 percent of the funding for the Texas Democratic Party for over a decade, trial lawyers provided virtually all the funding for the Bexar County Democratic Party in this election.""

We focused on the first part of that statement — that more than 80 percent of the state Democratic Party’s funding has come from personal-injury trial lawyers for over a decade, presuming this was not a claim about donations to individual candidates. 
Indeed, Sylvester said by phone, she based her analysis on the Texas Democratic Party’s contribution and expenditure reports for 2006 through 2010.

She said, too, that she should not have said the percentage held ""for over a decade"" without checking the party’s finance reports for 2002 through 2004, which she did before following up with us by email. From 2002 through 2010, Sylvester said, the state party fielded nearly $15.7 million in contributions, not counting contributions from federal Democratic committees such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee clearly made in connection with federal races, which Sylvester said is not her focus.

Sylvester said $11.75 million, or 75.4 percent of the adjusted total, came from personal-injury trial lawyers or groups steered by them, such as the Texas Democratic Trust, which was a political committee guided by the late Fred Baron, a Dallas lawyer. She later stressed that conclusions should not be reached for 2012 until end-of-year finance reports are filed in January 2013, though rolling in available information for the year only mildly reduces the overall percentage, to 74.7 percent.

Next, we made our own run at identifying such contributions to the party from 2002 through fall 2012. This tally is imperfect given that we likely failed to catch some donations or, conversely, filter them out. We also did not research how many contributions were returned; that occasionally happens.

At any rate, our calculation is that nearly $14 million of more than $18 million given to the party, or 75 percent, came from trial lawyer interests.

Notably, though, the party’s draw from such contributors fluctuated year to year.

In 2002, an election year that included every legislative seat and races for statewide office including governor and the U.S. Senate, more than 70 trial-lawyer-connected contributions accounted for about $5.4 million, or 81 percent, of the party’s $6.7 million in contributions, not counting the party-committee donations targeting federal races. Sylvester separately concluded that $5.5 million of $7.7 million in the party’s contributions, 71 percent, came from trial lawyer interests.

In 2003, by our calculation, such contributions dipped to 26 percent of about $509,000 donated to the party. Such contributions accounted for 36 percent of the party’s donations in 2004 and 24 percent in 2005--well below 80 percent. Then again, such aid accounted for more than 70 percent of party donations from 2006 through 2010, topping out at 93 percent of donations in 2008. Such donations fell to 40 percent of total donations in 2011 and less than 30 percent part-way through 2012.

The group steered by Baron was dominant through the decade, accounting for more than $5 million in contributions. But others also were crucial. Texas 2000, a group organized by trial lawyers, and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association accounted for more than $2.3 million in donations. The Beaumont-based law firm of Provost & Umphrey, ponied up $1 million through October 2008. Nix Patterson & Roach, which has offices in Texarkana, Dallas, Austin and Daingerfield, gave $925,000, while.Houston lawyer John O’Quinn, who has since died, donated $730,000.

A Sept. 26, 2002, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, which tracks campaign-finance spending, as saying that Texas 2000 and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association function just as the political committee of Texans for Lawsuit Reform. ""Like-minded individuals appoint a treasurer, sit in a circle and throw some money in the hat,"" he said. Critics including Sylvester have noted that pro-trial groups often have names not revealing their pro-trial leans.

Separately, we asked the Democratic Party and the trial-lawyers association about the decade-long share of donations from trial-lawyer interests. Party spokesman Jacob Limón emailed that since Gilberto Hinojosa won election as party chairman in June 2012, trial lawyers have not accounted for the majority of contributions--about $32,000 of $91,000 donated to the party between Hinojosa’s election through late September, 35 percent.

Willie Chapman, spokesman for the trial-lawyers association, emailed that while it has not calculated the share of trial-lawyer contributions to either major party, his hunch is that, ""whatever the percentage is, using the last decade gives a lot of weight to the multi-year commitment to the Democratic Party made by"" Baron. 
Our ruling

Sylvester wrote that for over a decade, personal-injury trial lawyers have accounted for over 80 percent of the Texas Democratic Party’s contributions.

When we inquired, she pegged the percentage at 75 percent--what we found as well. So the published percentage is an exaggeration, though certainly trial lawyers have been dominant party benefactors. 
On another front, this statement failed to clarify that the share of lawyer contributions bounced around year to year. That is, personal-injury attorneys didn’t consistently account for over 80 percent of party receipts.

We rate the claim as Mostly True.","[('\nOpinion column, ""Personal injury lawyers rob Democrats of broader support,"" Sherry Sylvester, in the San Antonio Express-News, Dec. 2, 2012\n\nTelephone interviews and emails (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Sherry Sylvester, senior communications advisor, Texans for Lawsuit Reform, Dec. 6-Dec. 13, 2012\n\nNews article, ""Lobbyists seek to end PAC-to-PAC donations,"" Austin American-Statesman, Sept. 26, 2002 (Nexis search)\n\nEmail (excerpted), Jacob Limón, deputy executive director, Texas Democratic Party, Dec. 5, 2012\n\nEmail, Willie Chapman, communications director, Texas Trial Lawyers Association, Dec. 13, 2012\n\n\xa0', 'http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Personal-injury-lawyers-rob-Democrats-of-broader-4081555.php')]",/factchecks/2012/dec/14/sherry-sylvester/tort-reform-spokeswoman-says-personal-injury-trial/

Dennis Kucinich says mortgages for 14 million Americans exceed the value of their homes
","
The so-called fiscal cliff of Jan. 2 is the deadline for tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 to expire and for automatic cuts in defense and nondefense spending to take effect -- unless Congress and the White House reach a deal.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich took to the floor of the House last month to warn against proposed austerity measures. The Cleveland Democrat said such spending cuts would repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression.

""Poor and middle-class Americans know all about the fiscal cliff,"" he said, because ""they've been getting pushed off it for years.""

Among examples he cited: ""Fourteen million Americans' mortgages are greater than the value of their homes.""

The recession officially ended more than three years ago. Are so many homeowners still ""underwater"" in their mortgages, even in an economic recovery from the collapse of the housing bubble in 2008? PolitiFact Ohio asked Kucinich's staff for more information.

They referred us to the Zillow online real estate database. Its Negative Equity Report, produced on a quarterly basis, shows the percent of homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.

According to the third quarter Zillow Negative Equity Report, issued last month, 28.2 percent of U.S. homeowners with a mortgage are under water, which is down from 30.9 percent in the first quarter of 2012.

The actual number of homeowners in negative equity, owing more than their homes are worth, declined about 1.3 million in the third quarter, to slightly more than 14 million.

The situation may be  improving, but more than a quarter of homeowners with mortgages remain underwater.

Pew Environment Group says the Atlantic menhaden population declined by 90 percent in recent years
","The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is scheduled to vote today, Dec. 14, on whether to cut the catch limit for Atlantic menhaden.

Environmentalists say the menhaden population, a crucial part of the Atlantic ecosystem, has dropped to dangerous levels. Menhaden are an important food source for tuna, cod, striped bass, whales, dolphins, ospreys and eagles.

Opponents of a strict limit, mostly from the fishing industry, say there are enough fish and the size of the population rises and falls naturally. The fish are used for fertilizer, bait, and fish-oil supplements.

On Dec. 11, three days before the meeting, the Pew Environment Group ran a large ad in The Providence Journal headlined, ""Governor Chafee: When this little fish disappears we're in big trouble."" It talked about the importance of the species, adding, ""But in recent years, menhaden numbers along our coast have plummeted by 90 percent.""

Fish counts are a contentious topic. After all, it's tough to do an inventory of undersea life, most of which you can't see. We wondered whether Pew’s number was accurate.

We asked Pew for its source. Spokesman Jeff Young referred us to the 2011 Stock Assessment Report by the fisheries commission, a compact of 15 states that deals with fishing issues on the East Coast.

Table 7.5 offers a complex calculation -- using lots of different data sources -- of the number of menhaden at the start of the year. The estimates go from 1955 to 2008. Young said biologists focus on the number of fish that had survived their first year, when they're more likely to be caught. We will do that as well.

The estimates over the years show two peaks and two valleys. The population was high in the 1950s. It dropped precipitously and remained low in the 1960s. Then it started rising significantly, peaking from 1976 to 1989 before falling back to the 1960-ish range during the last two decades.

Whether the population declined by 90 percent, as Pew asserts, depends on where you want to start calculating and when you want to stop.

The Pew ad says the 90-percent decline was ""in recent years."" It gives no time frame.

If you think of ""recent"" as the last 10 years, the drop from 1999 to 2008 has been 43 percent, far from 90 percent, according to the chart Pew referenced.

Over the last 20 years, it's been 76 percent.

To show a drop close to 90 percent, you have to start at 1982, when the estimated number of menhaden was 20.2 billion, the second-highest ever reported, and compare it with 2008, when the population was about 2.4 billion -- a drop of 88 percent.

If you started with the first year of data -- 8.3 billion fish in 1955 -- and compared it with 2008, you’d have a decline of 71 percent.

We found smaller percentages when we looked at the more recent commission report, from 2012, because it gives a higher number for the menhaden population for 2011, the most recent year the report looks at. Using that estimate, the decline since 1982 has been 82 percent.

But Pew Environment's chief scientist Jud Crawford said the most recent report is considered less reliable because questions have been raised about the way the estimates were calculated.

We also consulted with Mark Gibson, deputy chief of the marine fisheries division of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.

""There's no question there's been a decline downward,"" he said. ""But when you have a fish stock that varies up and down across time, you can cherry-pick your window across time, say it declined and get a whole bunch of people alarmed.""

Our ruling

The Pew Environment Group said that ""in recent years, menhaden numbers along our coasts have plummeted by 90 percent,"" a very specific number. It says overfishing must be halted to rebuild the population.

The estimated number of menhaden is clearly well below the estimated population for the late 1980s. But it's currently at levels seen in the 1960s.

If you want to claim a 90-percent drop, you have to compare the 2008 population to a very specific -- and very exceptional -- year, 1982.

We don't consider a 30-year-old benchmark to be ""recent.""

Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Sen. Robert Singer says more than half those in New Jersey getting minimum wage are in high school
","
Raising the minimum wage so soon after Hurricane Sandy could create another round of casualties, according to state Sen. Robert Singer: businesses along the Jersey Shore.

During a Senate hearing Nov. 29, Singer (R-Ocean) argued against a measure to increase the hourly minimum wage to $8.50 from $7.25. Senate Democrats passed the bill 23-16; Singer voted against it. The minimum wage last got a bump in 2005.

Singer’s statement focused on the financial hit Shore businesses would face by raising their labor force costs on top of trying to rebuild in time for summer 2013.

""More than 50 percent of those people getting minimum wage in this state are high school students,"" Singer said. ""Many of them work the Shore area.""

While a good number of working high school students are likely being paid minimum wage, it’s a bit of a stretch to claim that more than half the population earning $7.25 an hour in New Jersey are in high school.

Let’s review the data.

New Jersey is one of 23 states with minimum wage set at $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal
government.

In its most recent annual report, the state’s Minimum Wage Advisory Commission noted that 16,000 people ages 16-21 were paid minimum wage on average for a year-long period ending September 2011, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That amounts to 40.2 percent of minimum-wage earners in the state -- the largest group of workers being paid $7.25 an hour, according to the report.

Brian T. Murray, a state Labor Department spokesman, said more recent data for the period of October 2011 through September 2012, shows that 24,400 people (52.4 percent of the state’s minimum-wage earners) were in that age group, according to the Current Population Survey and the BLS.

The more recent data, however, has not yet been released officially, Murray said.

So, Singer can’t accurately claim that more than half of New Jersey’s minimum-wage earners are high school students. The closest age range to high school in the New Jersey data is 16-21, meaning people not in high school are lumped in with students.

Singling out high schoolers isn’t critical to the overall discussion about raising New Jersey’s minimum wage, according to Singer.

""I don’t think the statement is really crucial in the entire discussion,"" Singer told us, adding that there’s no way to count high school students who may be getting paid ‘off the books,’ or in cash, without tax deductions. ""If it’s 40 or 50 percent, 10 percent doesn’t change my comments or the gist of my comments.""

There’s also a difference in the weight minimum wage carries in a family when a teenager is getting it versus an adult.

""The idea to the extent that teenagers are second workers or third workers in a household where there’s other income, then raising the minimum wage is not necessarily for those households an anti-poverty program,"" said Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ""The real effect of helping the working poor is to raise the income of those people who are heads of households.""

 Our ruling

During a speech on the state Senate floor about raising New Jersey’s minimum wage, Singer said, ""More than 50 percent of those people getting minimum wage in this state are high school students. Many of them work the Shore area.""

Data shows that high school-age students are part of the largest percentage of New Jerseyans earning minimum wage, but the data is for an age range of 16 to 21. That means nonstudents are included.

Singer said his figure doesn’t include students who may be paid ‘off the books,’ but there’s no way to quantify that group.

As a result, there’s no clear proof that more than half those in New Jersey earning minimum wage are high schoolers even though it’s likely some high school students are included. We rate Singer’s statement Mostly False. 
To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. 
Update: The minimum wage bill that Singer voted against also included a provision providing automatic annual increases in the minimum wage, starting in September 2013, according to Senate Republicans spokesman Jeremy Rosen. Further, Singer voted in the same hearing against tabling an amendment to increase New Jersey's minimum wage to $8.50 an hour, over three years, Rosen noted.",[],/factchecks/2012/dec/13/robert-singer/sen-robert-siner-says-most-people-jersey-earning-m/

Juan Hernández says Texas was first to pass a state ‘Dream Act’
","
Texas’ political future isn’t necessarily painted Democratic blue, according to Juan Hernández, the co-founder of Hispanic Republicans of Texas.

Asked by the Dallas Morning News in a Nov. 8, 2012, interview whether demographics will soon change the state’s Republican hue, Hernández said, ""No, because I see Texas [Republicans] moving very quickly to incorporating Hispanics."" Among his examples: ""Texas passed a state DREAM Act before any other state in the nation,"" he said. ""So Texas is different.""

By phone, Hernández confirmed that he was talking about a law PolitiFact Texas has examined several times. In 2001, Texas lawmakers passed (almost unanimously) and Gov. Rick Perry signed into law a measure allowing certain immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children to attend state colleges and universities at the tuition rates charged to legal in-state residents.

Hernández, a Fort Worth native and Mexican-U.S. studies professor who was tapped in 2001 to be Mexico’s special adviser on migrant affairs, said he was among many who supported the legislation.

Though sometimes called the ""Texas Dream Act,"" the law is much narrower in scope than the national DREAM Act proposed in various forms since 2001.

The federal Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, said a June 22, 2012, PolitiFact story, also pertains to certain children brought to the United States illegally by parents or relatives. But the national legislation would create a new way to give those immigrants legal status and avoid deportation, if they have stayed out of trouble and were in school or the military.

State law does not (and cannot) change their legal status. Texas’ law only requires that the students sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so.

Twelve other states have tuition laws like Texas’, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures website, enacted in the wake of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.

One provision in the act sought to prevent states from giving a tuition benefit to illegal immigrants that is not available to all legal U.S. residents -- that is, legal residents of other states, who pay a higher ""out-of-state"" rate. But the language was unclear, the NCSL site said, and ""there is no guidance in congressional report language or in federal regulations.""

Some states reacted by passing laws to allow the tuition benefit for certain illegal immigrants -- typically those who had attended high school in the state and intended to apply for citizenship. Other states, the NCSL site said, passed legislation banning illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates.

Both types of law have been challenged in court. The national DREAM Act includes language to repeal the murky federal provision.

Was Texas first to put the tuition benefit into law?

Yes. ""In June 2001, Texas (HB 1403) was the first state to pass legislation allowing in-state tuition for immigrant students,"" says the NCSL site in a report updated Nov. 28, 2012.

Next, it says, were California, Utah and New York in 2001-02; Washington and Illinois in 2003; Kansas in 2004; New Mexico in 2005; Nebraska in 2006; Wisconsin in 2009; Maryland and Connecticut in 2011. Oklahoma granted the benefit in 2004, then rescinded it in 2008.

Texas barely edged out California, though. According to California’s legislative information site, Assembly Bill 540 was approved by both Senate and Assembly on Sept. 14, 2001, then signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Oct. 12, 2001.

Texas House and Senate journals for the 2001 session show that versions of House Bill 1403 cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House passed the measure 142-1 on April 23, 2001; the Senate amended it, then approved it 27-3 on May 21, 2001.

Three days later, the House approved the Senate's changes 130-2. Perry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001.

Was this state law a ""Dream Act,"" even though it could not change students’ legal status?

Perry spoke of the ""Texas dream"" in a speech soon after he signed the law, telling the Southwest Voters Registration Education Project that he approved it ""so that young Texans who graduated from our public schools, regardless of their immigration status, will be able to pay in‑state tuition and take part in the Texas dream. We want bright, new Texans to stay here, and contribute great things to our future.""

A Nov. 15, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news story said the Texas law is ""commonly referred to as the Texas Dream Act.""

We trawled through more news stories on Nexis.com, where the first such reference we spotted was a 2004 description of ""Texas’ Dream Act."" Thereafter, we found many in other states, usually referring to similar in-state tuition proposals. 
In California and New York, however, stories from 2007 through 2011 reserved the term for legislation going further than the tuition laws already on those states’ books -- granting eligibility for financial aid or drivers’ licenses, for example.

Hernández agreed the Texas law is not equivalent to the national legislation. When he was helping advocate the state law, he told us, ""we didn’t call it the Dream Act.""   
But there is common ground, he said. ""We’re talking about the same kids, and we’re talking about finding ways to live a life in this nation,"" he said. ""I think that’s why many of us say it’s a type of Dream Act.""

Our ruling

Hernández said Texas was the first to pass a state DREAM Act.

Texas was the first state to permit in-state tuition for certain children in the country illegally. But like other states’ laws, its measure did not -- could not -- go as far as federal versions offering a possible path to citizenship. The state laws are not DREAM acts.

Candidate for Wisconsin schools chief backed biggest education spending cuts in state history, liberal group says
","
The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now has long been critical of state Rep. Don Pridemore, especially when blasting bills he authored that would affect police treatment of immigrants and require voters to present photo identification.

Now that Pridemore, a Republican from suburban Milwaukee, is challenging state schools superintendent Tony Evers in the April 2013 election, One Wisconsin Now has made a new attack.

In a news release Dec. 3, 2012, the day Pridemore announced his candidacy, the Madison-based group claimed Pridemore ""voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history -- nearly $2 billion between K-12 and the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical College Systems -- in favor of $2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.""

Both the funding cuts and tax cuts parts of this claim are similar to claims we've rated before. How do they stack up when combined?

Education funding cuts

To back the first part of the claim, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross cited a February 2012 Truth-O-Meter item that evaluated a nearly identical statement.

In that item, we rated as True an attack by Kathleen Falk that GOP Gov. Scott Walker enacted ""the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history."" Falk ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to challenge Walker in the June 2012 recall election.

We found that Walker’s 2011-2013 state budget, which Pridemore voted for, cut $1.11 billion in state aid to school districts, the university system and technical colleges.

But that’s far short of the nearly $2 billion that One Wisconsin Now claimed.

Moreover, the claim ignores the fact that school districts and other local governments were able to offset the cuts by forcing employees to pay a greater share of their health care and pension costs. One Wisconsin Now highlights just one side of the equation.

Ross said his math puts the total cut at nearly $2 billion because the budget reduced by $800 million the amount of property taxes that local school districts can levy.

But limiting a school district’s ability to raise taxes is not the same as a straight budget cut, which is what One Wisconsin Now claims in its attack on Pridemore.

Tax cuts

The second part of the group’s claim against Pridemore -- that he voted for ""$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy"" -- is similar to a One Wisconsin Now claim we rated in July 2011.

In that item, the group said Walker’s budget has ""tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade."" We rated the statement Half True.

We found that Walker’s budget -- along with other tax provisions adopted in 2011 -- will result in a total reduction of $2.3 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. However, while many tax breaks go to corporations and individuals with higher incomes, some go to small businesses and to average taxpayers.

Pridemore and other Republicans have argued that the tax cuts give incentives to employers to create more jobs. What’s more, One Wisconsin Now pairs up the 10-year figure with an annual one for school funding, skewing the comparison.

Our rating

One Wisconsin Now said Pridemore voted for ""the largest cuts to public education in our state history"" -- nearly $2 billion -- and for ""$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.""

Pridemore voted for the largest cuts to education -- but they amount to about $1 billion, not nearly $2 billion, over two years. And Pridemore voted for $2.3 billion in tax breaks, but they don’t benefit only corporations and the wealthy.

We rate One Wisconsin Now’s claim Half True.","[('\nOne Wisconsin Now, news release, Dec. 3, 2012\n\nInterview and email interview, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross, Dec. 6 and , 2012\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, ""Recall candidate Kathleen Falk says Gov.

"['Agriculture', 'Ohio', 'Economy', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich says agriculture is the ""strongest industry in Ohio""
","
Jobs in manufacturing, especially in the auto industry, drew so much attention in recent political campaigns that one observer speculated every man, woman and child in Ohio must spend their days building cars.

PolitiFact Ohio knew that was a joke, but the focus on factories increased our interest in comments by Gov. John Kasich when he addressed the 2012 meeting of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation on Nov. 29, 2012. The Ohio Capital Blog recorded the event.

Agriculture, Kasich said,  ""is the strongest industry in Ohio"" and ""the bedrock of the state of Ohio.""

We've heard similar comments from others: Sen. Sherrod Brown (""the state's No. 1 industry""), the state Department of Agriculture (""Ohio's No. 1 industry"") and the Farm Bureau itself (""Ohio's top industry"").

It's a bipartisan claim.

But PolitiFact Ohio wondered what measure makes agriculture No. 1. Employment? Dollars generated? Taxes levied? Square footage?

So we called Kasich's office and the state Agriculture Department and asked for sources.

Both referred us to ""OHFOOD,"" for Ohio food, which is an annually updated economic model developed by Thomas L. Sporleder, the much-cited professor of agribusiness at The Ohio State University.

The model, by its own description, is designed ""to capture the inter-dependencies and linkages among various sectors and industries composing the complex economy of Ohio"" and ""specifically to provide estimates of the economic importance of the food and agriculture-related cluster, along with the general manufacturing and service sectors, of the Ohio economy.""

Agriculture Department spokeswoman Erica Pitchford Hawkins said the analysis is the most comprehensive study available of Ohio agribusiness, and we could find nothing comparable.

The most recent, from June 2012, uses data from 2010 gathered primarily federal and county level agencies, Sporleder said.

In 2010, the study found, the total food and agricultural cluster contributed 11.7 percent, or $105 billion, of Ohio's total economic output of $898.7 billion. The cluster's share of the gross state product of $477.7 billion was $51 billion, or almost 11 percent.

Ohio's gross state product improved by 1.3 percent from 2008 to 2010, the study said, while the portion attributed to the ""agrifood"" cluster increased about 30 percent.

The agrifood cluster accounts for 14 percent of Ohio employment, or about 1 of 7 jobs. It gained 1 percent from 2008 to 2010, a period when total employment declined about 3 percent.

There are some points worth noting:

In the OHFOOD study, the ""financial, legal and real estate"" cluster is listed as a larger private sector of the state economy than the agrifood cluster. Kasich's office, though, pointed out that the grouping of financial services, legal services and real estate activities is particular to the study. That grouping is not used by such agencies as the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Sporleder told us the cluster is grouped because ""it’s all service related,"" but ""it’s not a supply chain"" in the way food and agriculture is.

That leaves food and agriculture the biggest sector of the state economy.

""If you’re only talking about commodities, that’s not the case,"" Sporleder said, meaning the cluster is more than just farming. ""If you’re talking wheat to flour to bread, you get the sector build-up. It’s an interdependent supply chain.""

More than just farming, the ""agrifood"" or ""agribusiness"" cluster also encompasses processing, wholesaling and retailing, and food services. As a group, it accounts for $3 billion of the gross state product in the OHFOOD mode.

Kasich described agriculture as the strongest industry in Ohio. Data shows that the agrifood sector is the largest sector of the state’s economy.

His statement is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.

"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Libertarian Party of Georgia']","
GOP lawmakers in Georgia don't walk the walk on spending, Libertarians say
","
The term ""supermajority"" worries some Georgia Libertarians -- and they say you should be concerned, too.

Republicans are very close to two-thirds majorities in both chambers of the Georgia Legislature, a ""supermajority,"" which is described as a majority so large Democrats and independents would be unable to block proposed changes by GOP lawmakers to the state constitution. 

Leaders in the state’s Libertarian Party tried to emphasize their trepidation in a recent press release. Republicans, they say, are not the best managers of state finances. One claim in the press release seemed worthy of a fact check.

""While Republicans held a large majority for the past few sessions, we saw an increase in the state budget for FY 2013 greater than the rate of inflation and population growth,"" said party Chairman Doug Harman. ""That certainly is not the limited government spending promised by Republican candidates on the campaign trail in 2010.""

The Libertarian Party endorsed James Camp in the race to fill a vacant state Senate seat that became open when Gov. Nathan Deal appointed Bill Hamrick, a Republican, to the Superior Court on the Coweta Judicial Circuit. An election is scheduled for Jan. 8, 2013.

We wondered if the party’s claim about the growth in the state budget was correct, and if it is the best way to measure such growth.

The party’s executive director, Brett Bittner, explained how they reached this conclusion. They compared the amount of money approved by the Georgia Legislature in the two most recent state budgets. That’s about a 5.4 percent increase. Georgia’s budget runs on a 12-month schedule that begins July 1 and ends June 30.

Bittner said they calculated the increase in inflation between 2010 and 2011, which he said was 3.16 percent. He added that number and the percentage of Georgia’s population increase between April 2010 and July 2011, which was 1.32 percent. Combined, that’s about 4.5 percent.

""[T]hat means the budget grew BEYOND inflation and population growth,"" Bittner wrote in an email.

Several experts we interviewed agreed that the Libertarian Party’s claim is accurate, if you make the comparison using Georgia’s population increase and the inflation rate between 2010 and 2011. But they said that’s not the best way to measure such things. They also said there’s some context that should be considered when examining the state budget.

""I don’t think this formula is the one I would prefer,"" said Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth.

Humphreys believes a better comparison would be to measure any increase in state spending against Georgia’s economic growth through its gross domestic product.

Georgia’s nominal gross domestic product, which measures the value of all the goods and services produced in current prices, grew by 3.9 percent between 2010 and 2011, Humphreys said. He noted, though, that increase is between one calendar year, as opposed to a fiscal year. 

Humphreys said a multiyear study of state spending is a more effective approach. He and others noted that state spending is about $1 billion less than it was before the Great Recession took hold in 2008. 

The biggest increases in state spending between the last two budgets occurred in education and community health. Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a nonprofit group that opposed the Legislature’s decision to cut some taxes earlier this year, said the current budget had to be increased. Enrollment in state-funded colleges has increased by 100,000 students over the past decade, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently reported. Another factor in increased state spending is Medicaid, which Essig said has been underfunded.

""Ninety percent of (the budget increase) was keeping the state afloat,"" Essig said.

He and others pointed out that Deal has asked state agencies to make further cuts.

Carolyn Bourdeaux, the former director of the Georgia Senate Budget and Evaluation Office, said in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the state had to replace federal stimulus funding and state reserves that were used to shore up general fund spending in prior years. For instance, she said the state took about $850 million in reserves between 2009 and 2011 from employee retirement health benefits and the state’s health benefit plan to help keep the state budget afloat.

""At least some of these funds must be replaced,"" said Bourdeaux, now associate director of Georgia State University’s fiscal research center.

Bourdeaux continues to track state spending against population, the consumer price index, gross domestic product and other factors. Her research shows state government real per capita spending has grown by only 2 percent since fiscal year 2009. Bourdeaux’s data also shows real per capita state spending has declined by 23 percent from its height in fiscal year 2001.

Bittner said they decided to compare spending against population growth and inflation because Georgia Republicans contend they’ve kept pace with those two categories.

""It did grow faster,"" Bittner said of state spending.

Bittner rejected the argument that the state has been hamstrung by other budgetary matters in recent years, particularly since they dominate both legislative chambers and hold all of the constitutional offices.

""We should see much greater cuts,"" he said. ""It further indicts them.""

To summarize, the Libertarian Party of Georgia claimed that the increase in the current state budget was greater than the inflation rate and the rate of population growth in Georgia. Their numbers are accurate, but per capita state spending is actually less than it was a decade ago and has been flat since the recession. Meanwhile, Georgia has had a record number of college students and has other areas where it must spend more. 

The claim is technically accurate, but it ignores some facts that would give readers a different impression.

"['Foreign Policy', 'Texas', 'Guns', 'Chain email']","
Chain email says Obama administration plans to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons
","
According to a chain email, President Barack Obama recently ""took the first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States.""

The email, sent to us by a curious Austin reader, continues: ""The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for U.S. citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the U.S. State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress.""

Talk about an explosive agenda.

Still, we launched into this look with skepticism since a similar fact-check boiled out to nothing but smoke. U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James drew a Pants on Fire in May 2012 after declaring that Obama and Hillary Clinton were seeking a treaty to ban the use of U.S. firearms.

So we kept the matches handy.

The recent chain email’s references to administration plans are presented as if they were part of an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article headlined: ""U.S. reverses stance on treaty to regulate arms trade.""

Datelined Washington, the actual article opens: ""The United States reversed policy on Wednesday and said it would back launching talks on a treaty to regulate arms sales as long as the talks operated by consensus, a stance critics said gave every nation a veto. The decision, announced in a statement released by the U.S. State Department, overturns the position of former President George W. Bush's administration, which had opposed such a treaty on the grounds that national controls were better.""

In July 2012, the United States participated in the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, but the negotiations adjourned after four weeks amid a lack of consensus, according to a July 27, 2012, New York Times news article. The treaty cannot take effect unless every country signs off.

The Times’ story says that major arms exporters — the United States, Russia and China — had said more time was needed before action. The story says, too, there was friction over whether the treaty would infringe on U.S. gun rights. Also, it says, 51 senators had urged the Obama administration not to sign the treaty — of significance considering U.S. ratification of any treaty would require 67 Senate votes.

According to the story, the treaty would establish common international standards for authorizing international arms transfers. The newspaper said a draft version said a prime purpose is to ""prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and their diversion to illegal and unauthorized end use."" It would also prohibit signatories from transferring conventional weapons that violate arms embargoes or enable those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the story says.

So, treaty gone?

Not necessarily. On the day after Obama won re-election, the U.S. backed a U.N. committee’s call to renew debate over the treaty, Reuters reported in a Nov. 7, 2012, news article, adding that such a resolution is expected to clear the U.N. General Assembly, leading to a resumption of talks in March 2013.

The story quotes an unidentified U.S. official as saying: ""We seek a treaty that contributes to international security by fighting illicit arms trafficking and proliferation, protects the sovereign right of states to conduct legitimate arms trade, and meets the concerns that we have been articulating throughout. We will not accept any treaty that infringes on the constitutional rights of our citizens to bear arms,"" the official is quoted as saying.

The story also says that ""U.S. officials have acknowledged privately that the treaty under discussion would have no effect on domestic gun sales and ownership because it would apply only to exports.""

We’re not inclined to rely on comments by unidentified officials. In our James’ fact-check, though, we noted an April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington by Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation.

Countryman summarized  the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced.

""We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment,"" Countryman said. ""...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support.""

As we reviewed this chain email, Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us the treaty is intended to apply only to the international arms trade. The U.N. cannot regulate firearms within countries ""on any ground whatsoever,"" Buchanan said. ""It has no domestic jurisdiction.""

Buchanan also provided a June 2012 U.N. ""Myths and Facts"" handout that includes denials the body is contemplating a ban on gun ownership. ""The U.N. is not pursuing a global treaty to ban gun ownership by civilians,"" the handout says. ""Member states are committed to tightening controls over the international import, export and transfers of conventional arms, because without such controls it is easier for weapons to be diverted from the legal trade into the illegal market, and into the hands of terrorists, drug traffickers and criminal cartels.""

The handout also says: ""Each sovereign state determines its own laws and regulations for the manufacture, sale and possession of firearms by its citizens. The United Nations has no jurisdiction over such matters... No UN agreement exists banning firearms possession.""

A July 27, 2012, draft of the treaty makes many references to restricting the international arms trade.

As far as we could tell, it lacks provisions for the international community to regulate firearms within countries. Its preamble even notes the ""legitimate trade and use of certain conventional arms ... for recreational, cultural, historical and sporting activities and lawful ownership where such ownership and use are permitted and protected by law."" The preamble also affirms the sovereign right and responsibility of any country to ""regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems.""

Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, expressed objections to the treaty to the United Nations on July 11, 2012, saying in testimony that the group would drop its opposition only if civilian firearms were not included. The draft treaty says it will apply to all conventional arms including battle tanks; armored combat vehicles; large-caliber artillery systems; combat aircraft; attack helicopters; warships; missiles and missile launchers; and small arms and light weapons.

We called the association to explore how the Obama administration might use the treaty to ban all U.S. weapons and didn’t hear back.

Our ruling

"['Oregon', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Our Oregon']","
Does Oregon spend more on tax giveaways than it brings in?
","
Middle ground is a hard thing to find in politics these days. Partisanship, especially at the national level, is almost a sport. And yet, this election cycle there did seem to be one point of agreement: The tax code needs to be reworked and breaks, in particular, need a close examination.

In a recent blog post, Our Oregon, an organization backed by several public employee unions and other groups of similar political views, made the same case for the Oregon’s tax code.

Here’s part of a recent post their Sockeye blog published on the topic:

""Oregon's tax expenditure code is a list of 378 different tax breaks, writing exceptions into Oregon's law for certain income, property, and other items. While some of the tax expenditures are good, common sense ideas (like the earned income tax credit, which provides relief for low-income, working families), others appear completely baffling (did you know that boat owners can take a tax credit for each of their boats?)

""Overall, Oregon's tax expenditure code costs the state $32 billion each budget cycle, while Oregon collects about $14 billion in total taxes and other revenue. To put it plainly: Each budget cycle, the state spends more money on tax giveaways than it receives in tax collection.""

We decided to check it out.

First, we called up the Oregon Department of Revenue. Spokesman Dennis Thompson told us to take a look at the Tax Expenditure Report. This report lays the details out pretty clearly for 2011-13. During the current biennium, the state is expected to bring in some $27.2 billion, while its tax giveaways are expected to total $31.3 billion.

The numbers support Our Oregon’s statement.

There is some important context offered in the expenditure report right before these figures. The dollar impact listed for tax breaks is not the amount of revenue you could gain if you wanted to repeal all of them. Take federal land, for example. Oregon has a lot of it -- and it’s exempt from property taxes. Even though we technically forgo those revenues, we don’t have much of a choice. It’s also true that certain tax breaks should, if working correctly, generate more revenue for the state than they give away -- inducements to attract business, for example.

We called Scott Moore, Our Oregon’s spokesman, and spoke with him about all of this.

""We tend to speak pretty generally about the money that the state loses through the tax code because there is a great deal of complexity in individual expenditures,"" he said. But ""I don’t think that discounts, in any way, the general statement that the revenue impact of this big collection of tax breaks is astonishing.

""There is clearly room to make that system more efficient and more effective and save money.""

He’s not the only one who feels this way, of course. The Legislature has already instituted a six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed. The folks at Our Oregon believe they should go further and statistics like this one underscore that.

There was, however, one other detail that caught us. The Our Oregon blog post mentioned $14 billion in total taxes and other revenue. The report we read put the figure at $27 billion, nearly double that. Moore told us the Our Oregon figure comes from a separate 2011-13 Budget Highlights document that references the state’s general fund, leaving out property taxes, beer and wine taxes, gas taxes and others. 
Moore said they went with the $14 billion figure because that’s the money the Oregon Legislature has the most direct control over. Property taxes, for example, usually go to local governments. But if you follow that line of reasoning, there’s also a significant portion of the tax code that the Legislature doesn’t have control over -- again, federal land. 

In the blog post, Our Oregon said ""the state spends more money on tax giveaways than it receives in tax collection."" State budget documents back them up.

But context matters. In the sentence before the statement we’re ruling on, Our Oregon compares apples and oranges. You can’t count revenues the Legislature has control over  and then compare them with tax breaks that include some the Legislature has no say in. We find that additional clarification is needed.

We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nInterview with Scott Moore, spokesman for Our Oregon, Dec. 6, 2012\n\nInterview with Dennis Thompson, spokesman for Oregon Department of Revenue, Dec. 6, 2012\n\nOur Oregon, Sockeye Blog, Dec. 5, 2012\n\nOregon Department of Revenue, 2011-13 Tax Expenditure Report\n\nOregon Legislative Fiscal Office, 2011-13 Budget Highlights, August 2011', 'http://ouroregon.org/sockeye/blog/where-oregon-spends-more-money')]",/factchecks/2012/dec/10/our-oregon/does-oregon-spend-more-tax-giveaways-it-brings/

Rep. Bob Goodlatte says more corn goes to making ethanol than feeding livestock
","With much of the nation experiencing drought, U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says the livestock industry needs relief from federal rules that siphon potential animal feed into ethanol production.

Goodlatte, R-6th, was irked by by the Environmental Protection Agency’s refusal last month to ease the Renewable Fuel Standard that mandates minimum levels of the nation’s fuel supply that must come from ethanol. The standard, he said, has shifted an increasing share of the corn crop into fuel production.

""In 2012 alone, the Agriculture Department estimates that roughly 42 percent of the corn crop will be used to make ethanol -- more than the amount of corn used to feed livestock and poultry in the United States,"" Goodlatte said in a Nov. 23 news release.

Goodlatte said the standard has contributed to a sharp rise in the price of corn -- it went for $6.95 a bushel this October compared to $4.32 a bushel in October 2010 -- and has tightened supplies of livestock feed.

We wondered if more corn really is being used to manufacture ethanol than to feed livestock.

Beth Breeding, a spokeswoman for Goodlatte, pointed us to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It estimates a yield of 10.7 billion corn bushels for the market year that runs from Sept. 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013.

The Department projects that 4.15 billion bushels -- or 38.7 percent of the crop -- will go to ""feed and residual use.""

The amount of corn going for towards ethanol production is projected to be 4.5 billion bushels -- or roughly 42 percent of the crop.

Agricultural economists told us there’s no doubt that the percentage of corn for ethanol has been on the rise, driven by renewable fuel standards first adopted in 2005 and expanded in 2007. Under those guidelines, most types of gas are blended with about 10 percent of corn-based ethanol.

But there’s a key point to consider: Not all of the 42 percent of the corn crop sent to ethanol plants for production ends up as fuel.

""That’s what I call a gross number,"" said Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University. ""That’s what goes into the ethanol plant, but a third of that comes out of the ethanol plant as ethanol feed called distillers dried grains with solubles.""

About two-thirds of a corn kernel is starch, which is removed at plants to make ethanol. The remaining portion has protein-rich compound of distillers grains and solubles, which is sold as livestock feed.

Tyner said when taking into account that livestock feed yield, about 27 percent of the nation’s corn crop is going to produce ethanol. Using the gross number, he said, is ""misleading.""

Estimates vary on the net amount of the corn crop that goes to ethanol after taking into account the distillers grains bi-product.

Richard Wisner, a professor emeritus of agricultural economics at Iowa State University, estimated that when that after taking into account that bi-product, about 32 percent of the 2012-2013 crop is projected to go to ethanol.

Using the gross figures as Goodlatte did is a common way of looking at how much corn is used for ethanol, said Wisner, a biofuels economist at the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center that’s partly funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Still, Wisner said, the net figure of 32 percent is a ""more realistic"" gauge of the how much corn is going to ethanol.

Our ruling

Goodlatte said 42 percent of the nation’s corn crop is being used to manufacture ethanol, more than the amount of corn used to feed livestock.

Goodlatte’s statement is based on commonly cited raw figures from the agriculture department.

But the tallies don’t take into account that a portion of the corn used in ethanol production still ends up in feed troughs as dried distiller’s grains. When that corn byproduct is taken into account, contrary to Goodlatte’s claim, the amount used for feed easily outpaces the amount that ends up as ethanol.

So Goodlatte’s statement is based on accurate raw numbers, but omits key information that disproves his conclusion that more corn goes to ethanol than livestock feed. On the whole, we rate his statement Half True.","[('Rep. Bob Goodlatte, ""Fixing a badly broken ethanol policy,""\xa0 Nov. 23, 2012.\n\nE-mail from Beth Breeding, spokeswoman for Rep.

"['New Hampshire', 'Social Security', 'Jeanne Shaheen']","
Social Security doesn't contribute to the national debt, says Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH
","
When it comes to the fiscal cliff, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is willing to consider anything to ease the fall. Everything, that is, except for one key federal program.

""I think we do need to take Social Security off the table because Social Security has not contributed to the debt and the deficits,"" Shaheen said Tuesday, Nov. 27 in an interview on MSNBC’s Jansing and Co.

""We do need to fix it for the long-term,"" she said. ""But that's a different discussion than the one that we're having about those programs that are actually costing.""

We’ve heard claims like this before. In August 2011, PolitiFact gave a Mostly True ruling to a claim that Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. At the same time, we ruled Mostly False on a claim that Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit.

We decided to take another swing at it.

To start, we approached representatives from Shaheen’s Senate office, who reminded us that Social Security is a self-financed program, funded primarily through dedicated payroll taxes.

In most years, including the period from 1984-2009, the program takes in more money than it distributes in benefits, creating a surplus. Those surplus dollars add to the Social Security trust funds, which currently hold about $2.7 trillion in assets.

The two trust funds -- one dedicated to old age and survivors’ insurance and the other committed to disability insurance -- collect interest over time. And that interest only adds to the surplus, thereby reducing the deficit, according to Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Including interest, the Social Security trust funds held a surplus of $69 billion in 2011, $68.6 billion in 2010 and $121.7 billion in 2009, according to Social Security Administration records.

""To that extent, it’s actually reducing the overall federal deficit,"" Van de Water said.

But, other analysts argue the interest payments earned by Social Security only amount to a re-shuffling of government dollars.

As noted in the prior PolitiFact rulings, the Social Security trust funds may be considered separate, but, in reality, they are not ""locked boxes"" or closed-off savings accounts. Rather, Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-earning government bonds.

The dollars invested in Treasury bonds are frequently mixed and invested with other revenue sources in the government’s general fund, and, together, the money is used for other government purposes, including spending, repaying debts and cutting taxes.

So, when the Social Security trust funds collect interest, they are merely accepting money from other parts of the government, according to Howard Gleckman, an analyst for the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort between the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.

Without considering interest, Social Security has actually been running a deficit over recent years, Gleckman noted. And, when Social Security runs a deficit, the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference.

""It’s an accounting fiction,"" Gleckman said of the interest payments. ""It helps make the Social Security funds look more solvent, but really you've just taken (money) out of general fund. … The money is simply being transferred from one government account to the next.""

In 2010, the program ran a ""cash deficit"" of $49 billion, according to the Social Security Administration’s summary of its 2012 annual report. The following year, the deficit stood at about $45 billion, and, looking forward, the program’s future doesn’t look much brighter.

Social Security trustees project the program’s cash deficit to exceed $60 billion over the next few years, and by 2033, the trust fund will no longer have enough money to cover full benefits for beneficiaries, according to the most recent estimates.

""The Trustees project that (the deficit) will average about $66 billion between 2012 and 2018 before rising steeply as ... the number of beneficiaries continues to grow at a substantially faster rate than the number of covered workers,"" according to the annual report.

Lawmakers from both parties have proposed ways to bridge the gap and salvage the program. But, with the insolvency date looming, Social Security stands to have an even greater effect on the debt moving forward, according to Laurence Kotnikoff, an economics professor at Boston University.

""Nobody can claim Social Security isn’t part of the overall problem,"" Kotnikoff said. ""It’s all labeling games. … It absolutely contributes to the overall fiscal situation. It’s in terrible shape.""

Our ruling: 
Social Security is designed as a self-supporting, pay-as-you-go program, in which current payroll taxes pay for current benefits. This played out for many years, and with interest, the program has built up an annual surplus, which appeared to help offset the national deficits.

But, in reality, Social Security is not closed off from the rest of the government. The program’s surplus funds are frequently invested in Treasury bonds, and during surplus years, the bonds earn interest paid with other government dollars. And in recent years, the amount of taxes collected have not equaled the benefits distributed, leaving the Social Security funds facing a cash deficit, which then forces the government to borrow more money to offset.

This was the case in 2010 and 2011, and Social Security trustees anticipate higher deficits looking forward.

While there’s a case for both interpretations, we see clear evidence that Social Security does affect the nation’s debt and deficit.

Milwaukee County Board chairwoman says county employees pay far more than their counterparts for health care
","
Defending a tax increase that helped county employees pay for health insurance, Milwaukee County Board Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic told a Milwaukee radio interviewer that workers had seen those costs rise substantially two years in a row.

She deflected a question about private-sector benefits, saying the proper comparison point for county benefit costs is what other government workers pay.

""When you compare them (Milwaukee County employees) to the City of Milwaukee and the State of Wisconsin, they are paying much more than their counterparts,"" Dimitrijevic told WTMJ-AM (620) afternoon show host John Mercure on Nov. 14, 2012. ""You have to compare apples to apples.""

It’s been well-publicized that Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining law increased state employees’ health care costs. And Milwaukee -- while not under Act 10’s health care mandates -- got its workers to pick up a greater share of such costs in the wake of the law.

But are county workers paying ""much more"" than state and city employees?

It’s an interesting question, given the prominence of the health care issue in the 2012 county budget tussle between the County Board and County Executive Chris Abele, who again had sought larger cost-sharing from employees.

First, a few words of caution. While there are credible ways to compare health insurance plans, it’s a complicated exercise because costs can vary significantly depending on employees’ health and the intricacies of each plan’s design. For simplicity’s sake, our analysis is based on insurance costs for current employees, not for retirees. The figures discussed here apply to most, but not all, employees of the three governments.

We examined reports that Dimitrijevic says she relied on in making her claim, and spoke with city, county and state officials about their health plan offerings for 2013.

We’ll start with two key measures:

Plan design

State employees have no annual deductible, receive 90 percent co-insurance and have comparatively low limits on yearly out-of-pocket costs (ranging from $500 for single coverage to $1,000 for families).

That gives them a clear advantage over city and county workers.

Most City of Milwaukee workers chose a plan with deductibles of $500 to $1,000 and out-of-pocket caps of $1,000 per person/$2,000 family. The co-insurance picks up 90 percent. The city plan does not charge co-pays for office visits.

County workers face the highest deductibles ($800-$1,850) and by far the highest out-of-pocket limits ($2,500 per person to $5,000 per family). Office and prescription co-pays do not count toward that maximum. Their co-insurance pays less than at the city and state -- 80 percent.

But for 2013, the County Board, over Abele’s objection, funded a county contribution to employees to reimburse them for eligible health care expenditures such as co-pays, deductibles, co-insurance, dental care, or vision care.

The county contribution to these ""flexible spending accounts"" ranges from $600 for a single employee to $1,800 for a family.

So that can offset most of an employee’s costs up to the deductible. And county officials say it brings those county employees who use very little health care into rough parity with city employees.

Still, county workers face higher out-of-pocket payments than city workers if their medical costs mount. And the difference could amount to several hundred dollars, or a couple thousand dollars in a bad health year, so it’s significant.

It’s not clear how many people fall into the higher-use group, though after 10 months of 2012 about 35 percent had met their deductible. That includes retirees, but the figure for active workers would be comparable, said the county’s benefits administrator, Matthew Hanchek.

Monthly Premiums

County workers pay the highest premiums, and they can’t use that county contribution towards them.

City employees are on the low end with premiums ranging from $54 monthly to $173 in the most popular plan. Most state workers will pay $85 to $211.

By contrast, county workers will pay $100 to $225 a month, putting another gap between them and the rest.

Let’s try to tally it up:

It’s clear that state employees have the lowest costs.

That leaves county vs. city.

We asked the county’s Hanchek about the city vs. county comparison.

He said the flexible spending contribution brings the county plan close to parity with the city’s when you consider all active members.

There’s some support for that by another measure: the collective employee share of their employer’s total health care bill.

At the county, that figure is a projected 23 percent to 27 percent for 2013, depending on which measure from several county sources you prefer. The city is in the 23 percent to 25 percent range, said Michael Brady, city employee benefits director.

To the extent those figures are apples-to-apples, they suggest there isn’t much difference between the plans as a whole. Benefits officials caution that these aggregate figures don’t necessarily reflect a typical employee’s experience.

Hanchek did note that the city’s premium costs are a bit lower than the county’s, which he attributed mainly to demographic factors.

County Comptroller Scott Manske looked at the situation a different way and drew this conclusion: At higher usage levels, county workers likely face much higher out-of-pocket costs, compared with city workers. At average usage levels, it’s a wash or the county worker could pay a little more, he said.

We’ll give the final word to Richard Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48, the labor organization that represents many city and county employees. Both employee groups have been asked to pay more for health benefits in recent years, Abelson said.

The bottom line, in Abelson’s view, is that city workers pay a little bit less than their county counterparts, even when the county’s flexible spending account is considered.

One final note. We found that city workers earn $50,476 on average, slightly more than state ($49,534) and county workers ($50,188), so at least in a rough sense city employees may have a bit more ability to pay.

Our rating

Dimitrijevic said Milwaukee County government employees are paying ""much more"" for health insurance than their counterparts at the City of Milwaukee and in state government.

There’s mixed evidence, but we think a fair reading of the numbers is that some county employees will pay more. The precise number is hard to judge. And those people could pay out ""much more"" if you think hundreds of dollars a year or more is a big deal.

But there’s an important detail here that undercuts Dimitrijevic’s claim: the county’s contribution to workers’ flexible spending accounts. Because of that, some city and county employees ultimately may pay similar amounts when you factor in that taxpayer-funded contribution.

Frank Lautenberg says New Jersey tourism generates billions in the Garden State
","
Jersey resilience may not be the only factor driving the need to rebuild in the wake of Superstorm Sandy.

Tourism dollars also are at stake, to the tune of a total that exceeds the Garden State’s nearly $32 billion budget.

Sen. Frank Lautenberg discussed the wrath of Sandy, President Obama’s visit to New Jersey to inspect the damage, and the importance of the state’s tourism industry during a Nov. 13 speech on the Senate floor.

""I joined President Obama in his visit to the area. For many people in my State, the boardwalk isn't just a source of pride, it's a source of critical income to our state,"" according to Lautenberg’s speech published in The Congressional Record. ""In 2008, tourism brought in $38 billion dollars and supported more than 300,000 jobs in the state of New Jersey. Families came from all over the country to walk the boardwalk in Atlantic City or take a fishing boat out of one of our ports, Point Pleasant or one of the others, or ride the roller coaster at a pier in Seaside Heights.""

For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the senator’s claim about tourism in 2008 and the number of jobs created in that field.

Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray said the senator’s statement wasn’t meant to imply that New Jersey received $38 billion in tax revenue for 2008. Instead, Gray said, Lautenberg was referring to the overall financial impact tourism has on the Garden State.

""Senator Lautenberg was referring to the amount of money spent on tourism in New Jersey and he is right that tourism is a huge generator of revenue for New Jersey businesses,"" Gray said in an e-mail. ""Senator Lautenberg will continue working in Washington to convince his colleagues about the need for disaster relief and to rebuild the state's $38 billion tourism industry.""

How widespread is tourism in New Jersey’s economy?

A 2008 tourism economic impact study shows that the bulk of tourism spending that year -- 33.4 percent -- was in the greater Atlantic City region. The Shore area, from about Monmouth/Ocean counties down to Cape May, was next, at 28.4 percent; Gateway area (northern New Jersey), 21.5 percent; Delaware River region, 9.2 percent; Skylands region (northwestern part of state), 7.4 percent.

New Jersey tourism spending dipped a bit during the recession, but numbers have remained strong, with spending at $38.8 billion, revenues (federal, state and local taxes) at $7.7 billion and tourism-related jobs at 359,000.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Lincoln Chafee']","

Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee says five economic indicators tracked by the federal government were positive in October, for first time since 2006
","
""Are we there yet?""

Anyone who has driven the family to a vacation on Cape Cod has heard that question rise up from the back seats, a plaintive cry for progress as the traffic crawls toward the Bourne Bridge.

After four straight years of unemployment over 9 percent, Rhode Islanders wonder how long their road to economic recovery is going to be. Governor Chafee made the case earlier this month that, though it’s been slow going, the state is making progress.

In a Dec. 1 interview with The Providence Journal about his plans for the state Economic Development Commission, Chafee said the state isn’t getting enough credit for the progress it has made on the economy, particularly this year.

""We're seeing unemployment going in the right direction, for the last six months,"" he said. ""The five economic indicators that the federal government tracks -- for the first time since August 2006 -- were positive this October.""

We weren’t sure which indicators he was talking about or whether they were actually all in positive territory, so we decided to check.

The state and federal governments track the labor market through a variety of statistics. The most commonly watched by the public is the unemployment rate. But other indices are used too.

The numbers don’t always  move in the same direction. Improvement in one can be offset by setbacks in another. For example,  if the size of the workforce goes down but the number of unemployed stays the same, the unemployment rate will go up.

Chafee was touting the five indicators for the month of September (they were released in October, hence his reference to them as October numbers), because the bad numbers (concerning unemployment) all fell and the good numbers (employment) all rose, and all at the same time.

Laura Hart, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Training, said the five federal categories Chafee was referring to are the same key indicators the state tracks, through data approved by the federal Department of Labor.

Here are the indicators for Rhode Island, and how they changed from August to September, as reported by the state DLT:
- The unemployment rate dropped from 10.7 to 10.5 percent
- The number of unemployed people dropped from 59,221 to 58,663
- The number of employed people (at jobs in Rhode Island and nearby states) increased from 495,480 to 499,480
- The total work force (the number of people available to work) went up from 554,701 to 558,143
- The number of in-state jobs went from 456,000 to 459,500 .

The last time those five indices all went in the right direction was from July to August of 2006, when the unemployment rate went from 5.1 to 5 percent.

So Chafee was right.

DLT spokeswoman Laura Hart cautioned that the month-to-month figures are extrapolations from polling of residents and employers and could be revised in March, when employers file tax information.

She compared it to the difference between a poll and an election.

Chafee is not alone in seeing some movement, however slow, in the state’s economic recovery. University of Rhode Island economics Prof. Leonard Lardaro has commented on the underappreciated progress the state is making, but noted that it seems to come in fits and starts.

""While Rhode Island’s economy remained in a recovery, the magnitude of which almost nobody in this state seems to fully comprehend, the pace of that recovery tapered off a bit in September following a very strong August,"" Lardaro wrote in his Rhode Island economics blog Nov. 12.

In a report prepared for the Dec. 6 Fall Economic Outlook Conference hosted by the New England Economic Partnership at Bryant University, Edward M.
