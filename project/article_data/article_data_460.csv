U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta points to each child's share of the national debt
","
U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta’s two children, Colby and Jack, are still years away from college. But, like every other child in the country, they’re already facing thousands of dollars of federal debt, according to the first-term Congressman.

""$50,000,"" Guinta, a Manchester Republican, says in an ad, ""Future,"" released August 21, 2012 on New Hampshire airwaves. ""That's what every child owes today because Washington politicians have run up a huge spending tab and left our kids the bill.""

Of course, children shouldn’t sit at home waiting for the bill to arrive, nor should parents fret about a $50,000 bill coming from the government. No one in Washington is planning to pay downthe country’s debt immediately.

Still, it’s fair to ask if Guinta is on target with his claim.

To support the claim, representatives from Guinta’s campaign led us first to the national debt clock.

This week, the total debt passed the $16 trillion mark. But, as of August 21, when the Guinta campaign released the ad, the figure stood at $15.97 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

The campaign then pointed us to the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates the current population to be 314.3 million.

Doing the simple math shows that, to pay off the total debt, each person would have to pay an average of $50,810, which included children.

This number may look right, but it doesn’t support Guinta’s claim entirely. The first-term Congressman said that each child owes $50,000 to the debt.

According to the Census Bureau, there are currently about 73.9 million children under age 18 in the United States. By that count, each child would have to pay $216,102 to erase the total debt. So if you limit the count to kids, Guinta islowballing the bill.

Still, that number doesn’t paint a full picture of the debt, some analysts said.

Rather than using the total debt figure, which includes both the debt held by the public ($11.18 trillion) and intergovernmental loans ($4.79 trillion), some analysts drew a distinction between the two.

The public debt category includes all debt held by individuals, corporations, state, local and foreign -- in other words, all the money borrowed by the federal government. Meanwhile, the intergovernmental loans includes the money owed to beneficiaries in the future, such as the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare.

The Congressional Budget Office and other federal agencies, typically use the public figure alone.

""At some point, those (Social Security and Medicare) bonds are redeemed, and that money is used to pay benefits, but in terms of the actual fiscal health of the government, it’s just not a useful measure,"" said Howard Gleckman, an analyst with the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, and author of the blog TaxVox.org.

Still, other analysts contend that both the public debt and the total count are useful and appropriate measures, as noted in past PolitiFact rulings dealing with variations of this claim.

In April of 2011, PolitiFact gave former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty a Mostly True ruling on his claim that each child born into the United States inherits a $30,000 share of the debt. Pawlenty’s figure referred to the public debt, which stood at $9.4 trillion at the time. But it also applied to the total debt, which, if spread out to each person in the country left each facing an average debt share of $45,000.

Around the same time, U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, an Ohio Republican, cited the $45,000 number in a video posted to YouTube. PolitiFact ruled the claim True using the total debt figure.  

""Most people use public debt, but total debt is a good measure too,"" said Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institution’s Budgeting for National Priorities Project. ""What difference does it make if debt is owed to the public or to another part of the government? For every dollar you owe, you have to repay it -- and to do so you have to raise a dollar of revenue.""

What’s more, since no one is collecting payment today, it’s difficult to say what share each child, or each person, will bear of the national debt. With interest, the total figure is constantly rising, and the point he’s trying to make could actually be far worse.

Our Ruling:

Guinta’s terminology is clouded. Children alone aren’t paying for the debt, and they certainly don’t owe any money today. But, taking a step back, as the Congressman tries to illustrate the weight of the debt, his numbers are on target as long as they are spread across the entire population, at this moment in time.

To pay off the debt, each person in the country, including children,would have to pay an average of $50,810 -- slightly above Guinta’s $50,000 figure.

We rate his claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD97880>],/factchecks/2012/sep/12/frank-guinta/us-rep-frank-guinta-points-each-childs-share-natio/

Jerry Patterson says Sierra Club sued him to stop Gulf drilling and lost but ‘the turtles are fine’
","
Sea turtles surfaced at the state Republican convention in Fort Worth -- in a speech.

State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said June 9, 2012: ""I have been sued by the Sierra Club. Sued me. They wanted to stop oil and gas exploration, production, on the Texas Gulf Coast,"" he said. ""We won. We’re producing oil and gas, and the turtles are fine.""

We decided to check on the oil and gas and turtles.

Patterson told us by phone that he was referring to a 2002 lawsuit brought by the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club over drilling at the Padre Island National Seashore, the federal park southeast of Corpus Christi on North Padre Island that is a nesting ground for sea turtles including the endangered Kemp’s ridley.

We looked up the case on the U.S. District Court website for the Southern District of Texas, where records show the suit was filed April 18, 2002, and dismissed May 7, 2003. The Sierra Club took the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal Aug. 27, 2003.

The club sued the U.S. secretary of the interior, National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying they had not done enough wildlife impact analysis to comply with federal laws before giving BNP Petroleum of Corpus Christi permission to drill in the park.

When the area became a federal park in 1962, the original private landowners and the state retained the rights to extract and profit from minerals at the site. According to the park’s website, drilling has occurred there since the 1950s. The state’s share of royalties from oil and gas goes into the Texas Permanent School Fund, an endowment established in 1876 to channel income from state lands to Texas public schools.

The Sierra Club lawsuit sought an injunction to halt drilling permits until the defendants complied with the federal laws the club claimed were broken. The district court, however, found that the government had sufficiently investigated the impact of drilling and operation on the turtles, and the appeals court affirmed that decision.

So, was Patterson sued, as he says?

We realized he could not have been one of the parties originally sued in 2002 -- he wasn’t even elected land commissioner until November 2002. Rather, court records and our phone interview with Patterson spokesman Jim Suydam showed that in his role as land commissioner, Patterson filed to intervene in the suit Jan. 14, 2003. After that, according to the court documents and an April 19, 2003, Associated Press news story, Patterson was listed as a defendant in the suit.

According to the appeals court summary, the district court said government had not shirked its duties in estimating the effect drilling would have on the turtles, noting that the Park Service’s March 2001 oil and gas management plan spelled out restrictions and mitigation requirements. The plan’s 16 pages of drilling/production requirements include measures such as having turtle-spotting monitors precede heavy equipment being driven along the beach and shielding light sources so turtles would not become disoriented.

The courts’ dismissals of both the lawsuit and the club’s appeal amounted to victory for the government, or as Patterson said, ""We won.""

And how about those turtles?

Texas’ coast once had many.

According to a news story in the June 2012 issue of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s magazine, canneries nearly wiped out the Texas green turtle population after the Civil War. The department’s website said the turtles were hit hard again from the 1940s to 1960s by people gathering and selling ""truckloads"" of eggs. Today, the story said, the shrimping industry is the biggest threat. Sea turtles must surface to breathe; if they’re trapped below water in a net, they will drown.

""All species in Texas waters — leatherback, hawksbill, loggerhead, green and Kemp’s ridley — are listed as either threatened or endangered,"" the story said. The Parks and Wildlife website said Kemp’s ridleys are the most endangered sea turtle species in the world.

In a U.S.-Mexico program from 1978-88, Kemp’s ridley eggs from a turtle sanctuary in Tamaulipas were brought to Padre to hatch, ""imprinting"" the baby turtles to return there for nesting, according to the story, which also said, ""All along the Texas coast, scientists and advocates have dedicated their careers to sea turtle research and protection.""

According to news stories dating from 2002 through August 2012 that we found using the Nexis news database, since 1996, turtle nest counts on the Texas coast have risen almost every year. Texas’ growing colony of Kemp’s ridleys now serves as a backup of sorts -- if disaster struck the Tamaulipas sanctuary, the species might not be wiped out.

Carole Allen, Gulf office director with the nonprofit Sea Turtle Restoration Project, told us by email that she believes the major reasons for rising turtle numbers are increased protection of the turtles in Tamaulipas and the requirement of turtle excluder devices on U.S. shrimp boats. The devices, called TEDs, provide a grill of bars in a trawl net that large sea creatures can fit through; shrimpers, however, sometimes sew nets together again to counteract that escape hatch.

In its 2002 lawsuit, the Sierra Club described ways that oil and gas operations could harm turtles, but included no measurement of harm occurring. We checked with the club’s lead volunteer in the lawsuit, Pat Suter, who chairs the Corpus Christi chapter. She told us by phone, ""As far as I know, there has not been direct impact on the turtles that can be proved.""

Sierra said in its suit that trucks traveling to and from the well site would threaten turtles. The news articles we reviewed included no reports of turtles hurt or discouraged from nesting by oil and gas rigs, trucks, drilling or pumping at the federal park. Separately, an April 15, 2004, ""white paper"" on the park’s website said, ""There has been vehicle traffic, from both visitors and heavy equipment operators, on the Gulf of Mexico shoreline for over fifty years with no documented case of a crushing of a nesting sea turtle within the park.""

Allen told us, ""My personal opinion is that everything is being done to protect nesting sea turtles and hatchlings from being run over at the National Seashore. Kemp's ridleys are in far more danger from law-breaking shrimpers.""

As we closed out this check, Suydam conceded that Patterson was not sued by the Sierra Club.

""It looks like Commissioner Patterson misspoke there,"" Suydam said. ""He intervened in the Sierra Club's lawsuit, and then became a defendant."" Still, Suydam said, ""The sentiment is true. When the Sierra Club sues to stop oil and gas exploration, it is in effect suing to limit oil and gas production on Permanent School Fund lands,"" which is Patterson’s responsibility.

Our ruling

The Sierra Club did not sue Patterson; he wasn’t quite land commissioner when the group filed its suit against federal agencies.

Still, he later joined the lawsuit, which the government won. And, despite ongoing oil and gas activity at the park in accord with the 1962 terms, Texas’ threatened and endangered sea turtles are increasing in numbers.

President Obama 'built' nation's $16 trillion debt, GOP Rep. Reid Ribble says
","
When President Barack Obama said ""If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that,"" he meant that success in business was the result of government, not hard-working people, according to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

In late July 2012, PolitiFact National rated the claim False, saying Romney took Obama’s words out of context. But barely a month later, the Republican National Convention was replete with referencesto Obama’s ""you didn’t build that"" comment.

Among those sounding the theme from the Tampa, Fla., gathering was U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., a first-term congressman serving the Green Bay area.

During an Aug. 30, 2012 interview, Ribble and Jerry Bader, host of a conservative radio talk show on WTAQ-AM and -FM in Green Bay, talked for several minutes about the Obama comment. The interview was done the day after U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney’s running mate, spoke to the convention.

Ribble said: ""What the president did build, though -- and (Ryan) talked about this last night -- is he built this $16 trillion debt. He did build that.""

Wait. All of it?

At first glance, Ribble’s claim may appear way off. But let’s examine the numbers.

How much we owe

We checked the U.S. Treasury Department’s ""debt to the penny"" meter for the day Ribble made his statement. The debt was a few hairs under $16 trillion, although it crossed that threshold several days later.

We then spun the meter back to Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama’s inauguration. The debt was $10.6 trillion.  

That means debt rose $5.4 trillion under Obama -- about one-third of the $16 trillion total.

By saying Obama ""built this $16 trillion debt. He did build that,"" Ribble suggested Obama was responsible for the entire amount.

Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson disagreed, saying it’s obvious the $16 trillion accumulated over many years. Her boss’ point, she said, was that it reached $16 trillion because of Obama.

But even if that was what Ribble meant in blaming Obama, he cited the $16 trillion debt figure, not the roughly $5 trillion accumulated during his presidency.

Obama’s role

As for what role Obama played in the accumulation of debt, Olson cited a number of news articles about how much debt and spending increased during Obama's time as president. Let’s look at two of them.

1. ""Obama is the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents""

That line is from PolitiFact National, although it is a bit dated. It’s from May 2011, when our colleagues rated as Pants on Firea claim by then-U.S. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that Obama ""increased the debt"" 16 percent while President George W. Bush raised it 115 percent.

In saying Obama was the debt king among the last five presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan, PolitiFact National found that under one measure -- debt as a percentage of gross national product -- Obama ranked highest. As of December 2010, the ratio under Obama had risen nearly 22 percentage points; Reagan was second at 14.9.

(However, using raw numbers, our colleagues found that at the time, the debt had increased by 34 percent, or $3.66 trillion, under Obama -- well below the 86 percent increase, or a total of $4.9 trillion, under George W. Bush.)

2. Obama budgets and spending up each year

A May 2012 analysis by The Washington Post Fact Checker found that Obama's budgets have increased each year, from $3.27 trillion in 2009 to $3.65 trillion in 2012; and that Obama proposed more in spending each year than Congress ultimately approved.

So, the debt has increased significantly under Obama. But, despite Ribble’s claim, the responsibility goes far beyond the White House.

Other factors

When Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said at the GOP convention that $5 trillion in debt had been added over the past four years, PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly True. Our colleagues pointed out that while the figure was on target, the blame is bipartisan. Democrats had majorities in the Senate and House for two years of Obama’s presidency, but Republicans have controlled the House since January 2011. Moreover, our colleagues noted, much of the debt stems from entitlement spending policies that were set under past presidents and Congresses.

PolitiFact Ohio made similar points in June 2012 when it rated as Half True a statement by Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, that debt under Obama had risen $5 trillion -- more than any other president.

Our Buckeye colleagues noted that although Obama approved the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt, Obama’s administration has cited decisions made under GOP President George W. Bush -- including tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Medicare prescription drug program -- as major contributors to the debt.

Our rating

Ribble said Obama ""built this $16 trillion debt."" His spokeswoman said Ribble meant that the debt had reached that level because of Obama.

But Ribble used the $16 trillion figure, not the roughly $5 trillion that the debt has increased under Obama. Moreover, the debt grew not only due to Obama’s actions, but those taken by present and past presidents and Congresses.

We rate Ribble’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7B8B00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/12/reid-ribble/president-obama-built-nations-16-trillion-debt-gop/
"['New Jersey', 'Federal Budget', 'Leonard Lance']","
Congressman Leonard Lance claims the U.S. Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years
","
In more than three years, the U.S. Senate has not passed a good budget or a bad budget -- it hasn’t passed any budget at all, according to U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance.

The Republican congressman made that point during a recent TV interview in response to a question regarding the budget proposal put forth by Wisconsin congressman and Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan.

""I think it’s an honest proposal and Paul Ryan would be an adult at the table regarding issues of importance, including preserving Medicare,"" Lance said in a Sept. 5 interview on NJToday. ""The Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years, not a good budget, not a bad budget, no budget.""

The federal government has continued to spend money, but Lance is right that the Senate has not passed a ""budget resolution"" in more than three years. That resolution represents the congressional budget plan, serving as a blueprint for federal fiscal policies.

Our PolitiFact colleagues have fact-checked similar claims before and, depending on the wording, those statements have landed at different points on the Truth-O-Meter.

First, let’s explain more about the congressional budget process.

The House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that covers the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years. By itself, a budget resolution does not actually spend money, but instead serves as the framework for appropriations bills and other subsequent legislation dealing with budgetary matters.

The federal government doesn’t shut down in the absence of a budget resolution, since Congress has taken other steps to spend money and set certain budgetary guidelines.

Still, not adopting a budget resolution means Congress has not fulfilled its duties as part of the official budget process to lay out a plan for future budgetary decisions.

To back up Lance’s claim, his chief of staff, Todd Mitchell, pointed out in an e-mail how the Senate last passed a budget resolution on April 29, 2009. A report by the Congressional Research Service confirms Mitchell’s point.

On that date, the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year 2010, marking the last such plan approved by Congress.

The Senate has not passed budget resolutions for fiscal years 2011, 2012 or 2013. The GOP-controlled House passed budget resolutions for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, but they were rejected by the Democrat-led Senate. Fiscal year 2013 starts Oct. 1.

But the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has countered that the Budget Control Act of 2011 is meant to serve as the budget for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Enacted in August 2011, that legislation included provisions to raise the nation's debt ceiling and also set caps on certain types of future discretionary spending for 10 years.

""I just say to you, a budget is a limitation on spending. The Budget Control Act contained very clear limitations on spending for 2012 and 2013. So when our friends say there’s been no budget passed by this body, oh yes, there has,"" Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND), the committee chairman, said Monday on the Senate floor. ""There’s been a budget passed for 2012, one for 2013. Instead of a resolution, it was done in a law.""

However, while the Budget Control Act includes some features of a budget resolution, it lacks others, according to federal budget experts.

William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in an e-mail that ""a completed budget is expected to do much more than set spending levels for discretionary programs.""

""By that standard, the congressman is correct,"" Galston added, referring to Lance. ""The 2011 BCA kept the government open, but it didn’t constitute a full budget.""

Roy Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, agreed in an e-mail: ""The BCA is not a budget: a plan for the use of the government's financial resources.""

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Lance claimed: ""The Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years, not a good budget, not a bad budget, no budget.""

The congressman’s claim is solid, given that the Senate has not passed a budget resolution since April 29, 2009. Congress has taken other steps to spend federal dollars and set certain budgetary guidelines, but that resolution represents a plan to guide future budgetary decisions.

We rate the statement True.

"['Elections', 'Texas', 'Gilberto Hinojosa']","
Gilberto Hinojosa says if a Democrat carries Texas, California and New York for president, it's ""mathematically impossible"" for a Republican to prevail nationally
","
Talking up the importance of Texas turning blue, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party said at the Democratic National Convention that if Texas voted for Democratic presidential nominees, the combination of its electoral votes with those of California and New York mean ""it would be mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect a president.""

Hinojosa’s comment came to our attention in a news article on Hinojosa’s work for the party in the Sept. 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman.

Two days earlier, a news story in the San Antonio Express-News quoted Hinojosa along similar lines. After saying a Texas Democrat has not won statewide since 1994, it said: ""But the growing Latino population is expected to tip the Lone Star State from Republican to Democratic by the end of the decade,"" meaning Texas would shift to preferring Democratic presidential nominees, the story said. ""If Texas becomes a blue state, it will become blue because of the Hispanic vote,"" Hinojosa was quoted as saying. ""And the day that Texas becomes blue, it becomes mathematically impossible for Republicans to elect the president of the United States.""

Really?

We made a run at testing Hinojosa’s statement as noted by the Austin newspaper.

Nationally, it takes 270 of the country’s 538 electoral votes to win the presidency, as spelled out on a federal website devoted to the Electoral College. If the 38 electoral votes of Texas, 55 votes of California and 29 of New York flow to the Democratic nominee, he or she would have 122, leaving 416 votes unclaimed.

So the Republican nominee would need to win 270, or 65 percent, of those remaining votes.

That’s not mathematically impossible.

We failed to reach Hinojosa.

But Bill Brannon, the Texas party's executive director, suggested Hinojosa’s point is that if a Democratic presidential nominee carries each of the states, it becomes nigh impossible for a Republican to prevail. ""What ends up happening is there is no coalition out there that creates a path to victory for a Republican candidate,"" Brannon said by phone. ""In the current political environment, it is fair to say that it’s beyond highly improbable that any path to victory would exist for a Republican presidential nominee."" The party’s deputy director, Jacob Limón, later made a similar point.

For outside perspective, we turned to Allan Keiter, the founder of the 270towin website, which features an interactive Electoral College map for 2012 as well as information on past elections and a reminder that presidential candidates can win without winning a majority of the national vote: ""Since electoral votes are generally allocated on an ‘all or none’ basis by state, the election of a U.S president is about winning the popular vote in enough states... It is not about getting the most overall popular votes.""

By telephone, Keiter said that mathematically speaking, Hinojosa’s claim is incorrect. If a Democrat carried Texas, California and New York, he said, a Republican still could win. Broadly, he said by email, the ""minimum number of states needed to reach 270 (electoral votes) is 11.""

Then again, Keiter said, in the context of how voters in the states lately lean, such a claim has verve. 
That is, with California and New York considered Democratic territory, he said, if voters in Republican-leaning Texas preferred the Democratic nominee, President Barack Obama, he would likely pile up 239 electoral votes -- presuming the other states choose one candidate or the other as polls were signaling as of early September 2012.

For Romney to prevail, Keiter said, he would then have to a goodly share of the 11 remaining ""battleground"" states. Those states are, west to east, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire and Florida. (Obama carried each one in 2008.)

And ""practically speaking, since Texas would likely only go to the Democrat in a landslide, most of these other states would also likely be blue,"" Keiter wrote.

Separately, we reached Elchanan Mossel, a professor of Statistics and Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley who has compared the risks of the Electoral College method resulting in errors affecting the winner of the race as opposed to simply tabulating total votes nationwide.

Mossel emailed that Hinojosa’s comment ""is not correct on the math,"" and even ""nonsense."" 
He added later that he would prefer to characterize the Republican's chances under the chairman's described scenario as ""extremely unlikely."" The Democrat's statement, he said, indicates ""some assumptions are being made.""

Our ruling

Hinojosa said that if Texas, California and New York all backed the Democratic presidential nominee, it would be mathematically impossible for the Republican nominee to win.

Mathematically speaking, that is incorrect.

A case can be framed for the notion that if a Democrat carried the three states, he or she would hold a commanding position. Maybe, but that also assumes that many states would stay politically fixed one way or the other through the indefinite future based on voters' current leanings -- ""ifs"" that are, at the least, open to debate and speculation. 
All told, regardless, Hinojosa put no qualifiers on his statement. We rate it as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCF7480>],/factchecks/2012/sep/12/gilberto-hinojosa/gilberto-hinojosa-says-if-democrat-carries-texas-c/
"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'American Civil Liberties Union']","
Voter ID laws, poll tax not equivalent
","
Voter identification laws, such as the one implemented in Georgia in 2007, have become a hot-button election issue.

On one side, supporters have said the laws requiring voters to present some sort of government-approved -- and many times government-issued -- photo identification to vote are needed to prevent voter fraud. The GOP even included support of voter ID laws in its party platform adopted last month in Tampa during the Republican National Convention.

On the other side, civil liberties and civil rights groups have said the laws lead to disenfranchisement of voters, particularly minority and older voters, by obstructing their voting rights.

The American Civil Liberties Union has been one of the staunchest opponents of the voter ID laws, and it has repeatedly published information suggesting the laws suppress voting.

But the voter suppression argument has not always been found to be accurate. A study of Georgia election data conducted this month by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, for example, found that participation among black voters rose by 44 percent from 2006 — before the law was implemented — to 2010. For Hispanics, the increase for the same period was 67 percent. Turnout among whites rose 12 percent. Even when African-American participation fell in 2010 after President Barack Obama’s 2008 election, a far greater share of black voters turned out in 2010 than in 2006, showing that Obama was not the only factor driving turnout.

In its Summer 2012 edition of the Civil Liberties newsletter, the ACLU notes that ""Since the 2008 election, more than 30 states have introduced laws that make it harder to cast a ballot. ... What’s more, most of these laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID, essentially instituting a modern-day poll tax.""

Statistics about the voter ID laws have been repeated by people on both sides of the issue. But we wondered just much how of a dent does obtaining government identification make in the wallets of voters? Are the laws too complicated, and do they make it expensive to vote? And are the laws tantamount to a modern-day poll tax?

The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that 33 states currently have voter ID laws, with varying criteria and accepted forms of documentation. 
The ACLU’s newsletter also reports that 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens and 8 percent of white voting-age citizens lack government-issued photo IDs. The article also said these new voting laws were crafted to recast voting as a ""privilege"" reserved for certain segments of the population. 
PolitiFact has previously checked claims by several politicos, including Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., using statistics from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law about citizens lacking the government-issued photo IDs that were also cited by the ACLU. Both claims rated Mostly True. 
The ACLU newsletter labeled the new voter ID requirements as a ""modern day poll tax.""
The historical poll tax emerged in parts of the U.S. in the late 1800s as a blatant effort to restrict voting. Primarily aimed at minorities, these laws -- along with literacy tests -- disenfranchised many black, Native American and poor white citizens. The poll tax was outlawed in federal elections in 1964.

The poll tax portion of the ACLU claim, as a historical comparison, does not hold up.

But the organization’s claim about the cost to voters is much tougher to evaluate.

Some states, such as Georgia, which was among the first to implement voter ID laws, make it free for residents to obtain the government IDs and don’t require them for absentee voting.

DMV Answers, a for-profit website, reported that for residents, the cost of getting a state-issued photo ID varies. On the low end, the IDs cost $5 in states such as Delaware, Iowa, Maine, South Carolina and West Virginia; while costs can reach as much as $33.50 in Oregon. Most of the states’ ID costs are at the lower end, ranging from $10 to $15, according to the site. 
In May, PolitiFact reviewed a claim by U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings that requests made to some Florida residents to submit proof of citizenship amounted to a ""backdoor poll tax"" because they had to buy a stamp to mail in the documents. Although experts said any election procedure that requires voters to incur some type of financial costs could be coined a poll tax, actual poll taxes were unaffordable to the African-Americans they affected. The Florida request was seen more as an inconvenience, and the claim received a Half True rating. 
Whether states offer the ID for a nominal fee or free of charge, there is still a cost, said Randolph McLaughlin, a professor at Pace Law School in New York who specializes in voting rights litigation and has argued several civil rights cases.
""What do you need to get the ID? You have to prove who you are, so in some states you have to get a birth certificate and birth certificates cost money,"" McLaughlin said. ""You have to pay to get a piece of paper to get the government-issued ID, and because the places that issue the ID have the same operating hours that most people work, you may have to miss work to get this card for a problem that doesn’t exist."" 
The claim that the voter ID laws are the functional equivalent of a poll tax is difficult to prove. 
""The U.S. Supreme Court has not definitely settled this debate, although its 2008 decision in the Indiana voter ID case suggests that the poll tax claim faces an uphill battle,"" said Edward Foley, executive director of an election law center at The Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law. 
In that case, the high court found that Indiana’s requirement that voters present government-issued photo IDs did not violate the Constitution. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the main opinion in the 6-3 ruling, which said, ""The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process."" 
That brings us back to the claim that voter ID laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID. 
Many states with these laws do incur some costs, but the costs vary greatly from state to state. The costs to voters to obtain the IDs also vary. In some states, the cost for the ID is free, but accompanying documents necessary to receive those free IDs can cost money and take time to get. That’s more an inconvenience than a hindrance.

Rob Portman says the national debt in $1 bills would cover all of Ohio
","
The U.S. government has carried debt since 1790, according to the Treasury Department, but the national debt didn't top $1 trillion until 1982.

When it hit $16 trillion for the first time on Sept. 4, 2012, Sen. Rob Portman called it ""a dangerous milestone"" and ""troubling evidence that our nation is headed in the wrong direction.""

In an attempt to put $16 trillion in terms everyday people can get their arms around, he also released a list of items showing how that much money stacks up -- such as ""$16 trillion in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.""

Sixteen trillion is a lot of kapusta -- but is it enough to carpet the countryside and turn Ohio green? Just for fun, PolitiFact Ohio decided to survey the landscape

That would cover Ohio's total area of 44,825 square miles 1.42 times -- or nearly 1.5 times.

Would a proposed casino in Wood Village be the country’s largest?
","
One of the priciest state measure campaigns this fall will be over a proposed private casino in Wood Village in population-rich Multnomah County.Supporters of the state’s first non-tribal casino say it would provide money for schools as well a nearby entertainment center for the family. A similar idea failed with voters two years ago.

A coalition of critics calling itself the It's Still a Bad Idea committee called an inaugural press event on Monday to denounce what it calls a ""slick campaign"" by casino advocates to ""mislead voters,"" according to a press release. The campaign is funded largely by Oregon tribes, which operate their own casinos and could lose money to the private venture.

At the event, campaign spokeswoman Cynara Lilly told reporters that The Grange, as it’s called, ""would be the largest casino in the United States.""

Really? In little old Wood Village? That didn’t sound right. Maybe it would be the largest in Oregon, but we knew enough about mega-casinos to know that sounded overblown.

First, we checked with Lilly, to make sure we had quoted her correctly. We had, but she wanted to make a clarification. ""I did mis-speak,"" she said to PolitiFact Oregon. ""Technically, this would not be the largest casino in the United States. It would be the second largest. It would be the largest in the West.""

She specified not square footage, but the number of slot machines and gambling tables. That still sounded on the high side. The Grange proposes a 130,000 square-foot casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 gambling tables. That would top the number of video slot machines at Oregon’s largest tribal casino -- the Grand Ronde’s Spirit Mountain Casino-- but 2,200 is pretty much the norm for the big players in Las Vegas. So what gives?

And here’s where we get to the fine print.

The Grange developers have a business plan for a casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 card tables, but the language in Measure 83 would allow for up to 3,500 slot machines and 150 gaming tables. (Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for Grange developers, said they will build the proposed amount as that’s what the market will bear and they don’t anticipate that changing.)

A 3,500-machine casino would be larger than the posh Bellagio in Las Vegas, which has more than 100,000 square feet with 2,400 slot machines. Or Mandalay Bay in Vegas, which has more than 2,000 slot machines.

But it would pale next to the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, which has 6,000 slot machines, and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Tampa, Fla., which ""features more than 5,000 slot machines, 110 table games and 50 poker tables."" The WinStar World Casino in Oklahoma has 500,000 square feet of ""gaming floor"" with about 6,700 electronic games and 76 tables. You get the point.

Many of these mega-casinos are in the midwest and in the east, so Lilly is on the rightish track when she tells PolitiFact Oregon that a Wood Village casino with 3,500 slot machines would be the largest casino on the West Coast. Certainly it would contain more than twice the floor size of Spirit Mountain Casino.

Here’s the problem with that: (1) That’s not what she said at the press event, which was called to counter what they call a deceptive campaign waged by casino advocates, and (2) Grange developers aren’t building a casino with 3,500 video poker machines and 150 card tables.

We know! Some of you are probably thinking, how could PolitiFact Oregon be so naive? How could we be so gullible? What’s to stop the private casino people from pitching a smaller casino, then building a larger one? Well, all we can say is that developers would still have to get local permits to build a casino with more slot machines and, according to one legal reading, legislators can change the statutory maximum.

In any case, casino opponents are right to call out the larger numbers in the measure. Voters should have that information. But we can’t measure a proposed casino on the maximum number allowed when backers are selling a smaller number. PolitiFact Florida had the same issue in 2011 and fact checkers there went with the developer’s stated number when assessing a claim about a proposed 800,000 square-foot casino in Miami.

We follow precedent and go with what the developers say, and we return to the statement.

Campaigns bear a special responsibility when making statements for or against anything. They have to have their facts straight, and they have to know what they’re talking about. We understand that people sometimes slip, but campaign people can’t afford to do that. Especially when they have called a press conference to counter deceptive campaigning by the other side.

Lilly said that the proposed casino in Wood Village would be the largest in the country, which is not only inaccurate, but downright ridiculous. Her revised statement that the proposed casino would be the second largest in the country isn’t even close to accurate either. That shows a reckless disregard for accuracy.

We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB3B480>],/factchecks/2012/sep/11/its-still-bad-idea/would-proposed-casino-wood-village-be-countrys-lar/

Paul Ryan says Romney has always supported 2014 Afghanistan withdrawal
","
With Mitt Romney taking heat for not mentioning Afghanistan in his convention speech, vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan sought to clarify the Republican plan for ending America’s longest war.

President Barack Obama increased troops there in 2010 in order to overwhelm al-Qaida and strengthen and train Afghan security forces. The drawdown of that troop surge began this summer. Obama plans a full withdrawal -- and an end to the war -- in 2014.

That’s one point where Ryan said the Republican ticket agrees with Obama.

""We've always said that we agree with the 2014 deadline.  We've always agreed with where we are headed on Afghanistan on 2014,"" Ryan said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 9, 2012. ""But where we've taken issue is making sure that the generals on the ground get the resources they need throughout the entire fighting season so that they can keep our soldiers safe and operating counterinsurgency strategy. And I fear that this is not what's happening. I fear that there have been more political decisions made in troop strengths during this fighting season.

""And so we beg to differ with the president on parts of his Afghanistan policy. But we support the 2014 deadline.""

The end of the decade long conflict is a key point in the fight against terrorism, and Democrats have criticized Romney for waffling on Afghanistan. We thought we’d check Romney's past statements and see if he’s consistently agreed with the timetable set by his opponent.

What he said

One of last year’s Republican primary debates focused on national security. There, Romney expressed clear support for the 2014 deadline.

""The timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, other than a small footprint of support forces,"" he said in the Nov. 13, 2011, debate.

More recently, at a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, Romney again said it’s his goal ""to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.""

But he also added, as he has numerous other times, that he would ""evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders"" when making decisions about American troops.

A few days later, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked if that was a shift in position.

""No, it's the same posture I've had all along,"" Romney said, ""which is that I believe that the right target for us is to withdraw our troops by the end of 2014. At the same time in the speech I gave at the VFW, I said I would however also want to consult with commanders on the ground to make sure that that time line was still the appropriate time line and that is something, which I will continue to point out.""

An interview he gave on PBS NewsHour in October 2011 also indicated a soft commitment to the 2014 timetable. Host Judy Woodruff said, ""There is an agreement between NATO, the United States and Afghanistan that all foreign troops would be out by 2014. If you're president, would you abide by that agreement?""

Romney answered: ""I would listen to the generals. And if that continues to be the view of the ... commanders in the field as they assess the capabilities of the Afghan military, then of course I would pursue that course."" 
It's clear that Ryan was speaking for the Romney/Ryan ticket in his This Week interview. But we also looked for his own comments on the war. An op-ed, written shortly after he visited Afghanistan, reflected general support for the 2014 timetable while leaving open the possibility of a longer-term commitment: 
""A transition plan is in place for Afghan forces to take control of the country's security in 2014,"" Ryan wrote. ""Even as we work toward that point, it is important to remember that our nation's commitment to Afghanistan isn't likely to end there. Our nation's troops and resources will continue to support the Afghan people for years to come - not to engage in nation-building, but to mitigate the risk posed by the region's extremists to our own national security."" 
An even earlier withdrawal?

At times, Romney has suggested a pullout might be possible before 2014.

At a June debate in New Hampshire:

""It's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, consistent with the word that comes to our generals that we can hand the country over to the ... Afghan military to defend themselves from the Taliban.""

And at an August town hall, also in New Hampshire:

""I will do everything in my power to transition from our military to their military as soon as possible, bring our men and women home and do so in a way consistent with our mission, which is to keep Afghanistan from being overrun by a new entity that would allow Afghanistan to be a launching point for terror again like it was on 9/11.""

Criticizing Obama

Romney has offered scant agreement with anything else Obama has done on the war front.

His most pointed criticism centered on the 2014 deadline, but Romney objected to Obama’s public announcement of the withdrawal date, not the date itself.

In his speech announcing his current White House run, Romney said it was ""wrong"" to announce a withdrawal date.

When Defense Secretary Leon Panetta laid out a plan in early 2012 for the transition of U.S. troops from a combat role to a support role, Romney’s condemnation was harsh.

""He announced that. So the Taliban hears it, the Pakistanis hear it, the Afghan leaders hear it,"" Romney said. ""Why in the world do you go to the people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops? It makes absolutely no sense.""

""His naivete is putting in jeopardy the mission of the United States of America and our commitments to freedom,"" he said. ""He is wrong. We need new leadership in Washington.""

The Obama campaign counters that Romney’s plans for Afghanistan lack specificity, a complaint we noted in several stories, including from some Republicans.

Our ruling

Ryan claimed that he and Romney have ""always agreed"" with the 2014 timetable for withdrawing from Afghanistan.

We found numerous instances where Romney expressed support for that deadline. His criticism was not of the date itself but the announcement of it, which he said emboldened the Taliban and endangered troops.

But Romney also has said a troop withdrawal would be conditional on what the situation on the ground is -- an important caveat that could leave him room to ignore the deadline.

Ryan’s statement was accurate but for that one detail. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7D6E00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-romney-has-always-supported-2014-af/

Taking ""In God We Trust"" off coins was debunked years ago
","
On the campaign trail recently, Mitt Romney brought up an issue that sounded familiar to us: the question of whether ""In God We Trust"" has been removed from U.S. coins.

Appearing in Virginia Beach, Va., on Sept. 8, 2012, Romney recited the Pledge of Allegiance, then continued, ""The promises that were made in that pledge are promises I plan on keeping if I'm president, and I've kept them so far in my life. That pledge says ‘under God.’ I will not take ‘God’ out of the name of our platform. I will not take ‘God’ off our coins and I will not take God out of my heart.""

The focus on God invoked the Democrats’ recent decision -- later reversed -- to remove ""God"" from the party’s official platform at the Democratic National Convention.

President Barack Obama’s campaign took Romney’s comment as a veiled dig at the president. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki fired back, ""Look, this is nothing more than a desperate attack based on a false premise by the Romney team and its sad that the debate has been driven to this level of discourse. The president believes as much that God should be taken off a coin as he does that aliens will attack Florida. It’s an absurd question to be raised.""

Because Romney in Virginia Beach didn’t directly accuse President Barack Obama of removing ""In God We Trust"" from the nation’s coins, we won’t put his comment to the Truth-O-Meter. But since the issue has emerged in the presidential campaign, we will instead return to the question of ""In God We Trust"" and coins, which we originally fact-checked in 2010 regarding a chain email.

The original chain email never really went away. A reader forwarded it to PolitiFact for fact-checking as recently as Aug. 28, 2012, just days before Romney’s speech in Virginia Beach.

As we wrote in 2010, the email has the standard ingredients of an Internet falsehood -- sloppy punctuation, an abundance of exclamation points, a plausible story (""I received one from the Post Office as change and I asked for a dollar bill instead""), a request to spread the email far and wide (""Please send to all on your mailing list!!!"") and screaming capital letters (""'IN GOD WE TRUST' IS GONE!!!"") .

The people forwarding the email included some snarky comments such as ""Don't know anything about this, but it does not surprise me. Typical of todays (sic) government.""

A Google search revealed that the email had been debunked long before by FactCheck.org and by Snopes.com.

The use of ""In God We Trust"" on coins dates to the Civil War era, though the phrase only became the nation’s official motto in 1956, and began appearing on paper currency (as well as all coins) after that. While the use of the motto on money has been broadly popular -- a 2003 Gallup poll found 90 percent approval among the public -- it has also been the target of occasional lawsuits citing the separation of church and state. The best-known case concerning ""In God We Trust"" and money was filed by church-state-separation activist Michael Newdow. It was argued in 2007 and rejected in 2010 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In recent years, the U.S. Mint has produced several series of dollar coins. A Native American series originated in 2000 with the Sacagawea Golden Dollar and was succeeded by a broader Native American series, also featuring Sacagawea, in 2009. The presidential series began in 2007, releasing four coins a year to honor deceased U.S. presidents in chronological order.

The chain email included a picture of a hand holding a dollar coin with a picture of President George Washington, so we’ll focus on that series.

The law that authorized the coins called for the U.S. president to be on the front, the Statue of Liberty on the back, and, on the edge of the coin, the year of minting as well as the inscriptions ""E Pluribus Unum"" and ""In God We Trust.""

The placement of ""In God We Trust"" quickly became controversial. In May 2007, a bill was introduced in the House that would require ""In God We Trust"" to appear on a face of the presidential dollar coins rather than the edge. That bill ultimately attracted 101 co-sponsors, all of them Republican (including Romney’s vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan). ""Once you start turning your back on the good Lord, I think you are going to reap the whirlwind, and this is something this nation cannot afford to do right now,"" said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., in a floor speech urging the coinage change.

Romney himself joined the chorus on Sept. 22, 2007, in remarks at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in Mackinac Island, Mich.

""We recognize the hand of the Creator in the founding of our nation,"" Romney said. ""We will fight to keep the words ‘under God’ in the Pledge of Allegiance. Have you seen the new dollar coin? ‘In God We Trust’ has been moved. It's not on the face of the coin anymore, it's on the edge -- virtually invisible, just like the (American Civil Liberties Union) wants Him to be. I will go to work to get God back on the front of our coin.""

The critics won the day. In December 2007, President George W. Bush signed a law that specified that ""In God We Trust"" appear on either the front or back of the coin rather than on the edge. That took effect with coins minted in 2009. Since then, each of the coins in the presidential series has had ""In God We Trust"" inscribed on the front. (In 2011, the White House stopped circulating new presidential dollar coins, citing large reserves of uncirculated coins; smaller numbers, with ""In God We Trust"" still on the front, continue to be produced to satisfy demand from collectors.)

""In God We Trust"" also appears on the front of the Sacagawea and Native American dollars. You can see ""In God We Trust"" on the presidential, Sacagawea and American Indian dollars.

We should note, that it is possible -- though extremely rare -- to find one of the original 2007 coins without the ""In God We Trust"" side inscription. According to a 2007 Associated Press story, due to what the U.S. Mint called complications in the quality-control process, ""an unknown number"" of new George Washington dollar coins were mistakenly produced without their edge inscriptions, including ""In God We Trust."" In a March 2007 press release, the U.S. Mint wrote that these coins were released inadvertently, and that it ""understands the importance of the inscriptions 'In God We Trust' and 'E Pluribus Unum,' as well as the mint mark and year on U.S. coinage. An expert who follows coin collecting estimated more than 50,000 coins were mistakenly minted that way.

But that was a small fraction of the 300 million coins produced by 2007, and it was not done on purpose. 
Our ruling

As we noted, we are not judging Romney’s comment in Virginia here, since he was not explicitly blaming Obama for the status of ""In God We Trust"" on money. But the chain email that continues to circulate was wrong in 2010 (except for the rare coins mistakenly minted with no inscriptions) and it remains wrong now. As we did two years ago, we find the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE3F700>],/factchecks/2012/sep/11/chain-email/taking-god-we-trust-coins-was-debunked-years-ago/

Kal Penn thanks Obama for ""doubling funding for the Pell Grant""
","
Sandwiched between Kal Penn’s laugh lines during his Democratic National Convention speech -- including his appeal for viewers to include ""#sexyface"" in their tweets about his remarks -- were claims about President Barack Obama’s accomplishments.

""Now, I've worked on a lot of fun movies, but my favorite job was having a boss who gave the order to take out bin Laden, and who's cool with all of us getting gay-married. So thank you, invisible man in the chair, for that,"" he said, referencing Clint Eastwood’s off-the-cuff remarks to an empty chair at the Republican National Convention. ""And for giving my friends access to affordable health insurance and doubling funding for the Pell Grant.""

Penn, the Harold and Kumar star who spent a couple years in the White House Office of Public Engagement, was among several speakers who praised Obama for doubling the Pell Grant.

The grant program is a popular, 40-year-old federal subsidy for middle- and low-income students that does not have to be repaid. A person’s eligibility is determined by several factors, including how much money his or her family makes.

Penn’s claim that Pell Grants have doubled is true, in terms of expenditures.

In the 2008-09 academic year, Pell Grant expenditures were about $18 billion. In 2011-12, expenditures are $36 billion.

While funding has doubled, the number of students who receive Pell Grants has increased more slowly. In 2008, the grants assisted 6.1 million students, while in 2012, 9.7 million students received aid, an increase of 59 percent.

Experts point to a few factors to explain increased Pell spending: more people going to or returning to college because of the recession and more people in need of grants because of the recession.

Some recipients are receiving larger awards. Four years ago, the maximum Pell Grant award was $4,731, according to the Department of Education. The max has been $5,550 since 2010. It’s expected to increase to $5,635 in the 2013-14 academic year and will rise in line with inflation through 2017.

""Absolutely, (Obama)’s made it a priority,"" said Robert Moran, director of federal relations at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.

Still, the feds have tinkered with the program’s eligibility as a way to reduce some of the costs. Moran said he’s seen projections that say more than 100,000 students didn’t qualify for grants because of these changes.

Students used to be eligible for a second Pell Grant, known as a ""summer Pell,"" to help them accelerate their degree year-round. This short-lived program was cut as part of the appropriations bill passed in April 2011.

And HR 2055, which Obama signed in December, maintains the maximum award through 2013 but makes several changes to reduce $10 billion in spending over the next decade.For example, the law reduced the maximum number of full-time semesters of eligibility from 18 semesters to 12.

Plus, the grant covers less than it did a decade ago. According to The College Board, it helped with 42 percent of a student’s average tuition, fees, and room and board at public four-year colleges and universities in 2001-02. That fell to 32 percent in 2011-12.

Advocates of the Pell Grant like the expansion but worry about the program’s budget shortfalls and what cuts it may face as lawmakers seek to reduce the deficit.

Our ruling

Kal Penn correctly stated Obama doubled funding for the Pell Grant. It’s true Obama has made maintaining the maximum award for these grants a priority over his tenure, and the result has been a whole lot more spending. To help pay for this spending, though, the federal government has changed some of the program’s eligibility requirements, so that it’s more difficult to get the grants. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says, ""We've doubled our use of renewable energy""
","
During an appearance in Seminole, Fla., on Sept. 8, 2012, President Barack Obama touted the nation’s achievements in expanding the use of renewable energy.

""I’ve got a plan to control more of our own energy,"" Obama said. ""After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. That will save you money. It will help the environment. We’ve doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans now have jobs building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries.""

The line about renewable energy was identical to a line in Obama’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

We wondered whether Obama was correct that we’ve ""doubled our use of renewable energy.""

We began by asking the Obama campaign to back up the claim. A spokeswoman cited three statistics from the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that collects energy data.

• Net electricity generation from wind, which more than doubled between 2008 and 2011.

• Net electricity generation from solar has more than doubled over the same period.

• During the first five months of 2012, the United States has produced more electricity from wind than it did in all of 2008.

We checked the data and found out that all of these comparisons are accurate. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The problem for Obama is not that the trend is inaccurate, but that he used the wrong words to describe it.

Solar and wind are not the only types of renewables

The agency's tables include several additional categories of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, geothermal and various types of biomass energy. If you put them all together by BTUs, wind energy in 2011 accounted for 11 percent of all renewable-energy production. That’s not 11 percent of all energy production, including coal, oil and natural gas  -- that’s 11 percent of just the production from renewable sources. Solar, meanwhile, was even smaller. It accounted for about 1 percent of all renewable energy production.

If you look at all types of electricity generation from renewables, the increase isn’t double between 2008 and 2011 -- it’s 55 percent.

""Energy"" and ""electricity"" are not the same thing

Not all renewable energy is used to create electricity.  For instance, some renewable energy is used for transportation, primarily ethanol in gasoline. This ethanol is counted in the ""energy"" category but not in the ""electricity"" category. Much smaller amounts of biomass are used for heating in colder locales or in industrial facilities like paper mills.

So, to use Obama’s words, did renewable energy -- not just electricity -- double between 2008 and 2011? No. The increase in megawatt hours was about 25 percent, according to EIA data and estimates.

""Taken literally, the quoted statement is imprecise and probably misleading,"" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, an energy-policy think tank.

Our ruling

In his two speeches, Obama said, ""We've doubled our use of renewable energy."" But while the nation has made strides in expanding electricity generated by wind and solar -- the most high-profile part of the administration’s policies -- the increase for all kinds of energy, and for all types of renewables, was about 25 percent. That’s far short of doubling, so we rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7F5100>],/factchecks/2012/sep/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-weve-doubled-our-use-renewable-e/

Charter school funding claim hits close to mark
","
A math exercise by one prominent education advocate in Georgia had folks asking some questions.

Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association, recently sent a letter to education officials and other interested parties noting that state special charter schools will receive more money per pupil than those attending traditional public schools under a revised formula set by the Georgia Legislature.

Garrett sent his letter to Atlanta Journal-Constitution education columnist Maureen Downey, who then posted it on the AJC’s Get Schooled blog. It’s complicated, but he concluded that state-approved charter schools actually come out ahead when the budget cuts are applied.

Some well-versed on education wondered if Garrett’s conclusion about which schools will get more money from the state is correct. Some read the part about austerity cuts and said Garrett was just wrong. PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be worthwhile to do some homework on all of this.

Charter schools will be a hot political issue this fall. These are public schools that are independently managed and given organizational and curriculum flexibility while meeting state and federal education standards. Such schools are approved by local school boards or, if rejected by the local board, by the state Board of Education.

On Election Day in November, Georgia voters will decide by referendum whether the state constitution should be amended to allow the state to authorize and pay for more charters. Georgia Schools Superintendent John Barge surprised many fellow Republicans last month when he announced his opposition to the amendment, citing concerns that the state is having trouble funding public schools.

There are currently 15 state-approved charter schools. 

Now, back to Garrett’s statements.

PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine the second part first.

In 2003, the state began the first of several austerity cuts, due to declining revenue. For four of the prior past five years, local school districts were shorted millions that they were due under the Quality Basic Education Act, the state formula for funding public education, the AJC reported in 2010. 

Garrett admitted he erred when he wrote that austerity cuts differed between traditional public schools and state-approved charter schools.

""I wish to correct one piece of information about the funding of state special charter schools that I included in the version of Friday notes that I sent earlier today,"" Garrett wrote in an email he sent to the state Department of Education. ""In fact, it appears that the allotment sheets for state special charter schools DO, in fact, reflect a reduction based on austerity cuts. Thus, the paragraph in which I stated that those state special charter schools are not subject to the same austerity cuts as traditional k-12 schools was in error.""

Garrett confirmed he sent that email to the state, but said his larger point was state charter schools will get more money than traditional public schools under the amendment, which brings us back to the first part of his claim.

The QBE formula gives money to schools based on each student and ""indirect"" costs, such as administration. Georgia requires local systems to pay an amount equal to five mills of property tax generated within their taxing authority for those educational costs within the school district. 

Downey asked state Education Department spokesman Matt Cardoza to review Garrett’s claim that state charter schools will receive more money per pupil under the new formula.

His answer: ""I’ve confirmed that those numbers are correct. Our financial review team ran the numbers based on what the legislation says.""

The AJC recently examined the question of which types of schools get more money. An article concluded that state-approved charter schools would get more money per pupil, citing an analysis of school funding completed for Gov. Nathan Deal, who backs the amendment. However, traditional schools will get local money that state-approved charter schools do not. In 2011, the state Supreme Court ruled state lawmakers do not have the power to grant the state authority to approve and fund charter schools over the objection of local school boards. 

In conclusion, Garrett was correct on his larger point that state-approved charter schools will get more money per pupil under the proposed amendment than traditional public schools. Garrett admitted he was incorrect about the secondary part of his claim that state-approved charter schools are exempt from austerity cuts. 

We give Garrett a grade of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE2F700>],/factchecks/2012/sep/11/herb-garrett/charter-school-funding-claim-hits-close-mark/

Florida Democrats say Donald Trump denied overtime pay for millions. That needs context
","As President Donald Trump praises his economic record while campaigning for re-election, Florida Democrats say that he hasn’t done enough to help the middle class. ""The Trump administration has given corporations a $1 trillion tax cut — with almost nothing going into the pockets of workers — while at the same time, gutting workers rights, consumer protections, and denying 4.2 million American workers overtime,"" the Florida Democratic Party said in a press release, a day before Trump’s Orlando rally. It’s an exaggeration to say ""almost nothing"" is going into the pockets of workers, as our previous reporting shows. We wondered if the Trump administration denied 4.2 million American workers overtime. It turns out that’s something of an exaggeration, too.   Most employees are eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But there’s an exception for white-collar workers.  To be considered a white-collar worker by the government, an employee has to make more than $455 per week, be paid a salary, and work in an administrative, executive or professional position. People who meet these criteria do not qualify for overtime pay.  The Obama administration sought to boost the amount of money a white collar worker could earn and qualify for overtime. So in 2016, the Obama administration announced it would extend overtime eligibility to white collar salaried workers earning less than $913 a week, or $47,476 a year, about double the exemption level set in 2004 of $455 per week or $23,660 a year.  The change would have extended eligibility to 4.2 million additional Americans, the Obama administration said. But a federal court in Texas halted the rule  amid a challenge by Republican-led states and business trade groups. The Trump administration did not defend the Obama-era rule change, dropping the government’s appeal in 2017.  Instead, the Trump administration proposed its own rule; its number was more than the earlier exemption level but lower than the Obama rule.  In March, the Labor Department proposed making workers eligible for overtime if they earn $679 per week, or $35,308 per year. Above this salary level, eligibility for overtime varies based on job duties. (The rule does not change overtime protections for various blue collar workers including police officers, firefighters, nurses and non-management employees in construction.) While the Obama rule would have automatically adjusted the salary threshold every three years, the Trump rule doesn’t include that. The new Trump rule is expected to be finalized in 2020. The Democrats’ statement omits that the Trump administration wants to extend overtime to some Americans, though a much smaller number than Obama’s rule intended to help 4.2 million in the first year. The Trump Labor Department estimates that its rule would provide overtime to around 1.3 million extra workers. Heidi Shierholz, who was the chief economist at Obama’s Labor Department when the overtime rule was proposed and now works for the Economic Policy Institute, estimated that the Obama rule would have given new protections to 4.6 million workers in 2020 due to automatic updating. Daniel S. Hamermesh, a Barnard College economist, put the figure somewhat lower. He estimated that it would have led to about 3 million more people getting overtime. ""So the best conclusion is that the Trump regulation would leave unprotected about 2 million workers who would have been protected under the Obama regulation,"" he told PolitiFact. However, these are estimates, and it’s not possible to precisely know how many would have gotten overtime as a result of the Obama rule or the proposed Trump rule. Some factors are unknown, such as how employers would attempt to skirt the rules. ""We do know one thing,"" Hamermesh said. ""We know for sure the Trump partial rollback of the regulation will undoubtedly result in fewer people getting overtime pay than would have been the case under the Obama regulation, and the total amount of overtime paid to all people will also be less"" compared with the Obama rule. Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that there isn’t a guarantee that all of those additional people would end up getting a higher paycheck under the Obama or Trump plan. Corporations could respond to changes in overtime thresholds by reducing base wages and other compensation, leaving workers’ total compensation the same.  The Florida Democratic Party said the Trump administration has denied ""4.2 million American workers overtime."" In 2016, the Obama administration set a rule that would have raised the salary threshold for overtime pay, which it said would extend overtime to 4.2 million more workers.  The Democrats omit that the Trump administration has proposed raising the salary threshold to extend overtime to about 1.3 million workers. That’s less than Obama’s proposal, but not a denial to all 4.2 million workers.

Fox Business host wrongly claimed market crashed as 'instant reaction' to Obama’s 2008 election
","Fox Business Network host Charles Payne wrongly claimed the market crashed as an ""instant reaction"" to former President Barack Obama’s election in 2008. During a June 17 segment on ""Your World with Neil Cavuto,"" Payne was asked about President Donald Trump’s tweet that his failure to win re-election would cause a major market crash. ""I think President Trump was talking about the knee-jerk reaction on Wall Street,"" Payne said. ""All you’ve got to do is look at history."" Payne said the market went up 9% between the day Trump was elected and the day of his inauguration ceremony. ""Conversely, when President Obama was elected, the market crashed,"" he said. ""Trump was up 9%, President Obama was down 14.8% and President Bush was down almost 4%. There is an instant reaction on Wall Street."" We decided to check if Obama’s 2008 victory sent the stock market spiraling and, more generally, if elections do trigger immediate reactions on Wall Street. So we reviewed the numbers and talked to economists. Put simply, Payne is right about the market numbers but wrong about what caused them and how fast they happened. Since Payne mentioned the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, we first focused on that time frame, which for Obama was the window between Nov. 4, 2008, and Jan. 20, 2009.  We found that the market did decline following Obama’s election, but it’s important to note that that window of decline was part of a larger trend set off by the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened at 9,323.89 on Nov. 4, 2008, and dropped to a low of 7,939.93 by Jan. 20, 2009. That’s a 14.8% decrease, as Payne said. It continued sinking after Obama’s inauguration, hitting its lowest mark on March 6, 2009, at 6,469.95.  Looking at just Nov. 4 and 5 of 2008, the Dow fell less than 2%, from 9,323.89 to 9,139.27. So there was a slight drop in that time frame, too. But those declines shouldn’t be considered a ""crash,"" experts told us. In reality, the Dow had been slipping since Oct. 9, 2007, when it reached its pre-recession peak at 14,166.97.  On Sept. 29, 2008, before Obama’s election, the Dow fell 774.17 points in a single day. Two weeks before that, a declaration of bankruptcy from the financial services firm Lehman Brothers also caused the Dow to drop 498.86 points in a day’s time. ""The election of Obama did not cause the global financial crisis,"" said Tara Sinclair, professor of economics at George Washington University. ""The stock market can react strongly to news of all sorts, but the academic research is clear that the seeds of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession were sown well before Obama was elected.""  Sinclair said the 2008 financial crisis and market crash are generally attributed to ""issues in housing markets and financial interconnectedness that wasn’t foreseen by policymakers."" (For more on the causes, read our analysis from 2008). In a statement to PolitiFact, Payne defended his use of the word ""crash."" ""When the market declines almost 15% in less than three months, I consider that a crash,"" the Fox Business Network host said. ""I wasn't assigning blame, but the election at the time obviously didn't engender confidence in investors or mitigate concerns about issues at the time."" But Kathleen Day, professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, said Payne is cherry-picking, since Obama’s presidency eventually saw net stock market gains. ""That’s like taking a snapshot on a rainy day,"" she said. ""Let’s look at how many sunny economic days we’ve had over the course of their tenure."" For the record, the Dow opened at 13,112.90 on Nov. 6, 2012 — the day Obama was re-elected for a second term in office — and closed at 13,712.21 on Jan. 22, 2013, the first day the market was open after his second inauguration ceremony. That’s an increase of about 4.6%.  The Dow rose 8.6% in the same time frame after Trump’s election in 2016 and fell 3.6% after former President George W. Bush won in 2000 — so Payne was right on those numbers, also. Experts we spoke to were mixed on whether the stock market reacts to presidential election results.  ""Stock market fluctuations may reflect investors’ hope for the new administration that will take office on Jan. 20,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the nonprofit Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C. But the same market fluctuations could also be the result of other economic factors, such as joblessness, company profitability or economic growth or decline, Burtless said. ""Much of this information may have nothing whatsoever to do with the new administration."" Generally speaking, experts said it’s hard to explain market movements over a short period of time, such as the window between a president’s election and inauguration.  ""The stock market is a little bit like a hysterical person on a boat running from one side of the boat to the other and making it tilt that way,"" Day said.  ""The market is sensitive to elections, yes,"" she said. ""But no one really knows why it goes up or down everyday unless there’s some really catastrophic event."" Sinclair, the George Washington University professor, also warned against drawing conclusions from comparisons of the stock market’s performance under different presidents, since each person comes into office facing different conditions. (PolitiFact compared Obama and Trump on the stock market in 2018.) Comparisons that begin with Election Day are especially unhelpful, Burtless added, because a new president won’t take the reins until after inauguration. ""In that period, the newly elected president has no say over any of the policy levers controlled by a president who actually holds office,"" Burtless said. For what it’s worth, it’s also not clear how valuable the stock market is as an indicator of the country’s economic health, let alone a president’s economic decision-making. Not every American invests in the stock market, so it’s probably not the most relevant metric. Payne said, ""When President Obama was elected, the market crashed … Trump was up 9%, President Obama was down 14.8% and President Bush was down almost 4%. There is an instant reaction on Wall Street."" The Dow fell 14.8% between Obama’s 2008 election and inauguration, so Payne was right about the extent of the drop. The other numbers check out as well. More importantly, experts said the decline was not a crash in and of itself, but instead part of a longer trend resulting from the 2008 financial crisis and issues that had been bubbling for months. The reaction was hardly dramatic or ""instant.""

"['State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe falsely claims he inherited $2.4 billion debt left by GOP
","Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe loves to talk about his financial stewardship. ""Five years ago, when I took office, our state was mired in debt - a $2.4 billion debt left over by Republicans,"" McAuliffe told about 1,800 fellow Democrats during a June 15 speech at the state party’s Blue Commonwealth Gala. ""...We got the state humming again and we left office with the largest surplus in state history,"" he added. He made similar statements about inheriting a $2.4 billion budget deficit during a Jan. 24 speech at the University of Virginia, Jan. 11 on WAMU radio, Dec. 30 on CNN, Nov. 12 and Sept. 26 on Bloomberg Television, and Sept. 18 to reporters in Des Moines, Iowa. The claim has been part of McAuliffe’s pitch since shortly after he took office in 2014. We fact-checked it in 2015, wondering how he could have inherited a deficit from his predecessor, Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, when the state constitution requires a balanced budget. It’s a good time to examine the statement again. McAuliffe plans to be in the news. With Gov. Ralph Northam sidelined by his blackface scandal, McAuliffe is vowing to raise money and campaign for Democrats this fall when all 140 General Assembly seats will be on ballots and partisan control of both legislative chambers will be at stake. The inheritance Virginia has a two-year budget cycle that begins July 1 of every even year. Before the start of the first budget year, the legislature approves and the governor signs a biennial plan. After that, the governor and lawmakers negotiate budget amendments based on the needs and finances at the time. The state constitution requires that total expenditures not exceed revenues.  McDonnell, in one of his last acts as governor, presented two budget bills to the General Assembly on Dec. 16, 2013. The first bill put his finishing touches on the outgoing two-year budget, set to expire June 30, 2014. The proposal, called the ""caboose budget,"" anticipated $35.4 billion in general fund revenues for the budget cycle and $34.9 billion in expenses. The second bill was McDonnell’s proposal for the coming two-year budget, which began July 1, 2014. He anticipated $37.8 billion in general revenues and proposed $37.7 billion in spending. In other words, when McAuliffe took office on Jan. 11, 2014, McDonnell left two balanced budget bills on his desk. So why does McAuliffe say he ""inherited"" a deficit? Four years ago, we put that question to Brian Coy, who was McAuliffe’s communications chief. Coy noted that the economy slowed during the winter and spring of 2014, causing tax revenues to fall below expectations. The McDonnell administration ""left behind a budget that had a forecast that was too optimistic for our financial situation,"" he said. ""They supported a spending threshold that was too high."" Did that mean McDonnell should have seen the economic slowdown coming? ""With the benefit of hindsight, some signs could have been detectable and some may have not,"" Coy said. State budget analysts tied the slowdown to two factors: •Tax cuts ushered in by former President George W. Bush expired in 2013, causing the  capital gains tax to rise. As a result, there was a surge of people cashing in capital assets before the higher rates took effect, followed by a lull after the levy went up. The lull caused a steep drop in non-paycheck tax receipts in Virginia in 2014.   •Federal spending cuts hurt Northern Virginia, the state’s economic engine. McAuliffe sensed the problems shortly after taking office, but initially underestimated their severity. On Feb. 12, 2014, he cut the revenue estimate in the coming two-year budget McDonnell proposed by $140 million. ""Although our underlying economic forecast has not changed,"" McAuliffe said, ""it is clear that the current revenue receipts warrant attention."" The takeaway: One month into office, McAuliffe said McDonnell’s revenue estimate was $140 million high, but retained ""the underlying economic forecast"" McDonnell’s budget was built on.   In May, the shortfall caved to an estimated $1.5 billion. The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by cutting $800 million in spending and drawing $700 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Seven months into his term, on Aug.15, 2014, McAuliffe estimated the shortfall at $2.4 billion and ordered additional cuts to keep the new two-year budget balanced. In a speech to the General Assembly’s money committees, the governor said that out of caution, his forecast was deliberately ""pessimistic."" The surplus McAuliffe’s usually adds that, under his watch, the shortfall was ""turned"" into the ""largest surplus in Virginia history."" Although that claim doesn't factor in our ruling in this fact-check, we'll offer footnotes on it.  The record surplus claim stems from McAuliffe’s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. The figure slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year that ended in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990.  When adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest. Some people hearing McAuliffe’s statement might conclude that Virginia’s budget made almost a $3 billion rebound in one year of McAuliffe’s term - from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus in 2015. That’s not the case. McAuliffe overestimated the state’s economic problems in August 2014 when he adjusted the two-year budget to a ""pessimistic"" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe cites. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""Five years ago, when I took office, our state was mired in debt - a $2.4 billion debt left over by Republicans."" That’s just wrong. McAuliffe inherited balanced budget proposals from McDonnell in 2014 - as required by the state constitution. Perhaps, McDonnell should have seen approaching clouds and proposed a more conservative spending plan. But financial projections are tricky. When McAuliffe sensed an economic slowdown during his first weeks in office, he made a modest $140 million cut to McDonnell’s revenue forecast and said he was sticking with the ""underlying economic forecast"" predicating McDonnell’s budgets. Six months later, McAuliffe was projecting a $2.4 billion shortfall. McAuliffe is hardly the first governor to accuse his predecessor of leaving behind a financial mess. But evidence shows the brunt of the shortfall, though not McAuliffe’s fault, occurred during his watch. No doubt, McAuliffe faced tough financial conditions. But he did not  inherit a $2.4 billion deficit from Republicans, as he’s been saying for years. We rate his statement False.     ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6EB940>],/factchecks/2019/jun/25/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-falsely-claims-he-inherited-24-billion-d/
"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Fuzzy math fuels Sanders’ claim that cost barriers to health care kill 30,000 a year
","""Medicare for All"" — or single-payer health care — is a flagship issue for Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. So when a conservative group launched an ad campaign claiming such a policy would drive up wait times for medical care, the 2020 candidate responded aggressively. His point: Some people may wait a bit for care under a new system. But under the current one, many people do not have access to affordable care and the results are sometimes dire. Still, Sanders’ precision gave us pause. Namely, he tweeted, ""30,000 Americans a year die waiting for health care because of the cost."" Where did that 30,000 figure come from? How could Sanders — or for that matter, anyone — know how many people died ""waiting for health care"" specifically ""because of the cost""? We reached out to the Sanders campaign but never heard back. But multiple experts suggested that the 30,000 figure, while not conjured out of thin air, relies on math that is shaky at best. There isn’t enough evidence, either way, to entirely validate or repudiate this claim. The math Sanders’ 30,000 statistic appears to come from a figure used by Physicians for a National Health Program, a doctor-driven nonprofit group that has advocated for years for single-payer health care. But how did it compute that number? We asked Dr. David Himmelstein, a physician and part-time lecturer at Harvard Medical School, and one of PNHP’s founders. He said the group looked at the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a landmark study in which some state residents had been assigned Medicaid coverage by lottery, and others remained uninsured. One year into that study, researchers found the death rate differed by 0.13 percentage points between those who received insurance and those who did not. But, per the researchers’ analysis, that difference was not statistically significant. (That’s important and something we’ll come back to.) Himmelstein said the margin of 0.13 percentage points suggests that for every 769 people to lack health coverage, one will die. Looking at the current American uninsured population — about 27 million lack coverage —should put you close to 30,000. The problem Generally, experts said, it’s likely that cost barriers prevent thousands of Americans from accessing lifesaving medical care. But ""the particular math here seems a bit questionable"" in arriving at 30,000, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The problem lies in extrapolating so much from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment. While it yielded important findings, the death rate differential in particular is not statistically significant, so it cannot be applied so broadly, he said. The study wasn’t big enough to generate sufficient evidence spelling out the link between insurance coverage and mortality. Other research makes clear that such a link exists. Sommers’ own work, for instance, looked at the impact of Massachusetts’ 2006 health reform law — the model for the Affordable Care Act, which brought the state to near-universal coverage. That expansion was associated with a significant drop in mortality. For every 830 adults to gain coverage, one death was prevented. But differences nationally in both population and health care generally still mean it’s difficult to apply this statistic to the rest of the country — and, namely, to the remaining 27 million uninsured. So is 30,000 right or wrong? We don’t know. ""My guess is that one, [Sanders] is right that thousands of people die because they remain uninsured, despite the ACA; but two, the 30,000 number may be too high,"" said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at Families USA, a left-leaning health policy advocacy group. Going beyond insurance There’s one other issue: More often than not, people are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy coverage. In turn, that often means they can’t afford health care and suffer dire consequences. But it isn’t a one-to-one substitution. For instance, there are healthy people who lack insurance but may not need much medical care in that particular year, or may simply choose not to buy it. And, on the other hand, some people have coverage that isn’t robust enough to make lifesaving treatments affordable.   So, if you want to measure how many Americans do die ""waiting for health care because of the cost,"" you’d have to look beyond just the question of having insurance. Our rating On its face, Sanders’ claim speaks to an important, undisputed policy concern — thousands of Americans die because they cannot afford their health care. But his ""30,000 people"" talking point relies on weak math, and it lacks meaningful support either way. It could be true. But it also could easily not be. ""The senator’s comment looks like a reasonable attempt to use prior research,"" Sommers said. But ""he’s overstating the precision and confidence we can have in that number."" Sanders’ argument speaks to something more broadly true but neglects important details of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment’s limitations. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA23E80>],/factchecks/2019/jun/24/bernie-sanders/fuzzy-math-fuels-sanders-claim-cost-barriers-healt/

PANTS ON FIRE: Trump’s latest California voter fraud claim as baseless as past allegations
","In his recent interview on ""Meet the Press"", President Donald Trump claimed there’s proof to support his repeatedly debunked claim that ""serious voter fraud"" took place in California during the 2016 presidential election.  Trump alleged California ""admitted"" there were ""a million"" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election.  ""Take a look at Judicial Watch. Take a look at their settlement. California admitted to a million votes. They admitted to a million votes,"" Trump told Chuck Todd, the show’s host, in an interview that aired June 23, 2019.  Election officials and fact checkers have previously called out Trump’s baseless claims on the subject. In November 2016, PolitiFact National rated Pants on Fire his contention that he lost the popular vote because ""millions of people voted illegally."" PolitiFact California handed out the same rating for his claim of ""serious voter fraud"" in California. Hillary Clinton won the state by more than 4 million votes and she won the national popular vote by about 2.8 million. Trump won the decisive Electoral College tally.  We wanted to know the veracity of Trump’s new claim. So, we examined the settlement that he said is evidence of massive voter fraud in California. Here’s the exchange between Trump and Chuck Todd:  Todd: ""You didn't like the fact that you lost the popular vote. That bothered you, didn't it?"" Trump: ""Well, I think it was a -- I mean, I'll say something that, again, is controversial. There were a lot of votes cast that I don't believe. I look at California."" Todd: ""Mr. President.""  Trump: ""Excuse me."" Todd: ""But that’s a …""  Trump: ""Take a look at Judicial Watch. Take a look at their settlement. California admitted to a million votes. They admitted to a million votes.""  Todd: ""A million votes of what?"" Trump: ""Take a look at Judicial … Todd: ""What are you talking about?"" Trump: ""Judicial Watch made a settlement. There was …""  Todd: ""About what?""  Trump: ""There was much illegal voting.""  President Trump claimed there’s proof to support his repeatedly debunked claim that ""serious voter fraud"" took place in California during the 2016 presidential election. Our research Trump cited a January settlement California reached with the conservative group Judicial Watch. It requires Los Angeles County election officials to remove inactive registrations from voter rolls to comply with federal law.  The 20-page settlement document, however, notes all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county. It makes no mention of voter fraud or illegal voting.  In a written statement, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla blasted Trump’s new allegation. Padilla, a Democrat, has also been critical of the president’s past statements on voter fraud.  ""No matter how much he repeats them, Trump's lies about voter fraud are patently untrue. Specifically, the settlement with Judicial Watch, Los Angeles County, and the Secretary of State contains absolutely no admission to or evidence of ""illegal votes."" The President’s claims are untrue and yet another distortion aimed at undermining confidence in our elections.  The settlement was clear and simple, California will continue its work to adhere to modern list maintenance procedures under the National Voter Registration Act.  California elections officials have and will continue to work to meet the goals of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA): maintaining the accuracy of the voter rolls and increasing the number of eligible citizens who register and vote."" Dean Logan, Los Angeles County’s top elections official, added in an email: ""The agreement is about voter registration record keeping and interpretation of federal law, not about votes cast in any election."" In a press release last week, Judicial Watch said Los Angeles County had ""sent notices to as many as 1.59 million inactive voters on its voter rolls – a step toward removing the names of voters who have moved, died, or are otherwise ineligible to vote."" Logan, the county elections official, confirmed the notices had been sent.  Trump’s claim ‘completely inaccurate’ The Associated Press reported on the agreement in January, describing it as a settlement on ""old voter records,"" not on illegal voting. In the article, Paul Mitchell of the nonpartisan research firm Political Data Inc. called the case insignificant because it involves inactive voters who ""are not getting voting materials, they are not casting ballots, they are not showing up in precincts."" ""What they are saying is L.A. county holds on to too many inactive registrations,"" he told the AP. ""This whole thing does nothing to clean up the active voter file."" Reached for this fact check, Mitchell called Trump’s claim ""completely inaccurate.""  The White House did not respond to a request for information supporting the president’s claim. Judicial Watch also did not respond. The group’s president, Tom Fitton, has described the settlement on Twitter and in the AP article as an effort to ""clean up"" the state’s election rolls. Our ruling President Trump recently claimed California ""admitted"" there were ""a million"" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election, in an effort to support his widely debunked claim of massive voter fraud in the state.  Trump cited a January settlement between the state and Judicial Watch.  But that agreement says nothing about voter fraud or illegal voting. Instead, it requires Los Angeles County election officials to begin the process of removing inactive registrations, for people who have gone years without voting often because they’ve moved or died, to comply with federal law.  It says all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county. State and county elections officials strongly rejected the president's statement. We found Trump's new voter fraud claim as baseless as his past allegations.

No, those posts about infected needles being hidden in gas pump handles are part of an old hoax
","They say legends never die. But when it comes to the internet, it’s definitely hoaxes that keep on tickin’ — and in the case of alarmist Facebook posts, it seems there's no end to the misinformation. The Facebook post in question this time features a photo of a gas station pump handle and what appears to be a needle sticking out under it. It was posted on June 4 and had been shared more than 12,000 by June 24. The grammatically challenged text that hovers over the photo reads: ""Please look before gassing up there putting infected HIV needles in the gas stations plz warn every friend of yours and family members. Guys plz share share share"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, this years-old hoax holds no merit (Snopes reported versions of the rumor have circulated in email chains since at least 2000). While it is not entirely impossible for someone to attach a needle to a gas station pump, the problem is not widespread. We searched Nexis news archives and Google and could find only one reported case of such an incident, and it happened in 2017. Critically, the assertion that needles are infected with HIV is fabricated. In 2017, a man named Jose Medina reported that he was pricked by a needle when he was pumping gas in California. In fact, it appears the photo used in this Facebook post originated with the Medina incident. Medina’s daughter posted a lengthy update on Facebook shortly after and said her father went to the hospital for tests, which came back negative. At one point she addresses the rumor that the needle somehow contained the HIV virus: ""...because there are now people taking the photo and adding a different story or claiming the needle has the AIDS/HIV virus (when I never stated that the needle did or did not have the virus, we don't know what was or was not on there)."" There have not been any other credible reports, by media or law enforcement, of another incident involving gas station pumps and needles. According to the CDC, while HIV cannot survive outside of the body for long (such as on surfaces), it can survive in a needle for up to 42 days, depending on temperature and other factors. On a digital health website called TheBody that describes itself as ""The HIV/AIDS Resource,"" we found an archived CDC Q&A fact sheet on common rumors and myths about HIV/AIDS. At one point, the post addressed the rumors of HIV-infected needles being left in public places such as movie theaters or gas pump handles and said those stories ""appear to have no foundation in fact."" ""CDC has received inquiries about a variety of reports or warnings about used needles left by HIV-infected injection drug users in coin return slots of pay phones, the underside of gas pump handles, and on movie theater seats. These reports and warnings have been circulated on the Internet and by e-mail and fax,"" the website says. ""Some reports have falsely indicated that CDC ‘confirmed’ the presence of HIV in the needles. CDC has not tested such needles nor has CDC confirmed the presence or absence of HIV in any sample related to these rumors. The majority of these reports and warnings appear to have no foundation in fact."" The CDC would not comment on the claim other than to share information from its website that addresses injection drug use and HIV risk and transmission. An old hoax that has resurfaced on Facebook makes the claim that people are attaching HIV-infected needles to gas pump handles. Besides one isolated case in 2017, we could find no reports of needles being discovered in gas station handles.   While it is not impossible for such a thing to take place, the suggestion that infected needles are being hidden in gas pump handles in any widespread manner is fear mongering and inaccurate. We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7D0FC0>],/factchecks/2019/jun/24/facebook-posts/no-those-posts-about-infected-needles-being-hidden/

Donald Trump twists story on Central Park Five
","As President Donald Trump was boarding Marine One, a reporter called out a question about a vicious attack in New York’s Central Park that took place 30 years ago. ""Mr. President, will you apologize to the Central Park Five?"" reporter April Ryan called out June 18 on the White House lawn. ""They've been exonerated. There have been videos and movies shown about the case, and you came out with a full-page ad saying that they should die, that they should have the death penalty. Do you apologize?"" ""Why would you bring that question up now?"" Trump said. ""It's an interesting time to bring it up."" ""There's movies and everything about them,"" said Ryan, Washington bureau chief of American Urban Radio Networks. (The current Netflix series ""When They See Us"" is a dramatization of the case.) ""You have people on both sides of that,"" Trump replied. ""They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda Fairstein, and if you look at some of (the) prosecutors, they think that the city should never have settled that case. So we'll leave it at that."" Trump’s statement that the young teenage boys known as the Central Park Five ""admitted their guilt""distorted the record and ignored key facts — much more is known now than in the weeks after the attack. Evidence suggests that the young men made false confessions that they later recanted. In the early hours of April 20, 1989, a 29-year-old woman jogger was found badly beaten and raped in Central Park. On the night of the crime, police had responded to a group of about 30 teens threatening people in the park. A racing bike rider was accosted. A taxi driver reported rocks thrown at his cab. Two men, in separate incidents, were assaulted and injured and one of them was robbed. Ultimately, five young men, ages 14 to 16, were questioned by police and later charged with the beating and rape of the woman. In their first hours with police, the young men offered a mix of confessions. The details from each did not align with the accounts from the others. They identified different individuals who actually committed the rape. They did not agree on where the attack took place. Their statements failed to match the physical evidence from the scene, including the woman’s clothing. Importantly, none of them confessed to the rape itself. They soon retracted their confessions. The incident was front page news and fraught with racial overtones. The victim was white. The suspects were black and Hispanic. News coverage referred to ""wilding teens"" marauding at will. Within a few days, authorities had charged the five teens with rape and attempted murder. Soon after that, on May 1, Trump paid $85,000 for full-page ads in New York’s four major newspapers, the New York Times, the Daily News, the New York Post and New York Newsday. ''Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!"" the ad’s headline said (see page 13). ""I want to hate these muggers and murderers,"" Trump wrote. ""They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes."" The victim survived the attack. Trump’s statement saw the crime as part of a broader social decline. ""At what point did we cross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a helpless woman and laugh at her family’s anguish? And why do they laugh? The laugh because they know that soon, very soon, they will be returned to the street to rape and maim and kill once again."" 
Headline from Donald Trump’s ad in New York newspapers, May 1, 1989 After a trial in which they maintained their innocence, the five teens were convicted of rape and assault. No physical or forensic evidence connected them to the attack on the jogger. The prosecution’s case ""rested almost entirely on the statements made by the defendants,"" as the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said in a later filing. In addition to the attack on the woman, they were found guilty of two other assaults in the park. Four of them spent seven years in prison. A fifth served 13 years — until 2002. Then, everything changed. In February 2002, another man, Matias Reyes, in prison for raping and murdering a woman in 1989, confessed to raping and beating the Central Park jogger. He said he acted alone. DNA evidence conclusively tied him to the attack. He provided specific details that matched the crime scene. And he confessed to other sexual assaults that police had never linked to him. With that new evidence, late in 2002, a judge dismissed the convictions. ""This court finds that although the defendants made incriminating statements linking them to the crime scene, as established in the parties' papers, none of the defendants admitted raping the jogger,"" the judge wrote. The District Attorney’s Office said support for the other assault charges ""have been substantially and fatally weakened by the newly discovered evidence."" While there was evidence that some of them had participated in those crimes, the District Attorney’s Office called for the court to reverse all the convictions. Trump referred to a key prosecutor in the 1989 trial, Linda Fairstein, head of the city’s sex crimes unit. He said she and other prosecutors thought the city should not have settled. Her statements show she agrees with the judge’s ruling to vacate rape charges, but not the others. ""Mr. Reyes’s confession, DNA match and claim that he acted alone required that the rape charges against the five be vacated. I agreed with that decision, and still do,"" Fairstein said in a June 10, 2019, Wall Street Journal op-ed."" Fairstein, however, added that she thought the convictions on the other charges should stand. And in 2014, she objected to the city’s settlement, saying it ignored those other crimes. She said she believed that the teens played some role in the rape. So Trump’s claim that Fairstein and other prosecutors ""think that the city should never have settled that case"" is also exaggerated. The Central Park Five case raises the question of why these teenage boys would implicate themselves in a crime that they later denied having committed. It’s a complicated issue. No court found that the interrogators used illegal methods to secure statements from the teenagers. Ohio State law professor emeritus Sharon Davies studied the record. In a 2006 article about lessons from the Central Park jogger case, Davies said detectives drew the questionable confessions from the young men using persuasion. ""Why not just be cooperative, demonstrate remorse, and put the whole bloody mess behind them, the detectives prodded,"" Davies wrote. Whatever questions swirl around the circumstances, our focus here is more narrow: Did the teens admit their guilt, as Trump said? In the words of the New York Supreme Court judge and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, ""none of them admitted actually raping the Central Park jogger."" In their trial and on appeal, they all maintained their innocence. On the other hand, the young men described ways in which they participated in the attack, at least initially. In the eyes of Steven Drizin, law professor and head of Northwestern University Center on Wrongful Convictions, Trump’s statement is ""not entirely inaccurate but it is misleading and incomplete."" ""While the boys admitted their guilt, they immediately disavowed their confessions,"" said. ""Trump’s statement is misleading because it ignores the reality of false confessions. False confessions make up approximately one-fourth of all DNA exonerations, and youth are at an even greater risk of false confessions than adults."" Not every legal scholar agrees that that those confessions were false. Paul Cassell, professor of criminal law at the University of Utah, pointed to a 2003 report commissioned by the New York City Police Department. Three outsiders selected for the panel decided that the teens first attacked the woman, and then the actual rapist took advantage of the moment. The report’s authors had no additional facts beyond what was known at the trial. They acknowledged that the evidence offered ""a reasonable basis for maintaining that Reyes did, indeed, commit an attack on the jogger by himself."" In the eyes of the District Attorney’s Office, the confessions ""had serious weaknesses."" It was plausible that each defendant ""spoke about the crime with a view toward becoming a witness rather than a defendant.""   In short, there is now ample evidence that the confessions were false, and in that sense, not actual admissions of guilt. The District Attorney’s Office filing said, and the court agreed, that if a jury had been given the full set of evidence, it likely would have reached a different verdict. In 2014, New York City agreed to pay the Central Park Five $41 million in a legal settlement. The White House press office declined to comment for this fact-check. Trump said that the Central Park Five ""admitted their guilt."" And he said some of the prosecutors involved ""think that the city should never have settled that case."" While the five teens did early on admit to participating in an attack, they quickly withdrew those confessions. At best, they admitted their guilt to a limited degree for a brief time. Legal records show that none of them confessed to raping the woman in Central Park. A judge vacated their convictions when the actual rapist confessed and DNA evidence showed his guilt. Trump ignores reams of evidence that now point to the false nature of those confessions. Even the prosecutor he cited said she agreed the rape convictions were rightly overturned. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC929080>],/factchecks/2019/jun/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-twists-story-central-park-five/
"['Elections', 'Texas', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Beto O’Rourke on target about scale of Democratic surge in Texas in 2018
","Beto O’Rourke may have lost his U.S. Senate race in 2018, but he still sees something to crow about. O’Rourke told CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert that he helped boost turnout among young voters and that he did unusually well for a Democratic candidate in the GOP-leaning Lone Star State, where Democrats haven’t won a statewide race since 1994. ""Young voter turnout in early voting was up 500%. We won more votes than any Democrat has in the history of the state of Texas,"" O’Rourke said on the show June 13. His campaign didn’t get back to us, but when we took a closer look at the data, we found that O’Rourke’s boast was on target. The part of O’Rourke’s statement about surging young-voter turnout tracks back to research by TargetSmart, a political data firm. On Oct. 30, the firm released a study of the data on early voting across the country. The firm used official state election figures, then harnessed a mixture of public and proprietary data to analyze this early turnout data through several demographic categories, including age. This prompted a number of news articles that noted the 500% increase in early voting by young people in Texas. But because the study was released one week before Election Day, we wondered whether that differential continued through the final data. TargetSmart’s website includes final figures for 2018. It lists 118,383 Texans between the ages of 18 and 29 casting early ballots in the 2014 general election, compared to 674,027 casting early ballots in 2018. The 2018 figure for early voting was about 5.7 times higher than the figure for 2014, and that’s close to the sixfold increase that would equate to a 500% bump. The increase was a smaller ⁠— though still substantial ⁠— 200% once votes on Election Day are included in the tally. But in the interview with Colbert, O’Rourke was clear about the metric he was using. Other data from 2018, from Tufts University’s Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, found that the rate of overall youth turnout in Texas ⁠— not just early voting ⁠— roughly tripled over 2014. That’s even higher than the increase found by TargetSmart. The Tufts study found that O’Rourke saw his biggest levels of support in counties with high proportions of young voters, especially Latino youth. A footnote: O’Rourke hired TargetSmart to work on data projects, but the data cited here was from a publicly released, 50-state project the firm undertook, not something that O’Rourke paid for or had influence on. The part of his assertion about winning more votes than any Texas Democrat is also correct, though O’Rourke benefited from the state’s fast-growing population. We looked through vote totals for Democratic nominees who ran statewide in recent elections — presidential, senatorial, gubernatorial, attorney general, and other statewide offices. Here’s the summary of what we found, along with the totals for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, a Texan who won a landslide presidential victory that year.  In general, as the table shows, Democrats ran especially strong in Texas in 2018. It was a good year for the party nationally, and O’Rourke’s candidacy ended up being unusually popular among Texas voters. Even though presidential-year turnout is usually higher than midterm-election turnout, no fewer than seven Texas Democrats won more votes in 2018 than Barack Obama did in either of his presidential runs in the state. The 2018 nominees who accomplished this were those for attorney general, lieutenant governor, agriculture commissioner, railroad commissioner, comptroller, land commissioner, and governor. The only pre-2018 candidate to come close to the top of this list was Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ presidential nominee in 2016. Of course, all of these 2018 candidates, including O’Rourke, were blessed with running after Texas’ population had expanded dramatically. Texas has ""seen its number of registered voters increase more than fivefold over the past 55 years, from 3 million in 1964 to 7.7 million in 1990 and 15.8 million in 2019,"" said Mark P. Jones, a Rice University political scientist. Still, O’Rourke beat them all, becoming the first Texas Democrat to win 4 million votes or more in a statewide election. O’Rourke’s share of the vote — 48.3% — is well below what Democrats tended to receive when Texas was a Democratic-dominated state, or at least more competitive than it is today. Still, during the current, two-decade-plus era in which Republicans have dominated Texas, O’Rourke’s showing represented a breakthrough for Democrats, despite his loss. He won a larger percentage of the vote than any statewide Democrat since 1998, when Paul Hobby won 49.0% in the race for state comptroller. (Hobby lost, too.) O’Rourke said that in 2018 when he ran for senator, ""young voter turnout in early voting was up 500%. We won more votes than any Democrat has in the history of the state of Texas."" His assertion about young voter turnout is backed up by an analysis of state election data by the firm TargetSmart. And he’s correct that no Democrat has ever won more raw votes in a Texas statewide election than he has, an accomplishment achieved through a combination of his own electoral success, a pro-Democratic environment in 2018, and Texas’ rapid population growth in recent years. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF5D1C0>],/factchecks/2019/jun/24/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-target-about-scale-democratic-surge-t/
"['Population', 'Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Bill Brady']","
Fact-checking Brady’s muddled attack on Pritzker’s tax plan
","Illinois has had an income tax for 50 years and rates, while bouncing up and down, have always been one-size fits all. That could change next year if voters approve a constitutional amendment to replace the flat tax with a system of graduated rates that charge more to the wealthy. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker made the switch a centerpiece of his campaign last year, and in the months since he took office we’ve fact-checked a number of assertions from both those who support the switch and those who oppose it. Another in the series came recently from state Senate Republican Leader Bill Brady of Bloomington in a speech at the City Club of Chicago. ""We stood united as Republicans against this (the graduated tax) primarily because we could find no safeguards for middle-income families,"" Brady said. ""The last income tax increase in the state of Illinois, we saw the largest exodus of middle-income families."" On its face, the claim from Brady was a head scratcher because the most recent hike in the flat income tax, from 3.75 % to 4.95 %, was imposed by the legislature in mid-2017. There’s a lag in the availability of tax data that could illustrate who it is that might be leaving the state, and the latest figures available are from 2016 — prior to that last tax hike. So what was Brady talking about? When we reached out to his office, spokesman Jason Gerwig told us Brady meant to reference low-income rather than middle-income families. By way of support, he pointed us to the Better Government Association’s own recent analysis of federal tax filings between 2006 and 2016, a period that included four years during which the state’s tax rate temporarily rose from 3% to 5%. That investigation found the number of high-income tax filers in Illinois grew robustly after the tax hike even though critics had warned at the time that wealthier taxpayers would flee the state, while the number of low-income tax filers shrank. But PolitiFact rates claims based on the words people speak. Corrections by his staff aside, Brady not only referred to the state’s most recent tax increase and not the 2011 hike but also twice mentioned middle-income families in his remarks. Given that there is not yet data to shed light on the changing makeup of taxpayers following the 2017 increase, however, we also decided to assess how middle-income earners fared during the previous hike. There is no official definition for ""middle class,"" so we looked at several groups that might appear to fit that description, depending on the number of people in their families and the cost of living where they reside. The IRS data that was the focus of the BGA analysis shows that the number of filers reporting adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $100,000 grew slightly during the four years that earlier tax hike remained in effect. Growth was even greater among those reporting incomes of between $100,000 and $200,000, roughly approximating what might be considered upper middle class.  Loading...  In fact, the only income group that shrank in size was the one comprised of filers reporting annual income below $50,000. So Brady would have been on slightly firmer ground had he actually said what Gerwig said he intended to. At that, however, the numbers apply not to the last Illinois tax increase but the second to the last. Gerwig predicted the slide continued after the 2017 tax hike, but he had no data to back that up because it doesn’t yet exist. In his speech, Brady also sought to make the argument that a graduated tax would inevitably impose financial pain on middle-income earners by citing a past instance when the flat tax did just that. A key flaw in that claim is that Democratic lawmakers and Pritzker have OK’d a rate structure contingent on the passage of the constitutional amendment that would only hike taxes on those with incomes of $250,000 or more. Republicans, including Brady, caution those rates amount to little more than an opening bid and provide no assurance that Democrats won’t later hike rates more on everyone. While it’s true there’s nothing to prevent that, there’s also nothing to prevent it under the current flat tax system, as the very examples Brady seized on underscore. More broadly, a link between state populations and tax policy changes is far from clear. In an interview with the BGA for its analysis of the 2011 tax increase, economist Michael Hicks of Ball State University said that people make decisions about when and where to move the ""same way they look for value in the purchase of food, clothing or other items."" ""The amenities that seem to matter most are good schools or school choice, thick labor markets, neighbors who are high income, and more highly educated, and other things that are often associated with cities or suburbs in large metro places,"" said Hicks, who specializes in the effects of public policy on economic activity. ""All things being equal, a higher tax will cause some people to leave, but all things aren’t equal."" While arguing against a Democratic plan to swap out Illinois’ flat income tax for a series of graduated rates, Brady said the last time the state increased its income tax, ""we saw the largest exodus of middle-income families."" Illinois last hiked its income tax in 2017 and data is not yet available for any year later than 2016, so there’s no way to assess how many middle-income Illinoisans have filed taxes in the state since it took effect. Brady’s office told us the senator meant to refer to low-income families, whose share of tax filings did decrease following the state’s second-to-last tax hike, IRS data show, while the returns from all other income groups grew. But that’s not what Brady said in his City Club speech, so we rate his claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

"['Congress', 'Voting Record', 'New York', 'Kirsten Gillibrand']","
Gillibrand claims legislative victories in Trump era
","A point that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., brings up on the presidential campaign trail is her ability to work across the political aisle.   ""Even in the last Congress, President Trump signed 18 of my bills. I don't think he knows he did, but he did,"" Gillibrand told the editorial board at the Des Moines Register.   She repeats it often, so we checked her claim. It quickly became clear that evaluating the truthfulness of her statement would not be as simple as searching for her sponsored legislation in a Congressional database and seeing which bills passed. We approached Gillibrand’s campaign for evidence of her claim. Spokeswoman Meredith Kelly provided a list of legislation the senator sponsored or co-sponsored that made it into law in some form, typically as part of other bills, during the 115th Congress in 2017-18. This list had 17 pieces of legislation, including an amendment, and the 18th item was several bills intended to change sexual harassment policies in Congress. With one exception, the renaming of a post office, the bills did not follow a simple path from her sponsorship to a signing by the president. In some cases, bills originated in her office, but the House version was signed into law. This includes a bill regarding a hydroelectric project at the Cannonsville Dam, east of Binghamton. In this case, Rep. John Faso, a Republican, sponsored identical legislation in the House one month after Gillibrand introduced her bill. His bill ultimately passed both houses. Gillibrand’s bill, meanwhile, had been amended in the Senate. At the time, Faso was a member of the Republican majority in the House, and Gillibrand was in the Democratic minority in the Senate.   In another case, the House version of a bill to conduct a study in Oswego was signed, though Gillibrand carried a related bill in the Senate.   In two of the bills that became law, Gillibrand was an original co-sponsor, meaning that she signed on to the bill when it was introduced. This happened with a bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to provide benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. Another, sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, allows military families more flexibility in where they live before or after a new assignment. That bill became law as part of a large defense spending bill. Gillibrand’s campaign provided evidence of Grassley and Blunt crediting Gillibrand for her work on the bills.  The majority of the items on the list started out as bills sponsored by Gillibrand, but were passed in whole or in part as part of other bills. Gillibrand’s Computer Science Career Education Act was signed into law after it became a provision of another bill, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education For The 21st Century Act. Provisions of another one of Gillibrand’s bills, which promotes hands-on manufacturing and learning, was also included in the career and technical education act. A bill aimed at reducing wealth inequality was included in a defense spending bill. Provisions from her bill to help dairy farmers were adopted as part of a farm bill.    In one case, she offered an amendment to a defense spending bill to clean drinking water polluted by Air Force-supported activities. The spending bill was signed into law. The 18th item on the list was a collection of reforms to sexual harassment policy in Congress that Gillibrand had been pushing. Though she was not a sponsor of adopted legislation, the final law had provisions from Gillibrand's sponsored legislation. These elements included making sure interns were covered by the policy, eliminating a mandatory 30-day mediation before a complaint is filed, and conducting a ""climate survey"" of House and Senate offices about sexual harassment and other workplace issues, among others. Her activities around these reforms garnered her significant national media attention. Evaluating effectiveness is not simple, experts said. It can be difficult to measure how much a lawmaker worked behind the scenes to advance legislation, because the paper trail isn’t always clear, said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University. Rolling bills into other legislation is common, said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. ""Negotiating the legislative process in the Senate often means giving senators what they want in exchange to lift their fillibuster threat,"" Huder said. A good legislator doesn’t insist that his or her legislation pass as a free-standing bill, said Dan Diller, a former senior Senate staff member and director of policy at the Lugar Center, which measures bipartisanship. ""If you were so arrogant (to insist) that your bills pass free-standing, nothing would ever get done,"" Diller said. But, if you sign on as the 15th co-sponsor, you probably haven’t done much to advance the bill, he said. Gillibrand did not claim credit for any bills in which she was not an original co-sponsor, nor for any if her contributions were not acknowledged by the bill sponsor. In the case where part of a bill was adopted as part of a larger bill, that’s a sign of a flexible legislator dedicated to governance, Diller said. It’s difficult to pin down how much credit a lawmaker should receive in this instance, but a lawmaker should get credit if their entire bill is adopted as part of a different bill, he said. Craig Volden, an expert in legislative effectiveness and a professor at the University of Virginia, took a different view. In his model, he and his partner, Alan Wiseman, assign credit only for bills that a lawmaker sponsored, not ones they co-sponsored. As for ideas or language that ends up in law, ""there is no established objective standard,"" Volden said.    According to Congress.gov, maintained by the Library of Congress, Gillibrand was a sponsor of one bill that Trump signed during the 115th Congress, a post office renaming, and a co-sponsor of 18 other bills. These co-sponsored bills were largely not the ones that Gillibrand’s campaign provided to us.    Gillibrand said that Trump has signed ""18 of my bills."" The bills to which Gillibrand referred were not strictly bills that originated in her office. As the experts said, legislating requires flexibility in order to get anything accomplished. Indeed, provisions from bills that Gillibrand sponsored or supported early became law, but typically as part of other bills. Evaluating her contributions to those laws and how she influenced policy requires nuance and understanding how legislating works. But her phrasing lacked nuance. They may largely have been her ideas, but she called them ""my bills."" For all but one of the bills, she left out an important detail: In their final form, the bills were sponsored by someone else.   We rate her claim Half True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEBDA00>],/factchecks/2019/jun/21/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-claims-legislative-victories-trump-era/

The Trump policy called for the prosecution of all adults who crossed the border illegally; when parents came in with children, the families were separated. In the interview that aired June 20, Trump said it was not a mistake. He argued that separations were due to an Obama policy and that Trump himself wanted families together. ""We had separations,"" Trump said. ""When I became president, President Obama had a separation policy. I didn’t have it. He had it. I brought the families together. I’m the one that put them together."" Díaz-Balart said that despite 2,800 recent reunifications, the government still doesn’t know how many children are still separated from their parents. ""Are you ready? Under the Obama plan,"" Trump started saying, before Díaz-Balart pushed back saying that what they were talking about was Trump’s plan. ""No, we are not, because I’m the one that put people together. They separated. I put them together,"" Trump repeated. Reunifications happened, Díaz-Balart said, because a court ordered it. ""I inherited separation, and I changed the plan and I brought people together,"" Trump said. Trump repeated this claim later in the interview. Trump’s persistent claims don’t align with the facts. Generally, a child and an adult who arrive together at the border can be separated when border officials cannot establish the custodial relationship; when they believe the custodian may be a threat to the child; or when the custodian is being detained for prosecution. Immigration experts have told us that family separations were relatively rare under Obama and other past administrations. They did not happen at nearly the scale that they did under the Trump administration. George W. Bush’s Operation Streamline referred for prosecution immigrants who crossed into the country illegally, but made exceptions for adults traveling with children. The Obama administration initially kept families together in detention, but after losing a legal challenge, released families out of detention after holding them for a limited time. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border enforcement, previously told PolitiFact that Obama’s administration did not count the number of separated families. It’s unclear exactly how many children were separated from their parents during Trump’s administration, which has acknowledged problems in its logistics and record-keeping. Under a court order, around 2,800 children have been reunited with their parents or otherwise discharged from federal custody. The controversial family separations under Trump’s watch happened as a result of a new policy introduced in April 2018 by Trump’s then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions said an ""escalated effort"" was needed to address a crisis at the southwest border and directed the implementation of the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, to prosecute all adults illegally entering the United States. In March 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly told CNN he was considering separating children from parents to deter illegal immigration. In the Telemundo interview, Trump also said that ""when you put the parents together with the children, when you don’t separate,"" more people arrive at the border. Amid growing backlash and criticism of family separations, Trump issued an executive order to keep families together, even if a parent faced prosecution. Families will be detained together ""where appropriate and consistent with law"" and based on available resources, said his June 2018 order. Before issuing the order, Trump had claimed that family separations could not be stopped through an executive order. That wasn’t true, either. Trump said, ""When I became president, President Obama had a separation policy. I didn’t have it. He had it."" The Obama administration did not have a policy to separate families arriving illegally at the border. Family separations rarely happened under the Obama administration, which sought to keep families together in detention. Then, based on a court decision, it released families together out of detention. Separations under Trump happened systematically as a result of his administration’s policy to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally. After mounting public pressure and criticism, Trump signed an executive order to stop separating families. Around 2,800 children have been reunited with their families because a court ordered the Trump administration to do so. Trump repeatedly attempts to change the narrative about family separations, but the facts remain the same. Obama did not pass down to Trump a policy to separate families. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC99DC80>],/factchecks/2019/jun/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-again-falsely-says-obama-had-family-s/

Fact-checking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's comments on Amazon, “starvation wages” and food stamps
","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bashed Amazon during a June 16 interview with ABC’s ""This Week,"" accusing the company of paying warehouse workers ""starvation wages."" Asked for her thoughts on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the New York Democrat said she cares more about the ability of Amazon warehouse workers to make ""a living wage"" than she does about the billionaire’s fortune. ""But if his being a billionaire is predicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of their ability to access healthcare, and also if his ability to be a billionaire is predicated on the fact that his workers take food stamps,"" she said, then that’s a problem. Amazon said Ocasio-Cortez was ""just wrong"" in a response on Twitter. ""Amazon is a leader on pay at $15 min wage + full benefits from day one,"" the company wrote. Ocasio-Cortez fired back, this time with a definition for ""starvation wages."" ""Paying full-time employees so little that they require gov food assistance is what paying starvation wages means,"" she said the next day on Twitter. So, who’s right? In this case, both sides have a point. Amazon, an e-commerce giant, employs 647,500 full-time and part-time workers worldwide, in addition to contractors and temporary employees, according to company filings. That includes about 125,000 full-time employees working across 75 warehouses in North America, per the company’s website. In November 2018, Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour and began lobbying to replicate those changes on the federal level. The initiative brought median pay for its full-time U.S. employees to $35,096 for 2018, according to a company statement. That means about half of Amazon’s U.S. workers made less than $35,096 in 2018, in part because the $15 minimum wage was only in effect for the last two months of the year. (The federal poverty level for 2019 is $25,750 for a family of four, up from $25,100 last year.) Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said this figure for median pay ""does not include the monetary value of the several benefits we offer to our employees,"" such as health care. Corbin Trent, spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, cited reports in The Washington Post, Vox, The Intercept, NBC News, CNN and Newsweek as evidence supporting Ocasio-Cortez’s statement. Ocasio-Cortez also cited The Daily Beast on Twitter. In addition to detailing poor working conditions, several of these articles said some Amazon workers depend on the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to put food on the table. That finding originated with The Intercept and New Food Economy, a nonprofit news outlet focused on food, which submitted SNAP-related public records requests to 30 states where Amazon warehouses are located. The requests returned data from Arizona, Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington that showed thousands of Amazon workers get food stamps through SNAP, including as many as 1 in 3 in Arizona and about 1 in 10 in both Ohio and Pennsylvania. Stacking Ocasio-Cortez’s definition of ""starvation wages"" against these findings, it seems she’s partially correct; some warehouse workers did require government food assistance. But there are some caveats. For starters, Robinson said some Amazon workers listed as SNAP enrollees in the reports might be eligible because they choose to work part-time. Robinson also said some workers could have been receiving SNAP benefits at the time Amazon hired them. The biggest caveat, however, is the fact that The Intercept and New Food Economy based their reporting on data from 2014 to 2017, before Amazon raised its minimum wage. ""(Ocasio-Cortez’s) claims and the articles she points to are from before the wage increase,"" Robinson said. ""The 2018 annual total median compensation of U.S. employees was $35,096 and because the minimum wage went into effect for only two months of 2018, we expect that monetary figure will increase for 2019."" Will that increase be enough? Experts said there’s a lot of uncertainty when it comes to assessing whether a $15 hourly wage can keep people off SNAP. In part, that’s because incomes for Amazon’s workers depend on how many hours they work. It’s also because SNAP eligibility and benefits are determined not only by income relative to the poverty line, but also by factors such as household size. For example, a full-time Amazon employee making $15 per hour, working 40-hour weeks and taking two weeks of vacation would earn $30,000 yearly. If that employee had a non-working spouse and two kids, then she’d be above the poverty line, which is $25,750 for a family of four. But several circumstances could change that. ""If the dependents were all small children, the poverty line would be a bit lower,"" said Christopher Jencks, professor of social policy at Harvard University. ""If the worker in question had a working spouse and two children, the picture would look a lot better."" ""The picture would also vary depending on state and local taxes, housing costs, the health status of family members, how far those who work have to spend to get to their job, and so on,"" Jencks added. ""It all depends."" Plus, SNAP benefits are determined monthly, so a worker earning an hourly wage could be eligible one month and not another, said Timothy Smeeding, professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Other government programs, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, could also come into play for minimum-wage workers with multiple children, Smeeding said. ""For families of, say, four, $30,000 per year is liable to mean possibly some SNAP, but definitely still receiving tax help from the EITC,"" he said, adding that larger families could get both. Ocasio-Cortez said Amazon is ""paying full-time employees so little that they require gov food assistance."" Multiple reports said thousands of Amazon’s warehouse workers relied on food stamps to make ends meet in 2017. But some of those workers may have been part-time. Importantly, the company has also moved to a $15 minimum wage since those reports came out. That might not change things for all employees — experts said certain workers will still be eligible for food stamps and other forms of government assistance — but it could help more of them get by on their own. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Based on the best information available, we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE16200>],/factchecks/2019/jun/21/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/fact-checking-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-amazon-star/
"['Drugs', 'Texas', 'John Cornyn']","
Fact-checking John Cornyn on drug trafficking, drug overdoses
","U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, posted a series of tweets about drug overdose deaths ahead of a hearing held by the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control on federal efforts to counter drug abuse and trafficking. One of the Republican’s tweets was about his home state of Texas and included an image that showed the number of drug-related deaths in Texas and in the United States in 2017 (3,000 in Texas and 70,000 across the country). ""Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states from drug trafficking,"" Cornyn said. ""Nearly 3,000 Texans died from drug related deaths in 2017 – with half being overdoses involving opioids."" We decided to fact-check this claim, which originated from Cornyn’s opening statement at the Senate hearing. Understanding Cornyn’s tweet Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn, said the tweet was based on the senator’s opening statement at the Senate Drug Caucus hearing, which included additional context about the first half of the claim. ""My home state of Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states in terms of volume of trafficking and all related mayhem that accompanies the illicit activity,"" Cornyn said at the hearing, before offering the same statistics included in his tweet. Cornyn’s tweet doesn’t include the extra note that Texas is one of the most severely impacted states ""in terms of volume of trafficking and all related mayhem"" — which could include several categories of data. (Brandewie said the number of overdose deaths in the state was an example of related mayhem.) Instead, Cornyn’s tweet as-written suggests that his claim is just in reference to the number of overdose deaths in the state. This is the perspective we used to fact-check his claim, but we considered the context from the hearing when issuing our ruling. With this in mind, Cornyn’s figures are accurate, but his ranking of Texas as one of the most impacted states in terms of overdose deaths is based on totals that haven’t been adjusted for population size. Federal figures are in line with numbers Cornyn shared The image Cornyn shared with his tweet cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Brandewie confirmed via email that CDC figures were the basis of Cornyn’s tweet. Numbers published by the agency mirror the figures in Cornyn’s tweet: In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths across the country and 2,989 overdose deaths in Texas. Looking just at overdose deaths in 2017, opioids were involved in 67.8% of deaths nationwide and 48.8% of deaths in Texas. While looking at these numbers, it’s worth considering the fact that not all drug overdose deaths are tied to drug trafficking Courtney Lenard, spokeswoman for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, provided an analysis of mortality data that showed prescription opioids are associated with opioid overdose deaths. ""Correct, not all drug-related deaths are related to illicit drugs,"" Lenard said. ""However, illicit drugs – particularly illicitly-manufactured fentanyl – are largely driving the overdose epidemic in more recent years."" She said separate analyses conducted by the CDC using mortality data and drug seizure data from the Drug Enforcement Administration ""have suggested an association between states with high or increasing numbers of fentanyl encounters and increases in overdose deaths involving fentanyl."" How do drug overdose deaths in Texas compare with other states? Cornyn’s tweet connects the number of drug overdose deaths in Texas in 2017 to the state’s status as one of the states most severely impacted by drug trafficking, but does that check out? In 2017, there were 2,989 drug-related deaths in Texas, making it the state with the sixth highest number of overdose deaths that year, behind New York (3,921), California (4,868), Florida (5,088), Ohio (5,111) and Pennsylvania (5,388). But given that Texas is the second most populous state, it makes more sense to consider the rate of drug-related deaths per capita than to compare raw totals by state. If we look at the number of drug-related deaths per capita by state, Texas lands near the bottom of the list with 10.5 overdose deaths per 100,000 people. Just three states have a lower number of overdose deaths per capita: North Dakota (9.2), South Dakota (8.5) and Nebraska (8.1). The state with the most drug-related deaths per capita in 2017 was West Virginia, with 57.8 deaths per 100,000 total population, or 974 overdose deaths in total. Our ruling Cornyn said, ""Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states from drug trafficking. Nearly 3,000 Texans died from drug related deaths in 2017 – with half being overdoses involving opioids."" Cornyn’s tweet as-written includes accurate figures about drug overdose deaths in Texas and across the country, but his characterization of Texas as one of the ""most severely impacted states from drug trafficking"" based on these deaths doesn’t take population into account. Looking at raw figures, Texas was among the states with the most drug-related deaths in 2017. But when we look at the rate of drug-related deaths (which accounts for population), Texas is at the lower end and had fewer drug overdose deaths per capita than 46 other states in 2017. Also: Cornyn’s tweet originated from comments he made at a Senate hearing, which suggested that he was looking at a range of factors when considering the severity of the impact of drug trafficking in Texas, not just drug overdose deaths. We rate this claim Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA21C40>],/factchecks/2019/jun/21/john-cornyn/fact-checking-john-cornyn-drug-trafficking-drug-ov/

No, the only reason to oppose voter ID laws isn’t because 'you plan to cheat'
","A viral image on Facebook insinuates that Democrats in Congress oppose voter ID laws because they want to cheat to win votes. The post is an image of a tweet that reads: ""Two Facts: 1. The only valid reason to oppose voter ID is that you plan to cheat. 2. Every Democrat in Congress opposes voter ID. What more do you need to know about the party?"" The initial tweet was published by a Twitter user who goes by the name of ""Philip Schuyler"" and describes himself in the Twitter bio simply as a ""Supporter of President Trump."" (Philip Schuyler, we should note, is the same name as a general in the American Revolution who went on to become a U.S. senator from New York.) A Facebook page called ""Taking Back America,"" which posts and shares content promoting President Donald Trump, posted a photo of the Philip Schuyler tweet. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So does this post provide an accurate overview of the anti-voter ID stance and the Democrats who support it? Not really. A little reporting shows it’s far more complex than this statement suggests. And, the issue has become politically polarized, with a major elections bill drawing a strictly party-line vote. Why do people support and oppose voter ID laws? Some of the main reasons people support voter ID laws are to prevent voter fraud and ""to ensure that elections have the integrity and security that they deserve,"" said Jason Snead, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that supports voter ID laws, in an interview with PolitiFact. It’s a popular stance: Around three quarters of Americans favored requiring all voters to show government-issued photo IDs, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center pre-election survey. Snead cited a recent North Carolina ballot fraud case in which political operatives were indicted for allegedly illegally collecting ballots from people who requested to cast an absentee vote by mail. However, Republican efforts to require voter ID would not have stopped the incident because it did not involve voter impersonation at the polls. Research shows that voter fraud is uncommon in American elections. An investigation conducted by Loyola Law School, Los Angeles professor Justin Levitt found 31 credible incidents of voter fraud in over 1 billion ballots cast during general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. ""The reason to oppose voter ID laws – specific and unduly restrictive ID laws, not all laws across the board – is when they unnecessarily limit the ways that people can prove that they are who they say they are, down to a few forms of documentation that can be quite difficult for real eligible voters to obtain,"" Levitt told PolitiFact in an email. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law looked into which demographics of citizens strict voter ID laws might impact the most, by studying who has a valid government-issued photo ID. The center supports and helped craft HR 1, the ""For the People Act of 2019,"" which aims to change campaign financing, end partisan gerrymandering and make it easier for citizens to vote. The bill passed in the House in March 2019. In 2006, the Brennan Center commissioned a survey that found that an estimated 21 million voting-age U.S. citizens didn’t have government-issued photo IDs. Of those 21 million, 15% of citizens who earned less than $35,000 a year, 18% age 65 or older, and 25% of African Americans didn’t have a current government-issued photo ID. Do all Democrats in Congress oppose voter ID laws? The 2016 Democratic Party platform, which is revised by party members every four years, states, ""We will continue to fight against discriminatory voter identification laws, which disproportionately burden young voters, diverse communities, people of color, low-income families, people with disabilities, the elderly, and women."" In January 2019, congressional Democrats introduced HR 1, which could weaken states’ voter ID laws. For example, it could allow citizens in states that require voters to present government-issued photo IDs before casting ballots in federal elections to instead hand over a signed written statement, under the penalty of perjury, confirming their identity and eligibility to vote. No House Democrat voted against the bill, and no Republican voted in favor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to bring it to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. So while it appears, based on this piece of legislation, that Democrats in Congress do favor measures to loosen restrictive voter ID laws, it’s important to note that the voter ID section is just one part of the bill. Because voter ID laws vary in their restrictiveness, the position that individual Democratic lawmakers take may vary according to the particular policy under consideration. Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama, for example, in describing her effort to re-establish the Voting Rights Act earlier this year, noted in an interview with The Atlantic that before her father, who was wheelchair-bound, died in 2017, he ""didn’t have a driver’s license but he had been voting — until Alabama changed its law in 2014 — with a validly issued federal ID called a Social Security card."" Some states have ""strict"" voter ID laws, meaning citizens in those states who don’t have valid IDs must vote on a provisional ballot and take additional steps to ensure their vote is counted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. There are conflicting studies on whether strict voter ID laws significantly impact the outcome of an election. Our ruling The Facebook post said, ""Two Facts: 1. The only valid reason to oppose voter ID is that you plan to cheat. 2. Every Democrat in Congress opposes voter ID. What more do you need to know about the party?"" Critics of voter ID laws often defend their position by stating that not every voting-age citizen possesses a valid government-issued photo ID, and these laws disproportionately impact some more than others, including citizens of color and citizens 65 and older. Concern that more people are able to vote does not amount to an interest in cheating. While it is difficult to verify whether every congressional Democrat opposes voter ID laws of all kinds, we do know that every House Democrat who voted on HR 1, which could weaken voter ID laws, supported the bill. However, it’s important to remember that this was one aspect of a far-reaching bill. This claim contains an element of truth but distorts many critical details. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE0FD00>],/factchecks/2019/jun/21/facebook-posts/no-only-reason-oppose-voter-id-laws-isnt-because-y/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Pocan']","
Universal health care diagnosis is on the mark
","The debate over health care in the United States has been a hot-button issue for years. From private-pay to Medicare/Medicaid to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and now to ""Medicare for All,"" lawmakers have argued over how, who, and how much Americans should pay for their health care. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, has been routinely tweeting out his support for the proposed Medicare for All Act, including this tweet from April 30, 2019: ""The United States is the ONLY industrialized country without universal healthcare. The #MedicareforAll Act ensures that every person living in the U.S. has access to healthcare and comprehensive benefits. Today's hearing is a historic step towards making it happen."" We decided to focus on the first part of the tweet. Is the United States the only industrialized country without universal health care? Let’s take a look.   What is the Medicare for All Act? In April 2019, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, unveiled an updated ""Medicare for All"" bill. Sanders’ plan would create a government-run system that would provide health care coverage to all Americans. According to an analysis by PolitiFact National, Medicare for All would replace private insurance, as well as Medicaid and Medicare. The Affordable Care Act would go away. A government-run health insurance program would replace them all. The veterans health system would stay in place, as would Indian Health Services. The new Medicare for All bill largely mirrors an earlier one, but this version fully covers long-term care. PolitiFact National has created a guide to Medicare for All that answers many questions about the program. 
The United States vs. other countries In June 2015, our colleagues at PolitiFact National checked a very similar claim from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate: ""We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right."" At that time, a spokesman said Sanders was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 36 countries that includes Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and 26 more. The group does not include China and Russia, which the OECD classifies as ""emerging economies."" In its analysis, PolitiFact National cited a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries lacked universal health care coverage: Mexico had passed a law in 2004 with the goal of getting to universal coverage, but at the time of the fact-check had not yet reached it. As of 2013, coverage had reached about 87% of the population. However, by 2018, Mexico had implemented a public health care system known as Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social , which provides universal health care to Mexican families and foreign residents enrolled in the system. The other country on the OECD’s lack of universal health care list: The United States. (A footnote: Sanders framed his claim around major countries with a guaranteed right to health care, speaking as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don’t. As such, Sanders’ claim was rated Half True.) In that respect, Pocan’s claim is more straightforward -- he spoke of universal coverage. Emails to Pocan’s office seeking more information on his claim went unanswered. That said, Pocan spoke of industrialized nations, so the OECD is a good starting point. Other sources An April 26, 2018 article in The Economist noted: ""Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, America remains an outlier in health care provision. It has some of the best hospitals in the world, but it is also the only large rich country without universal health coverage. And health care costs can be financially ruinous."" In a May 14, 2017 opinion piece in The Conversation, Timothy Callaghan, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University Health Science Center, cited multiple reasons for why the U.S. is unlikely to adopt such as system: ""Its culture is unusually individualistic, favoring personal over government responsibility; lobbyists are particularly active, spending billions to ensure that private insurers maintain their status in the health system; and our institutions are designed in a manner that limits major social policy changes from happening."" Global Research, an independent research and media organization based in Montreal, Canada,  in a July 9, 2017, paper titled ""America the Only Developed Country Without Universal Healthcare"" said nations providing universal coverage offer one of three forms: 1. Government provided single-payer; 2. Two-tier providing basic care, along with secondary coverage offering more services based on the ability to pay; and 3. Mandate insurance from an employer or individually purchased, supplementing national coverage. Its report classified countries in this manner, and noted that when you move beyond the OECD -- to less industrialized nations -- there are dozens with universal health care. Among them: Belarus, North Korea, Mongolia, Romania, Tajikistan and Uruguay. Our ruling Pocan said ""the United States is the ONLY industrialized country without universal health care."" Our research, including an earlier fact-check done by PolitiFact National, made clear this is the case. Indeed, there are numerous non-industrialized countries that also offer universal health care. We rate the claim True.    ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB90840>],/factchecks/2019/jun/21/mark-pocan/universal-health-care-diagnosis-mark/
