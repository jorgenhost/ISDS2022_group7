Rep. Jim Renacci says each child is born with a $45,000 share of the national debt
","
Since joining Congress this year, Rep. Jim Renacci of Wadsworth and other Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives have made cutting spending and reducing the national debt one of their priorities. 
Renacci discussed the need for belt tightening in a video he posted to YouTube on March 29 titled ""Congressman Renacci Pledges Fiscal Responsibility."" 
""The United States is currently more than $14 trillion in the red, which means that our debt is now almost equal to the size of our entire economy,"" Renacci says in the video. ""To put it in context, every child born today inherits a $45,000 share of the national debt before they take their first breath."" 
That sounds like lots of moolah for a newborn to pay, so PolitiFact decided to check out Renacci’s claim. 
According to the U.S. Treasury Department, the nation’s total outstanding public debt is currently $14.3 trillion, up from $14.2 trillion on the day Renacci made his claim. He is correct that the national debt exceeds $14 trillion. 
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics estimates the nation’s Gross Domestic Product at $15 trillion in the first quarter of 2011, a number that only slightly exceeds the nation’s debt. So Renacci is also correct that the national debt almost equals the size of the entire economy. 
To determine the share of the national debt that would be allotted to each American, we divided the $14.3 trillion national debt by the 2010 Census’s current U.S. population figure of 308.7 million. That comes out to $46,323.29 per person, which is slightly higher than Renacci’s figure.   
Based on the information to this point, we ruled this statement True when we originally published this item in May 2011.  
Since then, a lot of politicians have made similar statements, resulting in additional fact-checking by our PolitiFact partners. PolitiFact Texas added an extra dimension to the issue by exploring what constitutes the national debt, breaking it down into to parts. We'll borrow from the explanation offered by PolitiFact Texas to explain: 
Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. 
        
In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. ""If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market."" 
   
So where does that leave us? Renacci's statement is accurate. The overall debt at the time he made the statement, divided by the population at the time, supports his number. But we know today that the public debt is what the government actually owes to those who have lent it money, and that is a good bit less than the total debt. That's important information that puts Renacci's claim into perspective, and on the Truth-O-Meter, that makes the statement Mostly True.

Democratic state Rep. Joe Gibbons says Floridians don't favor health care repeal
","
A proposed constitutional amendment that takes aim at the new federal health care law passed the Florida House of Representatives 80-37 on May 4, 2011.

The measure, SJR 2, prohibits laws that force people to buy health insurance and was a top priority of Senate President Mike Haridopolos, who is running for the U.S. Senate. The Florida Senate voted earlier in the legislative session to put the amendment on the November 2012 ballot -- assuming it survives any court challenges.

While it's unlikely the amendment could trump the impact of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the proposed change is seen as a straw poll on the popularity of the health care law. Democratic Rep. Joe Gibbons, D-Hallandale Beach, argued against the amendment, saying that it goes against the wishes of the majority of Floridians.

""Polls show that Floridians don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act,"" Gibbons said shortly before the amendment passed.

We wanted to know how Floridians feel about the health care law.

While there are dozens of polls about the popularity of the federal health care law on the national level, state-level polling data is more difficult to come by. The most recent Florida polls come from Quinnipiac University, a nonpartisan polling group. It surveyed 1,499 registered voters from March 29-April 4 and asked two questions about the federal health care law.

When asked, ""Do you support Congress repealing the health care law that passed last year,"" 49 percent of respondents said yes and 41 percent said no. When the question was phrased slightly differently to call the law the ""health care reform law,"" 54 percent said yes and 40 percent answered no.

In another Quinnipiac survey of 1,160 voters conducted Jan. 25-31, 50 percent of Floridians said the health care law should be repealed; 43 percent said it should not.

The recent polls show more favorable views of the law now than in earlier surveys we found, including a March 2010 poll conducted by Mason-Dixon. That poll found that 34 percent of Florida voters support the law while 54 percent opposed it.

On the national level, the polls asking about repeal are slightly different. A Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll from April 7-12, 2011, found that 52 percent of Americans want to expand the law or keep it as is, 35 percent want to repeal the law and replace it with a GOP alternative or repeal it altogether, and 14 percent are unsure.

A poll for Fox News conducted April 3-5 found that 60 percent of Americans want to repeal at least parts of the health care law, compared to 34 percent who want to expand it or leave it as is.

And a CBS/New York Times poll from January found that 48 percent of Americans want the bill to stand, 40 percent want it repealed, and 12 percent say they're unsure.

So -- on the national level at least -- the poll results vary widely.

And sometimes, that's what makes claims about polls complicated.

 But in this case, we're addressing Gibbons' claim specifically about Florida. He said: ""Polls show: Floridians don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act."" On a completely literal hearing of his comments, we guess Gibbons is right -- some Floridians do not want a repeal. But really, the question is, where do most Floridians stand?

We found two reputable recent polls from Quinnipiac University that both found -- though narrowly -- a plurality of Floridians support a repeal of the health care law. We rate this claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD3BD00>],/factchecks/2011/may/05/joe-gibbons/democratic-state-rep-joe-gibbons-says-floridians-d/

Barack Obama says that ""bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan""
","
In his speech on May 1, 2011, announcing that a Special Forces team had killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, President Barack Obama took care to praise Pakistan for its assistance.

""It's important to note that our counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding,"" Obama said. ""Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.""

In a press conference the following day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed those sentiments, saying, ""In Pakistan, we are committed to supporting the people and government as they defend their own democracy from violent extremism. Indeed, as the president said, bin Laden had also declared war on Pakistan. He had ordered the killings of many innocent Pakistani men, women and children.""

In a CNN interview on May 3, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough discussed al-Qaida's terrorist acts against the Pakistani military and also referenced how ""we saw in 2007, when al-Qaida declared war on Pakistan...''

Is it possible that bin Laden had declared war against the very country where he was living?

We went to the news archives for September 2007, when bin Laden released the videotaped message that underpins Obama's and Clinton's claim. The news stories, however, do not talk about a general declaration of war against Pakistan, but rather that bin Laden called for a jihad, or holy war, against Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was then president of Pakistan, calling him ""a tyrant'' and ""an apostate.''

Bin Laden disliked Musharraf because the Pakistani leader allied himself with the West -- particularly the United States -- and against al-Qaida. After Pakistani forces stormed a mosque in Islamabad, the Daily Telegraph in London quoted bin Laden saying, ""So Pervez, his ministers, his soldiers and those who help him are all accomplices in spilling the blood of the Muslims who have been killed ... He who helps him knowingly and willingly is an infidel like him.""

According to an account in the Chicago Tribune on Sept. 21, 2007, bin Laden said the military's siege of the mosque ""demonstrated Musharraf's insistence on continuing his loyalty, submissiveness and aid to America against the Muslims ... and makes armed rebellion against him and removing him obligatory.""

According to the Daily Telegraph, al-Qaida released a second statement in 2007 from bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, in which he said the storming of the mosque ""revealed the extent of the despicableness, lowliness and treason of Musharraf and his forces, who don't deserve the honour of defending Pakistan ... Pakistan is a Muslim land, the forces of Musharraf are hunting dogs under Bush's crucifix.''

So is declaring war against Musharraf and the Pakistani military that backed him the same as declaring war against the entire nation? Analysts we interviewed had a range of opinions on that point.

""That would constitute a declaration of war in my view,"" said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University.  ""In fact, a more powerful one than our secular conceptions of war since this would carry a theological imprimatur and a religious responsibility.""

But Sadanand Dhume, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said there is ""a very big distinction"" between declaring holy war against Musharraf and declaring war against the whole of Pakistan.

The statements by President Obama and Secretary Clinton were clearly meant to ease tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan, Dhume said, because Pakistan is still an essential ally in the region, particularly with the ongoing war in neighboring Afghanistan. But, Dhume said, the comments ""don't square with the facts on the ground.""

""Bin Laden has never declared war against Pakistan,"" Dhume said. ""He was opposed to Musharraf.""

After the 9/11 attacks, Musharraf was regarded as a key U.S. ally in the fight against terrorism, particularly al-Qaida. With the U.S. sending some $20 billion in foreign aid to Pakistan since 2001, Dhume said, Musharraf cooperated with the U.S. ""to a certain degree"" against elements of al-Qaida in Pakistan. For example, Pakistan's intelligence agency captured the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Pakistan in 2003, and turned him over to U.S. authorities.

Bin Laden always opposed the leaders of Muslim nations that were seen as sympathetic to the U.S., Dhume said.

""There was no declaration of war against Pakistan,"" he said. ""Think about it logically. Why would al-Qaida declare war against Pakistan? They declared war against a leader they thought was an American puppet. You have to view it through their ideology. For them, it is about a larger, global holy war.""

Indeed, many of al-Qaida's supporters are Pakistanis, he noted. A Chicago Tribune story about bin Laden's taped message in 2007 noted that a survey of Pakistanis at that time found that bin Laden had a higher approval rating than Musharraf -- 46 percent to 38 percent.

""I understand why Obama said what he said,"" Dhume said. ""If (Obama) described things as they really are, the (American public's) anger toward Pakistan would be even greater.""

Technically, bin Laden didn't declare war against countries, but rather against governments and regimes, said Laura Mansfield, a counter-terrorism analyst.

""But I'm not sure there is any distinction there,"" she said, or if there is, it is a distinction without much difference, because bin Laden's declaration resulted in terrorist attacks against Pakistani military and civilians alike.

""Bin Laden had an agenda to remove all of the secular leaders from Muslim countries and to replace them with leaders who would follow Sharia (Islamic religious) law,"" Mansfield said.

Bin Laden may have been more careful about declarations of jihad against the leaders of Muslim countries rather than the countries themselves, but that did not appear to translate to his statements about the United States. For the U.S., his ire was often more generally aimed at Americans rather than its leaders or government.

For example, a Feb. 23, 1998, ""fatwa"" signed by bin Laden and others in the name of the World Islamic Front and called ""Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders"", stated that ""to kill the Americans and their allies -- civilians and military -- is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.""

Again, Obama and Clinton said ""bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan."" In fact, bin Laden declared a holy war against Pakistan's then-president, Musharraf, because of his cooperation with the United States in its war against al-Qaida. Bin Laden clearly had some support in Pakistan (Exhibit A: that was his final hiding place). In the end, we think there are credible arguments to be made that there is little distinction between declaring a holy war on a country's leader and military versus the country itself. But unlike his declared holy war against America, bin Laden was seeking to spark a rebellion in Pakistan against Musharraf, so he could be replaced with an Islamist leader. And so we rule Obama's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA0D780>],/factchecks/2011/may/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-bin-laden-had-declared-war-again/

Gerry Connolly says U.S. owns 3 percent of world’s oil but consumes 25 percent
","
During a House floor speech on May 3, 2011, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., addressed the recent jump in gasoline prices, saying that energy independence and lower gasoline prices will come from higher automobile fuel efficiency and new sources of domestic energy, including wind, solar and biofuels.

In making the argument, Connolly cited a statistic showing how out-of-proportion the United States’ oil consumption is.

""America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves,"" Connolly said.

We thought we’d check his statistic.

We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal clearinghouse for energy statistics.

For the first part of Connolly’s statement -- ""America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil"" -- we turned to a table showing proven reserves of crude oil internationally.

For 2009 -- the most recent year with full data available -- the United States had proven reserves of slightly under 20.7 billion barrels, compared with more than 1.34 trillion barrels for the world as a whole. That works out to be 1.5 percent of the world total -- about half of what Connolly said, but still a small percentage of the global total.

As for the second part of his statement -- that the U.S. ""consumes 25 percent of (the world’s) global reserves"" -- we found an EIA table showing international oil consumption.

For 2009, the U.S. consumed 18.8 million barrels a day, compared with 84.3 million barrels a day for the world as a whole. That works out to 22 percent -- a little low, but once again, in the right ballpark.

When we checked with Connolly’s office, they sent us a few documents with figures more in line with the ones the congressman had cited, but when we looked at them, we noticed that they cited statistics from between 1999 and 2004. So we’ll stick with our numbers.

Bottom line: Connolly’s numbers are a little low because they are out of date, but his general point -- the U.S. consumes a disproportionate share of the world’s oil -- is valid. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC09640>],/factchecks/2011/may/05/gerry-connolly/gerry-connolly-says-us-owns-3-percent-worlds-oil-c/

Democrat and activist Ed Garvey says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker plans to push for legislation allowing the state to take over municipal governments
","
Wisconsin isn’t the only state stirring national political headlines. In Michigan, a new law allows the governor to take over local governments deemed to be in financial trouble.

Benton Harbor is one of several Michigan municipalities that failed a financial ""stress test"" and is now under the control of a state-appointed manager who, among other things, has the power to scrap contracts with public employee unions. Local elected officials are no longer in control.

Protests are mounting over what critics have called a ""dictatorship"" and at least once lawsuit claims the measure gives the state ""czar-like"" powers.

Could financial ""martial law"" declarations be coming to Wisconsin?

According to long-time Democratic activist Ed Garvey, such steps are next on the agenda of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. He first raised the issue April 14, 2011 on his  Fightingbob.com blog, then repeated it in subsequent postings, on Wisconsin Public Radio and in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Rick Ungar, a blogger on Forbes.com, picked up Garvey’s assertions April 16 with a posting entitled ""Gov. Scott Walker Reportedly Planning Financial Martial Law in Wisconsin.""

Two days later, during an April 18 radio interview, Walker vehemently denied being involved with any such plan.

So has Garvey exposed Team Walker’s next controversial political push?

Now, we can’t rule on prospective claims -- what will happen in the future. But we can look at what Garvey says he has already done -- expose plans that are under way -- and whether his evidence supports his own claim.

Let’s go to Garvey’s original blog post.

""We have discovered that Wisconsin's governor has the same twisted idea for Wisconsin as Michigan's governor does of his state,"" Garvey wrote April 14, 2011 on his blog. ""The state would be allowed to take over local governments if financial management standards are not met. Who decides? The governor or a newly elected uber comptroller. (I am not making this up.)""

He adds: ""The secret plan is being prepared by the state's largest law firm, Foley & Lardner, for the Greater Milwaukee Committee, the Bradley Foundation, the governor, and key legislators.""

A closer look at the evidence shows it’s not as Machiavellian as Garvey claims.

Garvey discovered a recently launched website, Makeityourmilwaukeecounty.com That spells out a legislative initiative. However, it’s hardly a secret.

The site is the online version of a project launched by a Greater Milwaukee Committee task force. It’s an outgrowth of a years-long effort by the private business group to study and recommend reforms to Milwaukee County government.

The task force’s recommendations drew attention in an Oct. 9, 2010 column by the Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice, who wrote the recommendations were back-burnered so as not to come out before the November election for governor.

In November, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at a claim by the state Democratic Party that GMC chairman and Walker campaign chairman Michael Grebe killed release of the report before the election. We said the claim was Barely True.

In February, the GMC task force made its recommendations public and the website launched about the same time.

The report calls for several initiatives, including: ""Develop a statewide fiscal stress test through the State Department of Revenue to help local governments maintain fiscal health.""

So, the site does talk about a ""stress test,"" but that’s not the same as the ""martial law"" style approach in Michigan. In fact, the website explicitly says the group is opposed to that approach: ""The Initiative does not support this type of legislation in Wisconsin.""

What’s more, according to GMC president Julia Taylor, about half the states have a ""fiscal scorecard.""  The thinking, she said, is that the more the public knows about how their local government is faring, the sooner problems can be headed off.

Taylor said she wasn’t sure when a bill including the GMC’s plan would be introduced or by whom.

""It’s very, very early in the process,"" she said. ""At this point we don’t have draft language.""


To be sure, some heavy-hitters are working with the GMC to build support for the recommendations and hammer them into legislation -- including lobbyists with Foley & Lardner, former state legislator Mary Panzer and public relations firm Mueller Communications. And the GMC is chaired by Grebe, who was Walker’s campaign chairman and led the governor’s transition team. Grebe also heads the conservative Bradley Foundation.

So, it may be easy to see why Garvey tries to connect some of the dots.

What about the essence of Garvey’s claim, that he discovered Walker’s involvement with the plan being discussed -- and, therefore, his support of it?

As Milwaukee County executive, Walker expressed support for the GMC efforts. But in the wake of Garvey’s first blog post, he issued a sharp denial about involvement now.

""No truth to it whatsoever.  Absolutely a bogus story,"" Walker said April 18, 2011 in an interview with WTMJ-AM (620)  talk show host Charlie Sykes.  ""There's nobody on my staff, nobody in my administration, I'm certainly not working anything remotely close to that.""  

Nevertheless, Garvey said in an interview that he still believes that Walker is involved.

""I think that’s true,"" he said. ""It all sort of fits in with a pattern.""

But thinking something is true and showing it to be true are two different things.

Garvey says he discovered a secret plot by Walker to push Michigan-style legislation that would allow the state to test the finances of local governments and then take over the bad apples.

The Greater Milwaukee Committee is proposing a ""good-government"" style website that would allow citizens to compare and contrast the health of local government finances. But it explicitly stops short of a Michigan-style approach.

What’s more, Garvey did not uncover it (it was previously announced by the group) and he’s provided no direct evidence of involvement from Walker, who vehemently denies it. The measure could change through the legislative process, but that’s the future.

Garvey had a ""scoop."" But it was more of the gardening -- and not journalistic -- variety. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC04540>],/factchecks/2011/may/05/ed-garvey/democrat-and-activist-ed-garvey-says-wisconsin-gov/

Former Reagan budget director says Ryan's plan saves debt reduction for later
","
President Ronald Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly, using spending cuts and tax increases.

Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, while Republicans should accept tax increases, not only for the rich, but also for the middle class. Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments. 

Prior to the roundtable, Amanpour interviewed Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. As the chair of the House Budget Committee, he created a broad budget proposal that the U.S. House of Representatives approved, mostly along party lines, on April 15. It's unlikely the proposal will become law; Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan.

Stockman didn't have kind words for Ryan's outline. 

""I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem,"" Stockman said. ""Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $600 (billion) or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt.""
  

Ryan's budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesn't suggest additional reductions. Ryan's budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White House's proposed 2012 budget, though Obama has since suggested  additional cuts to defense. The reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, a small number considering defense got approximately $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the future growth of defense spending, but he doesn't actually reduce it.

Ryan's proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects ""deep, across-the-board cuts in funding for national defense."" (On this point, Ryan's proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little. A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more, while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isn't enough to achieve U.S. security goals.)

We checked the proposal's numbers with Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute that focuses on defense. Even with Gates' suggested reduction, ""the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down -- it would essentially stay flat (only growing with inflation) for the next 12 years,"" Harrison said via e-mail.

We rate this part Mostly True, allowing for the fact that there are some small reductions that Ryan and the Obama administration both agree on.

In three years, Ryan ""does not cut one dime from the debt.""

As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term. But it's not enough to make a dent in the public debt. Keep in mind what the debt is: It's the total of all the money we've borrowed. The deficit, on the other hand, is the yearly shortfall. So making the deficit smaller each year doesn't cut the debt. As long as annual deficits exist, the debt will grow every year.

Ryan's proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the CBO analysis. The ""Path to Prosperity"" document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it shows debt going up every single year. Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan's budget shows the debt increasing to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to $23.1 trillion in 2021.

So Stockman's right on this one, too. True.

Other viewpoints

We checked with Ryan's office for a response to Stockman's complaints. A spokesperson describes Ryan's plan as ""common sense gradual reforms,"" and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obama's budget.

""Economic growth, combined with a real solution to rising health care costs, is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs,"" said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e-mail.

Meanwhile, we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryan's plan would also disagree with Stockman's critique. Short-term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery, they've said.

Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently: ""Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further, worsening unemployment. And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue, as the economy shrinks.""

Our ruling

Whether the deficit should be reduced quickly or slowly is no doubt a debate that will continue to burn. Stockman urges a dramatic approach to cutting spending and increasing taxes quickly, while Ryan's proposal offers a more gradual approach to cutting spending, and it doesn't advocate raising taxes. Stockman said Ryan's plan ""leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt."" Stockman is factually accurate on all these points, and we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECADB4C0>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/david-stockman/former-reagan-budget-director-says-ryans-plan-save/
"['Rhode Island', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'National Republican Congressional Committee']","
GOP Congressional Committee says U.S. borrows $4 billion a day for spending
","
Hundreds of Rhode Islanders got phone calls last week from the National Republican Congressional Committee, with a recorded message attacking U.S. Rep. David Cicilline.

Specifically, the GOP was criticizing Cicilline’s support of a Democratic budget proposal for fiscal 2012, which the Republican-controlled House defeated 166 to 259 on April 15. Similar calls were made in 22 other Congressional districts where the GOP perceives an incumbent Democrat to be vulnerable.

""Thanks to Washington’s addiction to spending, the federal government now borrows $4 billion a day,"" the recorded voice said. ""That’s given us $14 trillion in debt. And David Cicilline is making it worse. He voted for another Pelosi budget that would strangle our economy with more spending, more debt and more borrowing from China.""

Setting aside the freshman congressman’s vote on the Democrats’ proposed budget --which is a matter of public record --we wondered about that $4-billion figure, which Republicans around the country are citing in their budget battles with Democrats.

If Rhode Island were to borrow that much, in just two days it would pay for the entire proposed state budget of $7.7 billion for next year. Or it could pay for the I-Way,  the new Sakonnet River bridge and the replacement of the Route 95 viaduct in Pawtucket -- with $3 billion in pocket change.

Does the United States really borrow that much every day?

When we asked for proof of the claim, the NRCC referred us to a report by our friends at PolitiFact Florida. Turns out PolitiFact Georgia also looked into a similar claim.

First, a primer, courtesy of PolitiFact Florida. Let’s start with the difference between the ""national deficit"" and the ""national debt.""  

The deficit is the result of the government spending more in a single budget year than it takes in as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.3 trillion, according to the website of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. We've had a deficit every year since 2002.

Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a brief period at the end of President Bill Clinton's term and the start of President George W. Bush's administration, the federal government was actually operating with a surplus, according to a Congressional Research Service report.

The national debt, meanwhile, is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. That stood at $14.25 trillion on April 6, according to PolitiFact Georgia.

Its research determined that the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion a day since 2009. In 2010, the average was $4.7 billion a day. It has dropped, however, to about $2.45 billion a day so far this year.

But between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day.

Those numbers were enough to convince PolitiFact Georgia that the claim of borrowing $4 billion a day was Mostly True.   
   
PolitiFact Florida, delving into a similar matter, questioned the notion of the federal government borrowing billions every day to stay afloat.

""The actual borrowing doesn’t occur every day,"" Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, told PolitiFact Florida. ""The periodic auction of bonds, that’s when the money is raised.""

Still, PolitiFact Florida found the $4-billion figure reasonable and also went with a Mostly True ruling.

Makes sense to us. That’s why we’re going to do some borrowing ourselves, and go with our PolitiFact colleagues.

Adam Hasner says Florida judge using Islamic law in the courtroom
","
Adam Hasner may have announced he is officially running for U.S. Senate on April 26, 2011, but the former state House Republican leader had already been campaigning weeks before his announcement.

On March 20, Hasner spoke before members of South Florida 9-12, an offshoot of conservative talk show host Glenn Beck's 9-12 Movement, which aims to unite ""communities back to the place we were on 9/12/2001,"" according to the group's website.

The South Florida chapter was hosting a two-year anniversary celebration in Palm Beach County and in speaking to the group, Hasner touched upon what he called the ""warped sense of foreign policy"" held by President Barack Obama's administration.

""We cannot allow political correctness or multiculturalism or appeasement (to) cripple our defenses at home or abroad,"" Hasner said. ""Because these threats don't only exist on foreign soil, but these are threats from those who seek to destroy us from within.""

Earlier, Hasner had told the group that: ""The enemy has a name, and that name is Sharia-compliant Islam.""  (For a video of the speech, click here.)

Sharia law is the code of conduct for Muslims, based on elements of the Qur'an , teachings from the Prophet Mohammad, and centuries-old judges' rulings from Islam, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.

""A judge within the state of Florida ... in judging in the litigation between private citizens in a Florida state court, announced the decision was going to be based on Islamic Law,"" Hasner said. ""That is not supporting the U.S. Constitution, or the Constitution of the state of Florida. We need to make sure that these threats do not continue to grow and do not continue to infiltrate our state and our government.""

We wondered if Hasner was right, has a Florida judge announced that his decision was going to be based on Islamic Law?

We found a March 22, 2011, article by the St. Petersburg Times headlined ""Judge Orders Use of 'Sharia' in Suit."" We will explain the case first before we get into Hasner's comment.

The case

In November 2010, Hillsborough Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Nielsen took up a lawsuit filed against the Islamic Education Center of Tampa by former trustees.

In dispute were issues related to the corporate governance of the IEC, a learning and community center for Muslims in the Tampa Bay area. In 2002, the center changed its bylaws to eliminate a provision allowing trustees to serve for life, according to a St. Petersburg Times article.

The deposed trustees sued individual mosque leaders in 2008, arguing that they were unfairly removed. In January 2009, Ghulam Hurr Shabbiri, an Islamic scholar from Houston, came to speak at the IEC at the center’s invitation.

In speaking to some of those involved in the lawsuit, the scholar (dubbed an A’lim in Islamic culture) agreed to arbitrate the dispute matter so long as both sides agreed to drop the lawsuit and acknowledge his decision as binding.

On Dec. 28, 2009, the A’lim ruled that the trustees were removed improperly, according to the St. Petersburg Times. But the center countered that his ruling was not binding because only one of the four new trustees signed the agreement to enter into arbitration.

To sort out the mess, enter Nielsen, who oversees complex business litigation for the 13th Circuit Court of Florida in Hillsborough County. At stake in this leadership tussle is who controls $2.2 million the center received from the state, after the state used some of the center’s land for a road project.

On March 3, 2011, Nielsen, issued an order in the case in which he wrote: ""The case will proceed under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law.""

He wrote: ""Under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law, pursuant to the Qur’an brothers should try to resolve a dispute amongst themselves. When the brothers are unable to do so, they can agree to present the dispute to the greater community of brothers within the mosque or the Muslim community for resolution. If that is not done or does not result in a resolution of the dispute, the dispute is to be presented to an Islamic judge for determination, and that is or can be an A’lim.""

Nielsen went on to explain that ""the remainder of the hearing will be to determine whether Islamic dispute resolution procedures have been followed in this matter.""

Nielsen, a registered Republican appointed to the bench in 2000 by Gov. Jeb Bush and subsequently elected in 2003, soon found himself facing a firestorm of criticism from conservative bloggers and media outlets.

On March 22, 2011, he issued a five-page opinion on the case outlining his reasons for basing his decision on Islamic Law.

He noted that the Islamic Education Center is ""governed by a 'constitution' drafted by an Islamic A’lim. Part of the evidence considered by the court was a document entitled 'Organizational Structure of the Islamic Education Center of Tampa as described in its constitution which was adopted on September 25, 1993' … This document guides the operation of the IEC.""

Nielsen wrote: ""Decisional case law both in Florida and the United States Supreme Court tells us that ecclesiastical law controls certain relations between members of a religious organization, whether a church, synagogue, temple or mosque.""

The judge went on to cite a 1992 Florida District Court of Appeals ruling (Franzen v. Poulos) that said trial courts can't intervene in internal church disputes -- or synagogue, temple or mosque. He explained that the DCA ruling said the First (freedom of religion) and 14th Amendments (due process and equal protection) allow religious organizations to set their own rules and regulations, including ""creating tribunals to adjudicate disputes.""

After Nielsen’s March 3 ruling, the defendant in the case, the Islamic Center of Tampa, petitioned the Florida District Court of Appeal to intervene. The center contends that Nielsen should base his decision on state law, not religious doctrine, said their attorney Paul Thanasides.

For now, the case remains stalled until the DCA reaches its decision, Thanasides said.

Foreign law in U.S. courts

We were curious how often judges use something other than state law in ruling in American courts, so we consulted with two international law experts.

""It's much more common than you would think,"" said Markus Wagner, a professor of international law at the University of Miami's School of Law.

Wagner said that in deciding what laws to base his decisions on, a judge will look at the provisions agreed to between the two parties when they entered their contract.

""If we both sign a contract agreeing to be governed by German law, then Florida courts will interpret German law,"" Wagner said.

Wagner said the only time a judge will not consider upholding a decision based on foreign law is if it ""contravenes public policy.""

""There are certain fundamental principles that every country holds dear,"" Wagner said. For example, ""If the punishment included bodily injury, that's not our public policy. If certain rules say you may no longer speak your mind, that would go against the First Amendment rights ... Those penalties would not be enforced.""

While the use of Sharia laws in the courtroom seems to have captured the most interest from the media and bloggers, Wagner said judges can make rulings based on religious laws. But again, only if the parties involved entered into an agreement under those religious laws from the beginning.

""It happens all the time, it's just that no one writes about it,"" Wagner said. ""We could use Jewish law, Canaanite law, so long as it doesn't contravene public policy.""

We also checked with Ed Mullins, chairman of the international law section of the Florida Bar, to gauge how common it is for a judge to use foreign law in a Florida court.

""This is very common and uncontroversial,"" Mullins said. ""It's something lawyers are familiar with, but the lay person may not realize that this is very common.""

Our ruling

So back to the Hasner’s statement: In a lawsuit between private citizens, a Florida judge ""announced the decision was going to be based on Islamic Law.""

The current case is still being played out in Hillsborough County District Court, and Judge Nielsen’s own written opinions show that Hasner is correct about the judge's reliance on Islamic Law in the case. However, the judge's point is that it's not simply a dispute between two private parties. The issue involves religious law, and the legal experts support Nielsen turning to that body of law to resolve it. Whether Nielsen's decision will stand up after review by Florida District Court of Appeal is still unknown. For now, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC8D800>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-florida-judge-using-islamic-law-c/

Arianna Huffington says unemployment gains are actually from shrinking workforce, not job creation
","On the May 1, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Arianna Huffington -- founder of the liberal news and opinion website The Huffington Post -- threw some cold water on the recent drop in the unemployment rate.

Between October 2010 and March 2011 -- when unemployment measures have declined most consistently recently -- the rate has fallen from 9.7 percent to 8.8 percent. That has cheered the Obama Administration, which argues that the numbers are concrete evidence of an improving economy.

But Huffington expressed caution about what these numbers really mean, pointing out a complicating factor in how the unemployment rate is calculated -- one that raises questions about whether the administration’s optimistic interpretation is accurate.

Here’s what Huffington said: ""What's happening in the country with jobs, basically, despite the fact that supposedly, you know, we have a reduction in unemployment. We know this is really a statistical reason because of the shrinking of the actual labor force, but not any real creation of jobs.""

We’ve streamlined what Huffington said for clarity’s sake and will use that for our fact-check: Although the unemployment rate seems to be improving, she indicated, it does not reflect real job creation -- the improvement is actually caused by a shrinking labor force.

This gets a bit complicated, so bear with us.

We’ll start with the way the government’s official arbiter of employment statistics, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, calculates the unemployment rate. BLS determines how many Americans are looking for work, excluding people who have taken themselves out of the labor force, either temporarily or permanently -- for instance, if they are leaving jobs to return to school full time, taking time off to raise children, retiring, taking time to travel long-term or simply living off their savings for a stretch.

BLS takes the number of Americans who are unemployed but still looking for work and divides it by the ""workforce"" -- working Americans plus those who are jobless but looking for work. The result is the unemployment rate.

So, the unemployment rate can be shaped by two distinct factors -- the number of unemployed Americans and the number of Americans working or looking for work. If the number of jobless Americans declines and the size of the work force doesn’t change much, the unemployment rate will fall. But if the size of the workforce falls at a fast enough rate, even a decline in the number of jobless Americans can actually lead to a rising unemployment rate.

Enough with the theory -- let’s turn to the actual numbers.

Between October 2010 and March 2011, the unemployment level -- the numerator used to determine the unemployment rate -- has declined from 14,876,000 in October to 13,542,000 in March. Meanwhile, the civilian work force -- the denominator -- has declined over the same period from 153,960,000 to 153,406,000. And as we indicated, the unemployment rate has declined during that period from 9.7 percent to 8.8 percent.

So, over that period, unemployment fell by 1,334,000 people, but it did so for two separate reasons. On the one hand, 554,000 left the work force and, by the logic of the BLS statistic, were no longer counted as ""unemployed."" On the other hand, 780,000 people secured jobs.

Comparing those two numbers, then, we can say that about 0.5 of the 0.9 percentage-point decline in the unemployment rate was due to people actually getting jobs, and the remaining 0.4 points was due to people leaving the workforce, either because they gave up on their job search or for other reasons, such as retirement.

End of story? Not yet.

This calculation assumes that the labor force at least should stay the same size from month to month. In fact, economists say that to keep pace with population growth, the labor force has to grow from month to month -- according to one popular estimate, by 100,000 every month. So when the labor force declined from October to March by 554,000, that actually underestimated the migration away from the labor force. The real hit to the work force over that period was more than 1 million Americans.

This gets complicated to calculate, so economists sometimes use a different statistic instead -- the employment-to-population ratio. This shows what percentage of the 16-and-over population has a job.

The EPOP (as it’s commonly called) fell significantly during the most recent recession, meaning that a smaller share of the population held jobs. In fact, the last time labor force participation has been this low was in the mid 1980s -- a quarter-century ago.

This is the statistic that Huffington cited when we reached her. She first referred us to a blog post by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman that bemoaned the sluggish EPOP. She later followed up with a flurry of other articles and economic blog posts that made this point.

So we’re left to decide whether it’s better to trust the traditional BLS statistics or EPOP. It’s a tough call. The advantage of EPOP is that it solves the population growth problem, which is not a trivial factor, particularly when you’re talking about a span of several months. The drawback is that it counts as unemployed people who have chosen that course on a truly voluntary basis -- going back to school, raising kids and so on. That overestimates the genuine unemployment rate.

On balance, we think (and experts across the ideological spectrum tell us) that both measures are imperfect, but valid.

This leaves us with Huffington’s specific comment. The main shortcoming is in her phrasing. She says that there has ""not (been) any real creation of jobs."" There’s a legitimate argument to be made about whether the economy is creating enough jobs to keep the economy humming, but we don’t think it’s accurate to say that there’s been no job creation. Over the period we studied, the economy created 700,000-plus jobs, which is not only an increase in absolute terms but is also a pace that exceeded the amount experts say is necessary to keep up with population growth. It’s been modest job growth, perhaps, but not zero.

On the other hand, Huffington’s broader point -- that unemployment statistics can be affected by workers’ departure from the labor market -- is an important one, and one that’s often overlooked outside the world of professional economists.

No less an authority than the Federal Reserve Board of Governors took note of this reality during its March meeting. According to the minutes of the meeting, ""several participants noted that the drop in unemployment was attributable more to people withdrawing from the labor force and to fewer layoffs than to increased hiring."" ""There has been some growth in employment, but not as much as the headline-figure drop in the unemployment rate would initially suggest, and labor-force participation has dropped during the recession,"" said James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""There are caveats you could add to make the statement more complete, but as a one-sentence summary it is not far off the mark.""

Ultimately, we agree that Huffington is largely correct that the unemployment rate is affected by people leaving the workforce, not just by job creation, even if she has slightly exaggerated its extent. We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6E3A00>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/arianna-huffington/arianna-huffington-says-unemployment-gains-are-act/
"['Medicare', 'Social Security', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Rep. Eric Cantor says 10,000 baby boomers a day are becoming eligible for benefits
","
Amid the pop of champagne at the start of 2011, you many not have noticed the beginnings of a monumental event that will reshape America.

The first baby boomers turned 65. Every day this year, and for the next 18 years, multitudes more will turn 65 and begin to rely on the nation’s already-stressed entitlement programs.

Baby boomers are Americans born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their 65th birthdays mark the beginning of eligibility for Medicare and fall one year before their full qualification for Social Security.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been blanketing cable networks to promote the House GOP budget and the need for major spending cuts. His effort comes as Congress and the president grapple with both the 2012 federal budget and more immediate need to raise the debt ceiling.

Appearing on CNBC April 27, Cantor, R-Va., said ""you’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs. Ten thousand a day.""

Is Cantor’s number right?

We asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s press secretary, where the congressman came up with the figure of 10,000 seniors a day becoming eligible for entitlements. She pointed us to a series of statements and reports by the Social Security Administration.

In October 2007, when the first baby boomer claimed early retirement benefits from Social Security, the agency put out a press release. Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, qualified  for payments in January 2008, the agency said, adding that ""over the next two decades, nearly 80 million Americans will become eligible for Social Security benefits, more than 10,000 per day.""

Social Security allows recipients to start claiming benefits at age 62, though that means accepting a lower monthly payout. The full retirement age for boomers born in 1954 or earlier is 66. It then increases by two months in each of the next six birth years, with everyone born 1960 or later getting full benefits at age 67. Retirees can choose to defer payments up until they’re 70, receiving a larger monthly check in return.

The Social Security agency also referred to the 10,000-a-day statistic in its report for fiscal 2012.

The Pew Research Center highlighted the statistic in a 2010 study on baby boomers. According to Census data gathered by Pew, 76 million people were born in the United States during the generation. After subtracting those who have already died and adding immigrants born during those years, the Census estimates there are roughly 79.6 million people aged 45 to 64 in America.

If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years, then divide that by 365 days, you get 11,478. That’s the number of people, on average, who will turn 65 each day for the next 19 years. Obviously not everyone in that category will live to 65, but the math clearly gives you a figure above the 10,000-a-day cited by Cantor.

We also checked the Social Security awards given in 2010. According to the SSA, 4.05 million retired workers or survivors of deceased workers started getting payments last year. That means 11,102 people each day began receiving checks. In 2009 the number was slightly higher, at 11,436 per day.

Right now, about 8,600 people a day enter Social Security through the traditional retirement program, and another 3,000 each day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers. If the head count climbs up to 11,400 per day through the traditional program, plus another 3,000 per day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers, that’s almost a 25 percent increase in the number of Social Security beneficiaries.

And consider this: In 1950, as Social Security ramped up, there were 16 workers per recipient. Today there are 2.9 workers per recipient, and by 2041 the SSA says there will be just 2.1 workers per recipient.

Let’s review.

Rep. Eric Cantor said 10,000 Americans per day become eligible for entitlement programs, meaning Social Security and Medicare.

His number are borne out in projections and data from the Social Security Administration. During 2009 and 2010 ,the number of Social Security recipients was actually above 11,000 per day, though many of those people were not retirees.

Census data show nearly 80 million baby boomers, born over a span of 19 years. They will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare at a rate of 11,478 per day. In fact, as of May 3 an estimated 1.4 million people have turned 65 this year.

The numbers are staggering. We rate Cantor’s statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDE9380>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/eric-cantor/rep-eric-cantor-says-10000-baby-boomers-day-are-be/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Saxby Chambliss']","
U.S. Sen. Chambliss says 16,500 IRS agents needed for health reform
","
More than a year after Congress approved a health care overhaul, the debate is far from over.

Legal challenges are working their way through the courts. States are preparing for major changes. Opponents continue to rail against ""Obamacare."" Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are working to understand what it all means to them.  

When a constituent wrote a letter to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, his office replied with a three-page defense of his opposition to the law that the recipient shared with us.  

One argument concerned new tax credits, taxes and a host of other rule changes for businesses and individuals that will require new technology, administrators and paperwork to implement. This boosts the Internal Revenue Service’s workload.  

""In order to fully enforce the provisions of this bill, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that it will be required to hire an additional 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer,"" the Chambliss reply said.  

An additional 16,500 agents? That’s nearly the population of Decatur. Is this correct?

PolitiFact Georgia’s parent publication, PolitiFact National, checked related claims twice before. So has FactCheck.org, a nonprofit team that performs similar work to PolitiFact.

We found that Chambliss’ claim has led a long existence with several incarnations, all of which are misleading.

The Truth-O-Meter first ruled on a similar statement by U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican and one of at least a dozen lawmakers who made this point during last year’s fight over the legislation. He said that ""according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates"" of the health care bill.

Kirk’s attribution was misleading, PolitiFact ruled. The 16,500 actually came from an estimate from Republicans with the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation. House Republicans voted against the final health care bill.

This is what actually happened: The CBO, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, offered a cost estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years, but it suggested nothing about how those costs would translate to jobs, PolitiFact ruled. Republicans picked numbers at the high end of the CBO estimate that favor their case, the ruling concluded.   

Another problem is that even the Republicans on Ways and Means acknowledged that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs if they factored in overhead such as desks and office supplies in addition to salaries. The jobs figure is based on an estimate for the costs of benefits and payroll for a single worker.
 
PolitiFact ruled Kirk’s claim Barely True because it’s fair to assume the IRS will need to hire new employees.

The assertion continues to resurface. FactCheck.org noted that Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said it would take ""16,500 armed bureaucrats to make this program work."" It called the comment a ""wildly inaccurate claim.""

FactCheck.org also pointed out other problems. For instance, it misrepresented the Ways and Means estimates, which were for the number of potential employees. Actual IRS agents only make up a small percentage of the IRS workforce. The rest are clerks, accountants, administrators, attorneys, help-line workers and others who are not involved with enforcement. And only a small segment of agents -- law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases -- are armed.     

U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar claim in January but earned a better PolitiFact rating than Kirk did. She noted the health care bill ""may"" put those agents in charge of policing the bill, not that they would. This more careful language earned her a Half True.

After Bachmann made her statement, the IRS submitted a budget request to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2012. It includes estimates for workers it needs to begin implementation of the health care act.

We read the 159-page document and counted requests for 1,269 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes at a cost of $473.4 million. They were typically for support roles in areas such as information technology or customer service. Most were not agents.

And so we turn to Chambliss’ claim.

The attribution is incorrect. The 16,500 figure did not come from the IRS, but from Republican members of Congress who opposed the law.

That estimate was for employees, not ""agents."" And it didn’t account for overhead costs, which even the claim’s supporters acknowledged would likely lower the jobs number.

For 2012, the IRS estimate is 1,269, mostly in non-enforcement roles.

Chambliss’ statement that the IRS estimated it must ""hire an additional 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer"" to implement health care reforms not only repeated an oft-criticized, misleading claim. It got the claim wrong.

We therefore rule Chambliss’ statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE39E40>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/saxby-chambliss/us-sen-chambliss-says-16500-irs-agents-needed-heal/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says easing access to drilling would immediately reduce dependence on foreign oil
","
Except for the speculators and some investors, no one is happy with high gasoline prices. And as prices approached and then topped $4 a gallon in late April, an old debate roared with one side wanting to hold the profiteers accountable -- while the other side said it’s high time to tap America’s protected oil fields.

U.S. Sen. Rob Portman weighed in by saying that price fixing, if there is any, should be prosecuted, but that it’s also time to harness energy sources ""in our own backyard.""

""As an immediate bridge, we should increase access for oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska,"" the Ohio Republican said in his column, which ran on his Senate website as well as on RedState.com. ""This will create jobs, drive investment, and immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.""

Immediately?

Not so fast, say the experts. Pretend that environmentalists dropped all objections to drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf -- that area that lies offshore between states’ jurisdictions and the end of United States oceanic boundaries. Also pretend that the public decided its need for oil trumped what environmentalists see as the sanctity of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. Since we’re just pretending, everyone join in: Drill, baby, drill.

Then wait.

See ya around 2021.

These things take time. The process would have to start with bidding for government leases -- normally a two- to three-year process -- which could lead to the establishment of exploratory wells just to see what, exactly, lies below. Only then is it time to firm up plans for production while drilling more wells, building offshore platforms, assembling and inserting pipelines and, finally, bringing the oil to refineries.

""It’s quite a while before it can go into production, and the lag time is significant,"" Phyllis Martin, a senior energy analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Agency or EIA, told us. As a general rule, ""it could be anywhere from three to 11 years, and three is really fast-track and that’s for shallow offshore"" production with little or no need for exploration or lease negotiations.

The price differential, too, is misunderstood, she said. That’s because gasoline prices are set on the global market, and as various studies have noted, OPEC and other foreign oil producers could cut back or respond in other ways to keep prices high. ""So it’s not going to have a major impact,"" Martin said. ""There’ll be a few pennies, but not major"" savings.

Besides talking to Martin, we looked at several studies. Among the highlights:
  
Portman’s claim seemed off base when we first saw it, but that’s only because we had seen something similar to it before. It was voiced by Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, in 2008 when he was running for president and gasoline prices spiked.

A number of other GOP officeholders have repeated it in recent weeks, each wanting to lift federal drilling prohibitions more quickly and more extensively than President Barack Obama and Democrats have been willing to do.

PolitiFact ruled McCain’s claim False in 2008, noting that while some economists and energy experts agreed that producing more American oil would be good for jobs and, eventually, the trade balance, it would have no immediate effect on gasoline supply or prices.

""I have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons,"" Dr. A.F. Alhaji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, told PolitiFact nearly three years ago. ""The reality is there is no correlation between today's prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf.""

Before researching this subject, we asked a Portman spokeswoman, Christine Mangi, about the source of her boss’s claim. Her response in an e-mail:

""Sen. Portman was referring to, among other things, the situation in the Gulf. The Obama Administration was not processing deep water permits in the Gulf which contributed to a 13 percent reduction in oil production there. By freeing up our domestic, energy rich resources in a place such as the Gulf, we can immediately reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil.""

Yet Portman said nothing about the Gulf of Mexico (which accounts for about 30 percent of U.S. oil production, according to the EIA). His column took a big-picture view of energy needs and did not engage in the dispute about the government’s speed in granting permits since the BP oil spill in the Gulf in 2010.

But most of the Gulf drilling is in fact on the Outer Continental Shelf, so we asked Andy Radford, a senior policy advisor at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group, about it. He said that at a high point before the spill, the Gulf produced about 1.7 million barrels of oil a day. That’s down by 10 percent to 15 percent today, he said.

And if we had that oil now?

There would be little to no effect on prices because oil trades on a global market. India and developing nations are consuming more. Turmoil in the Middle East plays a role, too. As for the drop in the Gulf of Mexico, ""The Saudis can make that up in a few hours,"" Radford said. ""The effect would be more psychological than anything.""

In fairness, Portman spoke of reducing reliance on foreign oil, not of reducing the price. But he spoke of an ""immediate bridge"" to harnessing America’s natural resources by increasing oil production and exploration ""in energy-rich areas of our country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska."" This would ""immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil,"" he said.

All evidence is that it would not. The current reduction in oil flowing from the Gulf, which Mangi mentioned in defense of her boss’s claim, represents a tiny portion of this country’s oil output, and the reduced flow is not entirely attributable to the post-spill slowdown in issuing drilling permits. In some cases, Gulf fields were simply tapped out, ending their productive life, said Richard Charter, a senior policy advisor for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Furthermore, issuance of new permits has picked up, according to records from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. New permits can lead to more exploration, but there is no guarantee that new exploration will lead to a specific amount of oil. As we said already: It takes time.

It is noteworthy that the very day Portman’s column came out, the EIA released its annual energy outlook, saying that while U.S. consumption of liquid fuels is expected to keep rising, the import share has been falling and should keep doing so due to increases in production -- including biofuels -- and greater fuel efficiency.

That’s not to say it would or would not be worthwhile for the United States to produce even more oil over the long run. Economists and others cite potential economic, defense and trade benefits in the future. But by asserting this would produce an immediate reduction in dependence on foreign oil, Portman’s claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC720D00>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-easing-access-drilling-would-/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Dick Armey']","
Dick Armey says 49 Texas A&M University faculty have brought in more dollars than they cost over the past five years
","
In an opinion-page article, a former U.S. House majority leader from Texas poked at Texas A&M University while urging greater rewards for professors who attract research dollars.

In the April 17 Houston Chronicle, Dick Armey wrote: ""The incentives in our higher education system should attract the best professors and researchers in the world and provide our students the best education possible. Let's start by allowing researchers to keep up to 90 percent of the research dollars they generate instead of the 50 percent that is typically the limit today. Disclosing the salaries of tenured professors would be another useful reform, along with how many students they teach and how many funded research dollars they bring in.""

His A&M punchline: ""At Texas A&M University, only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years.""

Well, gig us. Is that count correct?

To our request for back-up, FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon said by email that the group is writing a detailed report making the point that ""great researchers should be rewarded for bringing in lots of research dollars, rather than having them siphoned off to support less productive researchers."" Armey chairs FreedomWorks, which says it mobilizes people for lower taxes, less government and more freedom.

Brandon’s reply continued: ""The easiest back-of-the-envelope calculation might be to assume that if a researcher brought in more funding than his salary, he would have ‘paid for himself.’ Incrementally this might be true, but neglects the full costs of running the university. To do a full cost analysis, you have to burden the compensation with overhead.""

Brandon said the latest available information, covering 2008, comes from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which describes itself as a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the federal government involving every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs.

Brandon said the data is the ""foundation for (Armey’s) analysis that only 49 (A&M) researchers paid for themselves."" Brandon said data drawn from that system show that for every $1 spent on faculty salaries, the university expended money on overhead. That is, Brandon said, each dollar of research ""creates some additional costs elsewhere in the university."" He said Armey calculated that each $1 of salary, plus 25 percent to represent the cost of benefits, must bear $2.71 of overhead. ""Running these calculations, we found that over a five-year period, only 49 researchers paid for themselves.""

We unsuccessfully sought a detailed breakdown of university spending from Armey supporting his claim.

Separately, an online search led us to articles published in September by the Bryan-College Station Eagle on a report prepared by the Texas A&M University System on the costs and contributions of faculty members in 2008-09.

As summarized in a Sept. 15 news article, the study isolated ""what a faculty member generates by teaching -- tuition paid by students and formula funding by the state based on weighted semester credit hours -- and subtracts from that the faculty member's salary and estimated cost of benefits. It doesn't take research dollars generated into account,"" the newspaper reported, though such information appears in an adjacent column.

In a memo prefacing the detailed breakdown, the chancellor of the A&M system, Michael McKinney, said it shows the ""faculty at each university generate revenue in excess of their payroll costs. University literally means totality,"" the memo says. ""Our faculties work together, some teaching many undergraduates, some teaching fewer graduate students and some providing new knowledge through research.""

Once issued, the report prompted criticisms across A&M’s flagship campus, according to the Eagle. Some complained the report’s faculty research funding tallies were off and some said salaries were overstated.

The paper quoted Jorge Vanegas, dean of the College of Architecture, saying the metric favors faculty who teach more without accounting for Texas A&M’s function as a research university. ""When numbers are taken out of their full context and they feed into misconceptions or explicit lack of recognition of what the full spectrum of academia should be, it causes a demoralizing effect on faculty,"" Vanegas said.

The Eagle reported that the A&M system removed the report from the Internet as a spokesman said the information on externally funded research continued to be refined. A few days later, the president at the College Station campus, R. Bowen Loftin, emailed faculty stating the report results wouldl not be used to ""assess the overall productivity of an individual faculty member, and it certainly does not speak to the quality of that productivity,"" the newspaper reported.

We obtained a copy of the report through an open-records’ request.

Of interest: One column in its charts shows the difference between total funds generated by each faculty member and their salary costs. We quickly counted more than 49 faculty members credited with generating more than they cost in the studied year, in just the first three of dozens of the university’s academic departments. Specifically, the report lists 21 faculty in Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication; 17 in Agricultural Economics; and 18 in Animal Science--56 total--as net income generators. In those departments, 45 teachers ran in the red, so to speak, according to the report. 
In an interview, system spokesman Jason Cook confirmed that the study did not try to assign a cost for each teacher's overhead. ""I don't know how we could do that,"" he said.

What about Armey’s statement that only 49 A&M faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead the past five years? Cook emailed us: ""We don't know how"" Armey's number was determined. Cook later said that the IPED research cited by FreedomWorks is useful to compare A&M to other institutions, but cannot be used to pinpoint how many faculty members earn their keep.

Upshot: Without access to Armey’s data, we couldn’t plumb his methodology. Meantime, our spot-check of Texas A&M’s recent study of faculty costs, which some critics said undercounted faculty contributions, suggests that way more than 49 faculty members accounted for more than they cost in 2008-09.

We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC667C40>],/factchecks/2011/may/04/dick-armey/dick-armey-says-49-texas-sam-university-faculty-ha/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Lenar  Whitney']","
Global warming is a hoax, says Louisiana congressional hopeful Lenar Whitney
","Can a 10-year-old debunk ""the greatest deception in the history of mankind?"" One congressional hopeful thinks so. A five-minute video outlining the beliefs of Republican Lenar Whitney, a Louisiana state representative running for U.S. Congress, has been making its rounds on the Internet over the past couple of days. And what does Whitney think is a big-government ""scam"" and ""conspiracy""? The video’s title says it all: ""Global Warming is a Hoax."" ""Energy security is real, global warming is not. It is merely a strategy designed to give more power to the executive branch while increasing taxes in a progressive stream to regulate every aspect of American life,"" Whitney says in the video. The video might not have received much national attention if it weren’t for a Washington Post column in which David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report called Whitney ""the most frightening candidate (he’s) met in seven years interviewing congressional hopefuls."" On top of frightening, Wasserman -- who has interviewed more than 300 congressional candidates -- called her ""fact-averse."" Whitney is running for an open seat that represents parts of Baton Rouge. The race is attracting a large field of candidates that includes former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who served time in prison for racketeering. We’ve lost track of how many times we’ve fact-checked climate change denial claims and found them to be False or Pants on Fire. (See here, here and here.) But given that it's still being talked about, we thought it was worth reviewing the evidence again. Whitney's video offers some specific pieces of evidence that are in need of debunking. The hoax We talked to several climate scientists who said Whitney’s claim was ""laughable,"" ""deeply misguided,"" ""uninformed,"" ""disgusting"" and ""absurd."" So is there a mass conspiracy to pull the wool over the world’s eyes? It seems highly unlikely, considering the numerous studies that show overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming is indisputable. Among climate researchers most actively publishing scientific articles, at least 97 percent believe in anthropogenic climate change, found one 2009 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal. The study examined published scientific articles and surveyed experts. The study says that the few ""contrarian"" scientists are a vocal, but small, minority. They also found that those scientists denying human-caused climate change tend to have less expertise in the subject than those who believe in it. Another survey out of the University of Illinois found that 82 percent of earth scientists (out of more than 3,000 respondents) believe that global temperature shifts are human-caused. Among climate-specific earth scientists who responded, 97.4 percent said they believe in human-caused climate change.    ""It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes,"" the 2009 report said. ""The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policymakers and a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists."" Beyond the surveys, there is a consensus among the world’s premier science organizations -- such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society in London -- that human-caused global warming is real, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociology professor at Oklahoma State University. (Not to mention NASA, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.) Dunlap co-authored a study published in 2013 that found a strong link between conservative think tanks and climate change denial books. It also found that a growing number of these books are produced by people with no scientific training, and nearly 90 percent of the books examined did not go through a peer review process, meaning they were not subjected to scientific scrutiny. And the consensus is not limited to just scientists. For example, Admiral James Locklear, commander of American naval forces in the Pacific, told the Boston Globe last year that climate change and rising sea levels are the biggest long-term security threat to the region. Recently, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who served under former President George W. Bush, wrote a column in the New York Times urging lawmakers to take action to combat climate change for the sake of the economy. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said there is no legitimate reason to doubt the severity of climate change. ""A true conservative would be prudent, listen to the experts and take action to address the threat,"" Jenkins said. His group aims to foster understanding about the environment among conservatives. Some conservatives say global warming is real, but has not risen to levels portrayed by the Obama administration, such as Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. Knappenberger said that what’s questionable is how much of a threat human carbon emissions pose and whether proposed regulations will do more harm than good. Climate change skeptics’ talking points have evolved since the 1990s as the scientific evidence has grown, said Dunlap, who has been studying public opinion of climate change for 20 years. They first said the Earth wasn’t warming. Then they said the Earth was warming, but it’s not caused by human activity. Now, many agree with the science, but it’s not that big of a problem. ""But in (Whitney’s) case, she’s reverting to some of the most primitive statements,"" Dunlap said. Her evidence? Whitney’s supporting evidence used in her video is too simplistic to be meaningful. Here's a few of her pieces of evidence: ""Any 10 year old can invalidate their thesis with one of the simplest scientific devices known to man: a thermometer. The Earth has done nothing but get colder each year since the film’s release,"" she said, referring to former Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 global warming film An Inconvenient Truth. Global temperatures have ""paused"" growth over the past several years, but to say this is proof global warming isn’t real is cherry-picking. As we’ve previously reported, 12 of the past 15 years have been the hottest years on record, according to NASA. Tied for the top are 2005 and 2010. (Even the source that Whitney’s campaign pointed us to agreed that there has been no significant cooling trend in the past few years.) The past 150 years have been characterized by overall warming, with intermittent periods of slowed warming or cooling, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. ""Fifty years from now, and assuming that carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at current rates, the period of slower warming from the late 1990s (of 2006) to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming,"" he said. Whitney also said, ""Last summer, Antarctica reached the coldest temperature in recorded history."" Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center did record the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth: about -135 degrees fahrenheit. But Serreze said this is one temperature taken at one location, so it has little to do with global warming. It was more a triumph of technology, because a satellite recorded the temperature remotely. And Whitney said there is ""record sheet ice and a 60 percent rise of ice in the Arctic sea."" Serreze said Whitney likely meant ""sea ice,"" which has had record highs in recent years. Sheet ice refers to land-based features, like Greenland and Antarctica. But this also doesn’t disprove global warming. Ozone depletion and greenhouse gases intensifies westerly winds and drives them south, which causes sea ice in Antarctica to extend further north, wrote Guy Williams, a sea ice specialist at the University of Tasmania, in a Washington Post column last month. In the Arctic Sea, the minimum ice extent (measured in September) for 2013 was about 50 percent higher than it was in 2012, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But 2012’s minimum ice extent was a record low in the satellite era, so even though Arctic ice extent grew, it was still far below average in 2013. Overall, sea ice (measured every September via satellite) has decreased about 13 percent each decade since 1981, Serreze said. Whitney mentions a trove of leaked emails from the University of East Anglia in England between some of the world’s leading climate scientists. She says the 2009 emails prove global warming is a ""scam,"" and scientists faked and hid data. But several investigations concluded that there was no data manipulation, despite climate change skeptics’ claims. A bonus: Jenkins pointed out that the thermometer Whitney holds up in her video is not a weather thermometer, but a medical thermometer. Our ruling Whitney said, ""global warming is a hoax."" There is an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real, and Whitney’s supporting evidence falls flat. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAF0AC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/01/lenar-whitney/republican-congressional-hopeful-says-global-warmi/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Rick Scott 'raised property taxes,' Charlie Crist says
","Sorting through this year’s gubernatorial campaign attacks has long since become taxing -- namely, who raised taxes and how much they’ve cost voters. The latest charge from Democratic challenger Charlie Crist comes from a campaign ad released July 31, 2014. In it, he attacked Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott’s budget decisions. ""Rick Scott raised property taxes,"" the ad said. A narrator doubles down on the claim, saying Scott raised ""your"" property taxes. Scott came into office promising to cut property taxes, so PolitiFact Florida thought this claim deserved an audit. Did Rick Scott raise Florida’s property taxes? We’ll budget some time to sort this one out. Taxes for schools Crist’s campaign said the claim came from a May 5, 2014, story in the Tampa Tribune detailing a projected increase in the property taxes municipalities contribute to public schools. This portion of your property tax bill, called the Required Local Effort, has been a Scott target since his 2010 campaign, when he promised to cut the rate first by one and later by two mills over seven years (we rated both Promise Broken). Both the Legislature and the governor have a say in the millage rate, which is used to calculate taxes on the assessed value of a property (one mill is equal to $1 in taxes per $1,000 in value). When Scott took office, the rate was 5.38 mills, which then went up to 5.446 in 2011, but was set at 5.18 in 2013. For 2014, Scott and the Legislature didn’t move the rate either up or down, leaving it at 5.18. Because of the way the rate is calculated, the state Department of Education in July adjusted the rate down to 5.08 mills. That’s important to note, because that means this year’s rate is actually lower than the year before. With a steady increase in property values across the state, the current rate will be bringing in more tax money than before, despite no action from the governor or lawmakers. ""If Charlie Crist is accusing us of raising property tax rates, that’s just not true,"" Scott campaign spokesperson Matt Moon told PolitiFact Florida. Instead, Crist is focusing on the higher tax revenue. The latest Florida Education Finance Program calculations from the Department of Education estimate collections for the Required Local Effort would increase by about $370 million in an $18.9 billion budget. Critics (including the Crist campaign) have equated that rise in collections with a tax increase. Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact Florida ""inaction is also an action. And in this case, Rick Scott’s actions raised taxes."" If that’s the case, the same logic could apply to Crist. The campaign doesn’t mention that Crist also oversaw changes in both the tax rate and collections from the Required Local Effort. We checked the rates and collections going back to before former Gov. Crist took office in 2007 and found that Crist also saw ups and downs among both. Fiscal year budget RLE millage tax rate Governor RLE tax collections 2006-07 5.01 Jeb Bush $7.3 billion 2007-08 4.84 Crist $7.9 billion 2008-09 5.136 Crist $8.24 billion 2009-10 5.288 Crist $7.8 billion 2010-11 5.38 Crist $7.19 billion 2011-12 5.446 Scott $6.9 billion 2012-13 5.295 Scott $6.7 billion 2013-14 5.18 Scott $6.8 billion 2014-15 5.08 Scott $7.17 billion   Most notable is 2007, Crist’s first year, when the budget lowered the tax rate. But because of increasing taxable values just before the Great Recession, tax collections still went up. In subsequent years, Crist-era budgets kept raising the tax rate but saw falling collections by the end of his term. The current rate and projected collections under Scott are both less than they were during Crist’s last approved budget. Our ruling Crist said, ""Rick Scott raised property taxes."" As Florida homeowners know, the taxes they pay are based on both tax rates and what the current property values are. What Crist means is that because taxable values are rising, collections from school property taxes are going up, even though the tax rate for the Required Local Effort is not going up. Scott did sign a budget his first year that briefly raised those rates, but collections dropped anyway -- a phenomenon that happened to Crist, as well. Even as collections are projected to increase, both the rates and tax revenue are now less than when Scott took office. Collections are increasing because property values are going up after a historic recession and loss of real estate values. Given all these factors, we rate Crist’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB08DC0>],/factchecks/2014/aug/01/charlie-crist/rick-scott-raised-property-taxes-charlie-crist-say/
"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'GeorgiaCarry.org']","
Gun group's church violence stats can't be verified
","It’s been a month since House Bill 60 became law and cleared the way for Georgians to carry concealed weapons in several new venues – all bars, many government buildings and, generating the most news coverage, churches that allow it. Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org --- a pro-gun group that advocates for fewer gun restrictions --- repeated a strikingly high and somewhat specific number in defending allowing guns in sanctuaries. More than 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property since 1999, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting this spring. A reader questioned that figure shortly after the bill became law on July 1. We decided it was a worthy target for the AJC Truth-O-Meter. Already, PolitiFact found flaws in a specific count from the other side of the gun debate. Everytown for Gun Safety claimed there were 74 school shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook, a tally that included incidents such as a teacher who committed suicide in a school parking lot overnight. We rated that claim Mostly False. Henry told PolitiFact Georgia that he relied on two specific websites, Cops and Cross and Carl Chinn's church security site, for the statistic. He used the term church generically, to cover all houses of worship. Cops and Cross is run by Jimmy Meeks, a former police officer who teaches church safety across the country. A recent banner on the site listed more than 470 ""violent deaths on church and faith-based property since 1999,"" but does not include sources for those figures. Instead, it directs users to the site run by Carl Chinn, a former building engineer for Focus on the Family. Chinn was among responders when a gunman took four people hostage at the conservative Christian group’s headquarters, and later surrendered, in 1996. Chinn said in an email that he relies on news reports, official records and blog items for his figures. Many incidents have multiple sources. That count, though, includes broad incidents not likely to be considered attacks. For instance, the first page of incidents for 2014 show at least two suicides on church property that, according to news reports, are not connected to the house of worship. GeorgiaCarry.org’s claim could also not be backed up with unimpeachable data elsewhere. The Centers for Disease Control found that the majority of the 166 deaths that occurred at houses of worship between 2003 and 2011 were suicides. But the National Violent Death Reporting System covers only 17 states, including Georgia. The CDC cannot provide specific numbers on suicides from the total figure, a spokeswoman said, because that sample is too small. That means the figures are not nationally representative and cannot be used to create an estimate to verify or refute Chinn’s numbers. There is similar incomplete coverage from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, with only about 38 percent of Uniform Crime Reporting agencies providing information, according to the FBI. Without more data, the FBI cannot verify the statistic. The federal government has generally stopped funding such research over political battles between gun control advocates and gun rights advocates. Several prominent social scientists have asked that barriers to firearms research be lifted, and President Obama has signed an executive order for the CDC to research causes and prevention of gun violence. Without reliable statistics, Chinn’s data could be the best approximation of data available. And although advocates often speak with more certainty than data supports, David Kopel, the research director at the Libertarian-leaning Independence Institute, said there is value in stories behind some of the numbers. Anecdotally, backers of Georgia’s law need only to point to Matthew Murray, who killed two missionaries in a Colorado church’s mission training center in 2007, Kopel said. Murray continued his spree by killing two more people at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. A congregant volunteering to help with security shot Murray, who then took his own life. There have been incidents closer to home. In July 2012, two people were killed in a shootout with each other outside a funeral at Victory for the World Church near Stone Mountain. In October of that year, Floyd Palmer gunned down Greg McDowell as he led a prayer at World Changers Church International in College Park. Palmer also was charged in 2001 with shooting a man outside a Maryland mosque. ""Are there incidents where someone comes into church with a gun, with the intent to commit suicide? I’m sure,"" said Clayton Cramer, an adjunct history professor at the College of Western Idaho who specializes in firearm history. ""How often? We don’t know."" ""Until such time that we have some real, hard data,"" Cramer added, ""the best thing to say is, there are examples where a churchgoer having a gun during a confrontation mattered or would have mattered,"" And that is where the claim of specific counts falls short. The data has some value in capturing the number of attacks on or at religious institutions. But there is no way to remove suicides from the death counts to ensure a more strict definition of attacks as understood by the general public. Without that ability, even a claim with some truth gives the wrong impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAFCD40>],/factchecks/2014/aug/01/georgiacarryorg-georgiacarryorg/gun-groups-church-violence-stats-cant-be-verified/
"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'George Will']","
Are Oregon's three largest employers, and 13 of the top 25, health-care providers?
","Syndicated newspaper columnist George Will weighed in recently on Oregon’s U.S. Senate race pitting incumbent Democrat Jeff Merkley against Republican challenger Monica Wehby. Will tossed a lot of numbers into his piece, including President Barack Obama’s approval rating in the state (43 percent), how many years Wehby has been a physician (17 out of her 52) and, curiously, how many X chromosomes the doctor has (2). The claim: Because the U.S. Senate has only three physicians, one of whom is retiring, Wehby’s knowledge of health care is sorely needed in that body, Will wrote. The same phenomenon is true in Oregon, he added, whose economy is dominated by large health care companies. The state’s ""three largest employers, and 13 of the top 25, are health care providers,"" he wrote. PolitiFact Oregon checked those statistics. The analysis: We clicked the Internet link Will included in the column. It took us to a chart labeled, ""State Profile: Largest Employers -- Oregon."" The chart, according to information on the bottom of the page, was prepared by an Oklahoma-based company called Infogroup. The first part of Will’s claim asserted that Oregon’s three largest employers are health care providers, so we started there. The chart he relied on puts Doernbecher Children’s Hospital at the top with 14,000 employees. The second and third spots belong to Oregon Health & Science University (12,000) and ""Cancer Center/OHSU Cancer"" (10,000). We emailed Todd Murphy, OHSU’s senior communications specialist. The institution’s most recent monthly report, for June 2014, put total employment at 14,616, he wrote back. Importantly, he noted that Doernbecher and the Knight Cancer Institute ""would be included in that number (both entities a fairly small portion of that 14,000)."" So Will’s ""top three"" are just one employer -- and it’s not the state’s largest in any case. That distinction is usually given to chipmaker Intel, which the Infogroup chart lists at No. 5 with 6,300 employees. We emailed Chelsea Hossaini, Intel’s Northwest Region communications manager. ""That claim is incorrect,"" she wrote of the chart. ""Intel is Oregon’s largest private employer with 17,500."" It should be noted that the chart Will highlighted included both public and private companies. Regardless, Intel far overshadows OHSU on total employment. Next, to check the second part of Will’s claim, we looked at some of the other ""top 25"" on the Infogroup chart to see if the listings were accurate. Many weren’t. The chart shows the University of Oregon at No. 11, for example, with 4,350 employees. However, the university’s information office wrote us that the correct figure, as of last fall, should be 5,105. The chart shows 4,000 employees at Lane Community College. But according to college spokeswoman Joan Aschim, LCC had only 1,128 contract employees as of Oct. 31. Numbers for other health care providers were also askew. Providence Portland Medical Center, at No. 18, has 3,408 employees, according to the chart. But Gary Walker, Providence Health & Service’s public affairs director, said that number gets close to employment at only one Providence facility in Oregon. Statewide, he said, the figure is closer to 18,500. (That figure puts Providence ahead of Intel, which calls itself the state’s largest private employer. However, Providence’s status as a nonprofit often puts the two companies on different lists.) St. Charles Health System in Bend has about 1,000 more employees than the 2,400 listed, hospital officials said. The 3,000 employees listed for Salem Hospital should be 3,949, said Mark Glyzewski, a hospital public relations consultant. Then there is Espresso PRN at No. 17, with 3,500 listed employees. In reality, Espresso PRN is a coffee shop with locations inside both of PeaceHealth’s Eugene-area hospitals, said Sonja Davis, the outfit’s general manager. It employs about two dozen, she said. The chart also lists 10,500 employees for PeaceHealth facilities in Oregon. The real number is 5,930, said Jim Godbold, a company spokesman. We talked to Jim Winner, vice president of Infogroup’s government section. ""We obviously have some counts there that aren’t correct,"" Winner said. In instances such as the OHSU-Doernbecher-Knight Cancer Institute tallies, he added, ""it looks like we double and tripled counted."" He said he would send a note to his ""data compilation folks"" so they could revisit the statistics. Next we set out to find information on the true top 25 companies to glean how many are health care providers. As it turns out, no definitive list exists. Sometimes company sizes are tracked by revenue, sometimes by employment. Most lists track public or private employers, not both. Sometimes the state of Oregon is considered the top public employer; other times government jobs are listed by agency or not at all. The Oregon Business Journal has its own list of the top 25 companies, for example, but its scope is limited to privately held businesses in the Portland metro area. We emailed Nick Beleiciks, a state of Oregon employment economist, to see what figures he had. He sent us a list compiled in 2013 by Michael Meyers, the economist with Business Oregon, a state agency. The list has weaknesses: It doesn’t contain overall numbers for employment in Oregon by the state or federal governments, and it was drawn from several sources. In addition, on the lower end of the list, some Oregon businesses that should have been included, according to PolitiFact Oregon research, are absent. Still, the numbers it does have square with information available elsewhere, and it’s the most authoritative combined list of Oregon’s top public and private employers that we could find. Meyers’ top three businesses are Providence Health System (17,000), Intel (16,200) and Fred Meyer (14,000). Providence and Intel both say they have more employees than that now, and to be fair, the list is a year old. Still, those numbers are close to what our check found. Among Meyers’ top 25 are four health care providers, not the 13 Will cited. PolitiFact Oregon’s check of the Infogroup list found, once errors were eliminated, that nine of the 13 listed qualify. But big Oregon employers, such as Roseburg Forest Products, aren’t on the list. If they were, they would bump one or two of those out of the top 25. In the end, while we couldn’t compile a definitive list showing the number of health care providers among Oregon’s top 25 employers, our research did show that the Infogroup list is incorrect. Last, we emailed Will at his Washington, D.C., office to say we’d found significant errors in the chart he relied on for his Wehby column. ""We do anticipate the running of an addendum in the near future to provide clarity about the employer information that was provided by Infogroup,"" came an unsigned reply from Will’s staff. The ruling:    Will, in a column supporting the candidacy of Republican Senate candidate Monica Wehby, included a link purporting to show Oregon’s 25 largest employers. The chart, he wrote, indicated that the dominance of large health care providers in Oregon -- the three largest employers and 13 of the top 25 in the state fit that niche, according to the chart -- make Dr. Wehby the best choice for the job. Calls and emails to many of the companies listed, however, indicate that the chart’s numbers are way off, often wildly so. The top three employers on the list Will used are, in fact, a single entity. And by our count, the highest number of health care providers that can rank among Oregon’s top 25 employers is nine, not the 13 Will cited. We rate the claim False.

Tapper: More Palestinian children killed in 3 weeks than Israeli soldiers in 8 years
","Gaza’s casualties have piled up much faster than Israel’s since bombs began flying three weeks ago, and on July 29’s The Lead, CNN host Jake Tapper put the disparity in context during an interview with Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev. ""If my calculations are right,"" Tapper said, ""Israel has, in the last three weeks, killed more Palestinian children, more than 200, than the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006, which includes the Second Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead, Operation Pillar of Defense, and now Operation Protective Edge."" ""At what point does the Israeli government say, enough, we’re killing too many innocent children?"" Regev gave an example of the grief the deaths are causing Israeli officials, but reiterated what Israel has been saying for weeks: Hamas is responsible for using civilians as human shields. Tapper’s tough line of questioning made some waves online, so we wanted to break down his claim about the casualties out of Israel and Gaza. Gazan child deaths Looking at the number of Palestinian children killed in the last three weeks is relatively simple -- virtually every major news organization has been referring to the United Nation’s figures, which we have little reason to doubt. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs issues a daily report on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which includes a tally of total deaths, civilian deaths and child deaths, gathered by combining reports from Palestinian authorities -- not Hamas -- and the bodies their own agents have seen in Gaza. The UN’s July 31 report puts the total Palestinian death toll at 1,263, including at least 852 civilians and 249 children. On July 29, when Tapper made his claim, the UN reported 229 child deaths. So Tapper’s estimate that ""more than 200"" Palestinian children are dead is accurate. Whether you can attribute all the deaths directly to Israel, however, is more of an open debate. Palestinian and Israeli officials have blamed each other’s bombs for some of the civilian deaths -- for example, the 15 Palestinians killed at a UN school in Jabalia on July 24. When Tapper went on air, the UN had not yet been able to definitively resolve their conflicting claims, although they’ve since traced the mortal shell to Israel. Other children have died during gunfights between the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and Hamas, and it’s impossible to say definitively whose bullets killed them. Israeli military deaths Tracing deaths in the IDF back eight years takes a little more work. Tapper told us he looked at the Israeli government’s figures on casualties for their four major military operations since 2006: Conflict Dates Summary Israeli military deaths The Second Lebanon War July 12 – Aug. 14, 2006 Militants from Hezbollah -- a Shiite Muslim group considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and EU -- took Israeli soldiers hostage at the Israel-Lebanon border. After negotiations and a rescue attempt failed, Israel bombed Lebanon, sent ground troops, and imposed air and naval blockades. Hezbollah responded with rockets and guerilla warfare. 119 Operation Cast Lead Dec. 27, 2008 – Jan. 18, 2009 Israel bombed and subsequently launched a campaign into Gaza, ostensibly to stop rocket fire and weapon smuggling by Palestinian militants, including Hamas. 9 Operation Pillar of Defense Nov. 14 – 21, 2012 Israel unleashed a series of airstrikes on Gaza, ostensibly to stop rocket fire by Palestinian militants, including Hamas. 1 Operation Protective Edge July 8, 2014 – present After the collapse of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the kidnapping and murder of both Israeli and Palestinian teenagers, increased rocket fire from Hamas, and skirmishes in the West Bank, Israel bombed and subsequently launched a military operation into Gaza. 43 (56 as of July 31) 
That adds up to 172 deaths, and Tapper correctly accounted for the major Israeli military operations since 2006. These figures, Tapper told us, ""provide an important sense of just how large these Gaza children death numbers are -- more than all the IDF troops killed in action the Israeli government deemed necessary to protect its country in the last eight years combined."" Besides the four operations above, three confrontations between Gaza and Israel have caused Israeli military casualties: Operations Summer Rain and Autumn Clouds in 2006, and Operation Hot Winter in 2008, which in total resulted in the deaths of eight Israeli soldiers. That takes us up to 180 deaths in what the IDF has publicly named ""operations."" We found a few other Israeli military deaths that likely should be added to any tally. In 2008, two Israeli soldiers were returned dead after being kidnapped during the Second Lebanon War, and an IDF soldier was killed by a Hamas bomb during Operation Cast Lead. An additional 34 on-duty soldiers and four off-duty soldiers also have died in terrorist attacks since 2006 (all the attacks were from Palestinians). Including them takes the total to 221 Israeli soldier deaths, compared to the deaths of 229 Palestinian children. Our ruling Tapper, while grilling an Israeli spokesman, said, ""Israel has, in the last three weeks, killed more Palestinian children, more than 200, than the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006."" His figure for Palestinian child deaths comes from the United Nations. According to humanitarian workers on the ground, more than 200 Palestinian children have died in the last three weeks from the Israel-Hamas conflict, though it’s not clear in every case whether the Israeli bullets and bombs are directly responsible. That is indeed more than the number of Israeli soldiers killed since 2006 while engaged in military operations, our review found. Tapper’s numbers are accurate, but there remains some question about who bears responsibility for the deaths of every Palestinian child. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E8A21F00>],/factchecks/2014/jul/31/jake-tapper/tapper-more-palestinian-children-killed-3-weeks-is/

Jackson Lee says 'we did not seek an impeachment of President Bush' but she co-sponsored '08 bill
","As Congress’ August recess loomed, partisan skirmishing reached a crescendo, with the U.S. House approving, on a near-party-line vote, a lawsuit against President Barack Obama on the grounds that he had overstepped his constitutional authority. Democrats, noting past statements by some Republicans in Congress, raised the specter of the president being impeached, though Republican House leaders insisted that impeachment wasn’t an option. During the floor debate over authorizing the lawsuit against Obama, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, suggested that Democrats had the moral high ground. Even though some Democrats had thought that President George W. Bush had abused his authority when he initiated the Iraq War, the House, while under Democratic control in 2007 and 2008, did not impeach him. The current resolution to authorize a lawsuit, Jackson Lee said in a floor speech on July 30, 2014, ""smacks against the Constitution, which says there are three equal branches of government. Therefore, the executive has the right to perform his duties. I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution for it is, in fact, a veiled attempt for impeachment, and it undermines the law that allows the president to do his job. It is a historical fact that President Bush pushed this nation into a war that had little to do with apprehending terrorists. We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush because as an executive, he had his authority. President Obama has the authority."" A reader asked us to check whether it’s accurate for Jackson Lee to say, ""We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush."" So we took a closer look. Jackson Lee, it turns out, is an imperfect vehicle for making this charge. Here’s the problem: A dozen House Democrats in 2008 did introduce a resolution seeking the impeachment of Bush. And Jackson Lee was one of the measure’s 11 co-sponsors. The measure in question was H. Res. 1258, introduced by then-Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, on June 10, 2008. The resolution -- a 167-page laundry list of criticisms -- accused Bush of ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" citing numerous ""abuses of power"" related to his prosecution of the war in Iraq and the fight against global terrorism, among other topics. If Jackson Lee means to define ""we"" as the Democratic caucus as a whole, she has a point. The resolution never gained wide support among the Democrats, even though they controlled Congress at the time. The bill died quietly in committee. Pelosi explained her thinking about the impeachment resolution in a July 2008 interview on ABC's The View. ""I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country,"" she said. ""We have to create jobs, expand healthcare, protect the American people and educate our children. And you can’t do that if you’re trying to impeach the President at the same time, unless you have the goods that this president committed crimes."" Even so, it seems odd to hear Jackson Lee saying ""we did not seek"" impeachment when she, in fact, was a co-sponsor of a measure that sought precisely that. When we reached out to Jackson Lee’s office, communications director Michael J. McQuerry said, ""the Congresswoman was stating that the Democrats did not try to impeach President Bush over executive orders."" However, we looked through Jackson Lee’s floor speech and saw no references to executive orders. For that matter, the specific target of the House GOP’s lawsuit -- administrative changes to delay the effective date of the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate -- did not take the form of an executive order, either, although Republicans have been critical of some of Obama’s executive orders more generally. Further undercutting Jackson Lee’s explanation, the 2008 impeachment resolution she co-sponsored did address executive orders twice: • It quoted then-Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., saying the Bush administration's ""shroud of secrecy extends to agency rules and executive pronouncements, such as executive orders, that carry the force of law. Through the diligent efforts of my colleague, Sen. (Sheldon) Whitehouse (D-R.I), we have learned that (the Office of Legal Counsel) has taken the position that a president can ‘waive’ or ‘modify’ a published executive order without any notice to the public or Congress -- simply by not following it.'"" • Citing a 2007 article from the Washington Post, the resolution said that Mike McConnell, Bush’s director of national intelligence, in a letter to the late Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, ""acknowledged that Bush's executive order in 2001 authorized a series of secret surveillance activities and included undisclosed activities beyond the warrantless surveillance of emails and phone calls that Bush confirmed in December 2005."" Our ruling Jackson Lee said, ""We did not seek an impeachment of President Bush."" She has a point that neither the House nor a majority of the Democratic caucus sought Bush’s impeachment. However, a dozen Democratic lawmakers did -- including Jackson Lee herself. It seems hypocritical of the congresswoman to seize the moral high ground -- essentially saying that her party gallantly went against self-interest by declining to seek Bush’s impeachment -- when in fact she personally had sought precisely that outcome. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDDE1600>],/factchecks/2014/jul/31/sheila-jackson-lee/rep-sheila-jackson-lee-d-texas-says-we-did-not-see/

Rick Perry recaps arrests of men from Ukraine, but it's not a country with strong terrorist ties
","Gov. Rick Perry has talked up his decision to dispatch up to 1,000 National Guard members to the Texas-Mexico border by suggesting people crossing the border are wreaking havoc. In a July 23, 2014, interview by Sean Hannity of Fox News, Perry brought up a state tally of non-citizens booked into Texas county jails who, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, have racked up thousands of criminal charges. The day of the Hannity interview, we rated as Pants on Fire Perry's claim that ""illegal aliens"" had committed over 3,000 homicides in six years; the posted information didn’t support that. Beyond crimes, Hannity said to Perry, the more important aspect of actions along the border ""is Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria. They’re catching people from these countries crossing our border. ""That concerns me,"" Hannity said. ""That’s a national security issue. Reaction?"" ""As we shared with you,"" Perry replied, ""the comptroller of public accounts, Susan Combs, who has a ranch out in far West Texas; on her ranch last week, there were three Ukraine individuals that were apprehended on that ranch. So we’re seeing, obviously, individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended as well as individuals who are committing crimes against the citizens of our state."" Perry’s mention of arrestees from Ukraine, where a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane was shot down near the Ukraine-Russia border on July 17, 2014, and his reference to countries with strong terrorist ties made us wonder. We looked into the described arrests before checking the Eastern European country’s terrorist ties. Three men from Ukraine Chris Bryan, a Combs spokesman, said by phone that according to Combs, several individuals from Ukraine were apprehended on a neighbor’s ranch after likely walking across her ranch. Both spreads are in remote Brewster County, which borders Mexico. A June 15, 2014, Facebook post by that county’s sheriff’s office states early that Sunday, Sheriff Ronny Dodson fielded a call from a rancher saying three men, posing as lost hikers and tourists, had walked up to his house and asked to use his phone. According to the post, the men ran off after the rancher offered to call the sheriff. The chase was on, according to the post, with two men landing in custody after a ""lengthy search"" and the third man getting pinned in a box canyon. ""It appears that all three individuals had entered into Mexico and crossed the border to gain illegal entry into the United States,"" the office said, adding the men were being held on several state charges.  A June 16, 2014, news story posted online by Odessa’s CBS 7 quoted Dodson as saying the men were trying to reach a friend staying in Alpine who was supposed to ferry them to Seattle, Wash. ""The officers were not able to apprehend the man who was their getaway,"" the story said. The sheriff’s office June 16, 2014, offense report on the arrests, which we obtained via an open-records’ request, said Homeland Security was contacted after it was discovered the men, ranging in age from 26 to 35, were in the country illegally from Ukraine. By phone, Dodson told us one of the men spoke English well and told him the trio hailed from Ukraine. They remain in the county jail, he said, though Brewster County doesn’t plan to press state charges. So, Perry was correct that three Ukrainians were arrested on a West Texas ranch, though he had the wrong ranch and his time frame was slightly off. Fresh charges, past convictions Next, Daryl Fields, a San Antonio-based spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office that has jurisdiction over the area, emailed us federal complaints and indictments indicating two of the men were previously deported Ukraine nationals newly indicted for re-entering the country without legal permission: Vadim Odorozhenko and Igor Yaroslavovuch Kotsiuba. According to the complaints, each man also had previously been convicted of crimes in the U.S. Odorozhenko ""is an aggravated felon by virtue of his convictions for kidnapping, unlawful use of a weapon, and assault in the second degree and assault in the third degree,"" the complaint against him states. Our search using the LexisNexis database yielded indications Odorzhenko drew his convictions and served prison time in Oregon. By telephone, Jessica Freeburn of the Oregon Department of Corrections told us Odorozhenko was in a state prison from mid-August 2005 to Nov. 4, 2011. She said he was then paroled but records indicate he was picked up by immigration officers on Oct. 16, 2012. Separately by email, an ICE spokeswoman, El Paso-based Leticia Zamarripa, citing an ""ongoing investigation,"" declined to say whether he was later deported. According to the complaint against Kotsiuba, he ""is an aggravated felon by virtue of his convictions for the distribution of narcotics, assault and burglary."" A LexisNexis search turned up nothing about him. A complaint charging Oleskii Storozhuk, the third alleged border-crosser, with entering the U.S. without legal permission was dropped, Fields said, but he ""remains in custody as a material witness."" Fields said by phone a fourth man, Igor Davidyuk, was charged with alien smuggling after his arrest in Washington state subsequent to the Texas arrests. Ukraine has terrorist ties? Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 after which the U.S. established diplomatic relations, according to the State Department. Of late, it’s been roiled by conflict with Russian separatists who want their Russian-speaking provinces to become part of Russia. But Ukraine isn’t among nations the U. S. considers state sponsors of terrorism nor was it listed among countries described by the government in 2013 as terrorist safe havens. Texas experts agreed Ukraine lacks terrorist ties. By email, Sergiy Kudelia, a Baylor University political scientist, said: ""Generally speaking, there are no organizations or groups operating in Ukraine today that are recognized by the U.S. government (or the European Union) as terrorist organizations."" After we pointed out a July 21, 2014, news report quoting Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko as saying he considers the Russian separatists to be terrorists, Kudelia said neither the U.S. or E.U. has embraced that characterization. By phone, Texas Tech University political scientist Frank Thames said he doesn’t think Russian separatists ""are particularly interested in sending people to the United States through the southern border. I wouldn’t make that link."" Our ruling Perry said three Ukrainians recently captured on a West Texas ranch are among ""individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended"" near the border with Mexico. This shakes out as half right. Three men from Ukraine were captured on a West Texas ranch in June 2014 (though Perry had the wrong ranch and his date was off a bit) after allegedly crossing the Rio Grande into Texas. However, Ukraine isn’t considered a country with terrorist ties. And while two of the men had prior U.S. criminal records, none has or had been charged with terrorism or related crimes. In contrast, Perry cited their arrests in the context of national security and terrorism. We rate this statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. UPDATE, 3:24 P.M. July 31, 2014: This story was amended to indicate one man was imprisoned in Oregon, not Washington, and to provide additional related detail.

Carlos Curbelo 'opposes the repeal of Obamacare,' says attack ad
","Republicans have a shot at winning back one South Florida congressional district: the seat held by U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, who ousted scandal-plagued GOPer David Rivera in 2012. Miami-Dade school board member Carlos Curbelo is the frontrunner in fundraising and establishment endorsements in a crowded GOP primary set for Aug. 26, 2014. That makes him the target of some of his opponents, including Ed MacDougall, the mayor of Cutler Bay. MacDougall portrays Curbelo as a Democrat -- a serious charge in a GOP primary (though overall the Miami-Dade/Monroe district now leans to the left.) In both a flier and a radio ad in Spanish, MacDougall portrays Curbelo as a defender of the Affordable Care Act, the law pushed by Democrats and President Barack Obama. On radio the narrator says, ""Se opone a la apelación de Obamacare."" (Our translation is ""he opposes the appeal of Obamacare"" but the ad is trying to refer to the ""repeal"" of Obamacare.) MacDougall is trying to get the votes of Republicans who support repeal. When we contacted MacDougall’s campaign, we received this response about his position: ""Obamacare must be repealed, with no strings attached."" Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, has voted more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare as a symbolic protest to the legislation. The Democratic-led Senate has refused to vote on the House bill. We decided to fact-check if Curbelo opposes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Curbelo’s statements A spokesman for MacDougall pointed to a December 2013 Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog for Curbelo’s comments related to repeal. The blog related to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that accused Curbelo of being part of ""obsessive repeal efforts"" to get rid of the health care law. The Miami Herald interviewed Curbelo and politics reporter Marc Caputo wrote: ""Curbelo, in an email, suggested the ad is misleading because he doesn't want full repeal: ‘I support substituting Obamacare with legislation that genuinely makes healthcare affordable for all - including those with pre-existing conditions - and that does not punish low income earners and those that employ them.’ "" We found other statements in which Curbelo was highly critical of the health care law but didn’t mention whether he wants to repeal it. In his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in March, Curbelo portrayed the law as a jobs-killer: ""Under this law, workers are discouraged from seeking the jobs that they need and employers are encouraged to suppress employee hours. ... Obamacare is just the most recent example of the left’s misguided policies that close the path of upward social mobility for those that have the desire to grow and achieve more for themselves and their families."" On his campaign website, Curbelo states that the law: ""has increased the cost of healthcare for millions of Americans and is threatening our economic recovery. A law that gives the IRS an outsized role in our healthcare system, considers 30 hours a full work week, and cuts funding for Medicare is at best, deeply flawed."" The Miami Herald editorial board questionnaire asked respondents if they support the law and Curbelo replied ""no,"" but he did not specifically use the word ""repeal."" Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida in an email, ""I clearly do not support the law and think it is bad policy. ... However I prefer to use the word ‘replace’ or ‘substitute’ Obamacare because to just say ‘repeal’ implies that there is no need for health care reform. But yes, if we replace or substitute Obamacare, that means it would no longer exist."" While he wants to replace the law, he agrees with at least a couple of policy goals within it that we asked him about. ""I agree with extending access to the health care system to people with pre-existing conditions. I believe that to be a worthy policy goal. I do not agree with the inefficient manner in which the ACA achieves that goal. I do not oppose letting young people stay on their family’s plans a little longer. 26 is probably too long – maybe 23 or 24. We have to remember there is a cost to all of this."" Curbelo directed us to a a couple of sentences in an interview he gave in January to a Spanish-language show a Fondo. We translated the line this way: ""Ideally, we need to get rid of/eliminate this law and start over, but that's not going to happen. So we need to sit down and rewrite the bad parts of this law."") Our ruling MacDougall said that Curbelo ""opposes the repeal of Obamacare."" MacDougall points to an interview Curbelo gave in December in which he said he was against total repeal but wanted to replace the law. In subsequent interviews, Curbelo called for a substantial overhaul of the law. MacDougall’s statement could leave voters with the false impression that Curbelo is a straight-up supporter of the health care law. Curbelo supports at least a couple of policy goals in the law -- such as providing coverage to those with pre-existing conditions -- but overall he is  very critical of the law. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC63E740>],/factchecks/2014/jul/31/ed-macdougall/carlos-curbelo-opposes-repeal-obamacare-says-attac/

Nancy Pelosi says U.S. House 'has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history'
","The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to sue President Barack Obama for allegedly overstepping the powers of his office. While the suit raises thorny legal questions about the limits of presidential power, it’s also being used by both sides to fire up their base in advance of the midterm elections. The suit, spearheaded by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was approved largely along party lines. Democrats argued that it’s an example of the Republican majority playing politics rather than tackling urgent policy issues, such as immigration. Indeed, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used the looming vote to approve the suit in a recent fundraising pitch, as reported by NBC News. ""Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president,"" Pelosi wrote. ""The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step."" We wondered whether Pelosi is correct that ""the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history."" We found that she’s right the House as a whole has never sued the president. However, we think it’s worth noting that individual lawmakers and groups of lawmakers have sued the president in the past -- frequently. In fact, we found at least 14 instances in the last four decades alone. This doesn’t make Pelosi’s carefully worded claim inaccurate, but it's worth adding important context. We should note that these challenges to presidential authority generally failed, particularly challenges over whether Congress or the president has the right to initiate military action. Often, the suits’ Achilles heel was the courts’ determination that the lawmakers lacked the ""standing"" -- basically, a demonstrable injury -- to file such a suit. This succession of negative rulings for Congress has presented the plaintiffs against Obama with an uphill legal climb, analysts say. Here’s a rundown of the 14 lawsuits we found: • Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities vs. Nixon (1974). This was one of the Watergate-era cases involving what evidence President Richard Nixon had to turn over to investigators that heightened the pressure on Nixon to resign. • Drummond vs. Bunker (1977). William R. Drummond, a citizen of the Panama Canal Zone, sued President Jimmy Carter to stop his administration from negotiating about handing over the then-U.S.-held canal zone to Panama, arguing that only Congress possessed that right. Six members of Congress intervened in the case alongside Drummond, arguing that the executive branch was depriving them of their constitutionally protected vote. • Goldwater vs. Carter (1979). Several lawmakers, led by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., sued Carter, arguing that the president had bypassed Congress by ending a defense pact with Taiwan. • Crockett vs. Reagan (1982). Sixteen senators and 13 House members asked a federal court to rule that the dispatching of several dozen U.S. military personnel to El Salvador by President Ronald Reagan contradicted Congress’s war powers and the Foreign Assistance Act. • Sanchez-Espinoza vs. Reagan (1983). Twelve House members joined with 12 Nicaraguan citizens and two American citizens seeking damages and a declaration that Reagan had violated war powers restrictions by pursuing the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. • Conyers vs. Reagan (1984). Eleven House members sued Reagan, arguing that his use of military force in Grenada had usurped Congress’s war powers. • Lowry vs. Reagan (1987). Ten House members sued Reagan on war powers grounds, this time over the president’s approval of escort operations for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. • Dellums vs. Bush (1990). One senator and 53 House members sued President George H.W. Bush to stop him from attacking Iraq without approval from Congress during the run-up to what became the Persian Gulf War. • Raines vs. Byrd (1997). Six members of Congress who had voted against giving the president the authority to veto individual items in bills -- rather than just entire bills -- sued over the act’s constitutionality. • Chenoweth vs. Clinton (1999). Four House members sued President Bill Clinton over his creation by executive order of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, saying it exceeded his authority as president. • Campbell vs. Clinton (2000). Thirty-one members of Congress sued Clinton on war powers grounds for his decision to send military forces to participate in a NATO-organized campaign of airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia. • Kucinich vs. Bush (2002). Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, sued President George W. Bush over the administration’s unilateral withdrawal from an anti-ballistic missile treaty, arguing that the executive branch could not do that without Congress’ consent. • Doe vs. Bush (2003). Twelve House members joined with several dozen servicemembers and their families to sue Bush on war-powers grounds, seeking to stop a United States-led invasion of Iraq. • Kucinich vs. Obama (2011). Kucinich also sued Bush’s successor, Obama, on war-powers grounds, saying that his intervention in Libya was unconstitutional. Drew Hammill, a spokesman Pelosi, said her statement is ""accurate"" because ""she is clearly referring to the ‘House of Representatives,’ not individual members of Congress."" Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Pelosi has some justification for singling out a lawsuit by the whole House. Having a majority of the House on board ""suggests the grievance may be more legitimate,"" Roosevelt said, though he added that this scenario also ""suggests that the House should be able to use the powers the Constitution gives it -- our familiar system of checks and balances -- rather than trying to enlist the judiciary in a political struggle."" Still, while Pelosi’s claim is literally accurate, legal observers suggested that her careful wording selectively downplays a long history of clashes between the two branches of government. Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying that Pelosi’s statement is ""technically accurate,"" but ""misleading"" ""Typically, suits are brought against other executive branch officials, rather than the president directly,"" she said. Stan Brand, a veteran Washington attorney who served as general counsel to the U.S. House under the late Speaker Thomas P. ""Tip"" O'Neill, D-Mass., said, ""It may be that the House as an institution has never sued a president, but undoubtedly there have been cases where challenges to presidential actions have occurred. I am not impressed by the claim that this is the first such suit, because it elevates form over substance. The much more interesting issues for me are the jurisprudential separation-of-powers implications of such litigation."" Our ruling Pelosi said ""the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history."" We did find a long record of skirmishing between the legislative and executive branches over the limits of each branch’s power, including at least 14 suits over the past four decades filed by individual lawmakers or groups of lawmakers. But Pelosi said ""the House of Representatives,"" and in her narrowly crafted claim, she’s right.

Cory Gardner says Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Colorado
","President Barack Obama’s indefinite delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has become a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans as the midterm election season heats up. In the Colorado Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall recently voted against Congress fast-tracking the pipeline, but said the administration’s review process should continue. His likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, has called for swift approval, insisting it would be an economic boon to the state. In an interview on Univision Radio, a primarily Spanish-language station, Gardner accused Senate Democrats of holding up the pipeline to placate environmentalists in an election year. ""The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs,"" Gardner said. ""Not only where the pipeline is being built, good-paying construction jobs, but manufacturing and service opportunities in Colorado along with the Keystone Pipeline. We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."" The planned route for the pipeline, which would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries, doesn’t go through Colorado. So we wondered if it was possible that ""thousands"" of jobs would be created by the pipeline there. We asked Gardner’s staff for the source of his claim. Spokesman Alex Siciliano pointed us to the written testimony of Gary Mar, who represented Alberta, Canada, in Washington and spoke at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing in February 2011. Mar cites a 2009 study from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that estimates over 15 years ""the development of Alberta’s oil sands will boost U.S. GDP by an average of $31 billion per year, creating over 624,000 jobs in the U.S."" We couldn’t find the original study, but a chart Mar appended to his testimony says Colorado would see 11,200 jobs between 2009 and 2025, about half of which would have come between 2011 and 2015. The chart, however, looks at the economic impact of the entire Alberta oil sands on the United States, not just the Keystone XL pipeline. In a subsequent 2011 study, the Canadian Energy Research Institute claimed job growth as a result of the oil sands could reach 600,000 in the United States, but only if existing pipelines were expanded and other projects came to fruition. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Energy Research Institute also said those numbers did not look at the economic benefits of the pipeline, but ""only the benefits from upstream production of oil sands."" Basically, it’s not measuring the benefit from the pipeline itself, rather the study estimates the effects of Canada being able to increase its capacity to produce oil. The study Siciliano showed us is also from 2009. As TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, told us previously, ""The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application."" TransCanada has stopped touting its own study on the the economic benefits of the pipeline from from the same time period, which estimated about 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, and another 118,000 spin-off jobs. Instead, in an email to PolitiFact this week, TransCanada pointed us to the State Department’s analysis of the project. According to that study, the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create the equivalent of 16,100 jobs if the project took one year. If the job lasted two years, the equivalent of 8,050 people would be employed over the course of the project. Of those jobs, 5,400 would be in states where the pipeline and support infrastructure will actually get built — Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The rest of those direct jobs would be created in other states. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project — 30,000 of which would be outside the aforementioned four states. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). How many of those 30,000 temporary jobs would be in Colorado? It’s not clear from the State Department study, and a spokeswoman for the department said it wasn’t available. Ian Goodman, who co-authored a Cornell University study of the pipeline, said it’s unlikely that Colorado’s chunk of those 30,000 jobs would reach the thousands. Though Colorado could see some benefits from being in a state proximate to the pipeline, it is not expected to be a major supplier to the construction. ""Most of these jobs would be in the states along the pipeline routing and most of the remainder would be in states heavily involved in the spin offs — pipeline supply chain and/or providing goods and services for Keystone XL workers,"" Goodman said. ""Colorado is not likely to have a big roles in these spin-offs. So it is hard to see how Colorado could be getting thousands of jobs from Keystone XL."" Goodman also said TransCanada has already spent about one-third of the pipeline's budget on engineering, design, permitting, and equipment and materials already procured and manufactured. That means that some jobs and economic development from that part of the project have already been realized. In a rosy scenario, Goodman estimated that at most 1,400 additional jobs could be created in Colorado, but more likely it will be less, perhaps closer to 500. As we’ve noted in the past, too, almost all of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Our ruling Gardner said, ""We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."" Gardner based that statement off an old study that measured the overall impact of the Alberta oil sands on the U.S. economy, not the Keystone XL pipeline specifically. The State Department study cited by the company building the pipeline estimates that the equivalent of 30,000 direct, indirect and induced temporary jobs will be created in states outside the pipeline’s projected route. However, it doesn’t specify how many of those would be created in Colorado. We rate Gardner’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAE3480>],/factchecks/2014/jul/31/cory-gardner/cory-gardner-says-keystone-xl-pipeline-would-creat/

MSNBC's O'Donnell: Republicans want to 'repeal' 2008 Bush immigration law
","One of President George W. Bush’s last acts in office was signing the non-controversial William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which contained a provision guaranteeing formal deportation hearings for child immigrants not from Mexico and Canada and without family in the United States. This guaranteed hearing is now at the center of the crisis on our southern border, as thousands of children stream into this country from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. On the July 23 edition of Last Word, MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell pointed to discussion of the 2008 Bush law as an example of the ""misinformation"" Republicans are spreading on immigration. O’Donnell played a clip where Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., implies that the 2008 law -- which was intended to provide protection for victims of sex trafficking -- shouldn’t apply to the children presently crossing the border. There’s no evidence, Brooks said, that ""this 60-to-90,000 illegal alien children mass that has come to America are coming here to be sex slaves or something of that nature."" O’Donnell took Brooks’ statement to what he saw as a logical conclusion. ""One of the positions that these Republicans are holding,"" O’Donnell said, ""is that they want to repeal the law that President Bush signed, which is about protecting children from sex trafficking. So they want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking."" We were skeptical that the Republican position is to repeal the 2008 law entirely, so we decided to dig deeper. What happens when a child arrives at the border When unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada are apprehended at the border, they’re screened by Border Patrol within 48 hours to determine whether they are victims of trafficking or have credible asylum claims. Those that do get a formal hearing, and those that don’t are bussed back, often within 12 hours of their arrival. The process for children from other countries starts the same, with an initial Border Patrol screening. But the 2008 law mandates that these children -- most of them from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- are sent to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) after their screening, regardless of whether or not they have asylum claims. 
 The HHS subjects these children to a more thorough medical check, and then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) transports them to a HHS shelter. From there, the children are released to relatives or other sponsors to await their guaranteed hearings. These hearings often don’t occur, though, for years, and shelters are getting overcrowded -- this is what pundits are referring to the immigration crisis. Compared to the roughly 3,000 non-Mexican minors apprehended at the border in 2009, the tens of thousands of minors crossing the border now are simply too much for the DHS and HHS to process. Laws are complicated While the provision dictating border policy is getting most of the attention, there’s more to the 2008 law. It also renewed funding for a 2000 anti-trafficking bill and laid out plans for sanctions and research to combat trafficking. There’s an ongoing debate about whether the Obama administration is properly enforcing the letter of the 2008 law. Conservatives and groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter immigration enforcement, say the 2008 law guarantees hearings only for ""unaccompanied alien children"" who do not have parents or legal guardians in the United States. Yet, according to the center, up to 77 percent of non-Mexican children arriving at the border without family members are being released to family members within the United States. These children, they argue, shouldn’t be eligible for a hearing. It’s unclear to what extent the 2008 law is the cause of the backlog of children -- but as we’ve addressed elsewhere, it’s certainly a major factor. What Republicans have proposed O’Donnell is right insofar that Republicans have honed in on the 2008 law as a major source of the current immigration crisis. But the prevailing thought among Republicans is that the law should be amended, not repealed. House Speaker John Boehner said July 17 that Congress couldn’t ""begin to mitigate the problem"" at the border ""if you don’t do something about the ‘08 law that’s being abused. And it is being abused."" The only Republican we found saying the law should be repealed is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ""We insist on having the 2008 law repealed as part of"" any immigration bill, McCain said on July 11. Senate Democrats, he said, are ""not willing to do that."" But it is fairly clear McCain misspoke. Legislation proposed by McCain and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., specifically calls for amending the 2008 law, not repealing it, and McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told us on July 30 that McCain wants to amend the 2008 law.  Other formal proposals from the GOP all call for revising, not repealing the 2008 law. Some Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., also support revising the law. There have been nine proposals related to the 2008 law from Republicans in the Senate and the House. And, according to Grant Newman of immigration research group NumbersUSA, all of these proposals involve amending the 2008 law, albeit in different ways. There have been no formal proposals, Newman said, for repeal. ""Most of the Republican attempts, their whole goal is to try to treat children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and in some cases, any child, like we treat Mexican nationals, where we can expedite removal,"" Newman said. A proposal by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, for example, would eliminate the distinction between countries of origin. Under their proposal, called the HUMANE Act, all children -- not just those from Mexico and Canada -- would be screened by the Border Patrol within 48 hours, and those without claims to amnesty or evidence that they’ve been trafficked would be removed as soon as possible, like Mexicans are under current law. Children who pass the Border Patrol screening would be submitted to a second screening within seven days in front of a judge, with a higher burden of proof than the Border Patrol screening but a lower burden than a formal hearing. Migrants who meet that burden of proof would be sent to the HHS to await a formal hearing as in current law, and migrants who don’t would be removed. A House GOP working group formed by Boehner and led by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, has released similar recommendations. The working group recommended an amendment to the 2008 law ""so all unaccompanied minors are treated the same as Mexicans for the purpose of removals."" So the Republicans who want to change the 2008 law have all proposed revisions, not repeal. It’s worth noting that Congress rarely repeals laws in full -- they’re too complicated for that -- but O’Donnell still mischaracterized Republicans’ stance on the 2008 law. Protections for trafficking victims O’Donnell does, though, have something of a point that Republicans are removing protections for victims of sex trafficking. Opponents of the Republican proposals about the 2008 law break mainly into partisan camps. According to NumbersUSA, many Republicans are unconvinced that the 2008 law even applies to the surge children, the majority of whom aren’t ""unaccompanied alien children"" under federal law. The burden to fix the immigration crisis, they say, falls solely on the executive branch. Democratic opponents of these proposals -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- have pointed instead their injustice towards child migrants. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., for example, criticized the HUMANE Act, saying it ""undermines the due process rights of a child that exists under existing law."" And advocates from Texas immigration rights group LUPE criticized the HUMANE Act on the grounds that it doesn’t provide children enough time to open up to officials. They gave the example of Sara, a sex-trafficking victim who wasn’t identified as such until she spoke to a social worker two months into her detention. Under the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal, they said, Sara would have been sent back to her abusers. But while proposals to revise the 2008 law may get rid of some safeguards for victims of sex trafficking, they don’t get rid of all of them. Current law gives immigrants from Mexico the opportunity to make their case when screened, and Republican proposals would give Central American children at least that much protection. The GOP working group’s recommendations, for example, would give children who don’t want to be returned to their home countries a screening by child welfare professionals and an expedited removal hearing within seven days after that screening. Our ruling O’Donnell took a soundbite from Republican congressman Mo Brooks to mean that Republicans ""want to repeal the law that President Bush signed"" in 2008 to protect victims of sex trafficking. O’Donnell concluded that Republicans ""want to be on record as not wanting to protect children from this kind of sex trafficking."" Republicans want to amend, not repeal the 2008 law. But it’s an open debate what these changes would mean for victims of sex trafficking. These proposals leave Central American children with some protections, but without what human rights advocates have characterized as a major protection. We rate O’Donnell’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA98D80>],/factchecks/2014/jul/31/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-odonnell-republicans-want-repeal-2008-bush-/

David Alameel misfires on claim John Cornyn ""decided to dodge his draft""
","David Alameel, the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee in Texas, told delegates to his party’s convention that he joined the military when his Republican foe, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, was ducking the Vietnam War. Alameel, a wealthy investor, said in June 2014: ""My wife and I struggled. There were times when we couldn’t even afford to buy milk for our baby. … So I joined the military at a time in the early 1970s when John Cornyn decided to dodge his draft simply to go to college."" A day earlier, according to a news blog post by Jonathan Tilove of the Austin American-Statesman, Alameel told the party’s veterans caucus: ""I served and Cornyn refused to serve. He sent a letter, `I can’t serve because I'm simply going to go to college.’"" Draft dodger – the term conjures up images of Americans unwilling to serve their country and sneaking off to Canada or faking injuries or pulling strings to avoid military service. Then again, according to a 1993 book on the draft by George Q. Flynn, more than 2 million college-going men put off being drafted in the era by seeking and receiving student deferments from the government that legally sheltered them as long as they stayed in school and kept up grades. Cornyn, who received his bachelor’s degree from San Antonio’s Trinity University in 1973, has said he was among them. Alameel declines to elaborate Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn’s campaign, asked us to review Alameel’s claim. For starters, we asked Alameel, who served in the Army in 1974-77, how he reached his assessment. Sergio Cantu, an Alameel spokesman, said by email the campaign would discuss ""Cornyn’s draft dodging at the appropriate time."" Earlier, Cornyn’s campaign said he had a student deferment in his Trinity years, according to a July 4, 2014, Statesman news story. How the draft worked PolitiFact New Jersey said in a 2013 fact-check the draft was in place for young men from August 1964 through December 1972. In the end, some 25 percent of the 6 million men who served during the Vietnam conflict were draftees, Flynn said in his book. Generally, men who received a draft notice in the mail had about three weeks to return paperwork requesting a hearing for a deferment, a Selective Service System spokesman advised. A local draft board decided whether to grant any requested waiver. ""For the Vietnam war and World War II, any time there was a draft, there were classifications of deferments,"" Pat Schuback of the Selective Service System said. ""If you were eligible for it, you were entitled to claim that deferment."" Another factor emerged. Flynn wrote that President Richard Nixon, with congressional approval, launched an annual lottery in November 1969 that was pitched as randomizing which men were most likely to be called up through the draft. Cornyn’s draft status Cornyn has previously said he landed a low draft lottery number, 28, which meant he was likely to be called up, according to a Sept. 29, 2002, Associated Press news story. According to a Selective Service System web page, that number went to every man with Cornyn’s birth date, Feb. 2, 1952. After that August 1971 lottery, anyone with a lottery number of 95 or lower and who was classified as available for military service was called to report for possible induction, the page says. But Cornyn, on the verge of his junior year at Trinity, wasn’t classified as available for service. In 2002, he said he’d sought a student deferment. ""I thought college was important,"" Cornyn said, ""and I think certainly I would have been willing to go if we had continued to have a draft at the end of my college deferment."" To our inquiries, Selective Service emailed us a form showing Cornyn, listing his occupation as a Trinity student, registered for the draft as he turned 18 in February 1970. We also fielded an undated Selective Service roster with handwritten entries for Cornyn and more than 25 other draft registrants showing how each man was annually classified by the government. The Cornyn entry on the roster states he initially fielded a 2-S (student) deferment on April 15, 1970 and that status was renewed in October 1970 and November 1971, or about three months after he drew his lottery number. According to the document, though, Cornyn was classified as 1-A, or available immediately for military service, on Nov. 17, 1972 before being classified as 2-S afresh on Jan. 18, 1973, a few months before he fielded his degree. Meantime, Nixon, who sought an all-volunteer Army, had announced in June 1972 that no more draftees would be sent to Vietnam, Flynn wrote in his book. Did Cornyn dodge draft? After the Democratic convention, Alameel told the Statesman he had a copy of Cornyn’s letter (which Alameel did not make public) saying he couldn’t serve because he was going to college. Alameel said the letter was the standard student deferment request. ""That’s the standard definition of dodging the draft — `I want a deferment, and I want to go to college’ — and then he never went back,"" Alameel said. ""He didn’t say, `Give me four years, and I’ll come back and serve.’ ""I don’t know how else to define that,"" Alameel said. Alameel’s definition of a draft dodger isn’t generally embraced. Schuback previously told PolitiFact New Jersey a draft dodger isn’t someone who received a legitimate and legal deferment from military service. ""A draft dodger is someone who got drafted and has then fled, or it also might be a person who made a statement by not registering (for the draft),"" he said. We reached out to historian Michael S. Foley, author of a book on draft resistance during the Vietnam War. By email, Foley said that before the draft lottery began, seeking and receiving a student deferment was ""totally legal and millions of men did it. That’s not draft dodging, certainly not in the way that emigrating to Canada or faking a physical/mental ailment or getting an influential father to pull strings with the draft board would be considered draft dodging."" On the other hand, Foley said, if ""you believe that every draft-age man should have made himself available for service during the Vietnam War, then that means 20+ million men were draft dodgers -- a pretty extreme view."" Foley also viewed the documents we’d fielded touching on Cornyn’s Selective Service history. He then wondered, by email, how Cornyn could have still not been drafted despite getting a low lottery number. We asked Selective Service about that. By email, Schuback provided the agency’s summary of changes in regulations after Nixon signed a September 1971 act into law described in Flynn’s book as giving the president the discretion to phase out student deferments. According to the summary, men who had qualified for a student deferment in the regular 1970-71 school year would ""be able to obtain deferments"" going forward at least ""until they graduate."" Cornyn (who got his lottery number after that school year) fit that description, according to the documents we received. The summary went on to say men not qualified for a student deferment in 1970-71 would not be qualified to get one going forward. Our ruling Alameel said Cornyn ""dodged"" the draft during the Vietnam War. This claim puts no stock in Cornyn registering for the draft and qualifying for student deferments, which many men eligible for service took. These men weren’t draft dodgers in the conventional sense of that term; none fled the country or the like. A government document even suggests Cornyn was briefly classified as available for immediate service. Alameel offered nothing but mention of Cornyn seeking a deferment as the basis of his claim which, all told, we find factually unsupported and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Scott Walker says Mary Burke's deal to help Abbott Laboratories was a $25 million waste
","In July 2014, Gov. Scott Walker’s re-election campaign targeted a so-far failed effort begun by challenger Mary Burke to lure a major Illinois-based drug company to expand in the Kenosha area. Now Walker’s back on the air with another TV ad related to that economic development deal. In mid-July we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that Burke, as state commerce chief in 2006, spent more than $12 million for land to help Abbott Laboratories even though the firm had presented ""no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin."" Federal Housing and Urban Development officials who provided the $12 million to Wisconsin concluded that the Commerce Department never got a written commitment from Abbott. Now they want the money back. In the new ad, Walker contends that Burke’s economic development strategy in the Abbott case ""could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million"" in ""wasted"" funds. But how can a $12.3 million deal become $25 million lost? The deal itself The Walker ads focus on a March 2006 announcement by Burke and then-Gov. Jim Doyle of a $12.5 million forgivable loan funded with federal money, specifically community development block grant funds. The money was to buy a 40-acre parcel in order to block a truck-stop development that local officials thought would discourage Abbott’s development of 500 acres the firm had acquired in Kenosha County for a potential corporate campus. Under a complex agreement with the state Commerce Department, the funds were passed through the Village of Pleasant Prairie to an arm of the Kenosha Area Business Alliance. The business alliance then used the funds to buy and hold two parcels for Abbott, with a proviso that the land could not go to Abbott unless the company showed -- by 2016 -- that it would create at least 2,400 jobs. Ultimately, $12.3 million, not $12.5 million, went for the deal. Eight years later, with two years left on that deadline, Abbott hasn’t made its contemplated Wisconsin move a reality. And HUD has declared that the project -- which it called a ""speculative land banking venture"" -- was ineligible for block grant funding in the first place. The state will pay half the $12.3 million back in cash, and the other half will come in a reduction of future block grant money to the state. The campaign’s math We spoke to Tom Evenson, a Walker campaign spokesman, about the ad’s claim that ""taxpayers"" could be out $25 million through the $12.3 million deal. He said that Walker views it as the state ""paying twice"" -- $12.3 million it has to repay, and the lost economic development the money could have generated if it had been used differently at the time. That ""opportunity cost"" argument is problematic for several reasons. The ad presents the math in concrete terms -- ""taxpayer"" dollars. And no matter how you cut it, the $12.3 million is being counted twice. So what are taxpayers out so far, and what are the possible outcomes when the smoke finally clears on this deal? The federal government put up the $12.3 million, but is getting the money back. State taxpayers didn’t provide the $12.3 million in the first place, but they will fork over $6.15 million in cash to repay HUD. The $6.15 million in lost future block grants from the feds means Wisconsin loses whatever benefit they might have provided. But state taxpayers don’t necessarily have to replace the lost federal funds with state funds. So depending on how you score that last item, the tab so far is either $6.15 million or $12.3 million. In the end, the total could be smaller. Under the Burke-signed deal, if no Abbott development occurs, the 40 acres could be sold and thereby generate some cash to offset the $12.3 million cost. The land is now assessed at about $6.7 million, according to local officials. The final proceeds to the state, though could be reduced to less than $3 million, however, because the agreement called for local officials to be reimbursed for paying taxes and utilities and other costs associated with the land. They say they have spent $3.9 million on those items. If the land can’t be sold, of course, there’s no offset to the state’s $12.3 million bill, or the locals’ $3.9 million. Either way, though, the hard numbers don’t approach $25 million. Finally, what about ""wasted?"" Walker’s math rests in part on the assumption that Burke’s deal never had a chance, in 2006 or now, to succeed. It looks like a faint hope now, though the land has been and is ready for development. And HUD’s criticisms fuel the notion that the deal, done in an election year for Doyle, was a pie-in-the-sky notion from the start. On the other hand, Commerce Department records show that Abbott’s interest developed over several years as it bought up 500 acres and dealt quietly with officials in a project they code-named ""Project Doo Dah."" Local officials came to the state to ask for help in buying up what it saw as a crucial final puzzle piece to attract Abbott and up to 12,000 jobs. At one point in late 2004, local officials were told that Abbott was choosing between Wisconsin and one other place for its expansion, according to a November 2004 email between Pleasant Prairie and business alliance officials. And Walker’s own administrators argued to HUD in 2013 that buying the vacant land ""has allowed the (Village of Pleasant Prairie) to remove slum and blight from the area and has created an environment in which Abbott Laboratories will want to move forward and construct their campus."" It also opened the door to major spin-off development, including Uline's new corporate headquarters and distribution facility that already employ more than 850, Lisa Marks, Walker’s housing administrator, wrote to HUD. Our rating Walker’s ad says that Mary Burke ""wasted 12.5 million dollars on a vacant lot,"" a move that ""could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million."" The spot greatly exaggerates the real taxpayer costs and ignores the Walker administration’s own praise to HUD for the project.

Ad says Bruce Braley was raising money during a veterans affairs hearing
","Attackers say U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, skipped an important Veterans Affairs Committee hearing to raise money for his campaign, but Braley says that’s not true. Braley ""skipped an astonishing 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings. He even skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers,"" says the television ad from Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with funding linked to the Koch brothers. Braley is running against Republican Joni Ernst for the U.S. Senate seat held by Tom Harkin, and veterans affairs are in the news because of delayed access to health care. We looked at whether Braley skipped 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings. We rated that Mostly True, because Braley did miss close to that amount. However, Braley said he did not skip a hearing to raise money, so we’re checking that claim here. A matter of scheduling The ad refers to a Sept. 20, 2012, meeting titled, ""Reviewing VA’s Performance and Accountability."" According to the official record, Braley was not present. The hearing touched on a number of issues within the Veterans Administration, such as mental health and homelessness. The issue of delayed care came up in terms of mental health and acquiring prosthetics, but it was not the focus (though issues with wait times had already surfaced in 2012). We asked Braley’s campaign why he was absent, and they said he was at a House Oversight and Government Reform hearing about Fast and Furious, in which federal agents traced weapons sold and brought into Mexico. The Sept. 20, 2012, hearing examined a report issued by the Justice Department’s inspector general. Braley was then a member of the oversight committee, and the transcript from that day’s hearing says he was present. The two hearings took place at roughly the same time in different buildings. The oversight hearing began at 9:36 a.m., and the VA hearing started at 10:19 a.m. Some have pointed out that footage of the hearing shows Braley’s empty seat during the oversight hearing. And he did not make any comments at the hearing, according to the transcript. In this screenshot of hearing footage, Braley’s seat (bottom, far left of the screen) is empty at 10:17. It’s possible he was there for part of the time, though, because the camera was not always pointed at his seat.  Braley’s campaign said he did attend three fundraisers that day, but they did not conflict with the hearings. One took place from 8:30-9:30 a.m., the next a noon luncheon (the Fast and Furious hearing ended at about 12:30) and the last a reception at 6:30 p.m. Even though it was a tight schedule, his fundraisers would not have stopped him from attending one of the hearings for at least part of the time. Our ruling An ad said Braley ""skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers."" He had three fundraisers the same day, but none overlapped with the veterans affairs committee hearing. He was counted as present at an oversight hearing about Fast and Furious that happened at the same time.

","Congressional oversight of veterans affairs isn’t looking so good in light of news about the VA and delayed access to health care. Now U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat running for Senate in Iowa, is getting bad press for missing a large number of committee hearings. Braley is running against Republican Joni Ernst for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Tom Harkin. But the television ad attacking him comes from Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with funding linked to the Koch brothers. Braley ""skipped an astonishing 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings. He even skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers,"" the ad says. That number sounded high to us, so we decided to check it out. Separately, we looked at whether he skipped a hearing to attend three fundraisers (more on that in a bit). What did he miss? Concerned Veterans said the missed meetings happened between 2011 and 2012 -- the years he was on the committee. There were 21 hearings of the full committee during those two years, according to a list maintained by the U.S. Government Printing Office. We went through all 21 transcripts and found that Braley was present for only five hearings. This means Braley missed about 76 percent of the hearings.That’s pretty close to 79 percent. This number doesn’t give quite a full picture of Braley’s participation. He’s a member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, which has hearings of its own. In the same 2011-12 time frame, there were 17 subcommittee hearings, and Braley was at 15 of them. Adding up the full committee and subcommittee hearings, Braley could have attended 38 hearings. He was present at 20 of them, which is an attendance rate of 53 percent and an absent rate of 47 percent. Why did he miss them? We asked Braley’s campaign why he missed so many meetings, and they pointed to several conflicting hearings and other responsibilities that explained his whereabouts for five of the full commitee hearings.  For example, on April 5, 2011, he attended a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (of which he was also a member) on the cost of postal service workers. The hearing took place at the same time as the VA committee hearing that day. During a May 3, 2011, hearing, he was meeting with Andrew Connelly, a disabled veteran from Iowa who spoke later that day at an Economic Opportunity subcommittee hearing, where Braley was also present. And on the morning of June 6, 2012, Braley met with another wounded veteran from Iowa at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Virginia instead of attending a hearing. The Concerned Veterans for America ad says he missed the meeting on Sept. 20, 2012, for three fundraisers, but we found that to be Mostly False. He was actually at an oversight committee hearing about Fast and Furious, in which federal agents traced weapons sold and brought into Mexico. Two of the hearings -- Aug. 13, 2012, and Oct. 3, 2012 -- only had two or three representatives in attendance. The Aug. 13 hearing took place in Orlando, and the only representatives there were Chairman Jeff Miller, Corinne Brown and Gus Bilirakis -- all from Florida. On Oct. 3, the House was not in session, so many representatives were not in Washington. Committee hearings are rarely well-attended, unless the members of Congress think it will get public attention, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Representatives have busy schedules and have to allocate their time accordingly. They might decide that a particular hearing is not as important as another hearing, meeting with constituents or raising money for their next campaign. ""Given that Braley has a high attendance rate for his subcommittee assignment, that strikes me as evidence of taking his committee responsibility seriously,"" Binder said. Is this normal? We wondered if it’s normal for a member of Congress to miss so many committee hearings, so we calculated the attendance ratings for all 26 members of the VA committee in 2011-12. Eleven members, Braley included, were absent for more than 50 percent of full committee hearings. The only representative with perfect attendance was Miller, the chairman. Here are the three representatives with attendance records as bad or worse than Braley’s: Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., missed 76 percent; Mark Amodei, R-Nev., missed 80 percent; Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., missed 86 percent. We compiled the attendance records for all 26 members, see them here. Braley also had the highest attendance other than the chair for the Economic Opportunity subcommittee, missing only 12 percent of those hearings. Four of the subcommittee’s nine members were absent for more than 50 percent of all subcommittee hearings. Our ruling A Concerned Veterans ad said Braley ""skipped an astonishing 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings."" When we analyzed the hearing transcripts, we found that he had missed about 76 percent of all 2011 and 2012 full committee hearings. He did, however, attend almost all of his subcommittee hearings. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9D1840>],/factchecks/2014/jul/30/concerned-veterans-america/how-many-veterans-affairs-hearings-did-bruce-brale/

Florida women make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes, Crist says
","Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Charlie Crist has started outlining what he wants to change about Florida, and he’s starting with how much women earn. ""Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes,"" Crist said in a campaign email sent out July 29, 2014, the same day he announced his First Day of Fairness plan. The plan outlines a series of executive orders Crist promised to make on his first day in office if he is elected. The potential orders promote causes like government transparency, raising the minimum wage among businesses contracted with the state, and, in this case, ending gender wage discrimination for employees of those contractors. PolitiFact has checked many claims about women making less than men, especially the past few years. Is Crist right about them making only 83 cents on the dollar in Florida, or is he short-changing voters? Time to check the paychecks. Measuring the gap The Crist campaign told us they took the figure from an April 2013 release by the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington-based a think tank focusing on women’s issues. The factsheet reads, ""In Florida, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $33,823 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $40,951 per year. This means that women in Florida are paid 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,128 between men and women who work full time in the state."" Those numbers are from a larger report by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2011 American Community Survey, which estimated median annual earnings for men and women who worked full-time, year-round over the prior 12 months. It’s worth noting right now that this data has already been revised. An April 2014 release from the same think tank updated the numbers from the 2012 Census survey estimates that Floridian women are making 84 cents on the dollar. That’s not what we’d consider a huge increase, but it still is a discrepancy compared to Crist’s claim. (His campaign didn’t tell us why they used the lower number.) But the Census Bureau isn’t the only federal agency that tracks income data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures in terms of weekly wages, not yearly. Unlike the Census Bureau, this method does not account for people who are self-employed, but it does include some people not measured in the Census Bureau’s annual figures, like some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. These BLS numbers show that Florida women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $668 in 2011, which was 84 percent of men’s median weekly earnings. That edged up slightly to 85 percent in 2012. Nationally, the comparable figures from 2012 show a similar pattern: Census shows the gap at about 77 cents, while BLS says women make 82 percent of what men make. Both evaluations say Floridian men and women make less than the national median income, although the gender wage gap is marginally smaller. Why is that? There are several reasons, and none of them are flattering for Florida. Alayne Unterberger, associate research director at Florida International University’s Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy, said there’s a high level of working, single mothers in Florida, and they tend to have less education and fewer quality job opportunities. The National Women’s Law Center says almost 66 percent of Florida women make $10.10 an hour or less, and that while men only need a high school degree to move out of low-wage earning status, women usually require at least a bachelor’s degree. The slightly better wage gap is only because men in Florida are likelier to earn less than the national average at a greater rate than the state's women are, shrinking the difference. ""Historically in Florida both male and female wages have been depressed,"" Unterberger said. She pointed out that a study FIU published in 2014 found that the wage gap has only decreased about 1.8 percent since 1990. ""We haven’t done a very good job of narrowing that gap over the years."" Using 2013 mean wages (not median), the FIU study adjusted for age, education level and occupation. It found that overall, women in Florida make about 82 cents on the dollar compared to men. Caveats apply to what all these evaluations actually show. Gender wage gaps nationally are different from occupation to occupation, as the Institute for Women’s Policy Research showed in its report on the top 20 occupations for women for 2011. While the gap was lesser in fields like nursing (96 cents to every dollar) and cashiering (90 cents), it was higher in accounting (77 cents) and financial advising (66 cents). While discrimination is partly to blame, another factor is that men and women historically enter different occupational fields at different rates, a trend known as ""occupational segregation."" The Institute showed that women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, for example, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and software engineers. That means overall, women are more often employed in lower-paying fields than are men. Women also disproportionately earn college degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and take more time off work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. That trend, though lessened by increased male involvement in child rearing, often restricts women’s career options and hours worked. Our ruling Crist said, ""Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes."" The figure came from a think tank using 2011 Census annual median wage data, and was bumped up a penny to 84 cents for 2012 in its latest statement on the issue. While there are other ways to evaluate the difference between what each gender earns, with several reasons why that’s the case, the Census numbers are one widely accepted measure. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBF6E00>],/factchecks/2014/jul/30/charlie-crist/florida-women-make-83-cents-ever-dollar-man-makes-/

RT's Peter Lavelle says he doesn't allow conspiracy theories on his show, then utters one
","Peter Lavelle hosts CrossTalk on RT, an English language cable news network funded by the Russian government. Lavelle opens each edition of CrossTalk by saying it’s a place ""where all things are considered."" Everything except, he says, conspiracy theories. Lavelle’s commentary on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 thrust him into the media spotlight with a contentious, 10-minute interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, who accused Lavelle of being obsessed with ""clearing Russia from culpability"" in the plane’s shooting. American officials have said the plane was likely shot down by Ukrainian separatists in Donetsk with a surface-to-air missile. Lavelle, an American who works as a journalist in Moscow, says the United States is too quick to tie Russian-backed rebels to the tragedy, berating the U.S. State Department for relying on social media as evidence for its claims and not looking at Ukraine as a responsible party. ""I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program,"" Lavelle said on the July 23 CrossTalk, addressing guest Vladimir Suchan. Then Lavelle proposed a theory that involves Ukraine bringing down the plane in effort to earn worldwide sympathy amid woes with its new government. ""But if I look at the timing of this tragedy in Ukraine, the (Petro) Poroshenko government was, well, in trouble with its latest offensive in the east, it was losing badly, soldiers were being circled, it was really bad news,"" Lavelle said. ""And all of a sudden we have this tragedy of killing civilians on this flight, and this puts Ukraine back on the front page, it competes with Gaza, a lot of ‘sympathy,’ for the Kiev regime, this is good timing in a way for the coup regime that hasn't been achieving too many successes since February.""   Um, so in essence Lavelle is suggesting Ukraine shot down MH 17 so it could blame the Russian separatists so the flailing Ukraine government could become front-and-center again in the news? Sounds like a conspiracy theory to us. But so that we don’t be accused of reaching a Pants on Fire conclusion too quickly, we decided to search around Lavelle’s other shows. We didn’t search every program, but we looked at enough to find that conspiracy theories are very much raised by Lavelle and featured on his show. RT is a curiosity for Western journalists, some of whom see its coverage as Kremlin-directed propaganda. As a star host, Lavelle has gotten and dismissed questions about the network's perceived bias. In 2008, he told a New York Times reporter, ""No one is telling me what to say."" He did, however, note that part of the network's ""mission is public relations.""   RT has also carved out a reputation for bringing in obscure guests to discuss unusual topics related to America, devoting time to questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Lavelle, too, has expressed his preference to be ""counterintuitive"" compared to corporate-owned American cable news networks. In a 2010 interview with Columbia Journalism Review, Lavelle said, ""Being mainstream has been very dangerous for the West."" Here’s a few of those conspiratorial, er, counterintuitive moments that we found with a simple Google search. Conspiracy No. 1: 9/11 was an inside job Lavelle invited several skeptics of the American government's Sept. 11 findings ""to try to find out what really happened"" on 9/11 for a March 2010 segment. The roster included Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth founder Richard Gage, who said three World Trade Center skyscrapers (the Twin Towers and a surrounding WTC building) that collapsed that day ""were brought down by explosive demolition on 9/11, not by fire and jet plane impacts."" Lavelle also asked blogger Ian Henshall, a blogger and author of 9/11 Revealed: The New Evidence, about what it's like to be called a conspiracy theorist when he's just raising questions. ""Conspiracy theory, if it means anything, is a simple story which you know claims to explain a major complicated event. That is exactly what the official story of the 9/11 attacks is,"" Henshall said. ""Very simple story, all organized by a guy in the cave with 17 hijackers who were just incredibly lucky. You could not get more of a conspiracy theory than that."" Henshall went on to talk about the ""worrying evidence"" that the towers-takedown was an inside job. Just so we don't raise the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists, we took three screengrabs of Lavelle and his guests talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories from RT's YouTube page: 1. ""WTC towers collapsed due to a controlled demolition;""    2. ""Attacks an inside job to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;""    3. ""9/11 attacks in 2001 were intentionally allowed to happen.""    It wasn't the first time Lavelle raised eyebrows about the official story of Sept. 11. In February 2010, Lavelle posited on CrossTalk that the Sept. 11 hijackers were ""not even fundamentalists at all"" -- much to the shock of the two people he was interviewing about a proposed burqa ban in France. This time he was challenged by a guest, former British journalist Douglas Murray of the Centre for Social Adhesion, who asked Lavelle, ""How can you keep speaking, let alone hosting a show, and know so little? How can you know so little and keep on talking?"" Murray detailed the appearance on the ""strange propaganda outfit"" in a blogpost. The other guest, Anne-Elisabeth Moutet of the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Institute, said al-Qaida is a completely fundamentalist group.  Conspiracy No. 2: AIDS drugs kill people with AIDS Lavelle later convened a panel to talk about the business of HIV/AIDS on July 21, 2010, asking questions that highlighted critics of antiretroviral therapy for people infected with HIV who say the treatments are nothing but a ""huge moneybag"" for Big Pharma. Lavelle invited on guest Peter Duesberg, a University of California-Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, who believes that AIDS treatments are killing people infected with ""the so-called AIDS virus, which doesn’t do anything."" So AIDS isn’t killing people, AIDS drugs are. ""The companies try to treat the virus that doesn’t do anything with drugs that are inevitably toxic,"" Duesberg said. ""The AZT was developed 40 years ago for one purpose: to kill human cells for cancer, chemotherapy. And the result is they have never ever cured one AIDS patient."" Lavelle asked Dr. Denis Broun of UNAIDS for feedback. ""We have 2 million people die of HIV infection every year. And these are not people who die of old age, I can tell you that. The average age of people who die in Russia is 32 years. This is preposterous,"" Broun said. ""The antiretrovirals are keeping people alive, and people are staying alive thanks to administration of these products."" Lavelle went back to Duesberg, who said the world’s 30-40 million HIV-infected population is doing well and the people who die are the ones ""getting these drugs that are inevitably toxic."" ‘They are designed to terminate DNA synthesis, that’s the central molecule of life, you’re dying from that,"" Duesberg said. ""That is AIDS by prescription. And 500,000 people are prescribed these drugs alone in the U.S. and all of them die, about half of them die from diseases that have nothing to do with HIV."" Another guest, Steve Caterer of Global Pharma Insights, said Duesberg’s opinions ""on the good side are disrespectful and on the worst side are tantamount to murder."" Later in the program, Broun said the three-drug HIV/AIDS drug treatment used today is much less toxic than the AZT-only treatment (azidothymidine) used 25 years ago. ""No one in his right sense is suggesting to use AZT alone today,"" he said. ""It's as if people were suggesting to treat syphilis with arsenic, as was done at the beginning of the century. ... We cannot discuss today's situation with antique data that are no longer valid in any way.""  Broun said researchers debate some points of treating the virus, but ""no one is saying, like denying the role of HIV in creating AIDS or saying the drugs are dangerous for people.""  Conspiracy No. 3: U.S. official planned to break up Ukraine Back to Ukraine, where Lavelle lambasted American media coverage of the ""Western-induced crisis"" in May 2014, and claimed that Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland was trying to break up Ukraine. ""It seems to me that there’s this habit now in Western media, particularly in the United States, that no one wants to see fault in themselves or their own governments here. Because this was so predictable, as you said at the beginning of the program, this plan that Victoria Nuland had was just nonsense. She was just going to break up the country, but they had a Plan B. If they don’t succeed, then Russia is a very easy enemy to blame everything on, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now."" Even guest Dmitry Babich, an employee of the Russian-government owned radio station The Voice of Russia, thought Lavelle was going a bit too far. ""I don’t think Victoria Nuland planned to break up the country. She thought that the east of Ukraine would just submit to the new government, the new government would be pro-Western, then as the Western media said, we should all take deep breath and then wait until Ukraine becomes completely anti-Russian,"" Babich said. ""And of course Victoria Nuland, just like John Kerry, they don’t know a thing about Ukraine."" Nuland became a notorious figure in the East as U.S. diplomats responded to Ukraine's political crisis, but there's no evidence she had a plan to break up Ukraine. A phone conversation between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt about Ukraine's next steps was leaked, in which she was heard as saying ""F--- the EU."" Routine remarks from Nuland about the United States' investment in pro-democracy initiatives in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991 were widely misconstrued on social media and by RT, which held up her comments as evidence that the U.S. was spending $5 billion to incite the riots (a claim we rated Pants on Fire). Our ruling ""Never"" is a strong word, yet Lavelle claimed he is a not a conspiracy theorist and has ""never allowed a conspiracy theorist on his show."" We’ll agree there is a somewhat subjective definition of what constitutes a conspiracy theory. But we think of the four we quickly found -- Ukraine downed MH 17 to drum up sympathy, AIDS drugs are what are killings AIDS patients, 9/11 was an inside job, and an assistant secretary of state devised a plan to break-up Ukraine -- at least one would fit most people’s definition of a conspiracy theory. Lavelle’s hypothesis about MH 17, we should note, was uttered in the breaths after saying he doesn’t allow conspiracy theories on his show. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA65F40>],/factchecks/2014/jul/30/peter-lavelle/rts-peter-lavelle-says-he-doesnt-allow-conspiracy-/
