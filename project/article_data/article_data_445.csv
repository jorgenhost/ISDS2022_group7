Nancy Pelosi overstates Republican gains in impeachment process
","House Republicans voted unanimously against a resolution that laid out how the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump would proceed. In an interview with ""Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert later that day, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her party had been more than fair. ""You would have thought that the Republicans would all vote for it, because it gave them more rights than we ever received in any of the other impeachment proceedings,"" Pelosi said Oct. 31. We spoke with Pelosi’s staff to learn what she meant when she said the Republicans are getting more rights than Democrats got during the impeachments of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. The comparison is a bit convoluted to begin with, because while Democrats were in the minority during Clinton’s impeachment in 1998, Democrats were in the majority in 1974 for the impeachment of Nixon. That put them in a stronger position than the House Republicans are in today. Pelosi’s claim that Republicans are getting more rights comes down to two measures: the number of lawmakers involved, and their power to call witnesses and ask them questions.  On the first, Pelosi’s staff say there are twice as many committees involved and so, twice as many minority party lawmakers. That is accurate compared with past impeachments, however, compared with what has taken place so far, the resolution’s focus on the two committees means that several other committees will now play smaller roles. Many Republicans on committees such as Oversight and Foreign Affairs have been able to participate when key witnesses testified. They will lose that under this resolution. For the Nixon and Clinton proceedings, all the action was in the House Judiciary Committee.  Under the just-passed resolution, duties are split between the Intelligence and Judiciary committees. The Intelligence Committee conducts the investigation. The Judiciary then assesses whether those findings add up to an impeachable offense. The rules laid out in the House resolution and by the Judiciary Committee chair give Republicans equal time to question witnesses. It does so in more detail than in the Nixon and Clinton House resolutions. Pelosi’s office said, compared with the past, more Republican members can participate, and everything the committees produce is shared equally. ""Intelligence Committee minority members are now not only able to question witnesses on equal grounds with Democrats, the resolution provides them the ability to call witnesses,"" they said in a statement. ""Thus, twice as many committees and their respective minorities possess this subpoena power."" The ability to call witnesses is key, and Republicans have complained that they don’t get exactly what the minority party got during the Nixon and Clinton impeachments. We looked into this in a separate fact-check of a claim from Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. On paper, that’s somewhat accurate. In 1974 and 1998, members of both parties could call witnesses. Either side could object to a witness, in which case, the dispute would ultimately be resolved by committee vote. Today, the Republicans lack the power to challenge a Democratic subpoena. The practical impact is less telling, because in the past as in the present, the majority party always has the votes to win at the committee level. Effectively, members of the minority party, then and now, have less subpoena power than the majority. It’s worth noting that bipartisanship was in force during the Nixon impeachment, and these issues were not so contentious. The House resolution to start the inquiry passed 410 to 4. The Trump investigation resolution passed 232 to 196. Sarah Binder at George Washington University said that the rules for calling witnesses, and thus the power to shape an inquiry, ""changed markedly"" since the Clinton hearings. In 2015, Republicans rewrote the standing House rules and gave committee chairs the automatic right to subpoena witnesses. The most that would be needed would be to consult with the minority, not win their approval. Binder said, ""it would be a bit eye opening"" if Democrats today rolled back the authority the Republicans established. The House, she said, has always been run by the majority. ""It's long been the nature of the beast,"" she said. Pelosi said that Republicans get more rights today than Democrats had in past impeachments. Today, Republicans on two House committees can participate, rather than just one. But Pelosi’s focus on past impeachments downplays that Republicans on other committees will have less opportunity to participate than they enjoyed before the resolution passed. Republicans also have less ability to use a committee vote to challenge Democratic subpoenas today than in 1974 and 1998. But practically speaking, the impact is minimal. The majority party can always win a committee vote if it wants to challenge the calling of a witness. Ultimately, the differences are not large. In the House, the majority always has the edge. The Republicans now have slightly different options — most notably, there are more participants — than the minorities in previous impeachments. But that doesn’t give them much more say in the proceedings. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/nov/04/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-overstates-republican-gains-impeachme/

Rep. Tom Cole exaggerates limits on Republicans in impeachment process
","Republicans explained their party-line vote against the Democrats’ impeachment process resolution on the grounds that it isn’t fair. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the House should have stuck with the rules in place for Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. ""Today’s resolution provides fewer due process protections and fewer protections for minority rights than what we have seen in previous impeachment efforts,"" Cole said Oct. 31 on the House floor. Today's impeachment process resolution fails to give the minority the same rights present during the Clinton impeachment, & it fails to offer the same due process protections given to both Presidents Nixon & Clinton. My full remarks from floor debate on H. Res. 660 ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/dsKxaFRAYQ He listed three differences. 1. The ""resolution does not provide for a co-equal subpoena power."" 2. It doesn’t guarantee ""all members the right to fully access committee records."" 3. Presidential participation in hearings by the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees ""was granted to President Clinton in 1998, yet it is not present here."" We wanted to know if Cole’s impeachment history was correct. (A separate fact-check examines Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s claim that the Republicans have more power than in the past impeachments.)  Warning: This stuff can make baseball rules look simple. Cole is partially correct that Republicans have less power on paper to block Democratic witnesses. But in terms of calling their own witnesses, Republicans are no worse off than they were in the past. And practically speaking, they never had much power to stop the Democrats from doing what they liked. During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment hearings, the majority and minority parties could seek subpoenas, and both of them could lodge an objection to the other’s request. The text of the rules for both the Nixon and Clinton hearings was the same (bold emphasis is ours):  The power to issue a subpoena ""may be exercised by the chairman and the ranking minority member acting jointly, or, if either declines to act, by the other acting alone, except that in the event either so declines, either shall have the right to refer to the committee for decision the question whether such authority shall be so exercised."" Of course, if it came to a committee vote, by definition, the majority has the votes to win. In contrast, the rule approved for the Trump impeachment effectively says the Democrats can object to a Republican request, but the Republicans can’t object to a Democratic one.  It gives the minority the chance to request a subpoena, but ""in the case that the chair declines to concur in a proposed action of the ranking minority member,"" the matter goes to committee vote. The business of ""either shall have the right"" is missing in the current rules. ""Under the Clinton and Nixon rules, it was symmetrical,"" said Stanford law professor Dave Alan Sklansky. ""Now there’s an asymmetry."" But again, both then and now, if it comes to a committee vote, the majority will get what it wants. And for the witnesses Republicans want, they face the same potential hurdle they faced back in 1974 and 1998. Cole leaves out a piece of history: Republicans changed the starting point in 2015 when they held the House and planned to investigate the Obama administration. The rules they passed Jan. 6, 2015, gave committee chairs the full authority to subpoena someone. The most the minority could expect was to be ""consulted."" At the time, Democrats complained bitterly. Cole misrepresents the issue of member access to materials in the Trump impeachment inquiry, and he’s wrong about what took place in the Nixon investigation.  He said the resolution doesn’t ""guarantee"" that all members have access to hearing materials. But his staff could point to no document or statement from the Democrats that denied access. His office told us ""the concern is that current chairmen are not respecting"" standing House rules. The Democratic materials say nothing about this one way or the other.  Compared with the Nixon process, lawmakers imposed strict limits on who could see what. The procedures for handling impeachment inquiry materials ""limited access to such materials to the chairman, ranking minority member, special counsel, and special counsel to the minority of the committee."" Cole muddies the roles of different committees. His full words on this point are: ""We offered an amendment that would require the chairman of the Rules Committee to promulgate procedures to allow for the participation of the president and his counsel in proceedings of the Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee or Foreign Affairs Committee. This right was granted to President Clinton in 1998, yet it is not present here."" The statement about Clinton is factually wrong, because none of those committees played a role in the Clinton impeachment. As in the Nixon proceedings, the House Judiciary Committee handled everything. Clinton’s lawyers did participate in the Judiciary Committee process, and the House resolution gives Trump’s lawyers the same rights for that committee. However, Cole has a point that Trump’s lawyers can’t participate in the House committees currently investigating the president, most importantly, the Select Intelligence Committee.  Easy comparisons quickly break down. Most clearly in the Clinton case, the White House had zero opportunity to participate as Independent Counsel Kennth Star investigated Clinton. The investigation took place outside the House. In the Trump investigation, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee can call witnesses and ask questions. They don’t have the same powers as the majority, but they have the right to participate and represent Trump’s interests. Once it gets to the Judiciary Committee, the House resolution grants Trump and his lawyers more rights than Clinton or Nixon enjoyed. Cole said the impeachment process ""provides fewer due process protections and fewer protections for minority rights than what we have seen in previous impeachment efforts."" He gave three examples, with mixed accuracy. He is partially correct on subpoena powers, but more on paper than in reality. Under the rules in past impeachments, Republicans could object to witnesses the Democrats wanted. They lack that today. But in the past, the most Republicans could hope for was a committee vote, which the majority would win, if it wanted. And in terms of getting the witnesses Republicans want, the rules are unchanged. Cole’s point about access to records is speculative and not based on actual policy statements or rules from the Democrats. His statement about the access granted to Clinton and his lawyers is incorrect. Comparisons to the past are difficult because each impeachment has played out differently.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate Cole’s statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/nov/04/tom-cole/rep-tom-cole-exaggerate-limits-republicans-impeach/

Peoples-Stokes' assurances on medical marijuana vaping are too broad
","Vaping-related illnesses have vexed public health officials and prompted state policymakers to consider banning e-cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control cited 1,888 reports  of lung injuries associated with e-cigarettes or vaping and 37 deaths as of Oct. 29.  Those who vape use an electronic cigarette product, such as a vape pen or e-hookah, to heat a liquid to produce an aerosol that they inhale into their lungs. The liquid can contain nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid oils (CBD)  and other substances and additives. Most electronic cigarette products contain a battery to heat the liquid. In New York, approved providers offer medical marijuana in several forms, including vape pens and cartridges, and offer THC and CBD in different concentrations, according to a 2018 report from the state Department of Health.   In an interview on WBEN radio on Oct. 9, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes assured listeners that vaping medical marijuana from an approved dispensary is safe.  ""If folks are vaping a legal medical cannabis product that comes from any of the New York state operators, they will not have to worry about the negative impacts on their lungs,"" Peoples-Stokes said.  But is that true?  We reached out to Peoples-Stokes’ spokesman, Kevin Jolly, who said that the Majority Leader was following guidance from the state Department of Health.  Jolly said the public health concern stems from recent cases of lung injuries from vaping products purchased informally on the street. Peoples-Stokes does not approve of vaping, he said. The state Department of Health, however, cautions users of state-approved medical marijuana vape products, even though it has no reports of problems with them.  On Sept. 7, Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker released a statement urging ""New Yorkers to stop using vape products while the investigation into the definitive cause of reported vaping-associated illnesses nationwide can be better determined.""  That statement was also posted on the department’s web page for medical marijuana users.  Medical marijuana products are ""rigorously tested for contaminants, pesticides and concentration of cannabinoids,"" the department advised, but it warned that ""out of an abundance of caution, we are also urging patients in the medical marijuana program to consult with their health care providers on potential alternatives to vaping products while the investigation continues.""   There are reasons Peoples-Stokes declared regulated medical marijuana safe for New Yorkers to use.  An earlier notice from the state Department of Health, dated Sept. 5, 2019, asked everyone except medical marijuana users to consider not using any vape products. And on Sept. 9, two days after the department cautioned medical marijuana users to consider alternatives to vaping, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news conference about vaping illnesses that ""this does not include the medical marijuana products. Those are regulated, and those are safe.""  At the federal level, the CDC is also investigating the cause of the lung injuries and has  recommended that no one use e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC, according to Cassie Brailer, press officer for lung injury response at the CDC. The agency knows that THC is present in most of the samples that have been tested and that most lung injury patients report using products that contain THC, Brailer said. National and state findings ""suggest products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources,"" are linked to most of the cases, Brailer said.  ""Since the specific cause or causes of lung injury are not yet known, the only way to assure that you are not at risk while the investigation continues is to consider refraining from use of all e-cigarette and vaping products,"" Brailer said.   In interviews with four researchers who study public health or cannabis use, we found mixed opinions on whether vaping even a regulated substance such a medical marijuana can have a negative impact on a patient’s lungs. Two experts said that it is too early to tell. One said that vaping any substance can be harmful. And one said that those vaping regulated medical marijuana in New York state should not fear the marijuana but said there are unknowns about the vaping device itself.     Mitch Earleywine, a psychology professor at the University at Albany who studies marijuana policy and advocates for reform of cannabis laws, said that flavor-free vape liquids, such as those used in the medical marijuana program in New York, remain under-investigated. He has done research on the vaporizer, which he said appears safe, but there is no long-term data on the vape oil.  Ana Maria Rule, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, agreed there is not enough data to declare vaping medical marijuana ""safe.""    Another expert, Ilias Kavouras, a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, said that lung damage can be caused by medical marijuana and vaping, including those formed during the process of smoking marijuana or vaping.  ""There is evidence in the scientific literature that toxic and carcinogenic species are formed during vaping,"" Kavouras said. A professor of public health at Syracuse University offered a different opinion.  Dessa Bergen-Cico, who is coordinator of addiction studies programs at Falk College at SU, said that people who purchase medical marijuana vape cartridges from registered state dispensaries ""should not have problems with product safety because the products are highly regulated and tested.""  However, ""it is still unknown if there is something in the vaping devices that is a catalyst for the lung injuries,"" Bergen-Cico said.  Peoples-Stokes said that people who used medical marijuana obtained from approved operators in New York shouldn’t worry about the negative impact on their lungs.  While state and federal public health officials have not found a link between medical marijuana from regulated operators and lung injury cases, they recommend caution when it comes to vaping. The Centers for Disease Control recommends people do not use e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC and consider refraining from using all e-cigarette and vaping products. The state is telling people to stop using vape products until the cause of the lung illnesses are known, and is urging medical marijuana patients to consider alternatives to vaping while its investigation is underway.   Public health researchers have found that it’s unclear whether vaping is safe or not, even if the user is vaping a regulated substance such as medical marijuana.  We rate Peoples-Stokes’ statement Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2019/nov/02/crystal-peoples-stokes/peoples-stokes-assurances-medical-marijuana-vaping/

Post that says Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz has 'numerous DUIs' is wrong
","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz has dominated national TV in defense of President Donald Trump amid the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry. Now social media users are firing back with an unfactual post about the arrest record of the second-term North Florida Republican congressman. ""Fun fact for ya,"" reads an Oct. 27 Facebook post. ""Republican Matt Gaetz has had numerous DUIs and his dad got him off each time. He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people. He is the swamp."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post takes a single arrest for DUI, inflates it and omits that the case was dropped. Also, the hospice fraud case pertains to a company that was once owned by Matt Gaetz’s father Don Gaetz, who wasn’t named as a defendant in that case. Matt Gaetz was arrested for DUI in 2008. In 2014, when he was a state representative, Gaetz mentioned the incident publicly when a fellow lawmaker called for preventing law enforcement from releasing booking photos unless the suspect is convicted. Here’s what happened, according to the Tampa Bay Times: When Gaetz was 26, he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island in a BMW registered to his father, then-Florida Sen. Don Gaetz. Okaloosa County Deputy Chris Anglin clocked Gaetz traveling 48 mph in a 35 mph. Anglin reported that Gaetz’s eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car and smelled of alcohol.  Gaetz, a lawyer, admitted he had consumed two beers but declined field sobriety tests. He was arrested and refused the breath test. We did not find evidence that Gaetz’s father Don ""got him off"" of the arrest, as the post says.  The prosecutor at the time asked to be removed from Gaetz’s case, saying his stepson was friends with Matt Gaetz. The case was then assigned to Steve Meadows, a prosecutor in a neighboring circuit. Gaetz’s lawyer filed a motion to drop the case. The prosecutor agreed to drop the case in December 2008, court records show. We searched Gaetz’s name on Nexis and did not find any other DUI arrests. Florida Department of Law Enforcement records note only one arrest for Gaetz, in October 2008, related to a DUI misdemeanor traffic offense. Snopes, which debunked a meme about Gaetz’s DUI record in July, found that the earliest version of the claim stemmed from a 2016 post by a conspiracy theorist. The Facebook post goes on to say ""he was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud."" That leaves the impression that ""he"" refers to Matt Gaetz, which is wrong. It was Don Gaetz’s former company, Vitas Healthcare Corporation, that was involved in litigation involving fraud. It didn’t involve Matt Gaetz, and the elder Gaetz was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Chemed Corporation and hospice subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation, alleging false Medicare billings for hospice services. The government accused the company of engaging in Medicare fraud between 2002 and 2013. At the time the lawsuit was announced, Don Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News that he remained active in the management of Vitas until 2000. Then Gaetz stepped aside when he was elected superintendent of the Okaloosa County School District. ""I gave up all management responsibilities in 2000, though I continued as a shareholder and attended about four board meetings a year,"" Gaetz told the newspaper. Don Gaetz sold Vitas in 2004 to Chemed. He was elected to the Senate in 2006. Gaetz was not named as a defendant and denied wrongdoing. In 2017, the government settled the case for $75 million.  A Facebook post said, ""Matt Gaetz has had numerous DUIs and his dad got him off each time. He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people."" This post is wrong. Gaetz had one DUI arrest in 2008, and the case was dropped. The post also includes a sloppy reference to a hospice company that Matt Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, previously owned. Don Gaetz sold Vitas in 2004. In 2013, the federal government announced a lawsuit that resulted in a $75 million settlement in 2017. The case did not name either Matt or Don Gaetz as a defendant.

US-backed Jordan-Syria barriers to fight ISIS aren’t border-to-border 'wall'
","A Facebook post claims the United States built a massive wall in the Middle East to block the ISIS terrorist organization. Below a map showing Jordan and Syria, the post says: ""This is a wall. Between Jordan and Syria. Why? To keep ISIS out. Want to guess who paid for it? The US. Yup, the US built a wall in Jordan. 274 miles worth. This was approved by the Dems in the house and senate. But, a Wall for the US is immoral. Apparently it’s not immoral in Jordan. Well well isn’t that interesting."" The post didn’t provide any source information. A reader asked us to check it out. We found there is no end-to-end physical wall across the Jordan-Syria border, and certainly none like President Donald Trump has advocated for on the U.S.-Mexico border. There are what amount to a series of barriers largely funded by the United States that were approved with bipartisan support. They were erected to block incursions by Islamic State terrorists, but also to block refugees. Jordan is considered a key U.S. partner in the Middle East, according to an April 2019 paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.  ""Jordan’s strategic importance to the United States is evident given ongoing instability in neighboring Syria and Iraq, Jordan’s 1994 peace treaty with Israel and uncertainty over the trajectory of Palestinian politics,"" the paper says.  ""Jordan also is a longtime U.S. partner in global counterterrorism operations. U.S.-Jordanian military, intelligence and diplomatic cooperation seeks to empower political moderates, reduce sectarian conflict and eliminate terrorist threats."" A detailed Vice News article in 2016 reported that the administration of President Barack Obama was allocating funds ""to build a sophisticated electronic fence along Jordan's northern and eastern borders, a wall which U.S. strategic planners hope will stem the flow of refugees."" The effort began as a $20 million project in 2008 to erect a set of surveillance towers along a 30-mile stretch of Jordan’s border with Syria. But it expanded into what became known as the Jordan Border Security Program, running some 275 miles along the entire Jordan-Syria border and costing $500 million, according to Vice. (Jordan’s border with Syria runs 234 miles.) Since 2013, the barrier ""has refocused on detecting Islamic State fighters and arms smuggling, as well as refugees, on both sides of the border,"" the article says. Experts we contacted largely confirmed Vice’s account, with some clarifications. The State Department describes the Jordan Border Security Program as an ""integrated border security surveillance, detection and interdiction system along Jordan’s land borders. "" ""It’s not a wall, and I don’t think any part of it could be described as such,"" said Ben Fishman, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""The U.S. funded a series of border security systems to Jordan as part of our long-standing bipartisan security cooperation with Jordan."" GlobalSecurity.org director John Pike said ""there are all kinds of radars and observation towers and other such anti-infiltration measures, but no wall."" Congress increased defense appropriations to Jordan to counter ISIS, including for enhancing border security, Jeffrey VanDenBerg, director of Middle East Studies at Drury University in Missouri, told us. ""But it wasn’t specifically for a wall, and it is not specified what portion of the increased funds were intended for border security."" Some of Jordan’s barriers on its border with Syria predated any recent U.S. appropriations, he added. The major funding, although U.S. money was provided previously, was supported by Democrats in an omnibus spending bill, said Valens Global chief executive officer Daveed Gartenstein-Ross.  He cited a 2017 appropriations measure providing up to $500 million that, the law says, ""may be used to provide assistance to the Government of Jordan to support the armed forces of Jordan and to enhance security along its borders."" A Facebook post claimed the United States paid for a 274-mile wall between Jordan and Syria, ""approved by the Dems in the house and senate,"" in order ""to keep ISIS out."" The post alludes to a U.S.-Mexico border wall like Trump has championed, and there certainly is no such end-to-end physical wall spanning the Jordan-Syria border. There are high-tech barriers, some of which predated U.S. participation. A major portion was funded by the United States, with bipartisan support, and a major reason was to fight the ISIS terrorist group, but also to block refugees.

Green New Deal doesn't mention abortion, but Nikki Haley's attack on it does
","Attacks on the Green New Deal include claims that it would cost $93 trillion (False), ""put a $600,000 tax burden on every household"" (False) and do away with commercial air travel (False). A new attack on the climate change measure and its supporters connects it to abortion. Republican Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador under President Donald Trump and former South Carolina governor sent an email Oct. 26 from Stand for America, a policy group she launched in February. The email says the following: ""Liberals continue to go around the country touting their radical climate change agenda. ""Front and center was their ‘Green New Deal.’ Or as we at Stand For America have come to call it, the ‘Green New Scam.’ The candidates touted everything from putting limits on red meat consumption, to promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population! ""We must stand up to these liberals, and let them know that we don’t support this radical agenda!"" The email then links to a petition that seeks to stop the Green New Deal, saying it would ""promote abortion."" Broadly, the Green New Deal is a resolution first proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that would address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment, with measures on emissions, water, infrastructure and scientific research.  The words abortion and population are not mentioned in the text of the Green New Deal resolution. With regard to other countries, the resolution says only that the Green New Deal would promote ""the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services, with the aim of making the United States the international leader on climate action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal."" So what is Haley talking about? We repeatedly emailed, called and messaged Stand for America, and we reached out to the publisher of Haley’s forthcoming book. But we did not receive any replies to our requests for information to support Haley’s statement. Haley’s email about ""the candidates"" pushing red meat and abortion agenda does not specify which candidates she alluded to. But conservatives accused 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of wanting to use abortion for population control in order to fight climate change, based on his answer to a question at a Sept. 4 CNN town hall  focused on climate change.  Here was his exchange with an audience member (in which neither mentioned the Green New Deal): Question: ""Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face. Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?"" Sanders: ""Well, Martha, the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions. And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control to me is totally absurd."" The agreement prohibits U.S. foreign aid not just directly for abortions, but for any organization that provides abortion or abortion-related services. It was rescinded under President Barack Obama and reactivated by Trump. Among the critics was U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., who tweeted, ""Bernie Sanders said YOUR tax dollars should be used to fund abortions in foreign countries to reduce population size."" Sanders did say population control should be part of addressing climate change. And he brought up the Mexico City agreement and said women should have the right to ""reproductive decisions."" But he did not explicitly promote the use of abortion for population control. Haley said in an email that targets defeat of the Green New Deal that candidates who are supporting the proposal are ""promoting abortion in third world countries to control the population!"" The email distorts the Green New Deal resolution by linking it to abortion. (The linked petition is even more direct.) The only element of truth in her attack is Sanders, one of the 2020 presidential candidates, linked climate change, population control and reproductive rights in a town hall.

American Family CEO makes a point about black male enslavement and today's incarceration
","It’s not uncommon for CEOs of top corporations to give speeches. It is uncommon for them to make the African American incarceration rate the focus of those speeches.  Yet, that’s what American Family CEO Jack Salzwedel did Oct. 8, 2019, at an event honoring the Deloitte Wisconsin 75, a list of the top privately and closely held companies in the state. Madison-based American Family is fourth on the list, with revenue of about $10.2 billion in 2018. ""There’s more African American males in the penal system right now than there were at the height of slavery,"" Salzwedel said. ""And it’s something that needs to be addressed because as a business this is an important issue for us, not just as a feel good. This is an important issue for us we think about our markets, demand for our products, the workforce, all of these things."" Salzwedel acknowledged that his speech could be controversial, adding: ""I truly believe that if people will be looking back 50 years from now at this time right now, that they’ll look at what’s going on with the mass incarceration movement right now and they'll look at us the same way we look back 100 years and look at slavery.""  Salzwedel’s entire statement is interesting, but we decided to focus on the imprisoned-enslaved comparison. Is he right that there are ""more African American males in the penal system right now than there were (enslaved) at the height of slavery""? The background The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress on Jan. 31, 1865, declaring, ""neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" Although slavery was abolished in the 19th Century, the long-term ramifications of the practice, which persisted for three centuries, continues to reverberate in public discourse, classrooms and even amongst the highest levels of corporate America.  For instance, the board of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce has identified ""racial disparity/inequity"" as the region’s top liability.  ""Business leaders are by nature forward looking -- they can see that to be successful we need to be a region of choice for all-inclusive of diverse talent,"" said Tim Sheehy, MMAC president. On Sept. 26, 2019, the MMAC announced that 65 employers with 130,000 workers had signed a pledge to increase the diversity of their managers and workforce. Those companies included Harley-Davidson, MillerCoors, the Milwaukee Bucks and Johnson Controls.  ""AmFam was not approached in the original outreach as their corporate footprint is relatively small in Milwaukee -- though that will be changing,"" Sheehy said. ""They are very supportive.""  Now, what about Salzwedel’s incarceration vs. enslavement claim? The evidence When asked to provide backup, American Family spokesman Ken Muth pointed us to ""The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,"" a 2010 book by civil rights lawyer Michelle Alexander.  In the introduction to the book, the author writes ""we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it."" Alexander goes on to say: ""More African American adults are under correctional control today—in prison or jail, on probation or parole — than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began.""  As evidence, though, that quote simply mirrors what Salzwedel said. What about the numbers? In 2014, PolitiFact Rhode Island fact-checked a similar claim: ""There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.""  That item noted:  ""The U.S. Census Bureau records for 1850 showed that 872,924 male African American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and ""free coloreds"" was 23.2 million.)"" Meanwhile, federal Bureau of Justice statistics statistics showed about 1.68 million African American men were under state and federal criminal justice supervision. Salzwedel’s statement was worded a bit differently, in that it referred broadly to the ""penal system."" When taken broadly, we think that takes in those on probation and parole, as well as those in the nation’s local jails.  The latest available nationwide data on parole and probation is from 2016, so we’ll zoom in there.  At the end of 2016, there were 487,300 black men serving time in state or federal prison and about 200,000 serving time in local jails, according to the BJS report ""Jail Inmates in 2016."" The agency also recorded 771,355 on probation and 289,000 on parole.  That means about 1.75 million black men were under federal, state and local criminal justice supervision.  That is about double the 872,924 black men who were enslaved in 1850. Considering population growth Of course, the nation’s population has grown a lot since 1850. Indeed, there are far more black residents in the United States now — about 40 million -- than the 23.2 million total residents in 1850. In 2016, the total U.S. population stood at 308,745,538.  By that comparison, black enslaved males tallied 3.7% of the population in 1850, while  African American males imprisoned today represent about 0.6% of the population. Reggie Jackson, head griot/docent at America’s Black Holocaust Museum in Milwaukee and a consultant at Nurturing Diversity Partners, also pointed to the issue of population growth ""Obviously, there are over 10 times more blacks today than there were then, so it would only make sense that more are incarcerated now,"" Jackson said in an email.   Our ruling Salzwedel said ""There’s more African American males in the penal system right now than there were (enslaved) at the height of slavery.""  On a strictly numerical basis, the claim is on point. There is some clarification needed, though -- chiefly the fact that the nation’s population growth means a lower figure on a percentage basis. Our definition for Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.""  That fits here.",/factchecks/2019/nov/01/jack-salzwedel/american-family-ceo-makes-point-about-19th-century/
"['Economy', 'Vermont', 'Phil Scott']","
Governor says Vermont caused Energizer’s pending exit. But he’s got no evidence.
","Last week, the Missouri-based battery company Energizer announced plans to close its factory in Bennington.  The company said it was shuttering the Vermont plant, which manufactures hearing aid batteries, and moving the operation to a new facility in Portage, Wisconsin, following a $2 billion deal to purchase Rayovac.  The Energizer closing in Bennington will eliminate about 100 jobs. The layoffs are expected to deepen financial strain in the Southwest region of the state, which has seen a sharp decline in employment opportunities since the Great Recession.  Gov. Phil Scott called Energizer’s plans ""disappointing"" in a statement released last week. And he blamed the company’s move on larger problems with the state’s business climate.   ""This decision is an unfortunate example of why those of us in Montpelier need to work together to make Vermont a more affordable place to do business and make sure our policies help businesses thrive rather than creating unique burdens and barriers to growth that make us less competitive with other states,"" Scott wrote in a statement last week.  The governor’s statement draws a direct connection between the state’s business climate and Energizer’s plans to shutter the factory.  We wondered: Are Vermont’s policymakers to blame for Energizer’s pending departure?  Energizer has said it is closing the Bennington factory — which was downsized in 2015— to consolidate operations in the Wisconsin Rayovac factory, which also produces hearing aid batteries. The only public statements Energizer has made on the decision indicate it is making the move because it would be more efficient for the company to produce the hearing aid batteries in one factory. The Portage plant employs more than twice as many workers than the Bennington facility (about 225 compared to 90). It’s also slightly larger. ""In order to be successful as a larger company, we are making significant investments to better utilize our existing manufacturing facilities, reduce complexity in our operations, and enhance service to our customers,"" Marcus Boolish, Energizer’s director of government affairs wrote in a letter to Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, last week.  Nikki Eaves, an Energizer spokesperson, offered a similar explanation to the Bennington Banner, saying that the facility in Wisconsin is equipped to handle the company’s hearing aid production.  ""As part of the integration,"" she said, ""we reviewed our combined manufacturing footprint and determined the total demand for specialty batteries can be produced more efficiently in one facility."" The company did not respond to questions from VTDigger about whether the state’s business climate contributed to its decision to leave the state.  But Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for Scott, said that it was ""self-evident"" that Energizer is moving out of state because Vermont’s business environment isn’t competitive.   She said that if it was ""advantageous"" for Energizer to ramp up its production in Vermont, the company would have kept operations here.  Kelley pointed to the fact that Vermont has among the highest power costs in the nation and some of the highest corporate and property taxes, according to the Tax Foundation’s latest business tax climate index. In 2018, Forbes ranked Vermont 47th in its U.S. ""Best for Business"" rankings and said that the cost of doing business in the state is 12% higher than the national average.    ""Businesses are going to do what’s in the best interest of the business,"" Kelley said. ""If their decision is to leave the state for another state, that indicates it is more advantageous and more competitive in that other state.""  Kelly did not, however, provide any additional evidence that Vermont’s business climate contributed to Energizer’s factory consolidation.  Sears, the senator from Bennington, said it would be hard to evaluate whether the governor’s statement is true, unless the company provided more information about its decision. ""I think it’s unclear what the reasons are for them not investing in Vermont,"" he said. ""You can generalize and say it’s anti-business and Wisconsin’s more business-friendly. I don’t know if that’s true or not."" The senator said he couldn’t recall the company lobbying legislators on business issues in the Statehouse, except on one occasion. About a decade ago, when Vermont banned mercury in batteries, the company asked lawmakers for a period of time to phase-out use of the chemical instead of an immediate ban. Sears said he worked to get that language written into the bill.  Kelley said the governor’s office was seeking more information from Energizer about its reasons for leaving Vermont.  Sen. Brian Campion, D-Bennington, said Scott should have that conversation with Energizer before he ""speculates"" on its motivations.  ""I think it’s important to hear directly from Energizer on what kind of things would have or even could keep them here,"" Campion said, noting that the company doesn’t plan to fully shutter its doors in Bennington until 2021. ""Are there things that could be done between now and then that could keep Energizer here?"" The governor is correct that by most measures, when compared to other states, Vermont ranks low on business friendliness. But his claim is specifically about Energizer’s reason for leaving.  According to Scott’s statement, the fact that Energizer is moving away, in and of itself, reveals the company wasn’t satisfied with Vermont’s business environment. His office can provide no evidence to support his claim. The only reason Energizer has cited for its move is that consolidation of operations in its Wisconsin facility — recently purchased from Rayovac — will streamline production.   We rate this claim false.",/factchecks/2019/oct/31/phil-scott/governor-says-vermont-caused-energizers-pending-ex/

Donald Trump’s World Series ad said he cut illegal immigration in half. That’s False
","President Donald Trump launched a high-profile re-election ad during Game 7 of the World Series, claiming that he’s delivered on a signature issue of his administration by ""cutting illegal immigration in half.""  ""President Trump is changing Washington, creating 6 million new jobs, 500,000 new manufacturing jobs, cutting illegal immigration in half, obliterating ISIS, their caliphate destroyed, their terrorist leader dead,"" the ad narrator says, going on to attack Democrats for impeachment inquiry proceedings as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This fact-check will focus on the immigration portion of the Oct. 30 ad — whether Trump has cut illegal immigration in half. That part of the ad shows Trump at the southwest border, standing in front of border fencing and shaking hands with Border Patrol agents. We did not hear back from the White House nor from Trump’s re-election campaign by publication time. But the ad cites ""Fox News, 9/10/2019"" as the source for his claim about immigration. An immigration official in September spoke of a drop of more than 50% in southwest border apprehensions in a three-month period. But that snapshot creates the wrong impression. On average, apprehensions under Trump have been higher than under his predecessor, Barack Obama. Also, apprehensions have more than doubled in fiscal year 2019, compared to fiscal year 2018. In a Sept. 10 interview, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared on Fox News’ ""Fox & Friends"" and spoke about a drop in border apprehensions in August, the latest monthly tally available at the time. (Apprehension data is commonly used as a tally of illegal immigration.) ""The president has literally thrown every domestic and international effort he can at this and it’s paid off,"" Cuccinellli said to Fox host Brian Kilmeade. ""As you noted Brian, we are down more than 50% since May in just three months."" U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that in May there were 132,856 apprehensions at the southwest border. In August, there were 50,684. That’s a nearly 62% decline in apprehensions. A three-month period is a relatively short period of time to know whether any changes are long-term or temporary, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.  ""You can only look at trends at the border in longer time spans,"" Brown said. It's also important to analyze how various factors affect any immigration changes, she said. Trump’s ad claiming he cut illegal immigration in half was also presented without any context, ommiting the time period, Brown said, which might lead people to wrongly presume that the comparison is before and after Trump took office. But the claim takes a period of time when illegal immigration increased under Trump and decreased under Trump, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It's just a silly claim, it's comparing Trump to Trump,"" he said. To evaluate whether Trump is ""cutting illegal immigration in half"" one should look at data on apprehensions before and during his time in office, experts said. Southwest border apprehensions during Obama’s tenure on average were around 400,000 a year. That average is higher for Trump. Apprehensions declined about 26% from fiscal years 2016 to 2017, but picked up again in 2018 and 2019. (2017 included about four months of Obama’s presidency.) There were roughly 548,000 more apprehensions in 2019 than there were in 2017.  Border Patrol agents recorded a total 851,508 apprehensions in fiscal year 2019.  That is nearly a 115% increase from the 396,579 apprehensions in 2018. Trump’s re-election ad said he’s ""cutting illegal immigration in half."" It isn’t apparent in the commercial that the claim is based on data for three months during fiscal year 2019, which show a drop of more than 60%. But that snapshot creates the wrong impression. Apprehensions on the southwest border have been higher during Trump’s presidency on average than compared with when he took office. The data overall shows that apprehensions in 2019 spiked significantly when compared to both 2018 and 2017.

Parson’s mostly right about big growth in small-business wages
","During his recent election announcement for governor of Missouri, Mike Parson trumpeted a strong economy in the state, taking particular care to highlight increases in small-business wages. ""With record lows in unemployment, more people are going back to work in Missouri,"" Parson said Sept. 8. ""Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small-business wage growth state in the nation."" Does the governor’s comment check out? We wanted to investigate. A spokesperson for Parson’s campaign cited an April 2019 article from St. Louis Business Journal that used numbers from an April 2019 report from Paychex/IHS Market Small Business Employment Watch to show Missouri ranked first in the country in hourly wage growth for small businesses. At $25.55 per hour, Missouri small business wages were up 3.48%, or 86 cents, that month. The Show-Me State finished first ahead of California, New York, Arizona and Illinois in small-business wage growth. According to the Small Business Employment Watch’s September report, Missouri now ranks third in the country in hourly wage growth increase at 3.38% (New York is second at 3.53% and Illinois is first at 4.11%). If assessing for weekly wage growth rise, Missouri is second at 3.83%. Illinois comes in at 3.84%, just .01% better than Missouri. Overall, Missouri has been a top-five small business wage growth state (by weekly earnings) every month this year, according to Paychex’s analysis. So what is Paychex, and how does it calculate its data for the Small Business Employment Watch? Paychex is a human resources and payroll company with over 600,000 clients nationwide. According to a media spokesperson for the company, it ""uses up-to-date, aggregated payroll data from approximately 350,000 of Paychex's small business clients with fewer than 50 workers"" to keep its data current. All businesses whose wage data is included in the report must have run payroll for the month that the data is being compiled and the three months prior. According to a Paychex spokesperson, the sample includes millions of small-business workers. How many small-business workers are there in Missouri and in the United States? It depends what you consider a small business. Paychex defines a small business as a firm with fewer than 50 workers, but the U.S. Small Business Administration defines small businesses as firms with less than 500 workers. According to the SBA’s 2019 profile for the state of Missouri, there are 1.2 million small business employees in the state of Missouri alone, and 58.9 million in the country. In other words, while Paychex represents a significant portion of small businesses, it’s not the whole pie. The company itself claims to work with one in 12 private sector employees. Parson said, ""Wages are on the rise — in fact we were the top small business wage growth state in the nation."" This statement is backed by statistics from Paychex that showed it to be true for the month of April, although Missouri fell behind in later months. Since it can’t be proven that Paychex takes a representative sample, and it’s the only indicator Parson cites, we rate this comment as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/oct/31/mike-parson/parsons-mostly-right-about-big-growth-small-busine/

Fact Check: Does California really have ‘90,000 unsheltered’ homeless people?
","California’s homeless crisis now ranks as one of the top concerns in the state, tied for first with jobs and the economy in a recent survey. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who chairs the governor’s commission on homelessness, has taken notice and promised greater urgency.  He recently called for his city to spend $30 million to jump-start the mass production of tiny homes, structures 500 square feet or less.  Steinberg said these no-frills structures could house thousands of homeless people in Sacramento and elsewhere, and help ease the state’s crisis, claiming ""90,000 Californians are unsheltered and homeless.""  That’s nearly the population of medium-sized cities, from Santa Barbara to Livermore to Redding. Is the state’s homeless crisis really as severe as Steinberg claimed?  We set out on a fact check.  Our research This isn’t the first time we’ve looked at Steinberg’s statements on homelessness. In July, during his push for a statewide ‘right to shelter’ law, we examined his claims about the share of unsheltered homeless people in California compared with New York City — and on the soaring rate of homeless deaths in two major cities in the state. We found his assertions were generally correct, but needed a few clarifications.  To verify Steinberg’s statement about 90,000 unsheltered people, we reviewed a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development study called the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. Housing experts consider it the most comprehensive and current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide.  Released in December last year, the report shows California had nearly 130,000 homeless people both sheltered and unsheltered, a tally from a point-in-time count conducted in January 2018. That was the most of any state, far ahead of second-place New York with about 92,000 homeless people. Of course, more people live in California than any other state.  Of California’s total, 89,543 were unsheltered, meaning they were not living in an emergency shelter or similar residence. Instead, they were found on the street, in a vehicle or abandoned building.  This matches Steinberg’s statement.  At nearly 69 percent, California’s share of unsheltered homeless people was the highest in the nation, the report found. Oregon had the second-highest share at about 62 percent.  Steinberg’s spokesperson said the mayor relied on the HUD report.   California has the nation's highest rate of unsheltered homeless people, according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. ‘Double digit increases’ in homelessness Chris Martin, a legislative advocate on homelessness at the nonprofit Housing California, said Steinberg used the best figure available.  He said a new HUD report is expected in December.  Based on early survey results around the state this year, Martin said he anticipates at least a 10 percent jump in California’s overall homeless population when the report comes out. He did not have an estimate on how the unsheltered population might change.  ""It’s bad,"" Martin said, of the overall totals. ""I’d say most communities around the state are seeing a double-digit increase.""  Martin pointed to one research group, HUB for Urban Initiatives, that estimates there’s been a nearly 24 percent spike in homelessness statewide from 2017 to 2019.  He noted that the federal homeless counts represent a snapshot-in-time of a community’s homeless population.  ""We usually estimate that two to three times the point-in-time number are homeless during the course of the year,"" added Sharon Rapport, director of the California State Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, develops housing policy and makes housing loans.  While the federal reports are issued each year, Rapport said the odd year counts are more comprehensive because not every jurisdiction did a survey in 2018. She said she expects the 2019 report to show a larger overall number of homeless people.  ""Despite these flaws, it is the best data we have at this point,"" Rapport added. Our rating Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg recently claimed ""90,000 Californians are unsheltered and homeless.""  He relied on the federal government’s 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. It uses data from point-in-time counts, but it is considered the best and most current set of estimates for homeless populations nationwide.  It backs up the mayor’s claim, showing California had nearly 130,000 homeless individuals in 2018, of which nearly 90,000 were unsheltered.  We rated Steinberg’s statement True.

Limbaugh wrongly claims Republicans are being shut out of impeachment hearings
","Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh wrongly claimed that House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump are keeping Republicans out of their hearings. More than 40 Republican lawmakers disrupted witness testimony on Oct. 23 by storming a secure room and chanting, ""Let us in!"" Many news outlets and top Democrats quickly pointed out that roughly a dozen of the protesting Republicans already had access to the depositions they were demanding to hear. Still, Limbaugh and others have charged that Republicans have been shut out of the House’s impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions on Ukraine.  ""The thing that, of course, is top-drawer today and has been all week is what little Adam pencil-neck Schiff is doing behind closed doors in a so-called impeachment inquiry that doesn’t feature the opposition party, it doesn’t feature cross-examination, no transcripts are released, everything’s being done in private, only selected leaks, you know the drill,"" Limbaugh said Oct. 25 on his radio show. Limbaugh’s comments were made before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision Oct. 28 to bring the probe to a more open phase, starting with an Oct. 31 vote on a resolution to affirm the ongoing investigation and start public hearings. Limbaugh, who did not respond to requests for comment, has a point that the impeachment hearings have so far taken place behind closed doors, without transcripts being formally released. (News outlets have obtained transcripts of prepared witness remarks in some cases.)  But he is wrong that the hearings have excluded House Republicans, 47 of whom sit on the three committees that have been leading the investigation.  The Constitution says little about procedures for impeachment: The House ""shall have the sole Power of Impeachment"" and the Senate ""shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments."" In three previous impeachments, the full House authorized inquiries and the House Judiciary Committee took the lead in conducting investigations, holding hearings and voting on whether to approve articles of impeachment. This time around, Pelosi opened the inquiry without a formal vote, a move Republicans criticized. She instructed three House committees — Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs — to carry out an investigation that the House Judiciary Committee will use to draft any articles of impeachment.  There are nine Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, 17 are on the House Oversight Committee, and 21 are on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. By contrast, those three committees feature 13, 23 and 26 Democrats, respectively, with four Democrats sitting on two of them at the same time.  All 47 of those Republicans have been able to participate and ask questions in the interviews and depositions held to this point, said Ashley Etienne, Pelosi’s communications director, in an email. Experts told us the same thing. Other House members, such as Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, have been kept out of the hearings not because they are Republicans, but because they are not on the relevant committees. And some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, have chosen not to attend despite being able to. There is no constitutional provision that says a president or his allies must be allowed to cross-examine witnesses during a House impeachment inquiry.  ""Nothing in either the Constitution or House rules requires public hearings and/or cross-examination at this stage,"" said Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University. When Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the inquiry was denying Trump ""due process accorded every American,"" we rated his statement False. If such rights apply at all, they would be granted during the Senate’s trial phase. ""The House impeachment inquiry is equivalent to a grand jury investigation in a criminal case,"" said Suzanna Sherry, professor of law at Vanderbilt University. ""And there is no opportunity for cross-examination when evidence is presented to the grand jury."" Republicans also have the ability to ask questions of witnesses at hearings, Sherry said, which is ""more opportunity for cross-examination than is given to a target of a grand jury investigation."" ""By any ordinary definition, that would amount to ‘cross-examination,’"" said Frank O. Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.  Limbaugh said House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry ""doesn’t feature the opposition party, it doesn’t feature cross-examination.""

California’s health mandate penalty and coverage of immigrants in the state illegally, explained
","A leader of a student group that supports President Donald Trump claimed that California is ""putting illegals first"" when it comes to health care. ""Starting January 1, 2020, California will tax legal citizens if they don’t have health insurance. Why? The state needs to come up with $98,000,000 to pay for free health insurance for illegal aliens. Why do Democrat’s (sic) keep putting illegals first?"" tweeted Ryan Fournier, founder and co-chairman of Students for Trump. Starting January 1, 2020, California will tax legal citizens if they don’t have health insurance.Why?The state needs to come up with $98,000,000 to pay for free health insurance for illegal aliens. Why do Democrat’s keep putting illegals first? 🤔 A screenshot of the tweet was posted on Facebook Oct. 21. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fournier told PolitiFact his claim was based on two June articles, one from a TV station in Los Angeles and the other from USA Today. The KTLA article said the California legislature voted to tax Californians who don’t have health coverage starting Jan. 1, 2020. The USA Today story said California would become the first state to offer health coverage to low-income adults living illegally in the country and that the plan would cost $98 million. Overall, the state does plan to impose a tax penalty on people without health care insurance, and it also plans to expand coverage for immigrants living illegally in the state. But the two moves aren’t directly related. Revenues from the tax will go toward subsidies to help Californians reduce the cost of their health care coverage. Other revenues are being used to pay for health care for unauthorized immigrants. A new mandate in California, effective Jan. 1, 2020, will require Californians to have health insurance throughout the year. Californians who don’t have health coverage in 2020 — and who don’t qualify for exemptions — would have to pay a penalty in 2021 when they file their 2020 state income tax return. The requirement is modeled after the individual mandate that was included in the federal Affordable Care Act, but effectively eliminated by Congress after Trump took office. California’s penalty is expected to generate about $317 million beginning in 2020-2021, said an Oct. 17 report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the California legislature’s nonpartisan fiscal and policy advisor. Those revenues will help offset the cost of new state subsidies that will be available to Californian households with incomes up to 600% of the federal poverty level, said the report. The subsidies were created to help households reduce the cost of health care coverage bought through the state’s health insurance marketplace, Covered California. ""To the extent that any penalty is collected, all of that money is going to fund additional affordability assistance in Covered California,"" said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a health care consumer advocacy coalition.  The subsidies will go ""to legally residing Californians up and down the income stream, including those above 400% of the poverty level that otherwise would not qualify for assistance,"" Wright said. The vast majority of the new subsidies will benefit Californians with incomes between 400% and 600% of the poverty line, said Scott Graves, director of research for California Budget and Policy Center. ""These residents — unlike people with lower incomes — do not qualify for any federal financial assistance even though they often face high monthly premiums as well as large out-of-pocket costs,"" Graves said. The new state subsidies sunset after 2022, but the mandate and related penalty will continue. Covered California’s website said that immigrants not lawfully present in the United States do not qualify for a health plan through Covered California (though they may qualify for the state’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal). Another portion of California’s 2019-20 budget expands health coverage for young adults in the country illegally. Medi-Cal, funded by state and federal taxes, offers free or low-cost health care coverage for low-income children and adults in California. The state has ""restricted scope"" and ""full-scope""  Medi-Cal; the restricted version covers emergency and pregnancy-related services, and the full-scope is more comprehensive, including medical, dental and eye care. California in 2016 began offering full-scope Medi-Cal to all children under 19 years old, regardless of immigration status.  This year, the state expanded full-scope Medi-Cal to adults 19 to 25 years old who are illegally in the country and meet the income requirements. In 2019-20, this expansion is expected to cost California about $98 million, with an estimated $74 million coming from the state’s general fund. The state funds will support the full-scope Medi-Cal services ineligible for federal aid, Graves said. The additional funding, beyond the approximately $74 million from the state’s general fund, will come from the federal government and be used to pay for emergency and pregnancy-related services, he said. ""As with the prior expansion, the general fund cost of this new expansion will be paid for with tax revenues that are generated by California’s current tax system, with no tax increase,"" Graves said. Almost all tax revenue that flows into the state’s general fund comes from the personal income tax, the sales and use tax, and the corporation tax, he said. The Legislative Analyst’s Office projected that on an ongoing basis, the Medi-Cal expansion for young adults would increase general fund spending by around $225 million annually across the Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services program. The full-scope expansion is expected to benefit about 100,000 people. Some California state lawmakers and immigrant advocates wanted to offer health coverage to all immigrants living illegally in the state, but those broader plans were curtailed during budget negotiations. California’s budget has a surplus of more than $20 billion. Our ruling Fournier said, ""Starting January 1, 2020, California will tax legal citizens if they don’t have health insurance. Why? The state needs to come up with $98,000,000 to pay for free health insurance for illegal aliens."" Californians will be required to have health care coverage in 2020, and if they don’t, they’ll pay a tax when they file their state income taxes in 2021. (There are some exemptions.) Revenue from the penalty will be used to pay for subsidies that will become available to Californians to help them reduce the cost of health care coverage.

Cruz attack ad on Trump distorts transgender bathroom access issue
","Donald Trump wants to let male predators masquerading as women in the same bathrooms as your wife and daughter, according to an ominous black-and-white ad from presidential rival Ted Cruz. The ad refers to Trump’s stance on North Carolina’s controversial HB 2 (sometimes dubbed the bathroom bill), the subject of repeated criticism and jokes by Cruz. (Here’s one: ""If Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he still can’t go to the girls’ bathroom."") ""Should a grown man pretending to be a woman be allowed to use the women's restroom? The same restroom used by your daughter? Your wife? Donald Trump thinks so,"" reads the ad, which first aired April 22 and includes a clip of Trump suggesting people use the bathroom that ""they feel is appropriate."" ""It's not appropriate,"" the ad continues. ""It's not safe. It's PC nonsense that's destroying America. Donald Trump won't take on the PC police. He's one of them.""   Did the Cruz ad accurately describe Trump’s view? Not really. The businessman's comments on HB 2 suggest he doesn't really see allowing bathroom choice for transgender people as a problem. But by prohibiting people from using the bathroom they feel is appropriate, Trump said, North Carolina has hurt its business potential.   Further, medical experts typically agree that a transgender woman is a woman who identifies differently from her assigned sex at birth, though there isn’t universal agreement on this point. So it’s not entirely accurate for Cruz to define a transgender woman as ""a grown man pretending to be a woman."" The ad is playing into fears of the Charlotte ordinance enabling predatory behavior on children and women, which could still happen (and still be a crime) without a transgender-friendly law.  With that, let's get into Trump's comments. Trump on NBC’s Today The ad quotes Trump as saying on April 21, ""People go — they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate."" The comment is plucked out of context from Trump's interview on Today. He was describing transgender people using the bathroom of their choice in Charlotte, N.C., before the state passed HB 2, which prevented local governments from setting anti-discrimination policies and restricted bathroom access to a person's gender on his or her birth certificate. Willie Geist: ""Mr. Trump, please be specific. Tell us your views on LGBT, how you plan to be inclusive as president. Speak about the North Carolina bathroom law, in particular."" Trump: ""Oh, I had a feeling that question was going to come up, I will tell you. Well North Carolina did something. It was very strong. And they're paying a big price. And there's a lot of problems. And I heard — one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying, leave it the way it is, right now. ""There have been not — very few problems. Leave it the way it is. North Carolina, what they're going through with all the business that's leaving and all of the strife — and that's on both sides. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. ""People go  — they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic — I mean, the economic punishment that they're taking. So I would say that's probably the best way…"" Matt Lauer: ""So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and wanted to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?"" Trump: ""That is correct. ...There's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is … first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is."" Trump essentially made an economic argument, that North Carolina was hurting financially from its bathroom bill and it should have left the Charlotte issue alone. His comments spurred outraged criticism from social conservatives and reluctant praise from his usual foes like columnist David Brooks and Vox.   But they weren’t his final words on the topic. Later on Fox News’ Hannity Trump gave a different and rather vague answer on Fox News that night. On Sean Hannity’s show, Trump said he believes that bathroom access should be a matter of local control. Hannity: ""I wanted to give you a chance to explain your position on that as it relates to transgenders picking which bathroom they want to go to. I can't even believe I'm asking the question, but I'm asking."" Trump: ""Well, it is a small number, but we have to take care of everybody, frankly. And North Carolina, which is a great place — which I won, by the way — I love North Carolina — and they have a law and it's a law that, you know, unfortunately, is causing them some problems. And I fully understand that they want to go through, but they are losing business and they are having a lot of people come out against. ""With me, I look at it differently. A community, whether it's North Carolina or local communities, really — they should be involved. We have so many big issues to be thinking about, Sean. We have ISIS to worry about. We have bringing trade back. We have rebuilding our military. ""But I think this. I think that local communities and states should make the decision, and I feel very strongly about that. The federal government should not be involved."" Hannity: ""In other words, let the states decide, let local community decides, kind of like your position on education, give it back to the states."" Trump: ""Yes, let them decide. Absolutely."" Here, Trump says the federal government shouldn’t be involved in bathroom policies as it has bigger fish to fry. Instead, he said, it’s up to ""local communities and states."" In the case of North Carolina, the local community of Charlotte enacted a policy, and state lawmakers blocked it from taking effect and prevented other communities from doing the same. So Trump essentially avoided answering the question at the heart of the controversy: whether bathroom policy should be decided by the local community of Charlotte or the state. A few days later on Fox News Sunday Trump advisor Paul Manafort reiterated the billionaire’s local control stance on Fox News a few days later, but he argued that it wasn’t a new position from what Trump said on Today. Host Chris Wallace challenged Manafort’s denial of a reversal. Wallace: ""Wait. Wait. Wait. But 12 hours before or eight hours before, he said leave it the way it is and that there doesn't need to be any change. It's a problem in search of a solution. Manafort: ""Which it is."" Wallace: ""Let me rephrase, it's a solution in search of a problem, that there's not really a problem there."" Manafort: ""What he said, he was asked a question of his personal opinion in the afternoon and then he was asked, ‘How do you handle the issue?’ And he answered that in the evening."" Wallace: ""His personal opinion stands?"" Manafort: ""What stands is what he said when he was asked the specific question of what should happen to this issue and he said it's a state's rights issue, it should be handled by the states."" Our ruling A Cruz ad said Trump thinks ""a grown man pretending to be a woman (should) be allowed to use the women's restroom.""  There's a grain of truth in this claim, but the overall message is highly distorted to scare voters. Trump did say he'd be fine with letting Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender women, use the bathroom of her choice in Trump Tower rather than the bathroom that corresponds to the sex on Jenner's birth certificate. But Trump did not say he supports a man ""pretending to be a woman"" using a woman's restroom.  Trump talked about how bathroom laws that allow people to use the bathroom of their choice are not a problem and bemoaned the business backlash that hit North Carolina with a state law that said people have to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender at birth. The state would have been better off leaving it alone, he argued, but as president he would not want the federal government to be involved. Doing nothing about a local government's decision is not an endorsement. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False. Editor’s note, April 27, 2016: After we published this item, we heard from readers and others who said our description of a transgender woman made it sound as if there is no public debate over transgender issues or how gender is defined. We did not mean to suggest that, and we have edited our report to more fully reflect that ongoing debate. Our rating still stands, however, because the ad distorts Trump’s views on access to public bathrooms.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b5dec59-b7ec-4ec6-a34d-87428af82a41",/factchecks/2016/apr/25/ted-cruz/cruz-attack-ad-trump-distorts-transgender-bathroom/

Ted Cruz says he won more votes in Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York
","Ted Cruz got whomped by Donald Trump in the New York primary. But in remarks in Borden, Ind., Cruz tried to take some solace by looking at the numbers a different way. ""I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York,"" Cruz said. Is that right? We took a closer look. Here’s the final results of the April 5, 2016, Wisconsin Republican primary, according to the Associated Press: Candidate  Wisc. votes Percentage Delegates Ted Cruz 531,129 48.2 percent 36 Donald Trump 386,370 35.1 percent 6 John Kasich 155,200 14.1 percent 0 Marco Rubio 10,569 1 percent 0 Ben Carson 5,608 0.5 percent 0 Jeb Bush 3,153 0.3 percent 0 And here are the final results of the April 19 New York Republican primary: Candidate  N.Y. votes Percentage Delegates Donald Trump 524,932 60.4 percent 89 John Kasich 217,904 25.1 percent 4 Ted Cruz 126,151 14.5 percent 0 So Cruz did win more raw votes in Wisconsin (531,129) than Trump did in New York (524,932). It’s a modest edge -- Cruz won about 1.1 percent more votes in Wisconsin than Trump did in New York -- but an edge nonetheless. The discrepancy owes much to two factors: Wisconsin’s turnout rate, which was two and a half times higher than New York’s, and the Republicans’ greater strength in purplish Wisconsin than in solidly blue New York. In Wisconsin, about 24 percent of the voting-age population cast a Republican primary ballot. In New York, it was just 5.6 percent. That helps explain why Cruz eked out more raw votes than Trump even though Trump won the much bigger state and almost three times as many delegates. Our ruling Cruz said, ""I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York."" This is certainly a glass-half-full way of looking at the results, but factually, Cruz is on target.

Gov. Rick Scott's claim about $1 billion in tax cuts needs some background
","Despite lawmakers virtually ignoring his budget wish list during the 2016 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott is boasting about fulfilling a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1 billion in his second term. Scott took credit for the fiscal feat both before and after signing the Legislature’s wide-ranging tax-cut package, HB 7099. ""Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes,"" an April 13, 2016, press release from the governor’s office read. Scott had pledged to hit the billion-dollar mark in tax reductions during his successful 2014 re-election campaign, mostly by giving breaks to businesses and limiting property tax growth. In his March 15 press release announcing his intention to sign the Legislature’s budget, Scott said he’d kept his promise with $1.2 billion in tax cuts over the first two years of his second term. Scott has repeated this claim several times in one form or another. But have taxes really gone down by more than $1 billion in two years, like he says? It depends on how you look at what the Legislature has done, but the changes haven’t happened the way Scott wanted. Tallying the taxes When we asked Scott’s office to break down their budget math for us, they pointed to a chart in their March 15 press release, without further detail:  We were able to verify the figures from Scott’s office based on changes passed by the Legislature the last two years. The Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research compiles an annual list of how much tax revenue will be affected by bills passed during that year’s legislative session (these can change as the fiscal picture becomes clearer). The House also analyzed HB 7099 to estimate how much the bill would change tax receipts. Cell phone & TV tax cut: In 2015, the Legislature passed a 1.73 percentage point reduction in the state’s communications services tax, a charge on consumer cell phone, cable and satellite bills. That amounted to a $21 annual reduction on a $100 monthly cell phone and cable bill. Scott had wanted to cut the tax by $120 million, something we’d rated a Promise Kept on our Scott-O-Meter.   Property tax reduction: This one is tricky, because it’s more of a tax shift than a tax cut. Scott also is taking credit for a solution he didn’t want. During the 2016 session, the House and Senate agreed to increase per-pupil education spending for K-12 students, something Scott had wanted. Scott initially wanted the bump in education funding paid almost entirely through higher local property tax collections, not with general revenue. (Scott had previously proposed limiting property tax increases with a constitutional amendment, a campaign promise he has so far ignored.) Higher property values meant that collections would increase whether lawmakers raised the key millage rate for local property tax dollars for schools or kept it the same. Instead, the Legislature cut the local rate and paid for the $428 million difference they needed with general tax revenue. Legislators mostly referred to this as ""tax relief,"" and not a tax cut. We’ve rated a similar statement Mostly True, because the change altered future collections, instead of cutting current collections. Property owners, however, are still shielded from a tax hike. Senate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, told the Tampa Bay Times that if you include this revenue swap, Scott ""technically"" had reached $1 billion in tax cuts. But that’s dependent on Scott accepting a plan he opposed. The Legislature has to revisit education funding every year, too, so this will no doubt change. Back to school sales tax holiday: Scott counts these breaks from sales tax on school supplies as a cut. These aren’t permanent cuts, because the Legislature has to approve whether there will be sales tax holidays each year. His figures do jibe with state estimates. The totals are different, in part, because the 2015 holiday was 10 days long, while the 2016 holiday will only be three days long. The terms of exempt items also differs between the two years. Manufacturing machinery and equipment: Getting rid of this tax was another Scott promise, going back to his first term. The sales tax originally was cut back with a limited exemption in 2012, but the following year was suspended by legislators for three years. Starting in 2014, the tax would not apply through April 30, 2017. Scott pushed to make the suspension permanent and in 2016, the Legislature agreed. The Scott-O-Meter rated this a Promise Kept. College textbooks: Scott proposed making college textbooks exempt from sales tax, suggesting it would save the average student about $60 per year. The Legislature agreed to the exemption for the 2015-16 fiscal year, but it was not renewed in the 2016 session. Other tax cuts: Scott’s office did not include specific dollar figures for other tax breaks, fee changes and provisions that went down over the last two years. In 2015, the Legislature removed sales taxes on gun club membership fees, put a $60,000 cap on taxes for board repairs, and gave businesses tax credits for pollution cleanup and research, among other measures. For 2016, legislators gave veterans’ organizations an exemption on food and drink sales taxes, phased out an asphalt tax over three years for government projects, and tinkered with taxes on cruise ship alcohol and tobacco sales, pear cider, and aviation fuel, among other changes. That’s just a sample of the tax changes over the last two years that Scott’s office counted. The figures are in the ballpark and add up somewhere north of $1 billion. Whether he can take credit for the total is a tougher question. Experts have told us that counting on things like tax credits and sales tax holidays means consumers have to spend money first before enjoying any benefits. Many of these changes also are temporary or narrowly focused. And remember that local governments may have to raise taxes to account for a change in revenue. Meanwhile, the Legislature has balked at several tax changes Scott has wanted, including eliminating the state’s corporate income tax — a major Scott request in 2016 that would have cost the state $770 million annually — and phasing out the sales tax on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said, ""Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes."" The figures are pretty accurate compared to state estimates for tax changes during 2015 and 2016. But there’s some question whether you can really consider all of the measures tax cuts. While some of the alterations are permanent, many of them are temporary exemptions or target very specific beneficiaries. Scott also has to ignore some of his earlier proposals and count a plan for education funding that is the opposite of what he wanted to top the $1 billion mark. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/25/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-claim-about-1-billion-tax-cuts-nee/

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders’ claim that Jim Kenney’s soda tax is regressive
","Jim Kenney’s proposed soda tax went national last week. Hillary Clinton led off what became a back-and-forth political battle by voicing her support for the tax at a forum in Philadelphia. Bernie Sanders chimed in later to call the tax regressive. Kenney fired back in an editorial on Huffington Post that his proposal, which would levy a three cent per ounce tax on distributors, was a ""corporate tax"" and said Sanders was siding with beverage corporations. Then Sanders responded with an editorial of his own, in Philly Mag. He basically gave an elongated version of what he said earlier in the week, which was, ""A tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia."" Is Sanders correct? Or was this political grandstanding?     Berkeley, Calif., remains the lone American city to enact a sugary drink tax. It taxes the distributors of sodas and similar beverages like sports drinks 1 cent per ounce. Studies have shown some of the cost of tax has been passed on to consumers. A Cornell study found about 25 percent of it was passed on, and a University of California-Berkeley study found the amount to be between about 50 to 70 percent, depending on the type of beverage. The prices of soft drinks were more likely to go up at supermarkets than chain drug stores. Carl Davis, the research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told Billy Penn last month soda taxes like the one proposed by Philadelphia are ""imperfect:"" ""The first thing you realize is that it is regressive. It’s going to hit lower and more moderate income families more heavily than higher-income families."" William Shughart, a Utah State University professor and sin tax expert, explained taxes like the one proposed by Kenney disproportionately affect lower income residents because a greater amount of their income is used on food and drinks. Warren Gunnels, senior policy advisor for Sanders, said in an email, ""It would make much more sense to finance universal pre-school in Philadelphia by raising taxes on its wealthiest residents, who currently benefit from flat state and city tax rates. Right now wealthy Philadelphians pay state income tax of 3.07 percent, an unemployment tax of 0.07 percent, and a city income tax of 3.92 percent. That’s a total state and local tax burden of 7.06 percent. By contrast, New York City’s wealthiest residents pay a top rate of 12.6 percent."" Such a plan would be easier said than done, according to Kenney’s administration. ""Because of the uniformity clause, it’s constitutionally impermissible right now in Pennsylvania to raise the income tax rate only for wealthy individuals,"" said Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s communications director. ""The Republican controlled state legislature would have to change the constitution and we’re not holding our breath on that one. Our kids need Pre-K now."" Kenney has said the tax is not regressive because he believes the money will stay in the neighborhoods. His finance director, Rob Dubow, said most consumers of sugary drinks are in poor neighborhoods. When Dubow suggested distributors would absorb some of the tax, City Council president Darrell Clarke responded, ""Fundamentally, I don’t believe that.""       Our ruling  Sanders said Kenney’s proposed soda tax would disproportionately increase taxes for low income families. In the only other instance of a soda tax in the United States, studies have shown somewhere between 25 and 70 percent of the cost of the tax gets passed to consumers. Tax experts say if this tax reaches the consumer level it would affect low income residents to a greater extent.    We rule the claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/19db2be2-02d7-4cfd-baa1-423db2d4d80f",/factchecks/2016/apr/25/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-jim-kenneys-sod/

Malaria's toll: Close to one African child killed every 2 minutes
","A grim statistic is circulating this World Malaria Day. USAID’s Tina Dooley-Jones, deputy mission director in Kenya, marked the occasion in Nairobi saying that ""globally, malaria kills a child every two minutes."" Dooley-Jones is far from the only one with that message. It plays large among malaria advocacy groups like Nothing But Nets. So it was curious to see a post in January on Medium from the head of the President’s Malaria Initiative, rear admiral Tim Ziemer, with the statement that ""in Africa, a child dies every minute because of the disease."" The initiative is one of the government’s largest global health efforts. It began under President George W. Bush and has been carried forward by President Barack Obama. Malaria’s toll among African children is a touchstone for many health activists, but the numbers can vary. Our colleagues at Africa Check spotted a range of statements. One organization claimed a child died every 30 seconds, another said once every two minutes, and in between was Ziemer’s figure. In this fact-check, we affirm that the correct number is closer to once every two minutes. USAID spokesman Ryan Essman told us that until fairly recently, his agency would talk about a death every one to two minutes, but now uses the two-minute time frame. ""Admiral Ziemer has been working with malaria for a decade,"" Essman said. ""He had it when he was child. Usually he uses the right number, but he might have slipped in the previous one."" As a humanitarian matter, the exact death toll makes little difference. This table from the Kaiser Family Foundation, using World Health Organization data, clearly shows that Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria. WHO Region Number of countries with ongoing transmission Estimated cases (1,000s) Percentage Estimated deaths (in 1,000s) Percentage Global total 96 214,000 100% 438 100% Africa 44 188,000 88% 395 90% Americas 21 660 <1% 0.5 <1% Eastern Mediterranean 8 3,900 2% 6.8 2% Europe 3 0 0% 0 0% South-East Asia 10 20,000 9% 32 7% Western Pacific 10 1,500 <1% 3.2 <1%   Africa wrestles with 90 percent of all deaths by the disease worldwide, and almost as large a percentage of active cases. Malaria is particularly lethal for pregnant women and their babies. The federal government estimates that it kills about 10,000 expectant mothers each year in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another 200,000 children will die prematurely from complications due to their mothers having bouts of malaria during pregnancy. Malaria’s death toll Our colleagues at Africa Check turned to the World Health Organization data for 2015. With huge gaps in the health care systems in many African nations, all experts agree that a precise count of malaria death is impossible. The WHO provides a range of estimates. Number of malaria deaths in children under 5 in Africa Middle estimate 292,000 Lowest estimate 212,000 Highest estimate 384,000   From that, the middle estimate shows one child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds, or close to once every two minutes. Middle estimate 1 min 48 sec Lowest estimate 2 min 28 sec Highest estimate 1 min 22 sec   The U.S. government spent about $860 million this fiscal year to fight malaria. The money went for a drug that can help pregnant women and their children, but many dollars also went to insecticide-treated nets and indoor spraying to prevent people from catching the disease in the first place. Obama seeks to raise the total by about another $70 million in the last budget of his administration. There is a strong global push to eradicate malaria, and gains have been made. In the past decade and a half, the rate of new cases has fallen by about a third in Sub-Saharan Africa. Going forward, many hurdles remain. Mosquitoes can become resistant to the most common insecticides, weak health care systems in many countries make it difficult to sustain antimalaria programs, and counterfeit drugs can be as fatal as the disease itself. Our ruling Ziemer wrote that malaria kills a child in Africa each minute. His staff at USAID said that figure is off. A better estimate is that a child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds. But even that figure comes with a measure of uncertainty. The actual death rate could be higher or lower. By any estimate, malaria remains a serious threat to children in Africa.

As federal prosecutor, Catherine Hanaway and her office handled more than 5,000 cases
","At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate in Columbia, candidate Catherine Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted more than 4,000 cases during her tenure as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Hanaway served as a federal prosecutor from July 20, 2005, through April 17, 2009, which means that she would have had to prosecute at least three cases a day on average to make that 4,000-case benchmark. That seemed like a lot of cases, so we looked at the record. Hanaway’s history in public life While many Missourians may know Hanaway as the first female speaker of the House in Missouri, she is also a decorated prosecutor who’s worked in both the private and public sectors. In 2005, Hanaway left her position as speaker after being appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri by former President George W. Bush. In 2009, Hanaway resigned and joined the Ashcroft Law Firm, founded by former Missouri governor, senator and U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft. As a side note, in 2013, Missouri Lawyer’s Media listed Hanaway as the most expensive lawyer to hire in Missouri at a rate of upward to $793 an hour. Hanaway said at the time that most of the firm’s clients were large national and international companies, and ""our rates are reflective of that."" Hanaway joined Husch Blackwell’s St. Louis office in 2013. Her federal prosecution history Will Scharf, Hanaway’s policy director, said as a U.S. attorney, Hanaway was ""directly responsible for federal prosecutions across half the state, signing every federal indictment initiating formal proceedings against criminals within the district, and supervising prosecutions as they progressed."" It’s unclear how many of these cases she prosecuted personally. She oversaw a staff of more than 100 people, as Hanaway makes clear on her campaign website. According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri’s online Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, which tracks criminal case filings for the court, Hanaway’s office filed at least 5,430 cases during her stint as a federal prosecutor. That doesn’t include cases inherited by Hanaway from her predecessors. So it could be argued that Hanaway actually dealt with even more than 5,430 cases. Scharf also noted in an email interview that Hanaway never claimed to be ""lead counsel"" or that she ""tried 4,000 cases,"" and that the notion that she could physically be there to prosecute 4,000 cases ""would be absurd, since 95 percent of criminal cases end in a guilty plea without a trial.""

Goodlatte: Obama said 22 times he lacks power to change immigration law
","U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says it should be a no-brainer for the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down President Barack Obama’s stalled program to shield millions of immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally. The high court heard arguments April 19 on whether Obama exceeded his authority in late 2014 by going around Congress and launching the program via executive order. Goodlatte, in a statement issued the day of the hearing, said the court should be guided by the past words of the president himself. ""Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own,"" said Goodlatte, R-6th. Obama’s program would delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for at least three years. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program. The president announced the program Nov. 20, 2014, after House Republicans didn’t act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Twenty-six states, not including Virginia, have sued to stop the program and have won before a federal district court judge in Texas and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We decided to examine Goodlatte’s claim that Obama said 22 times that he lacked the power to change immigration laws by himself. It’s a claim that’s been made by many Republicans. The source, according to Goodlatte’s statement, is a list blogged on Nov. 19, 2014, by then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Let’s first discuss the problems with Boehner’s list. Four of the quotes Boehner cited do not mention immigration but were general statements Obama made as a candidate for president about limiting the use of executive orders - a power he accused his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, of abusing. In another quote flagged by Boehner, Obama actually was talking about his inability to end the military’s now-defunct ""don’t ask, don’t tell"" policies on homosexuality. That leaves, by our count, 17 Obama statements on the list that go to the heart of Goodlatte’s claim. Here’s a sampling: March 28, 2011 During a town hall meeting at Bell Multicultural High School in the District of Columbia, Obama was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea. Obama said, ""With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed - and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard, so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. ""There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can’t make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity."" Jan. 30, 2013 During an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants. The president said, ""Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said, I think, previously, I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we’ve moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law, we said we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here, for example."" Feb. 14, 2013 Obama was asked during a Google+ Hangout, by a woman named Jackie, if he would be willing to take executive action on immigration to ensure ""families are not split apart."" Obama said, ""Well look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress, right now, has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system, and what that means is we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think in many cases the results may be tragic. ""And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we are focusing our enforcement resources on criminals as opposed to someone who is just here and trying to work and look  after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated, and what we’ve done is obviously passed a deferred action which made sure the dreamers - young people who were brought here and think of themselves as American are American, except for their papers -  that they are not deported. Having said all that, we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. That’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important."" Sept. 17, 2013 Obama was interviewed by Jose Diaz-Balart, anchor for Noticias Telemundo. The broadcaster asked the president if he would ""consider unilaterally freezing deportations for the parents of deferred-action kids"" - a term that generally refers to people who came to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, attend school or have graduated, and have not committed criminal offenses. Obama said, ""Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I’ve said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said,  ‘Here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented,’ and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement, and what I have been able to do is make a legal argument, that I think is absolutely right, that given the resources that we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do. ""What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. We’re not going to have them grow up under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I feel would be very difficult to defend legally."" On Nov. 18, 2014 - two days before Obama announced his immigration program - White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president altered his view on his executive power after conferring with the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security on ""what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address."" The White House argued before the Supreme Court that the 26 states contesting Obama’s program have no legal standing to sue, because immigration policy is the domain of the federal government and that no laws have been broken. The Obama administration also argued that it merely is setting policies - not establishing laws - on whom to deport. Congress, it said, provides only enough money annually to deport about 400,000 of the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The White House says it has focused on using those funds to deport those with criminal violations. Our ruling Goodlatte said, ""Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own."" Records offered by Goodlatte and other Republicans show Obama repeatedly has made such statements. But the congressman goes a little off course in trying to quantify the times the president has said so. In a handful of the instances, the president was talking in general terms about executive authority that he did not relate to immigration. So in the interest of precision, we rate Goodlatte’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/25/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-obama-said-22-times-he-lacks-power-chang/

Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham's claim that Saudi Arabia created al-Qaida lacks nuance
","Controversy is swirling over 28 pages from the congressional report on the 9/11 terror attacks that have been kept hidden from the public. There is a suspicion that they implicate Saudi Arabia, a United States ally in the Middle East. The Saudis have, for years, vigorously denied any involvement in the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., co-chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee that helped write the report and has pushed for release of all the documents looking at Saudi involvement in the attacks. Sunday on Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked why United States and Saudi officials don't want the information released. ""To me, the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is, did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?"" Graham said. ""I think it's implausible to think that people who couldn't speak English, had never been in the United States before, (and) as a group were not well-educated could have done that. So who was the most likely entity to have provided them that support? And I think all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia. We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida. It was a creation of Saudi Arabia."" We wondered if, in fact, it was Saudi Arabia that created al-Qaida, the organization led by Osama bin Laden that engineered the attacks. Origin stories The terrorist group's origins can be traced to Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union waged a long and ultimately fruitless war from 1979 to 1989. It was the era of the Cold War, and the United States backed the Muslim insurgents who were fighting the Soviets. The Afghan freedom fighters were also getting backing from fellow Muslims in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. One person giving money was bin Laden, the son of a wealthy construction magnate. But he also helped establish what was known as the ""Golden Chain,"" a group of Arab donors who gave millions for the cause. The money went to something known as the Services Office, which was run by bin Laden and a Palestinian religious scholar name Abdullah Azzam. The office recruited, trained and equipped thousands of foreign ""holy warriors,"" known as mujahideen, from more than 50 countries. Their training camp was known as ""the base,"" which translates to al-Qaida. In 1988, when the war against the Soviets was winding down, there was a meeting in Pakistan where al-Qaida was formed. Bin Laden wanted to take the fight of jihad to other countries, driving out the corrupting influence of Western countries and replace it with fundamentalist Islam. Bin Laden moved to Saudi Arabia. In 1990, after Iraq President Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait, Saudi Arabia's rulers felt vulnerable and asked the United States to intervene. That upset bin Laden. ""Bin Laden viewed this development as an unbearable humiliation for all Muslims — the land of the Prophet defiled by infidels,"" said Philippe Migaux, writing in The History of Terrorism. He offered his mujahideen fighters to help defend the country, but the offer was rejected. He then issued a fatwa, or religious edict, that denounced the ruling House of Saud, calling it corrupt. The Saudi government expelled him in 1991, ultimately stripping him of Saudi citizenship in 1994. He ended up in Sudan, where he operated al-Qaida and coordinated terrorist attacks. Sudan expelled him on May 18, 1996 — but not before he took millions with him raised from his Golden Chain — and he went to Afghanistan, which had just been taken over by the Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim group. He was in Afghanistan when the 9/11 attacks were launched. A question of financing So did Saudi Arabia start al-Qaida? Clearly Saudi money was directly invested to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan. But once that goal was accomplished and al-Qaida became an entity, the funding became less direct. Daniel Byman, research director at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, said in a email, ""Osama bin Laden's personal wealth mattered tremendously when the group was formed in 1988. In a way this wealth was ‘Saudi’ in that his family was a Saudi family, but it's different than the Saudi state or Saudi organizations."" ""Over time,"" Byman said, ""Bin Laden lost his money and/or the Saudi government froze it. A network of wealthy donors, many from the Gulf states (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia) became vital to al-Qaida funding (and easily eclipsed Bin Laden's personal wealth)."" Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, ""It's not as though everyone in the government supported funding al-Qaida."" But there was so much Saudi-based support from individual Saudis and organizations that directed money from the Saudi government that the statement should be considered true, Gartenstein-Ross said, even if Graham's statement ""is a bit under-nuanced."" ""He's talking about Saudi financiers. He's not claiming the state itself is a major supporter for al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""Government-sponsored charities were doing it, and the government had to be aware it was going on."" ""It's clear you had government money that went through these charities,"" he said. ""And while you could talk about lack of oversight for these charities, which used to be the line the government used, mere lack of oversight doesn't fully explain the government's position."" It would be more accurate to say that the terrorist organization was created, Gartenstein-Ross said, by ""Saudi financiers including organizations financed by the government that don't represent official government policy."" Graham directed us to a 2003 Wall Street Journal article that reported ""some of Saudi Arabia's richest and most influential families as among the first financial supporters of Osama bin Laden."" However, as the article notes, that support came as bin Laden was transitioning away from fighting the Soviets. The families involved have denied funding the al-Qaida-involved terrorist attacks. Graham harked back to his comment on Meet the Press when Todd asked about the distinction between the government and wealthy individuals who happen to be Saudi Arabian. ""That is a very murky line. Saudi Arabia has made it murky by its own legal action,"" Graham said. ""Whenever a U.S. group sues a Saudi Arabian entity, whether it’s a bank, a foundation, a charity, immediately, the defense of sovereign immunity is raised. The Saudis don't recognize the difference between a royal decision and a societal decision in the same way that other countries might."" Our ruling Graham said, ""We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida."" Al-Qaida was started in an effort, largely backed by Saudi Arabia, to force the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan. The government did not, strictly speaking, create the organization. It was the product of jihadists wanting to continue the fight after the Soviets left, using the funds of Saudi backers to do it. It prospered because of donations from Saudi interests, including groups tied to the government. The Saudis deserve significant responsibility for its existence. But Graham's phrasing could leave people believing the Saudi government itself created the terrorist organization. The truth is fuzzier, and the caveats are important. So we rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c651dc1e-3467-4404-96a7-78286af7f362",/factchecks/2016/apr/24/bob-graham/bob-graham-saudi-arabia-created-al-qaida/
"['National', 'Income', 'Voting Record', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders said poor people don't vote
","Income inequality is the core issue of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, and he said it may also be why he’s behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders why he thought 16 of 17 states with large wealth gaps were won by Clinton. ""Well, because poor people don’t vote. I mean, that’s just a fact,"" Sanders said. ""That’s a sad reality of American society. And that’s why we have to transform one, as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major society of Earth. We have done a good job of bringing young people. But in America today, the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote."" Is turnout among the poor really that low? The data shows that we’ve done slightly better at getting out the vote among low-income people than what Sanders suggests, but not by much. Sanders’ policy director Warren Gunnels pointed us to a report by the left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos, which used data from the Census Bureau. ""According to Demos, only one in four of those earning less than $10,000 voted in 2014,"" Gunnels said. ""Even worse, the turnout was just 12 percent among 18- to 24-year-olds earning less than $30,000."" In other words, roughly 75 percent of people in the lowest income bracket didn’t vote in the last midterm elections. However, there’s one catch to this figure. While an annual income of less than $10,000 is undoubtedly ""poor,"" the poverty threshold in 2014 also includes family incomes above $10,000. Sean McElwee, a policy analyst with Demos who authored the report, told us to look at annual incomes under $30,000 instead. The turnout rate for that group was 31.5 percent, which means 68.5 percent of poor people didn’t vote in 2014, about 10 percentage points less than what Sanders said. ""Sanders is indeed correct to highlight low turnout among the poor as an important factor that biases policy in favor of the wealthy,"" McElwee said.  As PolitiFact has reported, census data may overstate the turnout rates, as it’s based on self-reporting. So it’s possible that Sanders’ 80 percent figure is closer to actual rates than what the survey shows, but this is speculative. Sanders is more on target if we look at a definition of ""poor"" that is not based on income. A 2015 Pew Center survey looked at the politics of financial security, which analysts defined as having a credit card, a savings or checking account, and a retirement or investment plan; not needing to borrow money; not falling behind on bills, rent or mortgage payments; and not receiving food assistance or Medicaid benefits. The survey found that just 20 percent of the least financially secure were ""likely voters"" in 2014 compared to 69 percent of the most financially secure. Turnout always drops in midterm elections, when the White House isn’t at stake, and overall turnout in 2014 was the worst it had been in 72 years. Nonetheless, census data shows turnout is consistently lower among the poor than other income groups:  So why are the poor less likely to vote? The reasons are interconnected, if not unsurprising. For one, the political process sets hurdles for the poor. Registration barriers are key, said McElwee of Demos, pointing to census data that shows that low-income people are far less likely to be registered voters. Voter ID laws, for example, impose costs that people struggling to make ends meet can’t really afford. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2014 that a driver’s license can cost between $5 to $58.50 in states with voter ID laws. And nearly 500,000 eligible voters don’t have convenient access to an ID-issuing office, according to a 2012 study by New York University. The poor also make up 55 percent of people who can’t vote (which include felons and immigrants as well as residents of Washington D.C., and U.S. territories), according to a 2013 Harvard University working paper. ""This means that they can't vote but also they won't be mobilized by parties, who base their mobilization off of voter files,"" McElwee said. Being poor also means you cannot afford to devote time to the political process. The Pew study found that just 26 percent of the least financially secure knew which party controlled Congress compared to 62 percent of the most affluent. Similarly, compared to affluent non-voters, low-income non-voters were more likely to list disinterest, forgetting to vote, health and issues of access as reasons why they didn’t vote, according to census data. ""They often have inflexible jobs, have limited transportation options to get to the polls, and/or insufficient knowledge about democracy and the choices they face,"" said Zoltan Hajnal, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. ""The poor also often lack efficacy and don’t feel like their votes count as much."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""In 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote."" The figure is a bit high if we look at turnout by income. In 2014, about 75 percent of people who made under $10,000 and about 69 percent of those who made under $30,000 didn’t vote. If we look at financial insecurity, however, Sanders is right on the money. We rate his claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2016/apr/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-said-poor-people-dont-vote/
"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Clinton reaches too far on immigration claim
","In a new radio ad in Spanish, Hillary Clinton's campaign champions her work on immigration reform and says she's been ""standing with Latino families in Rhode Island and across the country for her entire career."" ""In Rhode Island, we come from all over. Our diversity is our strength,"" the campaign says in the ad. The announcer continues, ""She is the only candidate who has stood by our community and immigration reform from the beginning."" Ahead of Tuesday's primary, we thought this was an important issue to nail down. Has Hillary Clinton stood by Latino voters ""from the beginning""? Is she the only candidate who has? Let's tackle the Republicans first. Ted Cruz In an interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News in February, Ted Cruz said he would forcibly deport all of the country's undocumented immigrants by sending ""law enforcement to apprehend them and send them home."" He backs plans to build a U.S.-Mexico border fence, and wants to end birthright citizenship, according to an NPR report. We emailed Ted Cruz's campaign three times and asked for more information. They never got back to us. John Kasich At an August town hall meeting in New Hampshire, Gov. John Kasich said ""it is not practical nor is it I think desirable"" to deport immigrants en masse, The New York Times reported. But Ohio, where Kasich is governor, is part of a multi-state lawsuit blocking President Obama's 2014 executive order that would offer temporary legal status to millions. We exchanged 14 emails with Rob Nichols, Kasich's press secretary, hoping for clarification. He said we're ""testing the wrong part of the sentence"" and declined to provide information about Kasich's record until we established what Clinton meant by ""from the beginning."" We told him what she meant — the beginning of her career — and he said ""If I can prove that Hillary hasn't always stood by that community, why wouldn't that suffice?"" and then asked ""Why do we matter?"" Then he stopped responding. Donald Trump Well, there's the wall. Also his insistence that Mexico is sending the United States ""drugs, crime, and rapists."" Enough said. Bernie Sanders Sanders has a strong record on immigration issues, Warren Gunnels, his senior policy advisor, replied. Sanders supports ""comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows,"" the senator said in a MSNBC Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire in February. He voted for the Dream Act in 2010, which would have legalized immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He also supported the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" bill in 2013. This bipartisan legislation created a path for people already in the United States, focused on reducing visa backlogs, and improved work visa options for low-skilled workers. While he was in the House of Representatives in the '90s, he voted against House Amendment 778, which would have to prohibited undocumented people's access to Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food and shelter programs. He voted for Amendment 968 to H.R. 2202, which removed a section barring ""illegal aliens from receiving public assistance."" In 2006, he voted against the Immigration Law Enforcement Act, which allowed local police to aid in ""enforcement of immigration laws, to provide for effective prosecution of alien smugglers, and to reform immigration litigation procedures. Hillary Clinton We asked Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Hillary for America, to provide evidence to substantiate the ad's claims. Schwerin told us that while in law school, Clinton worked with Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children's Defense Fund. She completed research on education and health of migrant children that would later be used in Senate hearings investigating the living and working conditions of farm workers. He also told us about her job on George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, where she worked closely with Franklin Garcia, a well-respected union leader, registering Latino voters in south Texas, which was chronicled in a Buzzfeed article about her ties to the Latino community. While serving in the Senate, Clinton co-sponsored the Safe, Orderly, Legal Visas and Enforcement Act of 2004 with Sen. Edward Kennedy. Clinton co-sponsored the Dream Act in 2003, 2005 and 2007, which helped give immigrant students access to higher education, among other things. As Secretary of State in May 2011, Clinton called immigrants a ""source of vitality"" for the U.S. at the Council of the Americas 41st Washington Conference. She also supported Obama's commitment to comprehensive immigration reform during those remarks. During the campaign, Clinton has stressed that Sanders voted against the comprehensive immigration reform bill brought by Arizona Sen. John McCain and the late Sen. Kennedy six times. She voted yes. But, explaining that vote in 2007, Sanders said ""it made no sense"" to bring millions of ""guest workers"" into the country when it could drive down wages of U.S. employees. Gunnels, in a recent email, said Sanders also thought the bill ""lacked badly needed protection"" for immigrant voters and noted that Hispanic advocacy groups such as The League of United Latin American Citizens, The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, and The American Immigration Lawyers Association also opposed the bill. Drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants is another issue that flared on the debate stage last month in Miami. Clinton says she supports opening up driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. So does Sanders. But in 2007, as Sanders pointed out in the debate, Clinton said as president she would not support that.  Our ruling Hillary Clinton has long supported the immigrant community: from law school to the Senate to the Cabinet, and she's built a strong record of what her ad calls ""immigration reform."" She may well have been at it ""from the beginning,"" but to say she is the ""only"" candidate supporting ""immigration reform"" over a career is to minimize Sanders' position on the issue. Hillary's campaign can trace her support back to law school. As for the ""beginning"" for Sanders, we don't know what positions he took as a young socialist, but we can track his immigration record back to beginning of his legislative career in Washington. Sanders' voting record and his immigration reform plan show consistent support for a path to citizenship, despite his opposition to the 2007 bill. And remember, Clinton herself seemed to stumble on drivers' licenses in 2007. Because the statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/apr/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-reaches-too-far-immigration-claim/

Pro-Donald Trump PAC hits Ted Cruz on amnesty for illegal immigrants, more Syrian refugees in U.S.
","As Donald Trump was being rebuked for saying women who get an abortion should be punished, a pro-Trump political action committee attacked Ted Cruz on Syrian refugees and illegal immigration. Great America PAC aired its TV ad in Wisconsin and other markets on March 31, 2016, a day after Trump’s abortion comments in Green Bay and six days before Wisconsin’s primary election.   Refugee center in Hoxter, Germany, that primarily serves refugees from Syria. (Mark Hoffman photo) The 30-second spot shows a woman in her kitchen with two children. She starts by talking about Trump and terrorist attacks in Europe and California. ""Sure, I get some grief when I say I'm voting for Donald Trump. But you know what? I want to protect my family. Paris, San Bernardino and now Brussels? I want a president that will keep us safe. ""We need to control our borders and stop letting in dangerous people. Trump will do that. And Ted Cruz? He wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants. That won't protect my family. Donald Trump will."" Cruz -- who handily won Wisconsin, but has almost no chance to win the Republican presidential nomination on the first ballot at the party’s convention -- has cast himself as tough on terrorism and border control. We found that the ad’s clever use of the past tense -- in saying the Texas senator wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants -- has some foundation. But the foundation isn’t entirely solid. And when the woman in the ad returns to speaking in the present tense -- ""That won’t protect my family"" -- the ad leaves a misleading impression of Cruz’s current positions. Setting the table A few notes up front: Great America PAC, founded in February 2016 and formerly known as TrumPAC, didn’t respond to our requests for information to support the ad’s claim. A Cruz campaign spokesman told us that on immigration, the senator never backed amnesty and that on Syrian refugees, he never backed an increase in the numbers. The Washington Post Fact Checker gave the ad two Pinocchios -- its rating for a claim that has ""significant omissions and/or exaggerations."" Our evaluation was similar. ‘Wanted to let in more Syrian refugees’ As reported during the presidential campaign by the Huffington Post, Cruz in 2014 expressed support for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States. He said in a Fox News report on Syrian refugees (as shown in a video is on Cruz’s own Senate web page): ""We have welcomed refugees — the tired, huddled masses — for centuries. That’s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so."" He added: ""We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that."" The Fact Checker found in reviewing other Cruz statements in 2014 that he was not a particularly vocal advocate for accepting more refugees, but he supported the idea. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Cruz changed course, seeking to ban Syrian refugees who are Muslim from entering the United States. Wanted to ‘give amnesty to illegal immigrants’ Some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. Both the Fact Checker and FactCheck.org found it impossible to sort out Cruz’s position on the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill from the so-called Gang of Eight. FactCheck.org noted that one Cruz amendment to the bill would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally -- but, purposefully, also left intact provisions to provide legal status for them. And the Fact Checker pointed out that Cruz introduced five amendments to the bill, including one that expanded legal immigration, and gave passionate speeches in support of his amendments. Cruz now contends his amendments were meant as a ""poison pill"" to kill the bill, which ultimately fell apart. But as the Fact Checker observed, ""there’s no way to prove which version of the story is the truth; what we can say is that Cruz was being disingenuous then or disingenuous now."" As for now, Cruz is adamantly against amnesty. Our rating Great America PAC says Cruz ""wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants."" Cruz in 2014 supported continuing to allow Syrian refugees into the United States and in 2013, he appeared to back measures to give legal status to illegal immigrants. At the same time, the political action committee’s ad suggests those positions are current ones, when they aren’t. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.  ",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/great-america-pac/pro-donald-trump-pac-hits-ted-cruz-amnesty-illegal/

Tom Smith of Public Citizen says 600,000 Texas registered voters lack valid photo IDs to go to polls
","Tom ""Smitty"" Smith, a liberal activist, says more than half a million Texans lack sufficient papers to legally turn out to vote. Smith, the longtime director of Public Citizen’s Texas office, made his claim in an April 14, 2016, commentary on campaign finance published in the Austin American-Statesman that also mentions the law under legal challenge requiring Texas voters to present a photo ID before being casting a ballot at a polling place. Republicans who carried the ID mandate into law in 2011 say it reduces chances of voter fraud. Democrats say the show-your-ID hoop was needless and obviously intended solely to reduce turnout by minorities, the elderly and other citizens likely not to have one of the accepted kinds of identification. And ""Texas,"" Smith wrote, ""has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote."" Under the Texas law, a registered voter may cast a ballot at the polls if she or he presents one of these kinds of identification: a Texas driver's license; a personal ID issued by the Department of Public Safety; an election certificate, which is a new form of state photo identification created by the law; a U.S. military ID card; a U.S. passport; or a Texas concealed handgun permit. So, do some 600,000 of the state’s 14.2 million registered voters lack all of those? By email, Smith told us he drew the figure from a Feb. 29, 2016, Washington Post news story stating that Texas may have the country’s toughest voter ID mandate and that a federal court in the state ""found that 608,470 registered voters don’t have the voter IDs that the state now requires for voting. For example, residents can vote with their concealed-carry handgun licenses but not their state-issued student university IDs."" We’ve rated a similar statement about voting with concealed handgun licenses True. Federal court ruling The story was referring to a decision by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi accepting the 600,000 estimate. Ramos’ October 2014 ruling, lately awaiting review by the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, came in a suit brought by plaintiffs led by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth. Specifically, Ramos’ ruling presents her finding that ""approximately 608,470 registered voters in Texas, representing approximately 4.5% of all registered voters, lack qualified SB 14 ID,"" meaning one of the types of photo ID spelled out in Senate Bill 14, the legislation behind the Texas law. Expert's report In her ruling, Ramos said she based her finding on research presented by scholars, particularly Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard professor of government retained as a consultant in the lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department. Ansolabehere, Ramos wrote, ""performed an extensive match of various databases to arrive at the figures set out above, which is referred to as the ‘No-Match List.’"" Ramos elaborated: ""First, he (Ansolabehere) determined which of the 13.5 million voters in Texas’s voter registration database, the Texas Election Administration Management System (TEAM), lacked SB 14 ID. He did this by comparing individual TEAM voter records with databases containing the records of those who possessed SB 14 ID—current DPS-issued Texas driver’s licenses, Texas personal ID cards, EICs, Texas concealed handgun licenses, United States passports, citizenship certificates, and military photo IDs—to arrive at a list of voter records that did not match with any SB 14 qualified photo ID. ""Dr. Ansolabehere ‘scrubbed’ the list by removing entries that appeared to be duplicates and those appearing in other databases that identified persons who were deceased and who had relocated (potentially out of state). He also removed voters identified as inactive, and those who were eligible for SB 14’s disability exemption to further ensure that he was counting only those who had no alternative for voting other than with a qualified SB 14 ID. All of these matches were performed with algorithms designed to address different name spellings and the use of nicknames or other variations in the way individuals are identified or would be input into a database. He concluded that approximately 608,470 voters in the TEAM database lack qualified SB 14 ID."" Ramos wrote that defenders of the photo ID mandate challenged Ansolabehere’s findings ""by arguing that he failed to remove felons and voters who subsequently re-registered in another state. There was evidence that the (secretary of state’s office) purges the TEAM database on a daily basis for felons,"" Ramos wrote, ""and Dr. Ansolabehere testified that recent data from both the Pew Research Center and various secretaries of state established that the number of voters who may have re-registered in another state is extremely small—less than one percent,"" the judge wrote. We asked Ansolabehere if the 608,000 figure he estimated might, nearly two years later, no longer reflect the likely number of registered voters lacking one of the permitted photo IDs. By email, he said he couldn’t offer any comment beyond his September 2014 expert’s report and court testimony since the legal challenge to the law hasn’t settled out. Similarly, we asked Smith if, perhaps, the number of registered voters lacking the required photo ID to go to the polls in Texas has changed since 2014, maybe decreasing with the law in place. By phone, Smith said he doesn’t know. A 2011 state estimate Our search of the Nexis news database reminded us the Texas secretary of state’s office in 2011 answered a federal request for information by saying research indicated that about 605,500 registered Texas voters might lack a state-issued license or ID; the figure was reached by comparing voter registrations to Department of Public Safety records by first name, last name and date of birth, per an October 2011 news story in the Dallas Morning News. In reviewing Smith’s claim, we wrote the agency requesting elaboration on its own estimate and to ask if it had an updated count. By email, spokeswoman Alicia Phillips Pierce said the office has no up-to-date estimate of Texas voters lacking a poll-acceptable ID. Pierce also said she couldn’t comment on Smith’s statement because of the continuing legal fight, though she suggested we consider state briefs filed in its appeal of Ramos’s ruling. By our read, a state’s brief filed in 2015 doesn’t challenge Ansolabehere’s total estimate of voters lacking a required ID outside of a footnote stating that since implementation of the ID law, about 22,000 ""of the registered voters that plaintiffs claim do not have a photo ID have voted in at least one election."" Our ruling Smith said: ""Texas has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote."" That may have been so in 2014, according to an expert’s research, and the figure arguably aligns with a  2011 state estimate limited to matching voter registrations and driver licenses. We didn’t find an up-to-date figure, though, and Smith’s implication--that 600,000 citizens haven’t voted for lack of acceptable IDs--might not hold up; we don’t know. We rate the claim Mostly True. Mostly True – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab2c7daf-5de6-4a7a-8215-775d98c9a58a",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/tom-smitty-smith/tom-smith-public-citizen-says-600000-texas-registe/

Danny Tarkanian off the mark on Common Core attack
","The contentious Republican primary for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District is moving to the airwaves. In a new television ad, candidate Danny Tarkanian accuses his opponent, state Sen. Michael Roberson, of several crimes against conservatism including a claim that he ""forced Common Core for Nevada schools."" Because Common Core has become a rallying cry for a subsection of the Republican Party, we were curious how much of a role Roberson played in adopting the standards. The ad visually references a vote by the state’s interim Legislative Commission in August 2015, which meets when Nevada’s part-time Legislature isn’t actively serving and approves regulations proposed by state agencies and departments. The Tarkanian campaign sent two articles from the meeting, which saw the majority of commission members approve replacing the state’s former high school mathematics standards with the Common Core State Standards. The standards themselves refer to a group of general benchmarks in English and math developed by several states and nonprofit groups in 2010. Forty-two states have adopted at least some of the standards, and contrary to what Donald Trump says, they aren’t ""education through Washington D.C.,"" PolitiFact has reported on in the past. Roberson did vote for the Common Core math standards, but it’s not as cut-and-dried as Tarkanian’s ad suggests. State education officials testified that the vote was necessary to fix an ""administrative oversight"" that an earlier approved regulation omitted the corresponding standards for high school math, lost in the shuffle during a leadership change. But Nevada schools began transitioning over to the Common Core standards in 2011, so the committee vote didn’t ""force"" a new set of standards in overnight. ""It doesn’t mean that work that been in place for literally five to six years would have stopped,"" said state superintendent of public instruction Steve Canavero on what a ""no"" vote would have meant. Nevada schools fully implemented Common Core standards for English and math in all grades at the start of the 2014-15 school year, after several years of transitioning off the old standards. However, Roberson’s involvement in Common Core is a little more complicated. Common Core in Nevada Changing Nevada’s educational standards requires jumping through some bureaucratic hoops. The process starts with the state’s Council to Establish Academic Standards, a board made up of legislators and teachers who oversee and review the state’s academic standards. That board was tasked in 2009 with developing a set of regulations after Nevada and 47 other states agreed to look into developing a common set of education standards across the states. In 2010, that group and the Nevada State Board of Education both approved the new Common Core standards for English and math after numerous public hearings and workshops and began the multi-year process transitioning to the new standards. This is where approving standards gets slightly convoluted. Though the two state boards ""approved"" the standards and did the brunt of the vetting work, the final authority rests with the Legislative Commission, which is given authority to approve proposed rules and regulations through Nevada’s state constitution. So the 12-member commission approved the Common Core standards in May 2012 on an 11-1 vote, with Roberson joining the majority to approve the standards. So, it’s technically accurate to say Roberson voted in favor of implementing Common Core in Nevada (even though the ad references the wrong meeting). He also voted for several pieces of legislation that sought to assist the rollout of Common Core, like a study on implementation and aligning curriculum to the standards. But it’s somewhat disingenuous to directly connect Roberson to ""forcing"" Common Core implementation. Canavero acknowledged that while the ultimate authority to approve the standards lies with the legislators, the vast majority of legwork in reviewing and adopting the new standards was undertaken by state agencies through the regulation process, not by individual legislators. ""The Legislature in its wisdom has created a process in law and deferred some of that to regulation,"" Canavero said. ""They have a right to change that process if they collectively agree."" State agencies weren’t the only entities supporting Common Core — higher education Regents and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval have actively supported implementing the standards, citing previous standards as lacking. Opponents of Common Core did push for an ultimately unsuccessful bill that sought to ""repeal"" the standards during the 2015 session, but Roberson never took a vote or publicly voiced support or opposition to the legislation, which never left the Assembly. It’s worth noting that there is a difference between standards and curriculum. Nevada’s Common Core-aligned standards (which are online) do contain tips and suggestions, but the decisions on curriculum, textbooks and classroom materials still fall under the purview of school districts and individual teachers. Canavero said state agencies have held close to a dozen public hearings and workshops on Common Core over the last five or six years, and that education officials have had to battle a ""misinformation campaign"" that implementing the standards somehow constituted a federal takeover of public education. ""I believe it’s a settled matter,"" he said. ""It’s implemented, we’re aligned to it, we’re assessing it. Our students are receiving instruction aligned to these standards."" Our ruling Danny Tarkanian’s new ad claims Roberson ""forced Common Core in Nevada schools."" Although the ad points to a misleading committee vote, Roberson did indeed approve the regulation adopting Common Core standards back in 2012. However, it’s not accurate to claim he ""forced"" the regulations into schools because the adoption effort started before Roberson took office and was primarily handled by state agencies, not the Legislature. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/danny-tarkanian/tarkanian-misses-mark-linking-opponent-common-core/

Dolphins are rapists, 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' claims wrongly
","If your spirit animal is a dolphin, you may want to think about changing spirit animals. At least that’s what Dr. Andrea Bayden, a psychiatrist played by Tina Fey on Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, would have you believe. Netflix released the second season of the show — which follows happy-go lucky former cult member Kimmy Schmidt played by Ellie Kemper — on April 15. In the ninth episode, Schmidt meets a drunk Bayden, who tells Schmidt her sleep cycle is erratic. ""You know who else doesn’t sleep a lot?"" Schmidt replied. ""Dolphins. And they’re always smiling."" Not so fast, Bayden said: ""Dolphins are rapists. Look it up."" Yes, yes, this is a fictional show. But people wondered if the line was more than a joke. And quite honestly, so did we. (If you hate fun, we have plenty of fact-checks about tax policy you can read.) As it turns out, this is somewhat of an urban legend. Research has shown that dolphins sometimes exhibit somewhat aggressive behavior in their mating practices, but it’s not fair to call it rape. Females are strong as hell The myth largely emerged from research conducted on bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, said Janet Mann, vice provost for research and a biology professor at Georgetown University. Mann, who worked on the Shark Bay research, said male bottlenose dolphins form alliances with two to four other males, and these groups will consort with a single female, and mating occurs. Often, the males will be aggressive toward the female and attack males outside of the alliance that attempt to get near or steal the female. But the female can avoid mating with a particular male by turning away, or she can go belly up at the surface to avoid mating at all. There’s no evidence to show that the males force the females to mate, said Richard Connor, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who has also worked on Shark Bay dolphin research. It’s possible they intimidate the females, but that’s unproven. Connor added that researchers think female dolphins try to mate with a number of different males, to confuse the issue of paternity and reduce the risk of infanticide. So they may actually want to mate with the males that herd them. ""Males force the females to stay with them, but (there’s) no evidence of forced copulation,"" Connor said. ""People are making a leap, perhaps because they have not considered that females may want to mate with as many males as possible."" In a 2013 blog post debunking the dolphin-rape myth, dolphin behavior expert Justin Gregg noted that there are also rumors that dolphins rape humans. While there might be isolated incidents of dolphins with erections around humans or thrusting toward them, this is not rape. It’s unclear whether the dolphins actually want to mate or if it’s another form of social behavior, Gregg said. ""Calling any of this behavior rape trivializes the word rape,"" Gregg wrote. ""It either downplays the horrific human behavior of rape by jokingly misapplying it to quirky animal behavior, or unnecessarily vilifies what is, for dolphins, a diverse catalog of behaviors that might not cause the dolphins involved very much stress, and might even be consensual 100 percent of the time."" Gregg, a big Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt fan, told PolitiFact he wouldn’t be surprised if Fey and the show’s other writers know that the dolphins-as-rapists meme is not actually true. ""Either way, if it gets people Googling the concept and reading up on why it’s not really accurate to describe dolphins as rapists, all the better,"" he said. Our ruling Tina Fey’s character on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt said, ""Dolphins are rapists. Look it up."" We did. It’s just a myth. While research has shown some aggressive mating behavior among dolphin males, this isn’t the same thing as ""rape."" Importantly, there’s no evidence to show that the females are forced to mate. We looked it up and found that this claim is very much breakable. False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8057807-878d-4fca-b029-1f01fa7a7516",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt/dolphins-rapists-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt/

Hillary Clinton gets 0.2 percent of campaign donations from oil, gas employees, Robby Mook says
","In a recent post on Medium, Robby Mook -- Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager -- countered accusations from Bernie Sanders that Clinton has been tainted by taking money from oil and gas interests. ""In last week’s debate,"" Mook wrote of the April 14 Democratic presidential face-off in Brooklyn, ""Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent."" We have taken a look at this general topic before but haven’t rated this particular assertion, so we’ll do it here. A look at the numbers We turned to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. Clinton has raised $307,561 from people employed by the oil and gas industry. It’s worth noting that not all this money comes from people with deep pockets; this total includes donations from everyone employed by the industry, from CEOs to gas-station employees. Altogether, Clinton’s campaign has raised more than $180 million, so the percentage raised from employees of the oil and gas industry works out to 0.17 percent -- which is actually a bit less than Mook said. By comparison, Sanders has raised less from oil and gas employees than Clinton has -- $53,760 -- which amounts to 0.03 percent of the $182 million his campaign has raised. In any case, this particular statistic looks solid on the math. That said, we’ll raise a caveat. Mook’s narrow focus Mook has worded the claim carefully to exclude other donations, which amounts to a bit of cherry-picking. Mook refers to ""employees."" But as the Sanders campaign has argued -- citing analyses by Greenpeace and the Huffington Post -- Clinton’s campaign has also received donations from lobbyists who have ties to oil and gas interests. These donations would not be reported as having come from employees of oil and gas companies and thus aren’t included in the total we calculated above. The Huffington Post article, from July 17, 2015, found that ""nearly all of the lobbyists bundling contributions for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign have at one time or another worked for the fossil fuel industry."" It links to 40 registered lobbyists but only offers details on some donors who still work for the industry. The Greenpeace report says that when you add in donations by lobbyists with an alleged tie to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton's total would rise to nearly $1.8 million. The fossil fuel industry's share of the Clinton coffers would go up to about 0.8 percent. The Sanders campaign added that the Greenpeace report goes a step further to include more than $4 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supports Clinton. And the Sanders team said that Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil have donated at least $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation. ""I understand the Clinton campaign objects to these figures, because some of the fossil fuel lobbyists who have bundled huge sums of money for their campaign also represent clients in other industries,"" said Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels. ""In our view, that makes these contributions even more objectionable. It's the lobbyists in Washington who write the bills and curry special favors for the firms they represent. You can't reform big oil and gas companies by taking bundled campaign cash from their lobbyists."" The Sanders critique is not a slam-dunk, however For starters, it’s a stretch to draw a direct line between those super PAC donations and Clinton’s campaign. Under federal law, the candidates have no control over super PAC spending. In addition, it’s up for debate how significant these lobbyists’ donations are. It’s not clear how much of influence the oil and gas industry would wield through a donor who once lobbied for them but doesn’t any more. In some cases, the lobbyists advocated for clients in multiple industries, not just oil and gas.  Finally, Clinton’s stances on oil and gas issues is not exactly in tune with the industry. She has said that if individuals from the industry want to donate to her, they should know that they may be wasting their money. She favors policies the oil and gas industry doesn’t like, and she is a big supporter of renewable energy, a philosophy Sanders has also embraced. Our ruling Mook wrote, ""In last week’s debate, Bernie questioned Hillary’s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent."" Mook’s statement is accurate, though it’s carefully constructed to exclude donations by lobbyists who have at one time represented the industry -- a point made by Sanders, though its relevance is up for debate. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f1dfea64-4e60-4564-9663-e348645568ed",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/robby-mook/hillary-clinton-gets-02-percent-campaign-donations/

Donald Trump and the number of manufacturing jobs Pennsylvania has lost
","Donald Trump focused a campaign rally in Harrisburg Thursday on bringing back manufacturing jobs to a state that’s lost more than many others in the past decade. The presidential frontrunner bolstered his point by telling thousands of supporters at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex: ""Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001"" and later added that Harrisburg, the state capital, ""has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001."" That seemed like a large percentage of jobs lost. So we decided to check the claim. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania lost nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001, decreasing from 856,200 to 564,900 in the span of 15 years. That correlates with a 34 percent decrease in jobs lost -- quite close to Trump’s 35 percent claim. However, the job loss in Harrisburg is off. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the Harrisburg metropolitan area had 30,500 manufacturing jobs in January 2001 and now is home to 21,400. That’s a decrease of 30 percent, not 40 percent as Trump claimed Thursday. His campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. Trump was right when he told supporters in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has been among the hardest hit in the country by a loss in manufacturing jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C., reported last year that eight states lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 1998 -- Pennsylvania came in seventh behind California, Ohio, North Carolina, New York, Michigan and Illinois. That job loss is significant for a state that, in 2013, employed 10 percent of its job force in the manufacturing sector and made 12 percent of its gross domestic product from the industry. Major hubs of manufacturing the state were, at one point, steel mills in western Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, and the shipyard in South Philadelphia. The size of those industries has largely decreased since their heyday. Kevin L. Kearns, president of the United States Business and Industry Council, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents mid-sized manufacturing companies, said manufacturing job loss since 2001 can be chalked up to globalization and the proliferation of the use of robotics in manufacturing. He said thousands of jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector to technology. But the companies his organization represented that shut down in the last decade didn’t do so because of technology -- they did it because other companies in their supply chain had outsourced to other countries. Kearns said the impact of manufacturing job loss has an impact on every corner of the Pennsylvania economy, as people who were once middle class are now either jobless or in other industries that may not pay as well, causing them to spend less in other ways. ""In a generalized way, it means that people in Pennsylvania are earning less money,"" he said. ""It has a massive footprint and a massive ripple effect."" Our ruling In an attempt to show Pennsylvanians he would work to bring back jobs, Trump said ""Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001"" and ""Harrisburg has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001."" The figure about the statewide manufacturing job loss checks out, but his claim about Harrisburg losing 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001 is off by about 10 percent. We rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/839cc7a1-e2d7-42ab-99bd-6922ca16af39",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-and-number-manufacturing-jobs-pennsyl/

Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan says the war on drugs has failed
","Several Latin American and European countries pressed their case to decriminalize drugs at a special session of the United Nations this week. They came up short. The document that emerged maintained a basic prohibitionist stance. But the advocates for a softer touch did garner some prominent backers, including former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who argued in an op-ed that the war on drugs has failed. ""Prohibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs,"" Annan wrote. ""When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use."" Measuring the effectiveness of prohibitions can be tricky. For this fact-check, we're looking into the connection between getting tough on drugs and less use. We reached out to the Kofi Annan Foundation and did not hear back, so we don’t know what specific studies he had in mind. We reached out to several experts in the field and generally, they agreed with his statement. Jonathan Caulkins, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, has worked on some of the broadest examinations of drugs in America. Caulkins was part of the team that wrote the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy’s latest assessment of how much users spend on drugs. ""There is some research that finds increased harshness reduces use, but the overall statement is true,"" Caulkins told PolitiFact. ""By and large, expanding toughness beyond a basic prohibition plus the usual amount of enforcement does not drive down use."" European countries created a natural laboratory of sorts on the interplay of marijuana laws and marijuana use. Over the decades, different countries have adopted a variety of approaches. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction examined the results in each place. The center’s legal analyst Brendan Hughes told us no clear relationship emerged. The following chart shows why. In Italy, for example, penalties went up but so did use. Denmark also tightened its laws and saw almost no change. On the flip side, the United Kingdom adopted lighter sanctions and the prevalence of marijuana fell. But when Slovakia did the same, usage rose.  One approach to gauging the impact of enforcement is to track trends in the price of drugs, after factoring in changes in purity. Based on the basic rules of supply and demand, if the price falls, use is expected to rise, and vice versa. The most recent analysis from the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy dates back to 2008. While the numbers could have changed since then, that report had discouraging news for the zero-tolerance camp. The price of heroin had fallen about 30 percent for all grades or purity in 10 years, cocaine showed a modest but steady decline, and some grades of marijuana saw a 50 percent drop in price. (This predates by many years the decriminalization moves in Colorado and Washington State.) Thomas Kerr, Co-Director of the Urban Health Research Initiative at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, said the federal data provide ""compelling evidence"" of the limits of a get-tough policy. ""As expenditures on drug control increased dramatically, use has not gone down, nor has price, while purity has gone up,"" Kerr said. Kerr pointed to research in Thailand, where simple possession of heroin can lead to up to 10 years in prison, that found harsh enforcement tactics had no apparent impact on heroin users. We did find one study that concluded that greater incarceration reduced drug use. Economist Steven Levitt at the University of Chicago co-authored a 2001 article that examined cocaine patterns between 1980 and 2000. It was a time, Levitt wrote, when the number of prisoners jailed for drug-related offenses rose 15-fold. ""We estimate that cocaine prices are 10 to 15 percent higher today as a consequence of increases in drug punishment since 1985,"" Levitt wrote. ""Based on previous estimates of the price elasticity of demand for cocaine, this implies a reduction in cocaine consumed of as much as 20 percent."" However, that conclusion hangs on a rising price of cocaine, and data gathered after that report showed prices falling, not rising. That doesn’t mean that cocaine use rose in response. As a sign of the complicated nature of drug consumption, federal data showed that from 2002 to 2010, the amount of cocaine used in the United States fell by half. An article by Caulkins and his colleague Peter Reuter at the RAND Corporation, a prominent think tank, concluded that enforcement can sometimes help stop a mass market from forming, such as in the case of a new drug coming on the scene. But once a drug takes hold, ""there may be little return to intense enforcement. A modest level of enforcement may generate most of the benefits from prohibition."" Caulkins emphasized that the policy choice is not between a total ban and no ban at all. ""If one goes from the basic enforcement necessary to make a prohibition real to no prohibition at all, then use and abuse would go way up,"" he warned. Our ruling Annan said that studies consistently fail to find a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use. The experts we reached and the data and reports we found largely backed that up. In some places, tougher penalties led to less use. In others, tougher laws had no effect at all. In the United States, while there are shifting patterns of drug use, there is no simple relationship to the severity of the nation’s drug laws. The caveat is that from the European study, relaxing penalties had equally unpredictable results. Annan’s statement needs that bit of context. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57b76f03-26f4-41a0-8a93-f3bfa84ccb0f",/factchecks/2016/apr/22/kofi-annan/former-un-secretary-general-says-war-drugs-has-fai/
