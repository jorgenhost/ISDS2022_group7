Sessions says Kagan violated U.S. law regarding military recruitment at Harvard Law School
","In a discussion of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on ABC's This Week on May 16, 2010, the back-and-forth between Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the committee's ranking Republican, largely focused on Kagan's position on military recruitment while she was dean at Harvard Law School from 2003-2009. We examined a claim from each of the senators, and here we're focusing on one from Sessions.""She disallowed them from the normal recruitment process on campus,"" said Sessions. ""She went out of her way to do so. She was a national leader in that, and she violated the law of the United States at various points in the process.""There's no debate that Kagan challenged the law regarding military recruiting on campuses. But is it true that Kagan ""violated the law of the United States at various points in the process""?The military recruiting issue long predated Kagan's tenure at Harvard Law School. Since 1979, the law school had a policy that requires employers who want to recruit on campus through the school's Office of Career Services to sign a statement that they do not discriminate based on race, gender or sexual orientation. The 1993 ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy -- which denied entry to openly gay people -- precluded U.S. military officials from signing, and so they were prohibited from using the Office of Career Services. But that didn't mean military recruiters were barred from campus altogether. Rather, the military recruited through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). ""The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal,"" wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010.However, Clark wrote, in 2002 the military officials ""took a hard line with Harvard"" and threatened to yank all the university's federal funding because they said Harvard was not providing equal access to military recruiters in violation of the 1996 Solomon Amendment.Here's what the Solomon Amendment says:""No [federal] funds...may be provided by contract or by grant to an institution of higher education (including any subelement of such institution) if the Secretary of Defense determines that that institution (or any subelement of that institution) has a policy or practice (regardless of when implemented) that either prohibits, or in effect prevents...the Secretary of a military department or Secretary of Homeland Security from gaining access to campuses, or access to students (who are 17 years of age or older) on campuses, for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.""In light of the threat to school funding, Harvard relented in 2002. Military recruiters were allowed to use the school's Office of Career Services, though administrators essentially put out statements saying they didn't like it and that they felt the military policy was discriminatory. That's where things stood when Kagan took over in 2003.In 2003, Kagan penned a letter to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue: ""I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their country.""Nonetheless, she allowed military recruiters to use the Office of Career Services.Meanwhile, an association of law schools known as the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights was mounting a legal challenge to the Solomon Amendment.In January, 2004, Kagan and several dozen of her colleagues at Harvard Law filed an amicus brief (sometimes known as a ""friend of the court"" brief) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit (which has jurisdiction over district courts in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania), arguing that the federal government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied the same policies to all recruiters. The withholding of funds interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they felt were discriminatory policies, they argued. In November 2004, the Third Circuit court concluded that ""the Solomon Amendment cannot condition federal funding on law schools’ compliance with it"" and that ""FAIR has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits"" of the case.Kagan immediately reinstated the ban on military recruiters’ use of Harvard Law’s Office of Career Services. She wrote in a letter to the faculty that the military could still recruit through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association (as it did prior to 2002).But with that case pending before the Supreme Court, the Pentagon threatened to withhold all federal funding to Harvard, and Kagan reversed course and allowed recruiters to again avail themselves of the Office of Career Services. So the ban lasted one semester in 2005. Kagan signed on to another amicus brief, again making its case to the Supreme Court, but on March 6, 2006, the Supreme Court rejected that circuit court ruling with a resounding 8-0 ruling. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the military. ""Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the policy,"" the opinion said.So did Kagan violate the law when she banned military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services for that one semester? First off, the law didn't say universities may not bar military recruiters. It said certain types of federal funds may not go to those schools if they bar the recruiters. There's a big difference.It's certainly fair to say Kagan tested the law, but it's another thing to claim she violated the law. Kagan barred military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services only after a Third Circuit court ruled the Solomon Amendment was ""likely"" unconstitutional. And she reversed course even before the Supreme Court ruled against the universities -- so she didn't willfully flout the law after the Supreme Court made the law unmistakably clear.Some may argue that the Third Circuit decision didn't affect Massachusetts, which is in the First Circuit, and that the Supreme Court was decisive in its reversal of that circuit court decision. So one could also argue that Kagan didn't comply with what the law required, but we think it's a stretch for Sessions to say Kagan ""violated the law of the United States at various points in the process."" There was at least some legal ambiguity -- for a time -- about Harvard's obligation. And, we note, no money was ever denied to Harvard. And so we rate Sessions' comment Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E1240C0>],/factchecks/2010/may/16/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-kagan-violated-us-law-regarding-mili/

Perry: White used D.C. connections to form firm that worked in Middle East and defaulted on $60 million loan
","UPDATE May 21, 2010: Upon our published conclusion that Azerbaijan and Georgia are not in the Middle East, Gov. Rick Perry's campaign noted that the CIA ""World Factbook"" classifies the nations as in the Middle East. Asked why, CIA spokeswoman Paula Weiss told us that the book takes several factors into account in categorizing countries by region; she did not elaborate. Separately, we did a fresh round of research. The experts we consulted said that there's no standard definition of which nations make up the region but that Azerbaijan and Georgia would not generally be considered part of the Middle East. Bashing Washington helped GOP Gov. Rick Perry take out U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in his party's March primary. Lately, Perry is claiming a Washington taint in Democratic nominee Bill White's background.The narrator of a Perry Web video posted May 3 says: ""Bill White used D.C. connections from his job in the Clinton administration to form a company that did business in the Middle East and defaulted on a $60 million loan.""Those are several facts worth checking. To avoid a confusing pile-up, let's break Perry's statement into these parts: White's job in D.C., the connections it may have given him, and the international oil and gas company White started to explore in the Caspian Sea region -- not in the Middle East, contrary to what Perry says.To support the video statement, the Perry campaign provided us with news reports from five outlets, including The Houston Chronicle and a magazine, Azerbaijan International.White's DC jobWhite's resume reflects decades spent as a lawyer, businessman and government employee. Most recently, he served for six years as the mayor of Houston.Perry's statement reflects back to the mid-1990s, when White served for about two years as deputy U.S. energy secretary in President Bill Clinton's administration.In his book ""The Oil and the Glory: The Pursuit of Empire and Fortune on the Caspian Sea,"" journalist Steve LeVine calls White one of the Clinton administration's ""pioneers of Caspian policy-making"" and says he helped ""put Caspian oil on Washington's agenda.""According to a February 2003 story in the Houston Press, an alternative newspaper: ""During his tenure as deputy energy secretary in the mid-'90s, White repeatedly visited the Caspian Sea area, where he met with Azerbaijan President Haidar Aliyev and Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia to discuss energy deals with Western companies.""Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, said that while he was deputy energy secretary, White traveled to the Caspian Sea region about six times, including at least three visits to Azerbaijan and two to Georgia. Denying that his interest in the region was financial, White told the Press then:  ""I had an interest in the former Soviet Union before I went into government, during government and after government. I thought it was critically important that the United States and the whole West try to teach good models of free enterprise over there.""FronteraWhite left his federal post in August 1995 and the next year helped found Houston-based Frontera Resources, which set its sights on emerging markets like the Caspian Sea. That resource-rich region was the site of an oil rush after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.A May 1997 item in the Houston Press said that ""after White left his energy post, he and Lan Bentsen, son of former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, immediately founded Frontera Resources and went into Azerbaijan and the neighboring state of Georgia."" Time out for a geography lesson. Those two places -- along with Bolivia, the only countries where Frontera has operated -- are former Soviet republics in the Caucasus, a region just north of the Middle East.Did White use Washington connections from his federal experience to form Frontera, as Perry says?Several published accounts, including a 2003 Houston Chronicle story sent to us by Perry's campaign, characterize the formation of the company that way. Some of those articles note that Lloyd Bentsen, who served as Clinton's Treasury secretary in 1993 and 1994, was an investor in the company; White told us recently that he knew Bentsen before his stint as a federal official.White also said the other co-founders of the company, Bentsen's son, Lan, and Steve Nicandros, who came to Frontera from a job as head of international business development for Conoco, didn't reflect connections he made in Washington. Bacon said White's wife introduced him to Lan Bentsen.We visited with White about the 1997 form filed with the Texas secretary of state's office to form the company and wondered about two other officers listed as vice presidents. He told us that he'd worked with Reginal Spiller and Robert Berls at the Department of Energy. White said he recruited Spiller, a geologist, to the department from Maxus Energy and that Spiller became vice president of exploration and production at Frontera. White said he hired Berls, an expert on the former Soviet Union, to work at the Energy Department on the recommendation of senior officials at the Defense Department.LeVine, the ""Oil and Glory"" author, told us that it wasn't White's political connections in Washington that were key to the Frontera enterprise, but contacts farther afield. ""It's the political connections that he made on the Caspian Sea as a D.C. official that gave him the entree there,"" said Levine. ""He didn't need contacts in Washington. ... He was the contact."" LeVine said: ""There is no doubt that Bill relied on senior-level contacts as deputy energy secretary to have the entree to obtain the energy acreage that Frontera got in Georgia and in Azerbaijan. You cannot say flatly that none of that would have happened absent him, but having met the presidents of both countries numerous times, you know, that's how business is done.""For his part, White called Perry's overall statement ""ridiculous."" He pointed to his deep background in oil and gas and energy-related fields and said he had ""many (employment) alternatives"" when he left the Energy Department. He also said the first money invested in the company was his own and noted that Nicandros, the company's current chairman and CEO, had been a leader in the oil and gas industry before coming to Frontera.Still, White acknowledged that his experiences as a federal energy official who traveled to the region had played a role in Frontera's business, saying: ""They helped me in making the assessment that these countries would not expropriate the oil and gas concessions.""Translation: White's administration experience helped the company assess the political and economic stability of the nations in which Frontera would do business.White was chief executive of Frontera until 1997, when he became president and chief operating officer of the Wedge Group, a private Houston holding company with interests in oil service companies, commercial real estate and hotels, according to a February article in the Austin American-Statesman. White remained chairman of Frontera's board until 2001.  He no longer has any role at the company, although his most recent financial disclosure form, filed with the Texas Ethics Commission on Feb. 16, says he holds ""10,000 or more"" shares of Frontera stock, which trades on the London stock exchange and on the unregulated over-the-counter market in the U.S. A March 31 audit report performed for the company by PriceWaterhouseCoopers says it ""has suffered recurring losses from operations and has limited available funds ... which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.""Bacon said White's shares are worth about $11,000. The loan In 1998, Frontera entered into an agreement with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan to develop oil fields there. In 2000, Frontera announced that it would receive $60 million in loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was created as communism crumbled in 1991 to support private sector growth in central Europe and central Asia.Problems developed in 2001, said Frontera spokeswoman Liz Williamson, when the state oil company halted exports of oil from the project. This led to a dispute between the companies, Williamson said, which ""triggered a violation of a loan covenant causing Frontera to default under the terms of certain financing agreements"" with the bank, which did not immediately respond to our queries.Williamson said the bank then foreclosed. The following year, Frontera's interest in the Azerbaijan project was sold for $53 million, and the loan was repaid.Frontera continues to operate in Georgia.Summing up: Perry is right that White worked in the Clinton administration and that he later formed a company that defaulted on a $60 million loan. He's off the mark, however, when he says that the company did business in the Middle East. As for whether White used ""D.C. connections to form"" Frontera, as Perry says, that's true in only the baldest sense. Yes, White worked in Washington when he made key contacts overseas that surely helped him with Frontera. And he recruited two federal underlings to the venture. But Perry's wording leaves an impression of insider Washington wheeler-dealing by White not backed by what we found.We rate Perry's statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550889840>],/factchecks/2010/may/16/rick-perry/perry-white-used-dc-connections-form-firm-worked-m/

Perry says Houston has more debt per capita than California
","
Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor and Houston's former mayor, casts himself in a recent TV ad as a ""man on the move"" who intends to ""move Texas forward."" 
GOP Gov. Rick Perry, running for re-election, depicts White as a man running from his record. ""The city of Houston now has more debt per capita than California,"" the narrator says in a May 3 Web advertisement posted by Perry's campaign. 
White has touted his financial prowess; we recently noted his claim to cutting city property tax rates five times. In contrast, California in 2009 issued 450,000 IOUs for personal income tax refunds. 
Does Houston have more debt per resident than the Golden State? 
Believe it. Perry's campaign pointed to fiscal 2009 financial reports for Houston and California. Houston's outstanding debt that year was $5,720 per person. California's debt per person was $2,808 — less than half of Houston's. 
Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, balked. Comparing state and city debt is ""ridiculous,"" she said, arguing that Texas lets local governments, like counties and cities, borrow money to build most of their infrastructure. 
Next, we asked Perry's campaign why he compared Houston's debt to California's debt as opposed to, say, Los Angeles. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said California was singled out because its economy isn't flourishing ""and that sets a pretty powerful comparison looking at the debt between Houston and the debt of the state."" 
Powerful, yes. But reasonable? We asked financial experts all along the political spectrum about that. 
Like White's campaign, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, said comparing cities' and states' long-term debt can be misleading. 
""The state will typically have responsibility for public infrastructure, such as highways,"" Craymer said. ""Cities — they're in charge of infrastructure for not just roads, but water, wastewater, solid waste, landfills. They're really very different operations."" 
Talmadge Helfin, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, said California's debt load is beyond his expertise. Yet Heflin, former Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that generally, ""when you look at cities and states, the cities within a state tend to have a higher debt load than the state does."" Heflin echoed the infrastructure Craymer pointed to, that he said cities tend to use bonds to fund. 
Robert Kline, executive director of the Texas Bond Review Board, said he's never heard of comparing city debt to state debt. In the end, none of the experts we spoke with had either. They included Steve Murray, regional director of Austin-based Fitch Ratings, one of three major national credit rating agencies. 
""Typically we do not compare city debt and state debt levels primarily because (city and state governments) issue (debt) for very different purposes,"" Murray said. ""The repayment streams can vary greatly, so really, a more appropriate comparison, and what we do, is city to city and state to state."" 
We took his suggestion and compared Texas' debt to California's debt and Houston's debt to that of other big cities. 
In fiscal 2009, Texas had $1,368 in debt per capita, according to the state's financial reports. That was less than half of California's per-capita debt that year, whose population of 36.9 million people (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) is about 1.5 times the population of Texas. 
According to Los Angeles' financial reports, the city (the nation's second largest, with 3.8 million residents in 2008, the Census Bureau's most recent data) in 2009 had $3,995 in per-capita debt, or about two-thirds of the per-capita debt of Houston, which with 2.2 million residents in 2008 ranked as the nation's fourth-largest city. 
Other cities' debt per capita in 2009: the nation's largest city New York ($7,760), third-largest Chicago ($5,274), fifth-largest Phoenix ($3,757), sixth-largest Philadelphia ($4,684) and seventh-largest San Antonio ($1,808). Punch line: Houston's per-capita debt of $5,720 doesn't stand out in this sampling, except that only New York among the three bigger cities had more debt per resident. 
Meanwhile, Craymer cautioned against comparing per-capita debt loads of cities without taking into account what those debts are paying for. In Texas, for instance, Austin operates its electric utility, while the electric utilities in Houston are privately held. ""So you couldn't reasonably compare Houston debt to Austin because they include different things,"" Craymer said. 
More on point to how Murray compares cities, we looked at Fitch's most recent credit ratings, which are often used to assess the economic health of everything from corporations to governments. 
AAA is Fitch's best rating, while D, the worst, means the entity has defaulted. Of late, Houston, New York and San Francisco have received AA ratings from Fitch. Los Angeles was most recently rated AA-. 
How have state governments fared by the Fitch ratings? Texas most recently got the AAA rating, California landed with an A-. 
And where does all this debt noodling leave us? 
Perry accurately says Houston's debt per capita is more than California's debt per capita, a charge that seemingly packs a punch. 
However, Perry's claim leaves a misleading impression because Houston's and California's budgets are different beasts. Experts concur, moreover, that it's unheard of to compare a city's debts to the debts of a state. 
We rate Perry's statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54EC7A880>],/factchecks/2010/may/14/rick-perry/perry-says-houston-has-more-debt-capita-california/

Michael Savage says Kagan is a Marxist
","You write your senior thesis on socialism, it's bound to come up if you want to become a Supreme Court Justice.

Elena Kagan did. And it has.

""Now the empty skirts in the media are saying that she doesn't have much of a 'paper trail' that would reveal her views on issues,"" said conservative radio commentator Michael Savage, ""but her senior thesis at Princeton was entitled, 'To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900-1933.' She's a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through.""

The question is not whether Kagan wrote the paper. It's available to anyone who's willing to pay the Princeton University Library $54.60 to read it.

The question is whether the thesis reveals Kagan to be ""a New York City radical, Marxist lawyer through and through.""

We paid our $54.60, and read the 153-page senior thesis submitted by Kagan in April 1981. And we can say for sure that nowhere in the paper did Kagan say that she is a socialist. In fact, while Kagan offers strong opinions about various theories of the decline of the socialist party, she does not give her opinions about the party's political ideas.

The closest we get to an insight into why Kagan selected that topic is in the acknowledgements at the start of the paper, where she wrote, ""Finally, I would like to thank my brother Marc, whose involvement in radical causes led me to explore the history of American radicalism in the hope of clarifying my own political ideas.""

The rest of the paper is an examination of why the socialist party never took off. Kagan focused on the socialist party in New York City as a microcosm of the national movement, and sought to answer the central question, ""What caused the strange death of socialism in New York City?""

And, she concludes, ""The socialists' failure to maintain their momentum grew from their failure ever to achieve internal harmony.""

We put a call in to Savage's people at World Net Daily to see if there was some other evidence to support the ""Marxist"" claim other than Kagan's college thesis, and we got no reply.

So we're left with the thesis. Here are the parts of it that have given some people pause (they're from the paper's conclusion):

""In our times, a coherent socialist movement is nowhere to be found in the United States. Americans are more likely to speak of a golden past than of a golden future, of capitalism's glories than of socialism's greatness. Conformity overrides dissent; the desire to conserve has overwhelmed the urge to alter. Such a state of affairs cries out for explanation. Why, in a society by no means perfect, has a radical party never attained the status of a major political force? Why, in particular, did the socialist movement never become an alternative to the nation's established parties?""

And this is the final paragraph:

""Through its own internal feuding, then, the (Socialist Party) exhausted itself forever and further reduced labor radicalism in New York to the position of marginality and insignificance from which it has never recovered. The story is a sad but also chastening one for those who, more than a half century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America. Radicals have often succumbed to the devastating bane of sectarianism; it is easier, after all, to fight one's fellows than it is to battle an entrenched and powerful foe. Yet if the history of Local New York shows anything, it is that American radicals cannot afford to become their own worst enemies. In unity lies their only hope.""

Does this amount to Kagan showing political leanings toward socialism? Not according to Sean Wilentz, the Princeton history professor who advised Kagan on her senior thesis.

""She was interested in it,"" Wilentz told the New York Times. ""To study something is not to endorse it.""

According to a May 1, 2010, story on Kagan in the Daily Princetonian, ""Wilentz defended Kagan against her critics, noting that she was adept at removing her personal beliefs from her academic research on labor and radical history.

""Sympathy for the movement of people who were trying to better their lives isn't something to look down on,"" Wilentz told the Princetonian. ""Studying something doesn't necessarily mean that you endorse it. It means you're into it. That's what historians do.""

And just to be even more clear, Wilentz said, ""Elena Kagan is about the furthest thing from a socialist. Period. And always had been. Period.""

Indeed, in an interview with the student paper, Steven Bernstein, a classmate who appointed Kagan to the school paper, described her politics as ""progressive and thoughtful but well within the mainstream of the ... sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case.""

In her later, professional career, Kagan aligned herself with the Democratic Party. In 1988, she was a staff member on Gov. Mike Dukakis' presidential campaign. She later served as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton, and went on to act as Clinton's deputy assistant for domestic policy. And, of course, she was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as solicitor general last year.

Yet there's nothing in her record that suggests she's a Marxist, as Savage claimed. Yes, she wrote a paper about socialism in college. But she never said in the thesis that she subscribed to the political ideas of socialism. In fact, she mostly adopts the dispassionate tone of a historian. And there's certainly nothing in the public record to suggest she has since become one. Writing a history thesis about socialism doesn't amount to endorsing it.

So once again, we have a political commentator attacking someone as a ""Marxist"" with absolutely no evidence to back it up. That's not just false, it's irresponsibly so. Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DF23980>],/factchecks/2010/may/14/michael-savage/michael-savage-says-kagan-marxist/

Michael Savage says Kagan took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama
","Never once to mince words, radio talk show host Michael Savage offered a blistering assessment of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on the conservative World Net Daily website.

Savage said one of the knocks on Kagan is that she was paid by Goldman Sachs, the investment bank under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud related to its dealings in the subprime mortgage market.

""She took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama,"" Savage wrote.

According to a Judiciary Committee questionnaire Kagan filled out when she was tapped by President Barack Obama to be solicitor general in 2009, Kagan was a member of the advisory council for the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She served on the panel from 2005 to 2008 while she was dean at Harvard Law School. And in 2008, according to financial disclosure forms filed with the Senate committee, she was paid a stipend of $10,000 for her services.

According to its website, the Global Markets Institute at Goldman Sachs ""provides research and high-level advisory services to policymakers, regulators and investors around the world."" Kagan participated for several years in an annual, daylong conference for the company.

""This advisory group was comprised of leaders from various sectors including academia, the media, business, and other industry,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler told media outlets that inquired about Kagan's role with the board. ""They met once a year for a daylong conference organized around public policy matters. The group was not involved in making any investment decisions for the company.""

Asked about Kagan's involvement with Goldman Sachs on the day before her nomination, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the panel ""had absolutely nothing to do with decisions Goldman is being investigated for.""

The Huffington Post posted two reports the advisory council completed in 2005 and 2008. Among other things, they assess various risks faced by the world economy (and as the HuffPo article notes, they weren't exactly prescient).

While it certainly doesn't do any political good to be associated in any way with Goldman Sachs right now, we could find no evidence that Kagan's role is tied to any alleged wrongdoing at Goldman Sachs. We also think it's a stretch for some critics to embellish her limited one-day-a-year position into a broad characterization that she ""worked for"" Goldman Sachs.

But that's not what Savage said. He said Kagan took money from Goldman Sachs, and she did -- at least $10,000 in 2008.

The second part of Savage's claim -- the ""just like her boss, Obama"" part -- is a bit of a stretch, though.

Obama has never drawn a paycheck from Goldman Sachs and federal law prohibits corporations from making direct campaign contributions. So neither Obama nor his campaign got any money from Goldman Sachs, the corporate entity. And during the presidential election, his campaign didn't accept money from federal political action committees.

But he did accept considerable campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data, Goldman Sachs employees gave the Obama campaign $994,795. That put Goldman Sachs employees No. 2 on Obama's top donors list.

But again, getting a check from Goldman Sachs for services rendered (as Kagan did, albeit a small one) is far different than accepting campaign contributions from the company's employees. By that measure, Obama's Republican opponent Sen. John McCain took money from Goldman Sachs too -- $230,000 in campaign contributions from its employees. So we find Savage's claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54ECA3E00>],/factchecks/2010/may/14/michael-savage/michael-savage-says-kagan-took-money-goldman-sachs/

Schultz claims that Landrieu got $1.8 million in BP PAC and employee contributions
","Newsflash: The oil and gas industry gives a lot of money to politicians.

Among them is Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat whose state stands to be hardest hit by the thousands of barrels of oil gushing from BP's Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico.

Here's what Ed Schultz, the liberal host of MSNBC's Ed Show, had to say about her share of the dough:

""Americans are getting a real education on what the color of oil is,"" Schultz said on the May 5, 2010, episode of his show. ""It's green. It's real green. It's big money and influence. Just so you know what's coming down, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu received almost $1.8 million from BP over the last decade.""

That's quite a bit of cash, so we decided to look into the claim.

It turns out that the $1.8 million figure has been one of Schultz's regular talking points.

On May 6, Schultz criticized Landrieu for defending the oil industry while small businesses in the region could be wiped out by the disaster.

""We have interviewed people on this program in recent days that are on the verge of not only losing their family business of 80 years, their clientele right now, and wiping out the whole industry, yet you are concerned about the liability limits on big insurance and oil?"" he said. ""Sen. Landrieu, you‘re really looking out for people, aren't you? Or is it just that $1.8 million worth of money to your campaign speaking right now from BP?""

And on May 11, 2010, Schultz said, ""We should point out that Senator Landrieu has taken $1.8 million from BP over the last 10 years,"" shortly after an interview with Landrieu ended.

We checked that figure against data from OpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks campaign contributions. Between 2000 and 2009, BP employees and the company's political action committee contributed $25,200 to Landrieu. And since Landrieu was elected to Congress in 1996, BP employees and the company's political action committee have given her a total of $28,200. (So far, Landrieu hasn't received any money from the company's workers or PAC in 2010, so we excluded that year from our analysis.)

To put those campaign contributions to Landrieu in perspective, the company's employees and action committee have donated a total of $4,734,181 to all federal candidates since 1996, when Landrieu's congressional career began. That means that during her entire time in the Senate, Landrieu's only gotten about 0.6 percent of BP's action committee and employees' total contributions.

Both figures are a far cry from the $1.8 million Schultz claimed on his show.

Alana Russo, Schultz's spokeswoman, said that the original figure came from a May 4 CNN story; the news organization has since corrected the error. She also pointed out that Schultz issued his own correction on May 12.

""In recent days we have been reporting on this program on two different occasions that Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana had taken $1.8 million from BP,"" he said. ""I want to come off the top tonight and correct that number. It is $752,000... I want all of you to know our apologies from me, Ed Schultz, on this. I don‘t like getting my numbers wrong.""

But Schultz did get the numbers wrong - again.

Indeed, Landrieu has received $752,744 from all the oil and gas industry's political action committees and employees -- not just BP -- during her entire career. Schultz initially said that Landrieu had received $1.8 million from BP in the last decade, so his ""correction"" is an apples-to-oranges comparison. (We should also note that OpenSecrets is in the middle of updating some of its information; according to the organization, the most up-to-date figure is actually $758,744. But that number is available only on some parts of the OpenSecrets site.)

Furthermore, he said that he'd reported the $1.8 million figure twice on his show. But we found that he mentioned the statistic three times.

Russo told us Schultz is planning to issue an additional correction on his May 14 show.

So how to rate it on the Truth-O-Meter? Given Schultz's incorrect correction, we won't wait for a new one. He repeatedly claimed that Landrieu had made $1.8 million from BP employees and PAC in campaign contributions over the last decade. We found that she's only made $25,200 from them in that period of time. That's a huge difference. Schultz eventually issued a correction, saying that Landrieu's only gotten $752,000. But Landrieu has received about that much during her entire career from the entire oil and gas industry, not just BP's political action committee and employees.

"['Elections', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Florida', 'Allen Boyd']","
U.S. Rep Allen Boyd says he helped bring dial tone access to North Florida district
","In his re-election campaign for Florida's 2nd Congressional District, Rep. Allen Boyd, a Democrat from the North Florida town of Monticello, is quick to remind voters about his accomplishments that have helped their everyday lives. Like, say, when they pick up their phone and hear a dial tone.

""I remember when I first ran for office, there were still folks who didn't have phone service. Soon I'd helped ensure that everyone in North Florida could access a dial tone,"" Boyd states in a commercial titled ""Broadband,"" released by his campaign on April 23, 2010.

Really?

We wondered if it was possible that more than a century after the telephone was invented there were still that many people without access to a phone line. If so, was Boyd a key player in helping ensure that those phone-less folks got connected?

Aaron Blye, Boyd's campaign communications director, referred us to the incumbent's campaign website, which offers this explanation of the claim: ""In 1995, Allen voted for SB 1554, which brought competition to the telecommunications marketplace by ending a long-standing monopoly over local telephone exchanges, ensuring that telephone service was available to everyone in North Florida at a reasonable and affordable rate.""

Boyd started in the Legislature in 1989, a time when about 5.3 percent of Florida households did not have a telephone, according to 1990 Census Bureau numbers. By the 2000 census, the percentage had dropped to 2.2 percent. (It's difficult to calculate comparable coverage rates now because many people rely on cell phones.)

We also dug up census figures on each of the 15 counties that make up Boyd's congressional district. In 1990, there were 16,362 households without phone service in those counties, but that number dropped to 8,871 by 2000.

So the percentage of people without phones has definitely dropped. But how much credit should Boyd -- or at least the bill he supported -- get for that?

His website attributes the growth in phone service to SB 1554, a 1995 bill that passed the Florida Legislature. He says the bill ""brought competition to the telecommunications marketplace by ending a long-standing monopoly over local telephone exchanges...""

It's indeed true that Boyd was one of 118 state representatives who voted for the House version of SB 1554. And yes, the measure helped to deregulate an industry that was dominated by 13 local phone providers in Florida, eventually opening the doors for long distance carriers and cable companies to sell local phone service.

Boyd actively pushed for the bill's passage, said former State Rep. Scott Clemons, D-Panama City, who was chairman of the House Utilities and Telecommunications Committee, and the bill's main sponsor in the House. Clemons now serves as mayor of Panama City, which is part of Boyd's congressional district, and it's worth noting he has contributed to Boyd's campaigns.

""Allen was sort of the go-to person on rural issues,"" said Clemons, in a phone interview with PolitiFact Florida. ""He was pushing to make sure there was complete coverage in those areas. It was a component of the larger bill at hand.""

Still, we wondered whether it was Florida's law that brought more local phone providers to rural parts of Florida, or whether the increase was a result of sweeping federal reforms enacted by Congress a year later with the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

The 1996 law deregulated the phone industry in order to create a more competitive market place. It was the first time since 1934 that the rules regulating the telephone industry had changed nationally.

""The '96 Act did the same thing [as Florida's law] essentially, but on a grander national scale,"" said Kirsten Olsen, spokesperson for the Florida Public Service Commission, a state agency charged with regulating utilities like phone, gas and electricity.

So which law played a larger role in upping the ante for phone companies to invest in Florida, especially North Florida? The answer isn't so clear-cut, Olsen said.

""It's very difficult to pinpoint which is most significant,"" she said.

Her assessment was also shared by Tom Wacker, vice president of government relations for the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association, a nonprofit group representing more than 580 small and rural telephone cooperatives and companies.

Wacker said the law made it possible for larger companies to sell off their lines in rural areas to interested smaller companies and start-ups.

""You could argue that by selling off their territory, rural carriers took up the mantel and provided much superior service than those areas had experienced in the past,"" Wacker said.

While it may be difficult to pinpoint which law was most significant to rural Floridians, annual reports from the Florida Public Service Commission indicate an increase in local phone providers from 13 to 52 by October 1996, more than a year after the state measure was passed. Today that number has increased to 327 local providers certified through the state as of December 2008, according to the most recent figures available.

Still, the PSC report notes that initially new local service providers were more prone to set up shop in larger urban markets than rural areas.

""Understand that in an open market, players come out of the woodwork,"" Olsen said. ""But they're going after the low hanging fruit. They're trying to get the biggest bang for their buck, which is typically in a larger market.""

While local providers may have entered rural markets at a slower pace, Olsen said within 10 years of SB 1554 passing ""those areas which may not have had access before were now primarily covered."" There aren't statistics on whether the service is truly universally available because there are some very rural areas that remain without coverage, but by and large she said that anyone who wants phone access should be able to get it.

So back to Boyd's claim. He said he ""helped ensure that everyone in North Florida could access a dial tone."" Yes, the percentage of households without phone service went down during the 1990s, from 5.3 percent in 1990 to 2.2 percent in 2000.

And yes, Boyd voted for the state bill, which supports his cautious claim of ""helped."" (The campaign has not portrayed him as a leader on the effort, although one of his supporters has.)

But the state bill was just part of the reason for the big increase in telephone coverage. The federal law also played a role in deregulating the market. So we find his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54ECDDF00>],/factchecks/2010/may/14/allen-boyd/boyd-says-he-helped-bring-dial-tone-north-florida/

Landrieu says the Deepwater Horizon well is leaking 7,000 barrels of oil each day and a half
","In the wake of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, critics of offshore drilling are calling on lawmakers to rethink domestic energy policy.But Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana, says the industry has a good record. Oil production -- a major industry in her home state -- should not be shut down because of one accident, she argued in a May 4, 2010, interview on CNN.""In the last 10 years we've only had 7,000 barrels of oil spilled in the Gulf... not counting hurricanes,"" she told host John King. ""This well is spewing that amount every day and a half. So relatively speaking to the other wells that have been drilled, this is spilling a huge amount of oil.""We're not going to rule on Landrieu's underlying point, that oil drilling is safe, which is a matter of opinion. But we can explore whether she is correct about the magnitude of the Deepwater Horizon accident compared with others in the past decade. Landrieu's office pointed us to a document prepared for them by Minerals Management Service, the arm of the Department of Interior that oversees oil production. According to the report, a total of 31,122 barrels of crude oil, diesel, lube oil and gasoline were spilled in the Gulf between 2000 and 2009. That includes 24,069 barrels spilled during Hurricanes Lili, Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike. The difference between those two numbers is 7,053 -- roughly the amount cited by Landrieu. So, Landrieu is correct that except for the hurricane numbers, about 7,000 barrels of oil were spilled in the Gulf in the past decade. Federal authorities have said it's difficult to estimate the amount of oil flowing into the Gulf. Initially, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that about 1,000 barrels of oil were leaking each day into the Gulf as a result of the accident. But NOAA then increased that estimate to about 5,000 barrels a day (which is about 210,000 gallons). But scientists say it could be far more than 5,000. So Landrieu is close with the 7,000 figure, but there's considerable uncertainty about the actual amount spewing from the leak. We find her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54ECB3140>],/factchecks/2010/may/13/mary-landrieu/landrieu-deepwater-horizon-well-leaking-7000-barre/

Landrieu says Louisiana doesn't get ""one single penny"" from offshore drilling
","In the wake of the BP oil leak disaster, offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has come under intense scrutiny. On May 11, 2010, as Congress held hearings on the incident, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. -- whose state has so far been most directly threatened by the slick -- discussed the issue with MSNBC's Ed Schultz. Landrieu, who has often been an advocate for the energy industry in the Senate, told the liberal talk show host, ""I can promise you, no one's going to let the industry skid. We're going to make BP pay. And, I might say, and you know because you've heard me say this before, when will America realize that the Gulf Coast states need revenue-sharing? Do you know how much money the federal treasury gets from this industry every year? An average of $5 billion. Do you know how much money Louisiana gets? Not one single penny."" Landrieu's statement was so forceful -- that Louisiana gets ""not one single penny"" -- that we thought it deserved a fact-check. Before we get to that question, let's first look to see if she was correct about the federal treasury's take. It turns out that Landrieu is basically right. For 2009, the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department that collects revenues from energy production -- sent $5.7 billion directly to the federal treasury. But is the Louisiana share of offshore oil royalties really zero, as Landrieu suggested? It's a bit complicated, but the truth is the state makes millions. Here's the breakdown: • For the first 3 miles out from the shoreline, Louisiana -- like other states -- gets to keep 100 percent of any royalties produced by oil and gas drilling. In the most recent year available, 2008, this amounted to $275 million. • Between 3 and 6 miles from the shoreline -- a federally owned band formally known as the 8(g) area -- the federal government sends 27 percent of the royalties to Louisiana. The reasoning is that federal drilling in this area sucks out some of the oil from deposits that span the 3-mile dividing line between state and federal ownership, so these payments are meant to compensate for the lost revenue to states. In 2009, they totaled $22 million and they're estimated to be $32 million this year. • Beyond 6 miles from the shoreline is considered federal territory. For new drilling projects, states get a 37.5 percent share directly to their treasuries and an additional 12.5 percent for state land and water conservation fund projects. The 37.5 percent figure alone amounted to $6.3 million for Louisiana's treasury in 2009, with additional estimated amounts of $558,000 in 2010 and $476,000 in 2011. Existing drilling projects do not currently provide royalties to the states -- a sore point for Louisianans. (More on that later.) And some bonus money that's an indirect result of oil and gas operations off its shores: Louisiana gets a share of the Coastal Impact Assistance Program, a federal program funded by a one-time appropriation of $1 billion distributed between from 2007 to 2010. This money is dispersed to Gulf Coast states, except for Florida, in an amount roughly proportional to the amount of offshore production in federal waters off their shores. Through this program, Louisiana has taken in a share of the $1 billion appropriation. The grand total that Louisiana receives in a typical year is difficult to compute because of big variations in oil prices and other factors, but we feel safe in saying it's in the tens of millions of dollars every year, and depending on how you slice the numbers, possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. Either way, it's not accurate to say that Louisiana received ""not one single penny,"" as Landrieu did. (We ran our findings by both Landrieu's office and by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and they agreed that our reporting was accurate.) So what's behind Landrieu's claim? She has long argued that the state gets far less than it deserves from the proceeds of offshore drilling. Before passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 -- a bill that Landrieu championed -- Louisiana indeed got no financial benefit from federal wells further than 6 miles from its shores. And even that bill didn't go nearly as far as Landrieu wanted. Because only revenues from new projects are included initially, the payments to Louisiana will be relatively modest through 2017 -- a year outside the ""budget window,"" which is a common trick for lawmakers to make bills seem less expensive than they actually are. After that, the payments get quite large, as royalties from existing projects kick in. Louisiana could reap some of an estimated $385 million in 2017 and a share of up to $630 million in later years. Not seeing those big amounts materialize sooner has been a continued source of irritation for many Louisianans, including Landrieu. Reasonable people can disagree over how much Louisiana deserves to receive from drilling off its shores, but even if Landrieu has a point that her state is getting a raw deal over royalties, it is clearly incorrect for her to say that the state gets ""not one single penny"" from offshore drilling. We rate her statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5508BB5C0>],/factchecks/2010/may/13/mary-landrieu/landrieu-says-louisiana-doesnt-get-one-single-penn/

Bill McCollum on curbing mortgage fraud: ""You can't do everything.""
","Florida Democrats last week attacked Attorney General Bill McCollum in a press release, saying he didn't do enough to curb mortgage fraud. His ""flippant response to homeowners in trouble,"" according to the Democrats, was, ""You can’t do everything."" We wondered if the Republican gubernatorial candidate was indeed so ""flip,"" especially at a time when mortgage flipping fraud was so pervasive in Florida. The state has ranked first nationwide in mortgage fraud every year since 2006. Indeed, we found the Democrats quoted him correctly. On July 25, 2009, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune ran a front-page article in which reporter Jeremy Wallace noted that McCollum had acknowledged that his agency hadn’t done enough to stop more than 10,000 cases of potentially illegal real estate deals uncovered by the West Florida newspaper (the Democrats' campaign literature cites the Herald-Tribune article but gives an incorrect date of July 25, 2007). In the story, McCollum cited a lack of resources and his agency’s limited jurisdiction over criminal mortgage fraud for his inability to do more. The newspaper noted that McCollum had formed a task force in 2007 to investigate mortgage fraud cases, but that other consumer issues took priority. And so when a Sarasota reporter asked McCollum in an interview in Venice why he hadn’t done more on mortgage fraud prior, McCollum replied: ""It’s not the only thing we do. You can’t do everything."" It's worth noting that McCollum gave his response to the Herald-Tribune – and, not as the Democrats say, to ""homeowners in trouble."" Still, the Democrats were right about his words and quoted him accurately. We find their statement True.

Texas has the highest proportion of workers earning minimum wage or less
","
Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, running for re-election, touts the jobs he's helped create in Texas during his eight-year tenure. His Democratic opponent, Linda Chavez-Thompson, is skeptical. 
""Perry and Dewhurst like to brag that while other states are hurting, Texas is creating jobs,"" Chavez-Thompson said May 4 to the Central Texas Democratic Forum. ""But a recent report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has brought... some clarity to that, stating that Texas, now, has the highest share of minimum-wage workers in the nation."" 
We wondered. 
James Aldrete, a spokesman for Chavez-Thompson, shared a March 11 news release from the bureau, which states that last year, Texas had the nation's ""highest share"" of workers earning at or less than the federal minimum wage. The research was limited to workers paid by the hour, not counting salaried employees or people who are self employed. 
Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas, confirmed that Texas ranked No. 1. 
Abbot, who crunched the numbers cited in the release, told us that among the states and the District of Columbia, Texas had the highest proportion of workers — 8.5 percent — earning at or below the federal hourly minimum wage. West Virgina had the second-most residents earning the minimum wage or less, at 7.8 percent, and Alabama followed at 7.5 percent. Oregon, Washington and California had the lowest percentages: less than 2 percent. (Some state laws exempt certain occupations from the minimum wage standard. In Georgia, for example, tipped employees, such as waiters, are exempt.) 
The federal minimum wage last increased from $6.55 to $7.25 in July 2009. Before then, in 2008, Texas ranked 7th nationally with 4.7 percent of workers earning minimum wage or less, Abbot said. That year, Mississippi had the highest share of minimum-wage hourly workers, 6 percent, followed by South Carolina (5.9) and Tennessee (5.8). Oregon had the lowest share, 0.8 percent. 
Across the United States in 2009, nearly 60 percent of workers — 72.6 million — were paid by the hour, according to the release, including 3.6 million earning minimum wage or less, or 5 percent of the hourly workers. 
In Texas, the 5.6 million employees who earned an hourly wage in 2009 represented 54.3 percent of the state's workers, including salaried employees who earn a fixed annual sum, according to the news release. Nearly 475,000 Texans earned at or less than the federal minimum wage — more than double the 212,000 who were at a 60 cents lower federal minimum wage in effect in 2008. 
Why did the Texas number surge? In part, because the federal minimum wage set by Congress has, too. From 1998 to 2006, as the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 an hour, the number of workers making at or below that amount declined slightly in Texas, except for a small uptick in 2003. 
After Congress provided for increases in the federal minimum wage in 2007, 2008 and 2009, more Texans started falling below the wage floor. Workers in 14 other states and the District of Columbia didn't fall to the minimum-wage level or below because their mandatory minimum wage exceeds the federal level. 
Per the bureau's latest data, Chavez-Thompson gets it right: Texas has the highest share of minimum-wage workers in the nation. Her statement is True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DF38AC0>],/factchecks/2010/may/13/linda-chavez-thompson/texas-has-highest-proportion-workers-earning-minim/

George Will pegs Sen. Bennett's loss to votes on TARP, stimulus, health care
","The Tea Party movement shook the political world last weekend when two Utah Republicans knocked U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett out of contention for renomination during a state Republican convention. Commentators immediately hung Bennett's defeat on two of his past decisions -- to vote in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which helped bail out key financial institutions in 2008, and his efforts to co-sponsor a health care bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Both actions have been unpopular with Republicans, especially conservatives in the GOP's base.
 
During a roundtable on ABC's This Week, syndicated columnist George Will took a crack at analyzing Bennett's defeat.
 
""This is an anti-Washington year,"" Will said. ""How do you get more Washington than a three-term senator who occupies the seat once held by his father, a four-term senator, who before that worked on the Senate staff and then as a lobbyist in Washington? He's a wonderful man and a terrific senator, but the fact is, he's going against terrific headwinds this year, and he cast three votes, TARP, stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care. Now, you might like one, two or all three of those, but being opposed to them is not outside the mainstream of American political argument.""
 
We checked to see whether Bennett did indeed vote for TARP, the stimulus and a requirement that individuals purchase health coverage. Here's what we found:
 
• Bennett did vote for the TARP legislation (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008, along with 33 other Republican senators.
 
• Bennett voted against President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1), on Feb. 13, 2009. Only three Republican senators voted for the bill--Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. (Specter is now a Democrat.)
 
• The only time that Bennett made a floor vote on a bill containing an individual health care mandate came with the Democratic health care bill. During the vote on final passage on Dec. 24, 2009, Bennett joined every other Republican in voting against the bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590).
 
It's true that Bennett did co-sponsor the Healthy Americans Act with Wyden, and that measure did include a requirement that most Americans purchase health coverage. But it was significantly different from the main Democratic bill because it relied more heavily on health insurance exchanges. It never reached the floor for a vote, and because Will said that Bennett had ""cast three votes,"" including one for an individual mandate, he was at best only partly accurate in characterizing Bennett's record on that issue.
 
All told, Will was correct that Bennett voted for the TARP bill. But he was incorrect that Bennett voted for Obama's stimulus bill, and it was inaccurate for him to suggest that Bennett cast a vote for an individual mandate. He actually voted against a bill with an individual mandate, even though he also co-sponsored a bill that included an individual mandate that didn't advance out of committee. We rate Will's characterization of Bennett's votes Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E0336C0>],/factchecks/2010/may/12/george-will/george-will-pegs-sen-bennetts-loss-votes-tarp-stim/

Marco Rubio's position on the Arizona immigration law
","With controversy swirling around Arizona's new hard-line immigration law, U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio if often asked about the bill. But his answers have seemed inconsistent. We decided to put his comments to our Flip-O-Meter. The law, generally speaking, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. On April 27, 2010 in front of a largely Cuban-American crowd in West Miami, Rubio likened Arizona's bill to the creation of a ""police state,"" saying the American people wouldn't be comfortable with people being required to have documents on them at all times proving their citizenship status. Then on April 30, he told Fox News' Neil Cavuto that didn't believe the Arizona law was ""the best answer to that problem."" But in an interview with a conservative blogger nine days later, Rubio said he would've voted for the measure. The seeming flip, the Rubio campaign contends, is because of late changes inserted into the immigration bill. ""Marco's position has been consistent,"" campaign spokesman Alex Burgos said. ""It's the law that has changed since his first comments on it.'' Let's check it out. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What Rubio said on April 27 in West Miami ""I think the law has potential unintended consequences and it's one of the reasons why I think immigration needs to be a federal issue, not a state one.' ""Everyone is concerned with the prospect of the reasonable suspicious provisions where individuals could be pulled over because someone suspects they may not be legal in this country. I think over time people will grow uncomfortable with that ... I've always said I think the ultimate solution is to create a technologically based system where employers can verify the eligibility of the folks they are employing."" When Rubio was asked specifically about immigrants being required to produce documents at a moment's notice, the son of Cuban exiles said, according to the Miami Herald, ""That's not really something that Americans are comfortable with, the notion of a police state.'' What Rubio said on Fox News April 30 ""I don't believe that law is the best answer to that problem."" Later, Rubio said, ""There are portions of the law that over time may lead to unintended consequences."" What Rubio said to a Human Events reporter in a story published May 6 ""Understand that what Arizona is facing is different from anything Florida has ever faced,"" Rubio told Human Events' Jason Mattera. ""Arizona has a physical border with Mexico. And there (are) kidnappings, human trafficking, drug wars coming across that border into an American city. Frankly, very few states in the country can imagine what that’s like."" Human Events, a conservative publication, asked if Rubio were in the Arizona Legislature, would he have voted for the law? ""The second (version) that passed hit the right note. Yes,"" Rubio responded. The interviewer then asked about the first version. ""Well, I would have wanted to see changes like the ones that were made because I know that that’s not the intent of the bill."" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PolitiFact has thoroughly explored the Arizona immigration bill and the changes inserted in the final days of the regular session of the Arizona Legislature. We rated two claims after the first version of the bill passed and another two claims after the second version passed. The original version of the bill was signed into law by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23. One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by ""racial profiling"" -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning. Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges. The new version of the law says: ""A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution."" The prior version had said that an official ""may not solely consider race"" in such circumstances. Rubio, in his comments in West Miami, said he was particularly concerned about under what circumstances law enforcement officials in Arizona could stop people to inquire about their citizenship status. He said the changes in the bill had quelled those concerns. ""I mean no one is in favor of a bill that would force American citizens to have to interact with law enforcement in a way that wasn’t appropriate,"" Rubio said in the Human Events interview. ""And the first bill I thought held that door open. Since then, the changes that have been made to the bill I think greatly improve it."" But legal scholars say the door to some form of racial profiling remains open despite the changes in the law. Specifically, there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1975 ruled in United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce that U.S. Border Patrol could stop and question people in vehicles about their immigration status based solely on their appearance. In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that ""because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause."" The Supreme Court decision seems to conflict with the Arizona law, and a separate federal appeals court that covers Arizona, and is likely to set up a legal fight. There's also a provision of the law that requires legal immigrants to carry documents confirming their legal status. Rubio was concerned about that in his comments in West Miami April 27. When asked specifically about immigrants having to carry documents on them, Rubio said ""That's not really something that Americans are comfortable with, the notion of a police state."" That part of the law, however, was not stripped out in the amended version. The Mexican government already has issued a travel alert to their citizens, directing them to use extreme caution if visiting Arizona. And the cities of Flagstaff and Tucson have said they will sue to challenge the new law, which could go into effect in July or August. The bill has been criticized by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: ""I think it creates unintended consequences,” he told Politico. “It's difficult for me to imagine how you're going to enforce this law. It places a significant burden on local law enforcement and you have civil liberties issues that are significant as well.” We also should note that the changes, though made to sway critics of the original bill, did little to alter the vote totals in the Arizona Legislature. In fact, no one in the 60-member state House or the 30-member Senate voted against the first version of the immigration bill and in favor of the replacement bill. Rubio has suggested he would have voted against the first version of the bill, equating it to a ""police state,"" and said he would have voted for the second bill. That would have made him an anomaly in the Arizona Legislature. Rubio has outlined two basic concerns about the bill -- the possibility of racial profiling and the fact that people would be required to produce immigration documents at a moments notice. He has explained that his remarks changed because he was satisfied with the altered bill. That indeed is supported by the changes in the bill on the possibility of racial profiling, but it still does not explain his concerns on producing documents and the risk of a ""police state,"" because it is not addressed by the revised bill. So we rate his change a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E7D2C80>],/factchecks/2010/may/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-position-arizona-immigration-law/

Perry claims Texas accounted for 70 percent of the country's new jobs between November 2007 and November 2008.
","Gov. Rick Perry frequently celebrates the Texas economy for out-performing those of other states. His message that Texas could be a model for other states has been picked up in articles by Investors Business Daily, Trends Magazine and The Weekly Standard — all of which are touted on Perry's campaign Web site. The articles repeat the claim Perry made in a Jan. 15, 2009 press release stating: ""Approximately 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas.""We wondered if this eye-popping claim -- posted online by Perry's office and later echoed by State Comptroller Susan Combs, a fellow statewide officeholder -- was true.Perry's office pointed us to the Texas Workforce Commission, where number crunchers said they started their analysis by adding up the total jobs created in states, including Texas, that had job gains during the one-year period. There were 13 other job-gaining states, plus the District of Columbia. The other gaining states were Oklahoma, Maryland, Louisiana, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Hampshire, Iowa, Virginia, Alaska and Nebraska.Texas's 221,000 new jobs amounted to 71 percent of the 310,000 jobs gained among those states and D.C. The state's economy was ""really kicking,"" said Ann Hatchitt, the commission's director of communications.But the commission's conclusion comes with a big wrinkle. Hatchitt said the commission did not take into account the new jobs created in 36 other states where job losses overall outnumbered gains.Veronica Sanchez Downey, who analyzes data for the commission, said she'd feel comfortable summarizing the commission's conclusion about Texas job gains this way: ""Of all the states that gained jobs in the U.S. including the District of Columbia, Texas accounted for"" 67.2 percent of the added jobs from November 2007 to November 2008. The 67.2-percent figure reflects adjustments of the data since the initial research.Perry, of course, didn't say it that way.Two outside experts said the governor's 70-percent claim overstates the Texas share of jobs created nationally.Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, said the commission's method of calculating the percentage wasn't correct. By excluding all states with net job losses -- regardless of any job gains in those states  -- the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. was overblown, even ""laughable,"" he said.""To say it's misleading is to be kind,"" Brandi said. ""It's just not true.""Douglas Hall, director of the Economic Research and Analysis Network at Washington's non-partisan Economic Policy Institute, agreed that Perry's summary was inaccurate. The institute focuses on the economic needs of low- and middle-income Americans.Hall stressed that employment estimates, based on monthly surveys of employers, are frequently adjusted anyway: ""On an annual basis, the numbers are revised significantly and what can often happen is that six of the previous 18 months get changed not just in their magnitude but sometimes even in their direction, highlighting the fact that one must always take these numbers with somewhat of a grain of salt."" We find Perry's conclusion to be incorrect and highly misleading, especially because the agency that made the calculation quickly pointed out an accurate -- though less dramatic -- way of summarizing its finding. We rate Perry's statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DF7F8C0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/12/rick-perry/perry-claims-texas-accounted-70-percent-new-jobs-2/

Hank Gilbert says agency's inadequate oversight allowed salmonella-related deaths, illnesses
","
East Texas Democrat Hank Gilbert, running a second time for state agriculture commissioner, blasted out of the chute with a dramatic claim about the agency he wants to head.

Gilbert, hoping to deny Republican Commissioner Todd Staples a second term, said Dec. 14: ""A careless, lackadaisical attitude has already resulted in the deaths of eight and more than 600 cases of illness nationally thanks to poor TDA oversight at the former Peanut Corporation of America factory in Plainview."" 
He was referring to eight (the count actually reached nine) deaths due to salmonella poisonings traced to the corporation's since-shuttered Plainview peanut plant.

We wondered if Gilbert accurately characterized the department's role in ensuring safe food processing plants.

It turns out that a department inspector did visit the offending Peanut Corporation of America plant in 2005, 2006 and 2008 and also checked a box on a form filed after each visit stating that the plant had a license required by the state health department to operate.

But the Lubbock-based inspector, who was visiting the plant to certify it as organic, has admitted to making false assumptions about its health certification on each inspection. When his actions came to light in the wake of the salmonella crisis, he was fired.

The inspector, Gaylon Armonett, told the Associated Press the reason he checked ""yes"" the first time was that a plant manager told him an application for state health licensing had been completed and was in the hands of officials at the company's headquarters. Armonett said he checked ""yes"" in the succeeding years because he assumed the license was granted.

""It's an inadvertent mistake,"" Armonett said, ""and I'm sorry for it.""

Agriculture department spokesman Bryan Black suggested it wasn’t the department’s responsibility to police any plant’s cleanliness. ""Local and state health departments are responsible for protecting consumers from food-borne illnesses,"" Black said. ""TDA certifies products and processes to national organic standards and has strict protocols in place."" 
The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed that firms like the peanut plant that manufacture food for sale to the public must have a state-issued food manufacturer license. The agency has said it didn’t know of the Plainview plant until the salmonella outbreak. The plant closed in February. 
""We never received an application for a license,"" DSHS spokeswoman Allison Lowery said. ""As you can understand, it would be very difficult for us to know about a company when it fails to license with us.""
 
Lowery continued: ""As soon as we were aware of the problems... we immediately ordered the company to close this plant and recall all products made there. We also quickly took over the recall after we got no response from the company to our recall order. And we assessed $14.6 million in administrative penalties against the company."" 
In his statement about the peanut plant, Gilbert overstates the agriculture department's role; it's not the primary agency responsible for policing such facilities for health hazards. Still, its inspector admittedly slipped up in this case. If he'd flagged the Plainview plant for lacking the required food manufacturer license, it might have been shut down or its conditions improved. That could have prevented the 2009 illnesses and deaths.

We rate Gilbert’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E5FE640>],/factchecks/2010/jan/12/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-agencys-lax-attitude-allowed-sal/

Citing Bill White's 2005 vote on a constitutional amendment, GOP says Democrat supports gay marriage
","
The Republican Party of Texas debuted an online attack ad Dec. 2, 2009, casting Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White, the former Houston mayor, as too liberal for Texas tastes.

The GOP's spot muffles the audio from a White advertisement while blaring the Platters' oldie ""The Great Pretender"" and suggesting White isn't as moderate as he claims.

And the ad includes a stab that might wound White's appeal to many Texans: ""Favor gay marriage? Bill White's for it.""

We weren't aware of White's pro-gay-marriage stance.

As evidence, the Republican Party pointed to White's vote against a ban on gay marriage that was proposed as a constitutional amendment in 2005. The ban passed statewide with 76 percent of the vote, two years after Lawrence v. Texas, a landmark case that decriminalized sodomy in Texas.

White's campaign countered that White has since said that his 2005 vote wasn't a vote for gay marriage. His campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon said White wasn't available for comment and pointed us to the only public statement White has made about the Republicans' ad, reported in a Dec. 12 article in the Dallas Voice. In an e-mail to the publication, which touts itself as a media source for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community, White said his position is the same as that of Barack Obama, who endorses civil unions but does not support same-sex marriage.

Obama supports unions that would give same-sex partners legal rights and privileges equal to those of married couples on a state-by-state basis, including the right to assist a partner during an emergency, equal health insurance, employment benefits and property rights.

Unlike marriage, civil unions aren't recognized in all states. For instance, even if you had joined in a civil union with your partner in Vermont, you wouldn't be able to visit that person in the ICU after a head-on collision in Texas — a state that doesn't honor civil unions.

""Contrary to generally held assumptions, civil unions do not provide the same protections as does a marriage in terms of legal and financial rights, benefits and protections,"" said Yolanda Padilla, a professor of social work and women's studies at the University of Texas at Austin. ""These are not minor differences, but indisputably place gay couples in a very vulnerable position.""

White, who received the Political Equality Award in 2009 for his commitment to the Houston community from gay rights organization the Human Rights Campaign, said as mayor it was his job to work for everyone. For the same reason, he has said he refrained from taking sides in the gay marriage debate.

""As mayor, I avoid commenting on state and federal laws and policies I do not influence. I intend to vote 'no' on the proposed state constitutional amendment to protest its use as a wedge issue,"" White told Houston's GLBT Political Caucus Political Action Committee, according to a 2005 Houston Chronicle article that the Republican Party's video ad cited as evidence of his support for gay marriage.

Now that he's running for governor, White told the Dallas Voice that he intends ""to represent all Texans, and I expected to be attacked for this."" But that isn't the same as championing same-sex marriage.

We find the Republican Party's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E5FE980>],/factchecks/2010/jan/12/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-bill-white-supports-ga/

Rep. Lamar Smith says immigrants hold 8 million jobs
","In response to a new Democratic proposal to overhaul immigration laws, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith noted that a large number of illegal immigrants have jobs in the United States and suggested that one way to reduce the unemployment rate would be to free up those jobs for citizens and legal immigrants.  Smith, R-San Antonio, said the illegal immigrants hold 8 million jobs, according to a news release distributed Dec. 15.  Arguing against the Democrats’ proposal to provide millions of immigrants a path to citizenship, Smith says U.S. policies should “put American workers, American taxpayers, and American citizens first, not those who are in the country illegally. This is the kind of legislation that foreign governments would promote, not the U.S. Congress.”  He added that “allowing millions of illegal immigrants to stay and take jobs away from citizens and legal immigrants is like giving a burglar a key to the house. Illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs. Those stolen jobs rightfully belong to citizens and legal immigrants.” Leaving aside the question of whether any of those jobs were ""stolen"" from their rightful owners, we wondered whether Smith's 8 million figure — about the same as the population of Virginia — was correct. Do illegal immigrants hold that many jobs?  Smith’s source for the number is a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, Jeffrey Passel, who analyzed the relevant data for an April 2009 report, “A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States.” The Pew center is a research organization that seeks to “improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population.”  Using March 2008 data, primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau, Passel estimated that the number of undocumented workers in the United States was 7.8 million, so Smith is clearly in the ballpark.  But is it fair of the congressman to make his statement about jobs when the data refers to workers? Passel said yes.  We found a wrinkle, though.  Economic conditions have changed since March 2008. Smith’s statement suggests that the 8 million is a current figure, but the data used for that estimate are more than 20 months old. Since then, millions of people have lost their jobs, including many undocumented immigrants.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate for March 2008 was 5.1 percent; that figure has skyrocketed, to 10 percent, in December 2009. That month, more than 15 million people were without jobs.  Immigrants have been hit harder in the economic downturn. The unemployment rate for immigrants, without regard to their citizenship status, has gone up faster than that of natives, Passel said. With huge job losses across all demographic groups, Passel said the number of employed illegal immigrants has most likely dropped.  Passel suggested that today the number is closer to 7 million.  So Smith is right that millions of jobs are held by illegal immigrants. Yet by citing numbers that were 20 months old, he didn't account for conditions that have caused some of those jobs to disappear. We find his claim Mostly True.

Shami claims he's created 1,200 jobs in Texas by moving his factories to Houston from China
","
Hair-care mogul Farouk Shami of Houston thinks ""Made in the U.S.A. is the strongest brand in the world,"" and by promising to create new jobs, he's hoping to win the governorship. 
As a head-start, ""he just brought 1,200 jobs to Texas by moving his factories here from China,"" according to his Nov. 23 TV ad. 
We decided to follow-up on one of his biggest talking points. 
The Palestinian-born businessman, seeking the Democratic nomination in the March 2 primary, has created a $1 billion manufacturing company that makes CHI hair irons and BioSilk shampoo, among hair products. 
Shami cut the ribbon on his new Houston facility CHI USA in late July 2009. Earlier that month, he announced he was moving to Houston overseas production of his hand-held products, like hair irons, and in the process bringing more than 1,000 jobs to that city. 
But contrary to his ad, those jobs were created as a result of moving production from South Korea, not China, campaign director and senior strategist Vince Leibowitz said. 
""That was a miscommunication within our campaign over where those jobs were cut, and unfortunately we got the incorrect information to the talented people who put together our television ad,"" Leibowitz said. Democratic media firm Devine Mulvey produced the spot. 
As of Jan. 11, the campaign had changed its commercial to mention only the shift of jobs from Korea. The change happened after our inquiry. Still, on the same day we found the incorrect China reference in a video of the ad (shown to the right) on Shami's Web site, and on the site's homepage. 
Elizabeth Yong, public relations manager for Houston-based Farouk Systems Group, said CHI USA produces ""five to 10"" of a total 61 hair care tools, including the original flat iron.Yong said bringing all production stateside will take two years, though ""more than 1,000"" jobs have already been shifted. Last July, the company said it hopes to shift 4,000 jobs to Texas by 2012, starting with the move of 1,000 jobs from South Korea and China. 
Leibowitz said that some jobs have been created as a result of relocating production from China, but not the ones advertised as part of Shami's campaign. 
Perhaps Shami deserves a back slap for admitting his mistake and reworking his ad. Still, incorrect information was left online. We rule his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54DA86600>],/factchecks/2010/jan/12/farouk-shami/shami-claims-hes-created-1200-jobs-texas-moving-hi/

Marc Katz says Texas is last in spending for mental health care
","
Marc Katz, the Austin deli owner running for lieutenant governor, lists health care as his No. 1 campaign issue on his Web site. So it's no surprise that he took a shot at highlighting Texas' struggling mental health system on Twitter. 

""Texas is LAST (50th) in spending for mental health care,"" he said in a message on Twitter on Dec. 8.

We wanted to know the source for Katz's claim, but he didn't respond to our phone calls or email. We assume Katz was referring to data published by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation for fiscal 2006, which tallied mental health care spending for the District of Columbia and the 50 states. Texas was indeed ranked 50th for spending — per capita — though that was second to last.

Spending $34.57 per Texan, the state squeaked ahead of New Mexico, which spent $25.58 and ranked 51st. Florida came in third from last at $38.17, and the national average was $103.53.

When you look at total dollars spent, Texas ranked 10th in 2006, spending about $805 million.

Aware of the state's shortcomings in health care services, Texas legislators allocated $55 million in 2009 to be distributed during the next year (half of it has been already) to expand services at local mental health centers, and through August this year, community mental health centers will receive another $341.8 million in state money through the Department of State Health Services.

Twitter sometimes leads to clunky writing because items are limited to 140 characters per tweet. In this case, though, Katz sliced information to give it more impact. Sure, he was only off by one state, but that was the difference between Texas ranking last and not, an important detail when you're showing Texas' rank in ALL CAPS.

Fla. senator says Jan. 8, 1835, is the only day U.S. has been debt free
","U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla., has joined the ranks of politicians experimenting with Twitter. LeMieux, who was appointed last year to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Mel Martinez, has sent Twitter messages with his thoughts on health care reform (""neither 'comprehensive' nor 'reform'""), his whereabouts (""visiting our military installations tomorrow"") and now, U.S. trivia. ""Why is January 8th an important date in American History,"" LeMieux asked during the afternoon of Jan. 8, 2010. ""This day in 1835 is the only day in our history when we have not been in debt."" We've all seen pictures of the national debt clock, which is now spinning past $12.3 trillion. In fact, LeMieux has it running on a computer monitor posted outside his Washington office, and mentioned the debt on his first day as a senator. We wondered, was there actually a time, one time, when the clock struck zero? First, just so no one gets confused: Debt does not equal deficit. Deficit is the difference in the money the government takes in and what it spends each year. Debt is accumulated deficits, plus interest. You'd think the United States would have been founded with zero debt. But not so, says the Bureau of Public Debt. The government office, which is under the U.S. Department of the Treasury, says the United States had more than $75 million in outstanding American Revolutionary War debts when the nation was created. From there, the national debt grew some and shrunk some before ballooning to $127 million as a result of the War of 1812. The debt then started a steady 20-year decline, which you can see for yourself here. By Jan. 1, 1833, the national debt stood at $7 million. On Jan. 1, 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the debt was just $33,733. On Jan. 8 of that year, Jackson proclaimed that the last installment of the national debt had been paid. Jackson had called the debt a ""national curse"" when he ran for president in 1824. ""The Payment of the Public Debt,"" Jackson wrote in a toast at a party that also marked the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans (another good day for Jackson, who as general, led U.S. troops to victory). ""Let us commemorate it as an event that gives us increased power as a nation, and reflects luster on our federal Union, of whose justice, fidelity, and wisdom it is a glorious illustration."" According to the 1860 biography Life of Andrew Jackson written by James Parton, Jackson vetoed bills that appropriated money for infrastructure projects, thus quickening the pace that the country's debt was retired by up to five years. It was one of the cornerstones of his administration, said Parton, who added that Jackson thought it his most glorious achievement. But did it actually happen on Jan. 8? Jackson biographer Robert Vincent Remini said in his book The Life of Andrew Jackson that the extinguishing of the national debt ""nearly coincided"" with the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, which falls on Jan. 8. That would at least suggest the actual payment may have occurred a few days sooner. Remini doesn't get into more detail. Other accounts, like H.W. Brand's Andrew Jackson, His Life and Times, say the country was debt free closer to Jan. 1, 1835. For its part, the Bureau of Public Debt says that the national debt reached zero on Jan. 8, 1835, a Thursday. LeMieux's office provided PolitiFact with some additional examples (here and here) documenting the U.S. being debt free on Jan. 8, 1835. After Jan. 8, history writers fail to track the debt with precise detail. Jackson biographers Parton and Remini don't discuss how long the national debt remained zero. (In their defense, they use their ink discussing an assassination attempt on Jackson at the end of January 1835). The Bureau of Public Debt also appears fuzzy on how long America was debt free. All the government group notes is that it wasn't long. We talked to Robert E. Wright, a political economy professor and author of One Nation Under Debt: Hamilton, Jefferson, and the History of What We Owe. He offered a couple of caveats to this talk about the national debt. Even though the United States was considered debt free, the government still had outstanding loans, Wright said. No one asked for the loans to be paid off however, and the federal government had the money in the bank to pay them if they were. Wright said the country remained debt free for some time -- much longer than a day -- as politicians argued over what to do with government surpluses. ""There wasn't a desire to invest in corporations,"" Wright said. ""But there were schemes afloat to divide the money up and give it to the states."" Financial panics made those discussions irrelevant. By Jan. 1, 1836, the national debt had grown back to $37,000, according to the Bureau of Public Debt. A four-year depression starting in 1839 resulted in the debt growing to $20 million. Then, it was off to the races. The debt was more than $2.6 billion by the end of the Civil War; almost $27 billion by the end of World War I, and almost $260 billion by the end of World War II. The debt reached $1 trillion in Ronald Reagan's first term as president. It reached $5 trillion near the end of Bill Clinton's first term. LeMieux says that the United States was only debt free for one day in its history -- Jan. 8, 1835. He's right that the United States was indeed debt free on that day. And before and after that, we as a country really never got that close to being debt free. Did it last only one day, however, as LeMieux says? We found ""this day in history"" stories and blogs that tend to suggest so. But LeMieux's office didn't offer any definitive proof. Jackson biographers don't note it that way. Neither does the government office that tracks the debt. Scholars also say it lasted much more than a day. And since Jackson was bent on retiring the debt, we'd at least expect him to spend a day or two with an empty credit card account before racking up a bill again. We rate LeMieux's comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E618A80>],/factchecks/2010/jan/12/george-lemieux/fla-senator-says-jan-8-1835-only-day-us-has-been-d/

Giuliani says there were no domestic attacks during Bush presidency
","Republican Rudy Giuliani is painting President Barack Obama as weak on terrorism and is longing for the days of former President George W. Bush.Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and a candidate for president in 2008, appeared on Good Morning America on Jan. 8, 2010, to offer his assessment of the Obama administration's counterterrorist operations. He criticized plans to try suspected Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in a Michigan criminal court and questioned Obama's decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Giuliani said U.S. intelligence agencies stand to lose potentially critical information on other al-Qaida operatives and operations if the man at the center of the Northwest flight terror incident is tried in U.S. court. ""What he (Obama) should be doing is following the right things that Bush did -- one of the right things he did was treat this as a war on terror. We had no domestic attacks under Bush. We've had one under Obama,"" Giuliani said. ""Number two, he should correct the things that Bush didn't do right. Sending people to Yemen was wrong, not getting this whole intelligence thing corrected was both Bush's responsibility and Obama's.""Giuliani, the mayor of New York City during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, claims there were no domestic attacks under the Bush administration. That's obviously a preposterous statement that would warrant a Pants on Fire rating. We can't help but remember now-Vice President Joe Biden's line during his presidential campaign, ""Rudy Giuliani -- there's only three things he mentions in a sentence. A noun and a verb and 9/11.""Unfortunately, interviewer George Stephanopoulos never sought clarification on Giuliani's statement. After the interview, Stephanopoulos updated his blog to say Giuliani was wrong to say there were no domestic attacks under Bush, and then later apologized for not pressing him on the misstatement.But let's treat this as if Giuliani meant to say there were no domestic attacks under Bush post-Sept. 11, 2001, and run that past the Truth-O-Meter.The FBI offers a broad definition of terrorism, calling it ""the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.""Even stricter definitions would have to include:The anthrax scare. Shortly after 9/11, letters laced with anthrax began appearing in the U.S. mail. Letters went to U.S. senators and news organizations. Before it was over, five Americans were killed and another 17 were injured. ""The nation was terrorized in what became the worst biological attacks in U.S. history,"" according to the FBI.The shoe bomber. In December 2001, admitted al-Qaida member Richard Reid boarded a plane in Miami with plastic explosives packed in special hollowed-out shoes. The bomb failed to ignite properly and no passengers were hurt. The incident, however, led to Americans having to remove their shoes during airport security screening.The D.C. sniper case. John Allen Muhammad was convicted on capital terrorism charges for his part in the shooting of 16 people in and around the D.C. area in September and October 2002. Muhammad was executed last year. His 17-year-old accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, was sentenced to life in prison.All three events occurred after Sept. 11 and have been considered terror plots by the federal and state governments.Media Matters For America, a liberal group that analyzes the news media, documented other examples of U.S. terrorism:2002 attack against El Al ticket counter at LAX. Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at an El Al Airlines ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two people and wounding four others before being shot dead. Media Matters found a 2004 Justice Department report that Hadayet's case had been ""officially designated as an act of international terrorism.""Campus attack at UNC. In March 2006, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate drove an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians. Reza Taheri-azar reportedly stated in a letter: ""I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree."" A spokesman for Giuliani attempted to clarify the former mayor's remark several hours after the GMA interview, saying the statement ""didn't come across as it was intended"" and that Giuliani was ""clearly talking post-9/11 with regards to Islamic terrorist attacks on our soil,"" according to ABC News. It wasn't clear to us, or most of the world. But okay. Taking the literal definition of ""on our soil,"" that would exclude the failed December 2001 shoe bombing incident since it happened in the air. But not the others. If you add the second layer of ""Islamic terrorist attacks,"" the sniper and anthrax attacks could come off the list as well, because it is unclear if extremist Muslim ideology motivated either attack. Hadayet, the shooter in the Los Angeles ticket counter shooting, was killed during the attack by security personnel. So we don't know his motivation. Taheri-azar's own words make his motivation pretty clear. But now we're getting to a lot of ifs. And more importantly, that's not what Giuliani said on national television. Here's how Giuliani tried to clarify the issue during an interview later that day with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""This is so silly,"" Giuliani said. ""What I usually say when I say that, I usually say we had no major domestic attacks under President Bush since Sept. 11. I did omit the words 'since Sept. 11.' I apologize for that."" Giuliani went on to say it's not clear if the anthrax attacks were perpetuated by Islamic fundamentalists. We're not sure if Giuliani's claim that Obama has had only one domestic attack in his first year as president is right, either. Besides the Christmas Day bombing attempt, several U.S. lawmakers have already labeled the November Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism. The Giuliani spokesman, whom ABC News did not identify, said the ""one"" attack that Giuliani says took place during the Obama administration was a reference to the alleged Fort Hood shooter, Maj. Nidal Hasan. (Again, excluding the Christmas Day bombing plot by using the ""on our soil"" addendum.) Giuliani ran a presidential campaign based on the leadership he showed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. We would expect him to at least acknowledge that those attacks occurred while George W. Bush was president. But even considering that he was talking post-9/11, Giuliani is just plain wrong to suggest no terrorist attacks happened under Bush's watch. The clarifications added by a Giuliani spokesman are threaded so thin, it sounds like damage control more than anything.

NYC Mayor Bloomberg claims most people in finance earn $70,000-80,000 a year
","In a time of public anger over salaries and bonuses on Wall Street, it is a rare public figure who stands up for the financial sector. But New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- who, not coincidentally, is the founder of a financial news service -- did just that on Meet the Press on Jan. 3, 2010. Discussing what's happened on Wall Street since the sector's near-collapse in 2008, Bloomberg said, ""You know, we have -- everybody is bashing Wall Street. (But Wall Street) is one of the big revenue generators for New York and New York City. That's how we pay our teachers, that's how we pay our cops, that's how we pay our firefighters. And I've always thought, if the elected officials in Michigan bashed the automobile industry, or in California, (information technology), or in Texas, oil, they'd be run out of town on a rail. And yet, every day I pick up the paper and everybody, it's kind of hard to find anybody that's not saying -- well, look, there are some excesses. But overall, most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year. They're hardworking, and we want those industries to be here and not overseas."" The part that caught our eye was that ""people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year."" Many of us have the impression from the media that people who work on Wall Street earn much more than that. So we talked to experts and looked at the data. The mayor's office referred us to the New York City Economic Development Corp., whose head is appointed by the mayor. A spokesman said that office came up with that figure by using the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey data. We consulted with the Census Bureau on retracing their steps and found that Bloomberg's comment on Meet the Press was indeed accurate. The American Community Survey data -- which can be broken down by city, employer sector and employee earnings -- showed that for the ""finance and insurance"" sector in New York City, the median earnings in 2008 were $78,451. That figure includes both salary and bonuses -- an important factor in Wall Street compensation, where bonuses often dwarf base salary. A key factor to note is that this is a median number -- that is, the number exactly halfway between the highest earnings and the lowest -- and not an average. In many contexts, calculating the median can be more reliable than calculating the average (or mean), because the median is less likely to be swayed by a small number of very high or very low examples. In this case, using the median rather than the average for the sector minimizes the importance of the very highest paid executives on Wall Street, whose salaries are big enough to skew the entire results. Indeed, if you calculate the average earnings for the sector, rather than the median, the numbers look quite different. Using a separate data set from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks earnings for industries and localities on a quarterly basis, reveals that the average annual earnings for workers in New York City's ""financial activities"" sector was more than $331,000. (This amount, as large as it sounds, was actually extrapolated from data reflecting the first quarter of 2009, which was Wall Street's low point; it reflects a decline of 35 percent from a year earlier.) In other contexts, the New York City Economic Development Corp. isn't averse to citing the average rather than the median. On its Web site, the office offers a pair of charts that detail average annual wages by sector and borough, based on federal statistics. One chart shows the average wages for 2007 in the the finance-and-insurance sector at $286,158 citywide and $315,481 in Manhattan. Another chart reports an average for the ""financial services"" sector citywide at $288,213 for 2007. A spokesman for the corporation said it was valid for the office to cite median figures in one context and average figures in another, asserting that the mayor was correct when he said that ""most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year."" ""When the question is, 'What do most people who work in finance make,' the most appropriate data is the median, which literally represents the 50th percentile in the distribution,"" said the spokesman, David Lombino. ""An average would make no sense here. If you ate zero eggs, and I ate two eggs, the average is one egg -- but that is not what 'most' people ate."" The other key question is whether the data sets the mayor used are justified or misleading. The census data (as well as BLS data) count anyone who works for a financial firm, regardless of what their job is. A receptionist, an IT staffer, a janitor -- as long as they're employed in-house by a financial services firm, they get mixed in with the high-rollers that author Tom Wolfe called the Masters of the Universe. The receptionists and janitors tend to decrease both the median and average earnings figures for the industry. We had trouble finding specific compensation data for professionals on Wall Street. The Options Group, which publishes an influential compensation survey on the financial services sector, declined to provide data to us. But included in the publicly available pages posted on the firm's Web site is data showing that average salaries for a first-year associate -- a very junior position -- at ""global investment banks"" in 2009 was $80,000 to $90,000 -- which exceeds Bloomberg's figure right off the bat. Yet those same associates, according to the survey, also get bonuses on top of their base pay that average $65,000 to $75,000. Information on more senior positions was blacked out, but it's safe to assume the numbers go up from there. A lot of professionals on Wall Street ""make three-quarters of their pay in annual bonuses,"" said Michael S. Melbinger, an employee-benefits and executive compensation lawyer with the firm Winston & Strawn. Where professionals are concerned, ""I would say [Bloomberg's] figure is the bottom, not the average, even for a boutique firm."" But Lombino sees no problem in Bloomberg including the entire spectrum of financial services employees in his statistic. Indeed, that was part of the point that the mayor was trying to make -- that Wall Street supports the livelihoods of ordinary people as well as the super-rich. ""It is likely that (janitors and receptionists) enjoy other benefits associated with working for a large financial institution, just like traditional traders and bankers,"" he said. ""It would seem remiss to include them in any other category, and they have to fall in somewhere. If the mayor had said 'bankers,' or 'traders' -- those are occupations within the finance industry and [they would have produced] a different and higher figure. But he specifically said 'people who work in finance,' and that is the whole industry."" Bloomberg's artful wording -- ""Most of the people that work in finance make $70,000, $80,000 a year"" -- was broad enough to include lower-paid employees. And because of that, it is backed up by a credible federal statistic. But we believe a reasonable person hearing his comment would think he was saying that professionals such as bond traders and brokers earn $70,000 to $80,000 per year. So while he may be technically accurate, we find his statement misleading. It's also worth noting that other statistics more fully reflect that Wall Street professionals, even the most junior ones, earn much higher incomes than the amounts that Bloomberg cited. That's enough in our book to lower his statement to a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A550686080>],/factchecks/2010/jan/07/michael-bloomberg/nyc-mayor-bloomberg-claims-most-people-finance-ear/

Grassley claims he hasn't missed a vote since 1993
","Senators love to boast about their voting records, and Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is no exception.     During a weekly conference call with Iowa reporters, Grassley was asked about his re-election prospects this year.     ""I'm going to have tough competition,"" he said of his three opponents. ""Even though there's suggestions at the national level that this could be a very Republican year, I can't assume that it's going to be a very Republican year. And I'm going to have to campaign very, very hard. ... For instance, I haven't missed a vote since 1993. I hope I don't have to miss any votes this year because of a campaign.""     Has Grassley really been so steadfast? We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes; in the Senate, less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote, meaning members simply say ""aye"" or ""nay.""     First, we turned to  Congressional Quarterly  , a publication that annually studies lawmakers' voting records. According to  CQ  's Web site, Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993. The  Washington Post   also compiles  similar information, and we found that Grassley hasn't been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14, 1993. (Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work.)     What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa, according to the  Des Moines Register, noting that the senator has become ""the iron man of the Senate racking up ... 5,700 consecutive votes.""     Indeed, as an average, Grassley has voted about 99.6 percent of the time since he took office in 1981. Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near-perfect records. For example, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has, on average, voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years, first as a Republican then as a Democrat. And Sen. Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, has voted on average about 90.7 percent of the time.     Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record. When, for example, a blizzard threatened Washington, D.C., on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec. 19, 2009, Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didn't miss it.     ""Bc of potential blizzard I've come to office to sleep,""  he Tweeted  the night of the 18th. ""Vote at 720am vote Sat. Hv not missed vote 7/93. 5700 votes consecutive.""     Grassley said he hadn't missed a vote since 1993, which is certainly correct for every recorded vote.

Gov. Charlie Crist says Obama breaks transparency promise on health reform bill
","Don't mess with Charlie Crist when it comes to open government. It was Crist, as Florida governor, who created something called the Office for Open Government. And we've heard stories of the governor himself ordering agency heads to hand over public records requested by nosy reporters. Now Crist is taking up the cause of the nation's people in a debate over transparency when it comes to the health care reform bill. ""It seems that a bill that was crafted in a closed-door, backroom meeting in the White House will end the same way,"" Crist, who is running for U.S. Senate, said in a statement released Jan. 5, 2010. ""President Obama has broken his pledge to the American people to be transparent throughout this process, and (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid and (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi have only aided in the secrecy with sweetheart deals and dead of the night votes."" Crist is claiming that Obama broke a promise when it comes to transparency and health care reform. Lucky for us, we have this thing at PolitiFact called the  Obameter  , where we are tracking Obama's more than 500 campaign promises. If you'll now turn to  Promise No. 517  . To achieve health care reform, Obama said in August 2008, ""I'm going to have all the negotiations around a big table. We'll have doctors and nurses and hospital administrators. Insurance companies, drug companies -- they'll get a seat at the table, they just won't be able to buy every chair. But what we will do is, we'll have the negotiations televised on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents, and who are making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies. And so, that approach, I think is what is going to allow people to stay involved in this process."" If it only happened ... While the Senate and House floor debates have been televised on C-SPAN, negotiations have almost always been away from television cameras. ABC's Jake Tapper put the discrepancy in front of White House press secretary Robert Gibbs this week, to see if the final negotiations between the House, the Senate and the president would be televised. ""There have been a countless number of public hearings,"" Gibbs said. ""The Senate did a lot of their voting at 1 and 2 in the morning on C-SPAN ... I think what the president promised and pledged was so that you could see who was fighting for their constituents and who was fighting for drug and insurance companies."" But, Tapper pressed, the president was talking about negotiations, not votes -- which would hardly be a campaign promise since they would have been televised regardless. ""Well, but the bill gets put together on the floor of the Senate,"" Gibbs said. ""That's where the bill got augmented. And I think if you watched that debate ... you'd have seen quite a bit of public hearing and public airing."" Despite the action on the House and Senate floors, most of the serious negotiations on the health care bill have been done in the same fashion as other major initiatives in the past -- behind closed doors. From negotiations with the drug companies and health care interests to final assembly of the delicate compromise on abortion, the bulk of the big deliberations and discussions have occurred out of the public eye. The debate over the resulting bill may have been on C-SPAN as Gibbs claims, but the real sausagemaking took place in a private kitchen. That's why we rated No. 517 a Promise Broken. On top of that, C-SPAN CEO Brian Lamb  wrote  to House and Senate leaders last week inviting negotiations on the channel. ""President Obama, Senate and House leaders, many of your rank-and-file members, and the nation’s editorial pages have all talked about the value of transparent discussions on reforming the nation’s health care system,"" Lamb wrote. ""Now that the process moves to the critical stage of reconciliation between the Chambers, we respectfully request that you allow the public full access, through television, to legislation that will affect the lives of every single American."" Obama promised an end to closed-door negotiations and complete openness for the health care talks. But he has failed to deliver. When Crist says ""President Obama has broken his pledge to the American people to be transparent throughout this process,"" he's right. We rate Crist's claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E60DCC0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/05/charlie-crist/gov-charlie-crist-says-obama-breaks-transparency-p/

Milbank says Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they do the pope
","Since 1948, the Gallup polling organization has been asking Americans what man and woman ""that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most?"" This year, the polling firm stirred up more interest -- and in some circles, horror -- than in years past.

The reason: More people mentioned Glenn Beck, the conservative radio and television host, than the pope.

Granted, it was close: In the final tally, Beck and Pope Benedict XVI both were named by 2 percent of respondents. But Beck earned a few more mentions than the pope -- enough, by Gallup's reckoning, to edge His Holiness by a nose. The runaway winner was President Barack Obama, with 30 percent, followed by former President George W. Bush with 4 percent and former South African President Nelson Mandela with 3 percent.

Beck, on his Jan. 4, 2010, syndicated radio show, expressed mystification at the poll results and joked that they are ""a sign of the apocalypse.""

""It is so disturbing,"" he said. ""It's so wrong. ... When somebody phoned me up [with the news], I said, 'Shut the hell up!' ... None of it's good news for the world.""

Dana Milbank -- a columnist for the  Washington Post  who's generally considered liberal -- thought much the same about Gallup's finding. In a Jan. 3, 2010, column, Milbank analyzed Beck's role in the national discourse, concluding that while he is ""more parasite than host,"" Beck has, ""by any measure ... had a huge impact on the body politic.""

As his Exhibit A, Milbank cited the Gallup findings.

""It's official: Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they admire the pope,"" Milbank wrote. ""This news, at once unsettling and unsurprising, came from the Gallup polling organization on Wednesday. Beck, the new Fox News host who has said President Obama has a 'deep-seated hatred for white people' and alternately likens administration officials to Nazis and Marxists, was also more admired by Americans than Billy Graham and Bill Gates, not to mention Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. In Americans' esteem, Beck only narrowly trailed South Africa's Nelson Mandela, the man who defeated apartheid.""

It was a striking result, so we wondered whether Milbank was using the Gallup result accurately. Polling experts we contacted said Milbank was making too big a leap with the Beck-Pope comparison.

First, some background on the poll. Gallup asks the same question at the end of each year. The 2009 version is based on telephone interviews with 1,025 adults nationwide, conducted between Dec. 11 and Dec. 13. The sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points -- far greater than the difference between Beck's number and the pope's. And that's just the beginning of the problems with comparing the two men's stature using this poll.

Frank Newport, Gallup's editor in chief, said the primary problem is that the ""most admired"" poll is based on an open-ended question -- one in which the poll-takers asked respondents to volunteer names of the people they most admire, rather than providing them with a list of individuals to choose from. Using this poll, Newport told PolitiFact, ""I think it's not accurate, for example, to say that Beck is more admired than the pope.""

Given the enormous universe of possible answers facing someone asked an open-ended question, even most of the individuals who crack the top 10 in the ""most admired poll"" account for only a percentage point or two of all the responses. That means people with a passionate base of supporters -- but also a large group of detractors -- can find themselves high on the list. And it's not clear that someone who fits this description is clearly ""more admired"" than someone else who is more consistently, if less passionately, admired.

As it happens, other recent surveys have shown Beck with almost as many detractors as he has fans, and a sizable plurality of respondents say they don't know enough about him to have an opinion. In the September NBC/Wall Street Journal  poll, 24 percent had a positive opinion of Beck, 19 percent had a negative opinion and 42 percent said they didn't know or weren't sure. Meanwhile, an October Pew poll found that just 40 percent could identify Beck as a TV and radio host.

A better way to compare the two men, Newport said, would be to ask respondents directly whether they admired Beck and whether they admired the pope. Such a question would capture negative sentiment as well as positive sentiment. But no one has done such a poll, he said. Offering pure speculation, Newport suggested that the pope, leader of 1 billion Catholics worldwide, would score fairly well in this sort of test.

Other polling experts largely agreed that Milbank drew too glib a conclusion. Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, said that ""we have to take these low rankings in the most admired poll with a grain of salt. More popular than the pope? I can’t see that.""

And Mark Blumenthal, who edits the Web site Pollster.com, said that ""if the question posed were, 'Who do you admire more, the pope or Glenn Beck?' the results would likely be very different."" Blumenthal added that he'd judge Milbank's claim ""as more of a minor failure of semantics and copy editing than an effort to intentionally mislead.""

Because Milbank made a commonsense deduction from widely disseminated poll data, we're not going to call his claim False. But he's made a sweeping conclusion from a small amount of data. Because polling experts -- including the leader of the firm that did the poll in the first place -- believe that Milbank has drawn too sweeping a conclusion from complicated data, we're rating his statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E39CCC0>],/factchecks/2010/jan/04/dana-milbank/milbank-says-americans-admire-glenn-beck-more-they/

Cheney says Obama won't admit the U.S. at war against terrorists
","In his latest attack on President Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney seized on the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound jetliner to suggest that Obama is weak on terrorism. ""As I’ve watched the events of the last few days it is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war,"" Cheney said. ""He seems to think if he has a low-key response to an attempt to blow up an airliner and kill hundreds of people, we won’t be at war. He seems to think if he gives terrorists the rights of Americans, lets them lawyer up and reads them their Miranda rights, we won’t be at war. He seems to think if we bring the mastermind of Sept. 11 to New York, give him a lawyer and trial in civilian court, we won’t be at war.   ""He seems to think if he closes Guantanamo and releases the hard-core al-Qaida-trained terrorists still there, we won’t be at war. He seems to think if he gets rid of the words, 'war on terror,' we won't be at war. But we are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren’t, it makes us less safe. Why doesn’t he want to admit we’re at war? It doesn’t fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn’t fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency — social transformation — the restructuring of American society. President Obama’s first object and his highest responsibility must be to defend us against an enemy that knows we are at war."" Cheney's comments echo a frequent criticism by conservatives that President Obama does not use the phrase ""war on terror."" We rated that True when it was  made by talk show host Sean Hannity  in November 2009. We noted in our ruling that Obama had said he didn't use the more general phrase ""war on terror"" because he viewed the conflict as a war against ""some terrorist organizations."" With his statement to  Politico, Cheney is going further than Hannity did, directly alleging that Obama will not ""admit we're at war."" But a review of Obama's statements of the past year makes it clear he has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations.  The fifth paragraph of his inaugural address  : ""Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.""  In a February 2009 CNN interview:  ""I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations.""   In a March 2009 speech:  He said that people might ask why the United States is   at war and said, ""Al-Qaida and its allies, the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks, are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al-Qaida is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan.""   In his December 2009 speech at West Point on his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan:  He repeatedly called it a war and said, ""  I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaida.""   In his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize:  He said that ""we are at war"" and noted that  ""the world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks, and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense.""   Cheney has offered lots of criticism of Obama in the past year (of the claims we've rated, Cheney has earned a  True  and a  Mostly True  ). His remarks here go beyond opinion because he repeatedly says that Obama won't acknowledge that the United States is at war. But even a cursory examination of Obama's statements shows this one is preposterous. Obama has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations -- and has ordered a massive increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan to fight that war.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Florida', 'Karl Rove']","
Karl Rove says health care bill has a special treat for Florida's seniors, thanks to Sen. Bill Nelson
","The Nelsons are becoming whipping boys for Republicans upset with the Senate health care reform bill. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., is being targeted for a Medicaid provision in the bill that benefits only his state. (  Read our related item here  .) And now Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., is being accused of tucking in a special gift for 800,000 Florida seniors. Sen. John McCain calls it the ""Florida Flim Flam."" Karl Rove prefers the ""Sunshine State Sweepstakes.""  At issue in this case is Medicare Advantage, a program used by nearly 1 million Florida seniors.

We'll let Rove, the former adviser to President George W. Bush who was talking on Fox News, explain the rest.

""In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson -- no relation to Ben, except in his habits -- got a $25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients in their state,"" Rove said Tuesday. ""Every Medicare Advantage policyholder in America, except those in Florida, will see a huge cut in the federal support for those policies, and as a result, a dramatic decline in their benefits and an increase in their premiums, except if you live in Florida.""

Rove, McCain and many Republicans are accusing Nelson of sticking a big, fat goody in the health care bill for the folks back home. And only the folks back home. Is that what's happening?

First, a short lesson on what we're talking about, Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is an optional program that lets Medicare recipients 65 and older receive their benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the traditional Medicare program. The idea behind the program was to save the government money, but it hasn't worked out that way. Under the program, the government pays Advantage companies a set amount per enrollee, about $10,000, and they make a profit if they keep average costs below that level. The reimbursement amounts to about 14 percent more, on average, than the government spends on a traditional Medicare beneficiary.

The extra money allows companies to offer Medicare Advantage members additional services, such as prescription drug, vision and dental coverage at a much lower cost, as well as other perks like gym memberships. About 11 million people are enrolled in the program nationwide. To help pay for changes to the health care system, Democrats are considering deep cuts to Medicare Advantage reimbursements, about $120 billion spread between now and 2019.

That proposal has most Republicans, and in this case the Democrat Nelson, nervous.

Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin picks it up from here.

Nelson opposes Medicare Advantage, and voted against it -- believing it costs too much, McLaughlin said. But in the current debate Nelson was hesitant to strip benefits from seniors who already had them.

He asked for the 11 million seniors currently enrolled in Medicare Advantage to be grandfathered into the new system under the old rules.

At a cost of $35 billion, Nelson was told that was too expensive. Instead, Senate leaders offered Nelson $5 billion to help protect current Medicare Advantage recipients, McLaughlin said. So Nelson added a provision to the bill that protects seniors most affected by the proposed cuts or changes. Specifically, the money targets communities and areas where the cost of service is highest and allows those people to use the old rules. McLaughlin equates it to a cost-of-living adjustment. The language in the health care bill, which begins on Page 894, never mentions Florida or any specific state. Rather it creates a difficult-to-follow formula to determine just who should be protected from the changes. We should note that Nelson's provision wasn't a last-minute addition to secure his support on the larger bill. The Medicare Advantage exemption was included in the health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee in October. We'll also note that the Senate Finance Committee widened the pool of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries protected from the new rules. The total additional cost is expected to be around $7.5 billion over 10 years, McLaughlin said. Independent analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation say the protections will cost around $5 billion between 2012 and 2019.

So who benefits? Floridians for sure.

""Florida will definitely be treated more generously than most other states,"" said John Rother, executive vice president for policy and strategy for AARP.

But not just Floridians. Of the 1 million or so Floridians participating in Medicare Advantage, about 800,000 are expected to be protected from possible cuts. But so are people living in New York and Los Angeles, as well as in Oregon, McLaughlin says. A spokesman for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., confirmed that New Jersey seniors also will benefit from Nelson's protections to Medicare Advantage.

And Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said this: ""We got a special protection worth billions of dollars to stop Medicare cuts for 800,000 New York seniors.""

Menendez said a total of five states would receive protections. To be honest, we're not sure how many states or people will be protected since senators and their staff are using different numbers and estimates. We'll update this item when we find out. But what we do know is this: Nelson's provision in the health care bill will protect some seniors in Florida and others in Oregon, New York, New Jersey and California. A chief critic of the provision, McCain, and the independent Kaiser Family Foundation, both say it will cost about $5 billion. McLaughlin, Nelson's aide, puts the total at about $7.5 billion. That flies in the face of Rove's statement on Fox News, ""In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson ... got a $25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients in their state."" (  UPDATE:  After our story published, Rove  penned  a column for the  Wall Street Journal  that put the dollar figure at a revised $3.5 billion.) Though Florida may see the lion's share of the benefit, Florida isn't specifically carved out of any potential Medicare Advantage cuts. The current Senate legislation includes a complicated formula designed to protect seniors most at risk of big cutbacks. We rate Rove's claim Barely True.         
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001A54D9145C0>],/factchecks/2009/dec/24/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-health-care-bill-has-special-treat-/

Sen. Ben Nelson says Medicaid provision added to health care reform is not a special deal for Nebraska
","It has been called the ""Omaha Stakes"" and the ""Cornhusker Kickback,"" but was a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care bill a simple payoff to Nebraska to secure Sen. Ben Nelson's pivotal vote? That was the charge from several Republicans who blasted Nelson, D-Neb., for essentially selling his vote on health care reform in exchange for a special, backroom deal that could save the Nebraska state government millions of dollars in Medicaid subsidies. Nelson came to the floor on Dec. 22, 2009, to defend himself, and accused his attackers of distorting the facts to score political points. ""It is not a special deal for Nebraska,"" Nelson said. We decided to weigh in. At issue here is a tiny clause tucked into a 383-page Manager's Amendment to the Senate health care reform bill. The wording of the paragraph is steeped in legalese (you can read  the part that pertains to Nebraska  on page 98 if you're into that kind of thing), but it relates to money that states will have to pick up with regard to Medicaid. The Senate bill would expand Medicaid to people below 133 percent of the poverty level. And up until 2017, the federal government will pick up the tab for the added cost that will place on state governments. After that, states will have to start sharing the cost. The provision added in the amendment will exempt Nebraska from that sunset, however, meaning that the federal government would forevermore pick up all of the expense of expanded eligibility to Medicaid in that state. How much money is at stake? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office didn't specifically break out Nebraska, but said the cost of expanding Medicaid eligibility would be about $1.2 billion for Nebraska, Massachusetts and Vermont over the next 10 years. ""You’ve got to compliment Ben Nelson for playing 'The Price is Right,'"" said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. ""He negotiated a Medicaid agreement for Nebraska that puts the federal government on the hook forever. Not for six years, not for 10 years. This isn’t the Louisiana Purchase; this is the Nebraska windfall."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went on the  Today  show and called the deal ""sleazy."" And Attorney General Henry McMaster of South Carolina said he and his counterparts in Michigan and Washington state were investigating whether the special provisions for Nebraska are unconstitutional. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended the deal, saying, ""You’ll find a number of states that are treated differently than other states. That’s what legislating is all about. It’s about compromise."" On the Senate floor, Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., said Nebraskans have been embarrassed by all the attention from the controversy and want no part of a special deal. Shortly after Johanns spoke, Nelson came to the floor to defend himself. The provision, he said, was not a ""carve-out"" for Nebraska. To the contrary, he said, he pushed for the language because he opposes unfunded mandates placed on states by the federal government -- such as this Medicaid expansion -- and saw the exemption for Nebraska as a way to open the door for other states to do the same. ""You can twist and you can turn and you can try to distort what happens, but it does not change the underlying facts,"" Nelson said. ""The underlying facts are, this was pursued initially as an opt-in or opt-out for all states. It was impossible to do that at the present time, and so as a matter of fix, there was, in fact, the extension of the federal dollars from the year 2017 on, well into the future, as a marker to lay down so that every state could object to this manner of unfunded mandates."" ""Each state between now and 2017 — two-thirds-plus of a decade — will have an opportunity to come back in and get this bill changed,"" Nelson said. ""It is not a special deal for Nebraska,"" Nelson insisted. ""It is, in fact, an opportunity to get rid of an unfunded federal mandate for all the states. Let me repeat that: for all the states. There is nothing special about it, and it is fair."" Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, agreed that while the provision only mentions Nebraska, it may set a precedent for other states to get the same deal. '""Other governors will be on their congressmen and senators to make sure their states are held harmless,"" Harkin said. '""Sen. Nelson may have done all the states a big favor."" So to summarize, Nelson says the provision was meant as a ""marker"" to allow all states to fight what he believes is an unfair, unfunded mandate from the federal government. And maybe that's the effect the provision will have. Maybe it will open the door so that in the next seven years, other states will be able to change the law so that they can get the same deal as Nelson got for Nebraska. But for now, Nebraska is the only state in the bill that would get the deal. Other states may fight in the future, but Nelson has already won that battle for Nebraska. And unless or until all states get the same treatment, it  is  a special deal for Nebraska. We rule Nelson's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001A54E6AA340>],/factchecks/2009/dec/23/ben-nelson/sen-ben-nelson-says-medicaid-provision-added-healt/
"['National', 'Elections', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Public option was in Obama's platform
","
With a health care vote in the Senate approaching, President Barack Obama discussed reform and compromise in an interview with the

Washington Post

.


The reporter asked Obama what his general thoughts were on compromise in the political process.


Obama launched into a defense of the health care bill, an area where some of his liberal supporters have accused him of compromising too much.


""Nowhere has there been a bigger gap in the perceptions of compromise and the reality of compromise than in the health care bill,"" Obama said.


He then listed several things he called for during the campaign that he considers to be part of the bill, including coverage for the uninsured, new rules for insurance companies, tax breaks for small businesses and measures that rein in growing costs.


""Every single criteria for reform that I put forward is in this bill,"" Obama said. ""It is true that the Senate version does not have a public option, and that has become, I think, a source of ideological contention between the left and the right. But I didn't campaign on a public option. I think it is a good idea. But as I said in that speech on Sept. 9 (on health care), it is just one small element of a broader reform effort. And so we don't feel that the core elements to help the American people that I campaigned on and that we've been fighting for all year have been compromised in any significant way.""


We got an e-mail from a reader pointing out Obama's statement that he ""did not campaign on a public option."" How can that be, the reader asked, when the public option was clearly part of Obama's platform?


We agree that the public option was part of Obama's platform. It's

a promise we've listed

in our database of Obama's campaign promises.


It says that through a new health care exchange, ""any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it.""
 
But, we also have to say that the public option was not a very prominent part of Obama's platform. We added the promise in August after the public option became an intense part of the debate. We were able to find the proposal pretty quickly after looking in Obama's campaign literature, but he didn't discuss it very much during the campaign. That's true for both the general election and the Democratic primary.
 
If you look for mentions of the public option in Obama's speeches or comments to voters, you'll find very few. In fact, Obama gave a major address in Iowa on May 29, 2007, outlining his health care plan in considerable detail. There's not one mention of the public option in his speech.
 
The Democratic primary's big health care battle was over whether there should be

an individual mandate

that required people to buy health insurance. Candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards said there should be a mandate; Obama was opposed. Obama said that people don't buy insurance because they can't afford it, not because they don't want to, and it was wrong to force them.


When negotiations began on health care legislation in 2009, however, Obama changed his position and supported the mandate. (We gave him a

Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter

.)


So during the campaign, the public option was not mentioned much.
 
But since we track campaign promises, we believe candidates should be held accountable for all their promises, and that includes things they have in their campaign literature. It's up to voters to decide whether the public option --

Promise No. 518

-- is more or less important than Obama's other promises.


Obama's new claim is, ""I didn't campaign on a public option."" We will stipulate that it was not a particularly prominent part of his overall platform for health care. But we find that the public option was part of Obama's campaign materials, and that counts. So we rate his statement Barely True.

"['Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist campaign message says governor broke fundraising record
","The man running Gov. Charlie Crist's campaign for U.S. Senate is bragging that Crist set a fundraising record in 2009. ""In our first quarter we broke the record for fundraising in a U.S. Senate race in Florida,"" Crist campaign manager Eric Eikenberg wrote Dec. 18 in a campaign update to supporters. ""And we have met our goals time and again thanks to many of you who have invested in the Governor's message and vision of commonsense conservative leadership."" Crist raised $4.37 million between May 12 and June 30, 2009, according to federal election campaign  documents  . Is that a record for a single reporting period? To check, we turned to the two most trusted repositories of federal campaign finance information -- the government-run Federal Elections Commission and the nonpartisan, not-for-profit Center for Responsive Politics. According to them, Florida's overall Senate fundraising benchmark was set in 2006 by U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Nelson  raised  a little more than $18 million for his re-election campaign against Republican Katherine Harris. But his best quarter -- from January through March 2006 -- netted only $2.82 million, according to  FEC records  . Crist's number crushes that mark. Other than Nelson, former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez seemed to be a possible state recordholder. But Martinez's biggest haul was only  $1.7 million  , from January through March 2004. He repeated the feat again from April through June 2004. Martinez ended up raising a little more than $12 million for the 2004 election, slightly more than Democratic opponent Betty Castor in that cycle. No one else comes close to Crist's quarter fundraising total, records show. Crist raked in $4.37 million in his first campaign fundraising quarter and has raised $6.89 million through September. Nelson raised $6.53 million for his entire 2000 race, compared with $8.66 million for that year's GOP candidate, Bill McCollum. In the 1998 campaign between Crist and former Sen. Bob Graham, the candidates combined to raise about $7 million. Crist's take from May 12 to June 30 is the largest three-month gain for any Senate candidate in Florida history. We rate the Crist campaign claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001A5506E9C00>],/factchecks/2009/dec/21/charlie-crist/crist-campaign-manager-says-governor-broke-fundrai/
