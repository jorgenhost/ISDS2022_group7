Many more criminal indictments under Trump, Reagan and Nixon than under Obama, Clinton and Carter
","A Facebook post claimed that there have been 317 criminal indictments in the administrations of three recent Republican presidents — Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon — and only three indictments under three recent Democratic presidents — Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Here’s what the post said about those presidents, whose terms date back to 1969 when Nixon was in office: ""Recent administrations with the MOST criminal indictments:  Trump (Republican) — 215 Nixon (Republican) — 76 Reagan (Republican) — 26 ""Recent administrations with the LEAST criminal indictments:  Obama (Democrat) — 0 Carter (Democrat) — 1 Clinton (Democrat) — 2 ""Notice a pattern?"" Unless an administration official is charged with a crime for acts while in office, it’s not always easy to identify which indictments can be connected to a presidential administration; some administration officials have been indicted for acts in the private sector, some indicted people were involved in presidential campaigns but didn’t work in the administration, etc. This claim exaggerates the number of indictments under Trump, in particular, by counting the number of criminal charges filed, rather than the number of people indicted; and it includes the indictments of people who are not part of his administration, such as 25 Russians. On the whole, however, the indictments under the three GOP presidents do dwarf those under the three Democrats.  An indictment is essentially a two-step process in the federal system: 1. An agency such as the FBI or the IRS investigates possible crimes. If the agency decides to seek criminal charges, the case goes to a grand jury.  2. The grand jury is designed to be an impartial body of citizens drawn from the community that, with the help of prosecutors, conducts its own investigation, in secret. If the grand jury decides that criminal charges should be filed, an indictment is issued.  (Conviction, of course, would occur only after a plea bargain or trial.) The indictment formally charges a person or persons with a criminal offense or offenses. In other words, one indictment can contain multiple criminal charges against a single individual or against multiple individuals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election netted indictments against 34 people and three entities. However, 25 of the people indicted are Russian nationals or Russian intelligence officers. Only six of the 34 indicated are in Trump’s orbit: Paul Manafort (48/25 counts): Former Trump campaign chairman, former lobbyist for Ukrainian officials; crimes alleged not connected to his work for Trump. Convicted of tax and bank fraud. Oct. 30, 2017 indictment (with Gates): Counts 1-6; 10-12: 9. Feb. 13, 2018 indictment: 18. Feb. 22, 2018 superseding indictment (with Gates): Counts 1-5; 10-14; 24-32: 19. Sept. 14, 2018, superseding criminal information: 2. Rick Gates (23 counts): Top deputy to Manafort, former lobbyist for Ukrainian officials; crimes alleged not connected to his work for Trump. Pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and financial fraud related to hiding money he earned lobbying for politicians in the Ukraine along with Manafort. Oct. 30, 2017 (with Manafort): Counts 1-2; 7-12: 8. Feb. 22, 2018 superseding indictment (with Manafort) Counts 6-10; 15-32. Roger Stone (7 counts): Longtime adviser; Trump campaign official dispatched Stone to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails in an effort to damage Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Convicted of obstructing a congressional inquiry, lying to investigators under oath and trying to block the testimony of a witness whose account would have exposed his lies. Michael Cohen (1 count): Longtime Trump lawyer and adviser. Pleaded guilty to a series of criminal charges, including a campaign finance law violation that implicated the president but was unrelated to the Russia interference investigation. George Papadopoulos (1 count): Campaign adviser on foreign policy to Trump. Pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his efforts to put the Trump campaign in contact with Moscow. Michael Flynn (1 count): Campaign adviser to Trump and then briefly his national security adviser. Indicted Nov. 30, 2017. Pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his discussions with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition. Flynn and Kislyak had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia for election meddling. Because of the various indictments filed against Manafort, one could count a total of 48 charges against him. But ultimately he faced 25 charges: He went on trial for 18 charges (and was found guilty of eight of them) and then faced seven more charges (he pleaded guilty to two). So, that’s a total of 58 or 81 charges against Trump associates — not 215. But the claim we’re checking refers not to individual charges but indictments, of which there are only a half dozen directly tied to Trump. We contacted more than a half dozen presidential historians and none said they were aware of a source that lists the number of indictments during the presidential administrations in question. But we did find tallies organized a bit differently in a March 2019 article by FiveThirtyEight. The article counted the number of people indicted in cases made by special counsels, from Watergate through Mueller. Nixon: 28 key indictments. There were 72 indictments charging 68 people (58 were convicted), all in the Watergate scandal or related investigations. But arguably only 28 of the 68 were part of, or closely tied to, Nixon’s administration. They included two of Nixon’s attorneys general, two White House counsels, two secretaries of treasury and a number of White House aides. Click here to see a spreadsheet listing the Watergate indictments. Reagan: 33 people indicted. 18 people indicted (16 convicted) in an investigation of fraud, corruption and influence-peddling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development; 14 people, including Caspar Weinberger and Oliver North, charged (11 convicted) in the Iran-contra scandal, an illicit arms deal with Iran orchestrated by members of the administration; and White House aide Lyn Nofziger was charged (his conviction was overturned) over corruption allegations surrounding Wedtech, a military contractor.  Clinton: 2 officials indicted. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was charged (and acquitted) over allegations that he accepted improper gifts from businesses and lobbyists. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros was convicted (and pardoned) of making false statements to law enforcement about hush money payments to his former mistress. Obama: None. Carter: None.  A Facebook post said that there have been 317 criminal indictments under three recent Republican presidents and only three under three recent Democratic presidents. The claim is essentially on target for the Democratic presidents, but the comparison to the GOP presidents is overstated, because the numbers of Trump and Nixon administration indictments claimed are greatly exaggerated.  Even so, with a generous count, there were roughly 142 people indicted in the three GOP presidents — far less than 317, but far more than the two under the Democrats.

No, the Clintons and Obama didn’t give nukes and uranium to North Korea, Iran and Russia
","""It’s obvious who the real traitors are,"" begins a Dec. 29 Facebook post featuring photos of former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump. It claims that Bill Clinton ""gave nukes to North Korea,"" Obama ""gave nukes to Iran"" and Hillary Clinton ""gave uranium to Russia.""  The text over the photo of a satisfied-looking Trump says: ""Who betrayed America?""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to some energy and arms experts about the Facebook post. Resoundingly, they all told us it’s wrong.  North Korea ""North Korea developed nuclear weapons on their own and, in any event, tested them under George W. Bush,"" said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.  During Bill Clinton’s presidency, amid threats from Pyongyang to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the United States and North Korea negotiated the 1994 Agreed Framework. In the treaty, North Korea agreed to halt production of plutonium, which is used to make nuclear weapons. The country also halted plutonium processing in Yongbyon and froze construction of two other reactors.   The United States considered those reactors ""highly suitable for making plutonium for weapons,"" said Joshua Pollack, editor of the Nonproliferation Review and a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.  In exchange, an international consortium would replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors, mostly financed by Japan and South Korea, to provide the energy without nuclear capability. The United States agreed to provide shipments of heavy fuel oil to North Korea to help meet the country’s energy needs until the new reactors were operational.  The United States provided North Korea $400 million in heavy fuel oil until 2003, but the light-water nuclear reactors were never completed. In 2002, U.S. negotiators presented North Korean officials with evidence of a clandestine uranium enrichment program and the Agreed Framework treaty broke down during the George W. Bush administration. Iran Iran, meanwhile, doesn’t have nuclear weapons. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal reached by countries including the United States during the Obama administration actually required Iran to curtail its uranium enrichment activities and redesign a reactor that was under construction that ""would have been very useful for making plutonium for weapons,"" Pollack said.  By agreeing to the deal, Iran pledged to forgo 97% of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It also said it would give up 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges — the machines used to enrich uranium — and would only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for at least 10 years. In short: the country committed to not pursuing nuclear weapons and faced obstacles if it broke that promise. Iran’s nuclear activity was subject to international monitoring and the United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council agreed to relax sanctions imposed on the country.  In 2018, Trump announced that the United States would be withdrawing from the agreement. Since then, Iran has inched away from some of its commitments. The deal is weakened, but not entirely dead. And the amount of time Iran would need before it can produce a nuclear weapon has slowly but steadily shrunk. Russia As for Russia, ""the Hillary Clinton and uranium claim is totally without merit,"" said Siegfried Hecker a professor emeritus at Stanford University and a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  By the time the Soviet Union dissolved, Russia had more than 1 million kilograms of highly enriched uranium, Hecker said. To put that in context, it only takes a few 10s of kilograms to make one bomb he said. During Bill Clinton’s presidency, Russia actually sold to the United States 500,000 kilograms of uranium that had been diluted so that it was suitable for power plants.  As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton did serve on a government board that ultimately approved a transfer of ownership of uranium mines, but she wasn’t the deciding vote. A panel of several departments and agencies were part of its approval.  As we’ve previously reported, Uranium One, a Toronto-based company, had mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states. In 2009, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, bought a 17% share of Uranium One. In 2010, Rosatom sought to secure enough shares to give it a 51% stake.  Russia doesn’t have a license to export uranium outside the United States but the possibility that a foreign entity would take a majority stake in the uranium operation meant that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had to approve the deal. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Utah’s nuclear regulator also needed to sign off. Because CFIUS membership includes the U.S. State Department, the secretary of state would have had a voice in the decision. That panel also includes the attorney general, the secretaries of treasury, defense, commerce, energy and homeland security, and the heads of the office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. CFIUS approved the proposal, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100% of Uranium One and renamed the company Uranium One Holding. Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute, told PolitiFact in 2016 that Russia’s purchase of the company was probably approved because it ""had as much of an impact on national security as it would have if they set the money on fire.""   Our ruling Republican and Democratic presidential administrations in the United States have all tried to stop Iran and North Korea from making nuclear weapons, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, based in Washington, D.C. Russia, meanwhile, ""has mined and produced more uranium, including highly-enriched uranium which can be used for nuclear weapons, than they know what to do with.""  After working in nuclear arms control and nonproliferation for 30 years, Kimball said he’s never seen ""something that is so blatantly wrong"" as the allegations in the Facebook post.  ""Each of these three claims is false,"" he said, ""Period."" That’s our rating, too: False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096884680>],/factchecks/2020/jan/09/viral-image/no-clintons-and-obama-didnt-give-nukes-and-uranium/

Did Trump DOT secretary Elaine Chao use grant to help her husband Mitch McConnell's re-election bid?
","A YouTube headline claimed that Elaine Chao, President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, was caught improperly using her office to help re-elect her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell, who is seeking a seventh term to his Kentucky seat in 2020, is the top-ranking Republican in Congress. But, according to Morning Consult polling for the third quarter of 2019, he is also the most unpopular senator in the country among voters in his state. ""Elaine Chao BUSTED Sending $97 Million Contract To Help Mitch McConnell Win Reelection,"" says the headline, which also appeared on other websites and social media. The headline linked to a video from The Ring of Fire show on YouTube, which elaborated on the claim, primarily by referring to a Dec. 17 Politico expose. What we found:  Chao did get busted in the conversational sense of the word — her actions providing unusual help to Kentucky were exposed and they also drew criticism from a federal watchdog agency.  But the claim significantly overstates the amount of the grant (not a contract). And even though it certainly gave McConnell something to crow about in his campaign, the grant occurred more than two years before voters will go to the polls in November 2020.   In June 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation gave a $67 million interstate highway improvement grant — not a $97 million contract — to Boone County.  The county, Politico reported, is ""a rapidly growing suburban district of political importance"" to McConnell.  The county was one of 26 grant winners out of 258 initial applicants. In June 2019, the Government Accountability Office, a top federal watchdog, faulted DOT in a report for failing to document why Boone County and 41 other grant applicants that had initially submitted incomplete applications were allowed to revise them, while 55 other applicants were not.  ""It really invites skepticism, and it raises questions about the integrity of the process and ultimately the decisions that are made,"" Susan Fleming, director of GAO's physical infrastructure team, told Politico. ""Are these decisions driven by merit? Or are they driven by other factors?"" Boone County officials were in contact with Chao’s aide, Todd Inman, during the grant application process.  Inman is a former McConnell campaign staffer. ""Chao’s alleged favoritism toward Kentucky has become a focus of scrutiny following revelations that she had designated Inman as a special point-of-contact for Kentucky officials,"" the Politico article says.  The DOT said the Inman communication was coincidental and that Boone County’s application was among those ""best aligned"" with the grant criteria. In a later Fox News Radio interview, Chao dismissed the claims of favoritism as mere politics.  An earlier Politico article, in June 2019, revealed that Chao had designated Inman to help with grant applications and other priorities from Kentucky, ""paving the way for grants totaling at least $78 million for favored projects as McConnell prepared to campaign for reelection."" Inman had stated in an email to McConnell’s Senate office that Chao had personally asked him to serve as an intermediary ""on grants with special significance for McConnell."" McConnell dismissed that report at the time, suggesting at a news conference that he had discussed federal projects with Chao and that she hadn’t steered enough funds to his state. ""You know, I was complaining to her just last night: 169 projects, and Kentucky got only five. I hope we’ll do a lot better next year,"" McConnell said. It’s worth noting that McConnell announced his re-election bid in August 2018 — two months after the grant was announced, but more than two years ahead of the 2020 election. A social media post claimed: ""Elaine Chao BUSTED Sending $97 Million Contract To Help Mitch McConnell Win Reelection."" Chao’s agency gave a Kentucky county a $67 million grant, not a $97 million contract, so the amount claimed is overstated by nearly half. Chao was ""busted,"" in the colloquial sense of the word, in that it was revealed that the county had initially submitted an incomplete grant application, but eventually won the funds after consulting with an aide to Chao — who formerly worked on McConnell’s campaign. The process also drew criticism from the Government Accountability Office. The grant helped McConnell’s re-election bid in that it is the largest transportation grant received in Kentucky during the Trump administration. Voters could view that favorably come Election Day.

False image of missile strike on U.S. troops shared by Iran outlet
","An Iranian news agency tweeted a photo claiming it showed U.S. planes on fire this week after Iran launched missile strikes.

Getty credits the image to Abed Rahim Khatib/AFP. Some Twitter users replied to the news agency’s tweet, questioning why it was recycling the old image and noting that it was from November. Other Twitter users more broadly claimed that ""Iran’s online operatives"" were re-using old pictures. This is not the only case of old images being repurposed and falsely labeled as showing the most recent air strikes against U.S. military. Our reporting found that additional images and videos of older missile strikes by Iran and Israel were also shared widely on Facebook, falsely identified as being from this week’s Iranian strikes.

Did Biden laud a Paul Ryan proposal to cut Social Security as Bernie Sanders’ campaign said?
","Sen. Bernie Sanders argues that former Vice President Joe Biden sided with a Republican effort to cut Social Security. ""In 2018, Biden lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare,"" wrote the Sanders campaign in a Jan. 7 newsletter. The night before on CNN, Sanders had attacked Biden’s record on Social Security and Medicare. Ryan is a former Republican House speaker who proposed sweeping changes to Social Security that were never enacted.  We found that the Sanders campaign newsletter distorts what Biden said about Ryan’s plan. The Sanders campaign pointed to a speech Biden gave to the Brookings Institution in April 2018. Biden’s overall message was that ""folks in the middle class are in trouble"" and that the tax code ""is widely skewed toward taking care of those at the very top."" Biden argued that tax cuts were creating more debt, putting middle class programs at risk.  The Sanders campaign plucked out what Biden said about Ryan, but ignored the complete passage which showed that Biden wanted Social Security and Medicare protected, and to accomplish that goal would require making changes to the tax code. The thrust of his point about the tax code was that he was saying it does too much to help the uber rich.  This is what Biden said about Ryan: ""Paul Ryan was correct when he did the tax code. What’s the first thing he decided we had to go after?"" Biden said, with a slight smirk. Biden then leaned into the microphone and said in a deep menacing voice: ""Social Security and Medicare.""  Biden continued: ""Now, we need to do something about Social Security and Medicare."" He then sarcastically whispered: ""That’s the only way you can find room to pay for it.""  The Biden campaign said that he was mocking Ryan. To understand Biden’s tone, you have to actually watch and listen to his words. The snippet of written text, which the Sanders’ campaign newsletter used, doesn’t relay Biden’s full point.  The Sanders campaign omits what Biden said next (our emphasis is in bold): ""Now, I don’t know a whole lot of people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent or the top 1 percent who are relying on Social Security when they retire. I don’t know a lot of them. Maybe you guys do. So we need a pro-growth, progressive tax code that treats workers as job creators, as well, not just investors; that gets rid of unprotective loopholes like stepped-up basis; and it raises enough revenue to make sure that the Social Security and Medicare can stay, it still needs adjustments, but can stay; and pay for the things we all acknowledge will grow the country."" We sent Biden’s speech to Marc Goldwein, senior vice president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The 2018 speech is very clearly Biden saying the opposite of what the Sanders campaign is claiming. He’s saying that Paul Ryan is going to cut taxes so that he can complain about the deficit and demand a need to cut Social Security."" Biden was previously critical of Social Security and Medicare proposals by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Ryan, his running mate in 2012. RELATED FACT-CHECK: Biden said Romney and Ryan support ""massive cuts in Social Security for future generations"" During the 2020 campaign, Biden promised to ""prevent cuts to American retirees."" The reality is that if nothing changes, the $1 trillion-a-year Social Security program is on track to run out of reserves by about 2035. RELATED STORY: Social Security: A critical program with an uncertain future A Sanders campaign newsletter said, ""In 2018, Biden lauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" That stems from a speech Biden gave in 2018 in which he spoke about Ryan. Biden appeared to be mocking Ryan, not praising him. The Sanders campaign omitted what Biden said next: the importance of protecting Social Security and Medicare and to change the tax code, which he said benefitted the mega rich. Overall, the point of Biden’s speech was to criticize tax cuts for the rich and call for more help to the middle class.  The Sanders campaign plucked out part of what Biden said but omitted the full context of his comments.

Did Iran place an $80 million bounty on Donald Trump's head?
","Amid tensions between the United States and Iran, posts on social media have said that Iran has placed a large bounty on President Donald Trump. ""A bounty of $80 MILLION has been placed on President Donald Trump’s head by Iran as tensions between the country and the USA rise,"" said one representative Instagram post that received more than 380,000 likes as of Jan. 8, two days after it was posted.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post and others like it are based on actual events related to the death of high-ranking Iranian official Qassem Soleimani due to a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 2. However, many of the posts are misleading because they leave out important context. Reports of an $80 million bounty stem from remarks at Soleimani’s funeral procession in the northeastern city of Mashhad that were aired on Iranian state television. Footage from state TV, including the remarks in the original Farsi, were tweeted by NBC News Tehran correspondent Ali Arouzi.  At the funeral procession, which was a highly choreographed, state-run event with a national audience, a speaker called on Iranians ""to donate $1 each in order to gather an $80 million bounty on President Trump’s head,"" Arouzi wrote. The population of Iran is a little bit over 80 million, so $1 each would be roughly $80 million. There’s a caveat, however. The $80 million bounty was a suggestion by a eulogist at the funeral — not official Iranian government policy. We asked Farhad Souzanchi — a Farsi speaker who founded the Rouhani Meter fact-checking website, which covers Iranian politics — to review the video clip from the funeral. Souzanchi said that Arouzi’s summary of the speaker’s words was accurate. Souzanchi said the eulogist prefaced his remarks by saying that ""this is a voluntary suggestion from the people of Mashhad on behalf of all Iranians."" While the bounty has made a splash on U.S. social media, Souzanchi, who monitors Iranian media, told PolitiFact that the bounty proposal ""hasn't made much news"" in Iran. He said the speaker, whose identity PolitiFact has been unable to confirm, was not familiar to him either.  Other Iran experts urged not taking the bounty threat too seriously. ""I would not touch it with a 10 foot pole,"" said Mark J. Gasiorowski, a specialist in Iran and the Middle East at Tulane University. Arang Keshavarzian, an associate professor of Middle East studies at New York University, said he agrees with Souzanchi that there’s no indication in the Iranian media that the bounty is becoming a serious policy proposal.

Are most murders 'gangbangers killing gangbangers,' as Van Cleave says?
","A leading gun rights activist says Democratic lawmakers are trying to penalize law-abiding firearm owners for violence committed by gangs. The charge was made by Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, during a Dec. 9 rally at the state Capitol. His group was protesting a series of gun restrictions proposed by Democrats, who in November elections, won control of both General Assembly chambers for the first time this century. Working with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, the new majority is calling for universal background checks on firearm buyers, an assault weapons ban, a one-handgun-a-month purchase limit, and a red-flag law that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. With urging from Van Cleaves’ group and other pro-gun interests, more than 100 localities have declared themselves ""Second Amendment Sanctuaries""  that won’t enforce gun restrictions they think are unconstitutional. Van Cleave, in a speech at the rally, said Democrats should focus on stopping crime instead of restricting guns. He blamed gun violence mostly on gangs.  ""Let’s fix crime,"" he said. ""You know what? If you took an X-Acto pen to certain parts of every city in the state and around the country; if you cut it out and could take it off the map, murders would drop to almost zero. It’s usually gangbangers killing gangbangers."" We fact-checked his claim that homicides in Virginia and across the nation usually involve gang members killing one another. Our search for national statistics kept sending us to discontinued data once compiled by the National Gang Center under the Department of Justice.  Based on annual surveys of local law enforcement agencies, the Center tallied 11,934 ""gang-related"" homicides in the U.S. from 2007 through 2012. The FBI reported 93,253 total murders during the span. Comparing the numbers, the Center estimated that ""gang-related homicides typically accounted for around 13% of all homicides annually."" That’s far below Van Cleave’s claim that most murders are gang-related. But the Center had concerns about the reliability of its gang-related homicide numbers and stopped collecting them after 2012. It put an asterisk on top of its chart with the note urging ""caution"" in interpreting the results. In footnotes, the Center explained that localities had different ways of defining the term ""gang-related."" The Center tallied 1,975 gang-related murders in 2007, and 2,363 in 2012 - a 24% increase. ""The occurrence of gang homicides was highly concentrated in very large cities, with a small subset of these cities accounting for most of the increase over previous years,"" it wrote in footnotes. We asked Van Cleave where he got his information that most murders, nationally and in Virginia are ""gangbangers killing gangbangers."" He didn’t provide a specific answer. Van Cleave noted there are high murder rates in some cities where gangs are prevelant. He urged us to call the state medical examiner’s office for data on Virginia. Maria Reppas, communications director of the state Department of Health - which oversees the chief medical examiner - said the department doesn’t collect data on gang-related murders. The State Police don’t keep such records, either, according to Corinne Geller, the agency’s public relations director. Nor does the Virginia State Crime Commission, said Kristen Howard, executive director of the study group. They said they were unaware of any state statistics on gang-related murders. In opposing gun control measures, Van Cleave says murders in the U.S. and Virginia are ""usually gangbangers killing gangbangers.""  Our search turned up only one set of statistics, and it casts doubt on Van Cleave’s statement. The National Gang Center estimated that from 2007 through 2012, 13% of U.S. homicides were gang-related. But it stopped collecting the data after that, noting that police departments around the nation were submitting counts based on varying definitions of ""gang-related.""  We couldn’t find any statistics on gang-related murders in Virginia. The State Police, the Crime Commission, and the Department of Health (to which Van Cleave indirectly referred us) said they don’t keep such records and did not know where they might exist. So the burden of proof falls on Van Cleave to prove his claim, and he offers nothing concrete. We rate his statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096884540>],/factchecks/2020/jan/09/philip-van-cleave/are-most-murders-gangbangers-killing-gangbangers-v/

Fact-checking Facebook post on gun registry, immigrants here illegally
","A thinking face emoji trails this question being shared on Facebook: ""Why are guns required to be registered, but illegal immigrants aren’t???"" The graphic with the question and emoji was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The question’s underlying facts are flawed. There is no national registry of all people here illegally, and most states do not require gun owners to register their weapons. Immigrants in the country illegally generally have either overstayed the length of a visa or come into the country without authorization and proper documentation. The federal government has immigration records of people issued a deportation order or released from immigration custody pending a final resolution of their case. But there isn’t a database listing everyone who is in the country illegally. Gun owners don’t have to catalog their firearms in a national register, and the majority of states don’t require firearm registration. Some states even have laws to prohibit gun registries, according to the National Rifle Association, or NRA. However, six states — California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York — require the registration of certain firearms, such as assault weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center, which favors laws requiring gun registration. Hawaii and the District of Columbia require the registration of all firearms; and while California does not have a traditional gun registry, it has a similarly functioning system, the Giffords Law Center said. The Facebook post in its question form implies that guns are required to be registered, but that’s not the case nationally. Only a few states require the registration of some or all firearms. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

It's True. Man photographed at Baghdad U.S. embassy protest visited the White House in 2011
","After U.S. airstrikes killed fighters of Iran-backed militia in Iraq, protesters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Dec. 31, 2019, in what the Associated Press called ""one of the worst attacks on the embassy in recent memory.""

The Jan. 4 post paired the image with a second photo captured at the White House on Dec. 12, 2011.

In 2011, Amiri, then Iraq’s transportation minister, did indeed visit the White House. (You can read more on the criticism his appearance drew here.)

""All are pictured below outside our embassy.""  This photo of that 2011 White House meeting is similar to the one that appears in the Facebook post, though Obama is obscured by a lamp. If you zoom in on the man in the blue tie, it appears to be Hadi al-Amiri, though the photo caption doesn’t identify him.  We don’t know Amiri’s role in the December attack. Fox News reported ""it is unclear what Amiri’s level of involvement was in the siege."" The Associated Press said he ""joined the protesters outside the embassy in a strikingly bold move.""

Seth Moulton correct that prescription drug prices can be negotiated for VA, but not Medicare
","Democratic presidential candidate Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) doesn’t support single-payer health care — even though it’s the health care policy he’s covered by. Single-payer health care refers to a health insurance plan for everyone that is paid for by one entity, such as the government. But as a veteran, Moulton said he knows firsthand ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" of such an approach. His service makes him eligible for health coverage through the Veterans Administration health system, which single-payer advocates often cite as an American success story. And at a time when prescription drugs are a hot topic for presidential candidates, he made an interesting claim during a CNN town hall earlier this month: ""The VA negotiates prescription drug prices. Medicare doesn't do that."" Moulton has represented Massachusetts’s 6th Congressional District since 2019 and declared his candidacy for president in April on ABC News. It was during this interview that he said, ""I think I'm the only candidate who actually gets single-payer health care."" Some of the issues Moulton emphasizes in his presidential platform are national security, a national service education, health care and mental health. Moulton was a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps and competed four combat tours in Iraq. After Moulton made the claim, he added, ""that means our prescription prices at the VA are lower than Medicare."" When asked about the source for the conclusion about prescription drug pricing, Moulton spokesman Matt Corridoni cited a paper in Health Economics published online in April 2011. To verify Moulton’s claim, we asked health care experts if it was true that the Department of Veterans Affairs negotiates drug prices but Medicare doesn’t. All of them said Moulton’s claim is correct. ""The VA uses an entirely different system to establish drug prices, and also has a formulary — unlike Medicare,"" said Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and director of the foundation’s program on Medicare policy. ""Medicare delegates this job to private Medicare (Part D) drug plans that negotiate with drug companies, which leads to variations in drug prices across plans,"" she said. Walid F. Gellad, associate professor of medicine and health policy at the University of Pittsburgh, provided some more context for his claim. ""The VA does negotiate prescription prices on behalf of all VA patients, although they also benefit from a law that caps the amount they pay for prescriptions,"" Gellad said. ""Incidentally, it's not providers who do the negotiating, but the government agency itself."" Gellad explained that the VA negotiates prices on behalf of its beneficiaries, but Medicare doesn’t negotiate on behalf of people it covers. Economist Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare under George H.W. Bush and a senior fellow at the Project Hope health foundation, noted a key difference between the agencies: the VA covers around 6 million people, and Medicare has approximately 44 million beneficiaries. ""The use of administered pricing — where government sets the price like it does for Medicare physicians and hospitals—is more complicated for drugs because of the long lead cycle in their development,"" Wilensky said. ""The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have no experience negotiating prices for anything. This would be a challenging place to start — with potentially a lot of unintended consequences."" A specific problem, Wilensky said, is the time that it takes for drugs to develop: it can take ""10 years from the time drug development starts until it makes it to market."" Wilensky said that this ""means that if administered pricing for various drugs was set inappropriately, it wouldn’t be felt or observed for a decade. Whereas, if rates for physicians are set inappropriately, the pushback would be felt quickly."" Nevertheless, Medicare does actually do some negotiation, Gellad noted, just not by the government on behalf of its beneficiaries. ""Medicare does allow health plans that deliver the drug benefit to negotiate on behalf of their members,"" Gellad said. Drug prices through the VA do tend to be lower than Medicare, experts told us. ""Prescription prices at VA are lower than Medicare, partly because of the law that I mentioned, but definitely also because of VA being able to negotiate on behalf of all its members,"" Gellad said. Moulton said that the VA negotiates drug prices but Medicare does not. All of our experts said the claim is correct. Medicare isn’t allowed by law to negotiate prices on behalf of its beneficiaries. The VA — with 6 million patients — does negotiate and also has a legally enforced limit on the price of prescription drugs.

Tulsi Gabbard is right: Citizenship denials are higher for military applicants compared to civilians
","Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said that some immigrants in the U.S. military are getting the ""door slammed on their face"" when they apply for U.S. citizenship. At a meeting with veterans in California, Gabbard was asked what she would do about immigrant veterans who are deported. ""We got to bring our veterans home,"" said Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii who served two tours of duty in the Middle East and is a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard. Many immigrant veterans and active service members don’t know their rights and opportunities, Gabbard said. ""Even those who apply for citizenship, we’re seeing now, are getting rejected at higher numbers than those who are not veterans,"" Gabbard said. ""This dishonors their service, their sacrifice, the sacrifices that are made by their family members."" Is Gabbard right about citizenship denials for immigrants in the military? Official immigration data supports her claim. Military service isn’t limited to U.S. citizens. Lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can also enlist. A program authorized by President George W. Bush’s administration also allowed the enlistment of people who were neither U.S. citizens nor green card holders, but had critical skills needed by the military, such as expertise in certain languages or medical specialties. The military stopped accepting new applicants after new security screenings requirements were established in September 2016, said a summary from the Congressional Research Service. In general, immigrants must meet specific criteria to be eligible for U.S. citizenship. The law allows expedited naturalization for non-U.S. citizens in the Armed Forces and recently honorably discharged immigrant veterans. ""Immigrants have served in every war since the American Revolution,"" said Nancy Gentile Ford, a history professor at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. ""And the military has always served as a way for immigrants to become citizens."" Gabbard’s campaign used as backup reporting from McClatchy and the latest available data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 (October through December 2018), immigration officials denied 16.6% of military applications for citizenship and 11.2% of civilian applications, McClatchy reported in May. The denial rate was also higher for military applicants during each quarter of fiscal year 2018. (In the last quarter of fiscal year 2017, civilian denials were higher than military denials.) USCIS does not track the reasons for denials, the agency told PolitiFact, adding that all military naturalization denials are reviewed by a supervisor. Service members or veterans applying for naturalization must meet all statutory requirements and also submit documentation from the military, showing that he or she served honorably and that any separation from service was under honorable conditions, USCIS said. McClatchy reported that policy changes under the Trump administration have complicated the naturalization process for service members. For instance, a new requirement said that only higher-ranking officers, colonel or above, can certify whether someone is serving or has served honorably. That made it difficult for troops far away from high-ranking officers, McClatchy’s report said. A May 2019 policy brief from the Migration Policy Institute said that ""in recent years, the military has come to see noncitizens as less of an asset and more of a risk."" Gabbard said that immigrant military service members applying for U.S. citizenship ""are getting rejected at higher numbers than those who are not veterans."" The latest available citizenship application data supports her claim. It checks out for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and for every quarter of 2018.

Republicans support Donald Trump, but not as much as he said
","President Donald Trump has a commanding hold on Republican voters, but it isn’t as high as he says. In a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of Republican lawmakers who threatened to block his planned tariffs against Mexico. ""I think if they do, it’s foolish,"" Trump said June 4. ""I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record. Can you believe that? Isn’t that something? I love records."" Trump does enjoy strong support among Republican voters. But no public poll backs up the stellar performance he touted. We emailed the White House to point us to the poll Trump relied on. We did not hear back. Looking at support among Republican voters, Trump’s highest number in the latest polls is 87% from Gallup. CNN comes in second at 86%. The other four are lower. All polls are based on surveys done at the end of May. No margin of error, among the polls that provide them, would be large enough to deliver the 94% that Trump claimed. Trump’s approval among Republicans has generally held in the mid-to-high 80s, which would qualify as robust. Gallup clocked in a slightly higher number of 90% in March and April. That sort of shift is within the normal variation in polling. We checked out whether Trump’s Republican approval was at an all-time high, both at this point in comparable tenures or all-time, as he said. At this point in his administration (around the 860-day mark), Trump’s approval comes in a bit behind George W. Bush, who held a 94% approval rating within his party, as did his father George H.W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office. Here’s the full picture, going back to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump once claimed that he had the highest polling numbers ""in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan."" We rated that False. Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln’s time. That is pure invention. For real record-setting, look to George W. Bush who, according to Gallup, won approval from 99% of Republicans in the month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Trump said, ""I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record."" While his numbers hold steady in the mid-to-high 80s, no poll puts him at 94%. Nor did the White House point to a poll with that level of support. Still, 87% or 89% approval is a strong showing. Where Trump went overboard was in saying he had set some kind of all-time record. That didn’t happen.

The post also features a photo of a person in what looks like an orange jail uniform. It’s been shared more than 95,000 times, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here are the facts. There are two suspects in the shooting. One of the suspects is 16 years old and was listed on a court docket as Maya Elizabeth McKinney. But a lawyer for the suspect referred to McKinney as ""Alec McKinney,"" and the judge addressed the suspect as ""Mr. McKinney,"" Reuters reported on May 7. ""Denver’s ABC television affiliate, citing an unidentified police source, has reported that the younger suspect identified as transgender and had been bullied for it,"" the wire service said in its dispatch the day after the shooting. Some stories, such as this one from the Washington Post, don’t mention that McKinney is transgender. But others do, including these from Buzzfeed, The Wall Street Journal, and The Denver Post. However, the person in the photo that appears in the Facebook post is the other suspect, 18-year-old Devon Erickson, who has not been identified as transgender. And it was this suspect that the New York Post reported on May 8 shared social media posts critical of President Donald Trump and Christians while praising former president Barack Obama. ""You know what I hate? All these Christians who hate gays, yet in the bible, it says in Deuteronomy 17:12-13, if someone doesn’t do what their priest tells them to do, they are supposed to die,"" the New York Post says Erickson wrote on Facebook in May 2014. ""It has plenty of crazy stuff like that. But all they get out of it is ‘ewwwwww gays."" On May 9, the New York Post reported on online posts from McKinney, who, the paper said, is undergoing a female-to-male transition. McKinney tweeted about taking prescription drugs, disliking STEM students, and self-harm. The story doesn’t mention Trump or religion. The Facebook post appears to have conflated the two suspects in the shooting, drawing details about the gender identity of one of the suspects and references to Trump and Christians from the other’s social media posts. Media outlets have also reported that one of the suspects is transgender and that the other posted political missives online. How these insights into the suspects are related to the shooting is unclear. Citing this May 8 Daily Mail story, the New York Post reported that a friend of Erickson and McKinney wrote online that the two were troubled and didn’t get the help they needed. ""Devon did what he did because he’s a liberal or to make a statement,"" the friend said, according to the Daily Mail. ""He did it due to internal struggles. They’re both struggling with mental health issues and this is a time for awareness."" About McKinney, the friend said: ""Had people supported him in the way that he needed and deserved, he would not have struggled so much that he got pushed over the edge.""

Kirsten Gillibrand wrong about Donald Trump and bump stocks
","When Chris Wallace of Fox News asked Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand what can be done to stop shootings like the one in Virginia Beach, she wasted no time in laying blame on President Donald Trump. Gillibrand focused on bump stocks, the gun accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one — that is, from a weapon that requires a trigger pull to fire each round to one that shoots a steady stream of rounds with one trigger pull. Semi-automatic rifles are legal, but fully automatic weapons — sometimes called machine guns — are largely not. Bump stocks gained wide attention after they were cited as a major reason why a shooter in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017, was able to kill 58 people and injure almost 900 attending a music festival. In the June 2 town hall, Gillibrand said, ""Stop being beholden to the (National Rifle Association), like President Trump is. … Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No, because the NRA came crashing down and said, ‘Don’t you dare do any restrictions on our guns around this country.’"" A reader asked us to fact-check Gillibrand’s statement. We found that Gillibrand’s statement flagrantly disregarded the facts. Asked in the town hall about how to curb mass shootings, her answer was to attack — incorrectly — an instance in which Trump actually accomplished a goal that gun critics had sought, and where the administration directly disregarded the NRA, which had opposed an all-out ban. Bump stocks are now illegal in the United States, and it’s directly because of actions by the Trump administration. ""The senator is wrong,"" said Harold Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociologist who has studied gun policy. Once the role of bump stocks in the Las Vegas shooting became clear, Trump said he’d be open to banning the device. Just over two months after the Las Vegas shooting, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives began the formal regulatory process of reviewing whether bump stocks should be banned. Trump publicly reiterated his support on Feb. 20, 2018, signing a memorandum ""directing"" the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all such devices. The final rule was published on Dec. 18, 2018, with acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker announcing that bump stocks ""fall within the definition of ‘machine gun’ under federal law, as such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger."" The NRA issued a statement after the final rule saying that it opposed an outright ban and had asked for an amnesty period in the rule. Neither request became part of the regulation. The Firearms Policy Coalition and individual pro-gun critics (but not the NRA) challenged the new rule in court, but the critics of the ban lost at the U.S. District Court level in February 2019. The following month, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, allowing the ban to go into effect. The penalty for owning a bump stock is now up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine per violation. The ATF has a web page on how to destroy bump stocks in a way that satisfies the new rules, and one major seller of bump stocks, RW Arms, turned over its remaining inventory to the ATF to be shredded on March 26, 2019. A shooting instructor demonstrates the grip on an AR-15 rifle fitted with a ""bump stock"" at a gun club in North Carolina in 2017. (AP) Groups that favor stronger gun laws applauded the move, though some criticized how long it took and the fact that the ban was done through the regulatory process rather than by a law passed by Congress. Gillibrand’s national press secretary Evan Lukaske said the senator was referring to the NRA’s opposition to — and seeming ability to block — congressional legislation on bump stocks, and the 10-month lag between Trump’s expression of openness until the final rule was published. ""Sen. Gillibrand acknowledges that five months after the Las Vegas shooting, President Trump issued a ban that was enacted in December 2018, much to the NRA's chagrin,"" Lukaske said. ""Her statement supports the larger point, that the NRA uses money and influence to control members of the Republican Party, and prevent common sense gun reforms that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support."" Such concerns, however, do not get at the point of her town hall remark. She left the strong impression that bump stocks are still legal, and that Trump went back on his word. Both assertions are flatly incorrect. Gillibrand said, ""Remember after the shooting in Las Vegas, (President Donald Trump) said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to ban the bump stocks.’ Did he ban the bump stocks? No."" Gillibrand’s effort to turn Trump into a villain on bump stocks flies in the face of the facts. In reality, bump stocks were a rare area in which Trump accomplished a goal sought by gun critics, and his administration’s rule was more forceful than what the NRA had sought. Thanks to the efforts of Trump and his administration, owning bump stocks is now a felony.

No, Thomas Jefferson did not say big government is ‘strong enough to take everything you have’
","A post that recently popped up on social media is putting words in the mouth of former President Thomas Jefferson. The quote goes: ""A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to officials at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, the words cannot be found in his writings. ""Neither this quotation nor any of its variant forms has been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson,"" Monticello says on its website. That said, several politicians have used the phrase in speeches and interviews throughout the years, often without attribution. According to The Big Apple, an online dictionary run by etymologist Barry Popik, different variations of the quote have been around since at least the 1950s. Its first known appearance in print, Popik found, was an unattributed entry in the 1952 book ""Remember These Things"" by Paul Harvey. It showed up a year later, also unattributed, in the Texas newspaper, ""The Morning Avalanche."" In 1954, then-U.S. Rep. Gerald Ford used a similar line and repeated it as president in 1974. (Ford’s assistant, Robert Hartmann, reportedly said that Ford claimed to have heard the phrase ""early in his political career"" from Harvard McClain at the Economic Club in Chicago.) The list goes on from there, with variations of the phrase being attributed to Ford, others or no one at all. A Facebook post claims Thomas Jefferson once said or wrote that ""a government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have."" But the quote could not be found in any of Jefferson’s writings and appears to have originated sometime around the 1950s.

"['National', 'Climate Change', 'Michael Bennet']","
Michael Bennet is right that a majority say the effects of global warming are happening
","Over 90% of publishing climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is running for president, said in a CNN town hall May 30 that public perception is consistent with that consensus. ""The vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it,"" he said. We looked into this claim and found that Bennet, who recently rolled out a plan for 2020 to address climate change, is right that most Americans say climate change is taking place. But polls indicate that the public shows a bit less conviction when asked whether government should address the issue, though much seems to depend on how the questions are asked. Let’s take a look. Bennet’s climate change plan, which was released in May, includes a goal for the United States to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Bennet based his claim on a politics and global warming report published in April by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. The Yale and GMU programs use social science to help communicate climate change to the public. The report states that 70% of U.S. registered voters said global warming is happening. A majority ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" support investments in renewable energy research and infrastructure (87%), regulating pollution (82%) and/or taxing pollution (72%). Also, nearly four in ten voters said a candidate’s position on global warming will be very important when they decide who they vote for in the 2020 presidential election. We looked at other polls about climate change and found that responses vary on whether or not Americans believe climate change is real. One way to analyze the first part of Bennet’s statement is to examine Americans’ views on the timeline of the effects of global warming. A Gallup poll conducted in March found that 59% of Americans said that the effects of global warming have already begun and 66% believe it’s mostly due to pollution from human activities. The percentage of people polled who believe the effects of global warming are already underway has fluctuated over the years, but it’s steadily climbed from 49% in 2011 to 52% in 2012 to where we are today. Gallup does note differences in how Americans view the issue based on their political leanings. Among those who describe themselves as conservative, only 25% were classified as concerned believers, compared to 81% of liberals and 56% of moderates.   So, is Bennet also on point when he says that most Americans support doing something about climate change? The results are mixed. A Quinnipiac University poll released in 2018 found that the majority of American voters, 69%, are ""somewhat"" or ""very"" concerned about climate change. But a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January found that only 44% of Americans said global climate change should be a top priority for President Donald Trump and Congress. It was low on a list of 18 issues prioritized by the adults surveyed. However, the environment, categorized as a separate issue, was at No. 8, behind the economy, health care, education, terrorism, Social Security, Medicare and the poor and needy. A Gallup poll conducted last year found that 62% of Americans think the U.S. government is doing too little to protect the environment. The majority of Americans support governmental policies aimed at mitigating climate change such as spending more on solar and wind power (76%), setting higher emissions and pollution standards for businesses and industry (74%) and imposing mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions (67%). John Kotcher, a research assistant professor at GMU’s Center for Climate Change Communication, told PolitiFact that views on climate change among scientists and the general public vary in part because people have not always seen the issue as one that directly affects them. ""Historically, climate change has been framed as an environmental issue that’s distant in time and space — that it’s a problem for plants, penguins and polar bears,"" he said. Kotcher helped conduct the survey Bennet’s campaign referenced. Bennet said that ""the vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it."" The polls we reviewed show that the majority of Americans do think the effects of climate change are currently taking place and that they are concerned about it. While one poll found that less than half of Americans believe Congress and Trump should make it a top priority, other polls show that when questioned about specific policies to address global warming, a majority of Americans say they support action. We rate Bennet’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809755C780>],/factchecks/2019/jun/06/michael-bennet/michael-bennet-right-majority-say-effects-global-w/

Taylor Swift says most Democrats, independents, Republicans back nondiscrimination for LGBTQ people
","Taylor Swift has 118 million followers on Instagram, the photo and video sharing app. Nearly 850,000 of them liked a letter she posted there supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. The letter, which drew national news coverage, was to Republican Lamar Alexander, one of the U.S. senators from Swift’s home state of Tennessee. She asked him to vote for the federal Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. Then she wrote: ""A recent study shows that over 64 percent of Tennesseeans support laws for protection of LGBTQ people against discrimination. Reports are that the majority of Americans across ALL parties favor these nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ people (liberals at 81%, moderates at 76% and conservatives at 55%)."" We wondered if, on a national level, LGBTQ support is as strong as Swift says it is. Swift relies on a poll done by PRRI (Public Religion Research Institute), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. It’s the most recent poll we found that’s on point. Polling was done in 40,000 landline and cellphone interviews from March 2018 through December 2018 under the supervision of Pennsylvania-based SSRS, a survey research firm. Several polling experts told us that PRRI specializes in polling in this topic area and that PRRI and SSRS do solid work. The key question was: ""Do you strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing?"" In releasing the poll results in March 2019, PRRI said: ""Majorities of Democrats (79%), independents (70%) and Republicans (56%) say they favor laws that would shield LGBT people from various kinds of discrimination. … Majorities of liberals (81%), moderates (76%) and conservatives (55%) all favor nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people."" So, based on the poll, Swift is correct in saying that majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans support nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people, at least when it comes to jobs, public accommodations and housing. And she accurately cites figures for liberals, moderates and conservatives. (The polling did not ask about queer people — the ""Q"" part of Swift’s statement. The Human Rights Campaign says that regarding gender, queer people ""may see themselves as being both male and female, neither male nor female or as falling completely outside these categories."") ""Americans generally do not want to discriminate, so the results aren’t surprising,"" American Enterprise Institute senior fellow and polling expert Karlyn Bowman told us. ""That’s not the same thing, of course, as supporting a particular policy or behavior."" We did find some other recent polls that asked more specific questions, with varying results when it comes to Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released in May 2019 found that the vast majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents said employers should not be allowed to fire someone based on their sexual orientation or sexual identity. But a PRRI poll released in June 2018 found that a majority of Republicans favor allowing business owners to claim religious exemptions from serving gay and lesbian customers. ""Firing someone based on orientation is clearly unacceptable to nearly everyone,"" said Kathleen Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. ""Other sorts of laws might not be perceived as discrimination, allowing some people to support the principle of nondiscrimination protections, but not support some specific policies."" The Equality Act pushed by Swift would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in areas including public accommodations and facilities, education, federal funding, employment, housing, credit and the jury system. It was approved in May 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats. But the Washington Post reported that the measure is unlikely to get a vote in the Republican-led Senate, and that the White House has signaled that President Donald Trump would veto the measure if it ever reached his desk. Swift says: ""The majority of Americans across all parties support these nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ people (liberals at 81%, moderates at 76% and conservatives at 55%)."" Swift accurately describes the results of the latest poll we found that’s on point, which asked about support for laws that would protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people against discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing. She made the statement in seeking support for a federal bill that would prohibit discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, and the poll did not ask about that bill. We rate Swift’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809756DD40>],/factchecks/2019/jun/05/taylor-swift/taylor-swift-says-most-democrats-independents-repu/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
No, more people will not enter the United States illegally than be born here in a year
","During an appearance on ""Lou Dobbs Tonight"" on the Fox Business Network last month, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the current crisis at the border is at a level he has ""never seen before."" Patrick’s segment appeared after one about the birth rate from 2017, when more than 3.8 million births were recorded across the country, the lowest number in 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This will stagger you,"" Patrick said, referencing Dobbs’ report on birth rates. ""We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year."" ""We’re on pace to apprehend a million people crossing into this country illegally. Any law enforcement person you talk to — local sheriff, our state police — they will tell you that they catch one out of four or five. That means if we catch 1 million, there are 4 million others."" Patrick’s claim is wrong. No matter how generously we slice and dice the figures, his math does not add up. Patrick under on apprehension estimate Alejandro Garcia, spokesman for Patrick, pointed us to a few different sources for this claim: news reports about birth rates, projected border apprehensions for the coming year and a study that suggested the population of people in the country illegally is significantly higher than previously recorded. Let’s start with projected border apprehensions. The ABC News article Garcia provided reports that border authorities are ""predicting the number of undocumented migrants stopped at the southern border could reach as high as 1 million by the end of the year, potentially doubling last year’s level."" The only problem here, as the article notes, is that this estimate ""includes illegal crossings and people arriving at ports of entry."" Similar claims have been made by federal officials in the past, with the same caveat, that their estimate counts both apprehensions of individuals crossing illegally and law enforcement encounters with individuals at ports of entry who are looking to enter the country legally. A Fact-check.org analysis found that a more accurate estimate is that federal authorities are on track to make 643,306 apprehensions this fiscal year, the time frame U.S. Customs and Border Protection looks at when tracking apprehensions. That number was based on average apprehensions from the first five months of the fiscal year, which spans from October to September. There are two more months of data available now, which has boosted the monthly average. Officials are now on track to make about 789,000 apprehensions this fiscal year. It’s also possible to come up with a similar estimate for the calendar year; Patrick didn’t specify which period he was considering. Given the monthly average of about 76,700 apprehensions for the first four months of the year, officials look to be on track to make about 920,400 apprehensions this calendar year. Patrick wrong on 1 out of 4 (or 5) claim Garcia pointed to a study published by researchers at the Yale University School of Management to support the last part of Patrick’s claim: that agents apprehend just one in every four or five individuals who attempt to enter the country illegally. The study looked to calculate how many undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and it found a mean population estimate of 22.1 million in 2016  — ""essentially double the current widely accepted estimate"" of 11.3 million. But Edward Kaplan, a professor at Yale University who authored the study, said the higher population count does not mean individuals are crossing the border at the rate Patrick suggested. ""We do not estimate that 5 million people have crossed the border illegally in any single year during the time of our study,"" Kaplan said in an email, noting that the highest number of border crossings reported in the study was in 2000, when an estimated 2.6 million people crossed illegally. An important aside here: Many experts have raised concerns about the validity of the Yale study, including researchers at the Migration Policy Institute who said its findings were based on ""seriously flawed assumptions"" about migration patterns and Census data. Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, was among those researchers who criticized the results. He called its conclusions ""unsupportable"" in a blog post for the center, which advocates for low levels of immigration.   We asked Camarota to take a look at Patrick’s claim. Even though there has been an increase in apprehensions from previous years, Camarota said, far fewer than 4 million people will cross the border illegally this year. He said even if Patrick’s claim was limited just to births of native-born Americans (which Camarota estimated to be at about 3.1 million in 2017) or if he included estimates for people who overstay their visas in his calculation of illegally crossings, the ratio is off. ""The bottom line is that it doesn’t seem possible you could get to 4 million,"" Camarota said, referencing the number of births recorded in 2017. The Department of Homeland Security offers estimates for apprehension rates at the border and for how many people successfully enter the country illegally, based in part on observable data reported by agents on the ground and on statistical models. A Border Security Metrics report published in February used two different calculations to estimate that agents at the southern border apprehended about 65% to 75% of people who attempted to enter the country illegally in fiscal year 2017. A separate report published by the Office of Immigration Statistics in 2017 said agents apprehend 55% to 85% of all individuals attempting to cross, depending on the specific estimate. The DHS report also includes estimates for ""got aways,"" people who were observed successfully crossing the border while evading apprehension, and ""total successful unlawful entries,"" a number calculated through statistical models and observable data. There were an estimated 104,000 ""got aways"" in 2017 (an 83% decrease from 615,000 in 2006) and 160,000 ""total successful unlawful entries"" in 2017 (a 92% decrease from 2.1 million in 2000). Our ruling Patrick said, ""We will have more people enter our country illegally than were born in this country in one year."" There is no evidence to support Patrick’s claim. While it is hard to say exactly how many people successfully enter the country illegally while evading detection, it’s safe to say that the real number is significantly smaller than Patrick’s 5 million. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Footnote: This isn’t the first time Patrick has made a claim like this. In 2014, he suggested that more people are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a week ""than are born in Texas each week."" That was True (at the time).",[<zip object at 0x00000280970649C0>],/factchecks/2019/jun/05/dan-patrick/no-more-people-will-not-enter-united-states-illega/

""The design of the first SOLO cup was very intentional. When SOLO designed the iconic red cup in 1976, every detail served a purpose and still does to this day,"" Burrage wrote in an email. ""The rolled rim makes it easier to sip your drink, but also prevents a stack of SOLO cups from sticking together. The indented base makes the cup sturdier and less likely to crack.

Kirsten Gillibrand did not say undocumented immigrants should get Social Security benefits for free
","Take a quote out of context, rearrange some words and pepper in some misinformation and you have full-blown fake news. That’s what happened with a comment Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York made during a March stop on her campaign for president. A viral Facebook post misrepresents Gillibrand’s words, claiming she said illegal immigrants should receive Social Security benefits without paying into the system. The post misspells Gillibrand’s first name as ""Kristen"" and then goes on to claim that she said, ""Social Security must (be) expanded to illegal immigration, it’s their right.""

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim takes Gillibrand’s words of out context. What she actually suggested was that immigrants have a ""right"" to pay into taxes, Social Security, local school systems and should be provided a pathway to citizenship. During a March 19, 2019 campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa, Gillibrand discussed a variety of issues and, at one point, a woman in the crowd asked: ""Would you please talk a little about immigration ... what you’ve done, what you see, both broadly, the Dreamers, the people detained at for-profit prisons, separated children, and the asylum seekers?"" Gillibrand took a few minutes to answer and eventually said (around the 19:45 minute mark in a Facebook live video of the event): ""First, we need comprehensive immigration reform. If you are in this country now, you must have the right to pay into Social Security, to pay your taxes, to pay into the local school system and to have a pathway to citizenship. That must happen."" Soon after she made those comments, former Arkansas Gov. and conservative pundit Mike Huckabee appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and mischaracterized her words. ""If a person comes here illegally… let’s not only give them grandma’s Social Security, let’s toss in a car,"" Huckabee said. ""I hope Kirsten Gillibrand has to go out and talk to people in their 70s who can barely afford food and tell them they’re going to not get their Social Security raised because we’re going to be giving it to people who broke into this country illegally."" That wasn’t the only spin on Gillibrand’s remarks. Other outlets such as Breitbart, the Washington Examiner also spread the interpretation that Gillibrand suggested undocumented immigrants should receive Social Security benefits without contributing. It didn’t take long for the claim to turn up in posts on social media. But as one Los Angeles Times analysis addressed, Gillibrand wasn’t advocating to give away the program’s benefits but to allow immigrants, ""of whatever status, to pay for those benefits openly, via payroll and income taxes, and to receive the benefits they’ve earned."" The analysis said many undocumented immigrants already pay into the system without receiving any benefits. According to a 2013 Social Security Administration report, 1.8 million undocumented immigrants (the report employs the term ""unauthorized"" immigrants) worked and contributed to Social Security in 2010 using a Social Security number that was either fabricated or that belonged to someone else. Not including visa holders and others, the report estimated that a total of 3.1 million undocumented immigrants were working and paying into Social Security taxes that year. ""While unauthorized immigrants worked and contributed as much as $13 billion in payroll taxes to the OASDI program in 2010, only about $1 billion in benefit payments during 2010 are attributable to unauthorized work,"" the report said. ""Thus, we estimate that earnings by unauthorized immigrants result in a net positive effect on Social Security financial status generally, and that this effect contributed roughly $12 billion to the cash flow of the program for 2010."" Meredith Kelly, Gillibrand’s campaign spokesperson, told PolitiFact Gillibrand’s words are being mischaracterized. ""Sen. Gillibrand simply made a factual statement: Undocumented immigrants already do pay into Social Security and income taxes, but get none of the benefits that they would as citizens,"" Kelly wrote in an email. ""Under her plan for comprehensive immigration reform, they would have a pathway to earn their citizenship and those benefits that they already pay into. This is deliberate misinformation that has already been debunked."" A Facebook post claims Sen. Gillibrand said ""Social Security must (be) expanded to illegal immigration, it’s their right,"" suggesting that immigrants should receive those benefits for free.

Biden highlights the nation’s lack of school psychologists
","Outlining his education platform on May 28, former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden put the spotlight on an often-ignored mental health problem: kids’ access to mental health care. In a policy paper released at a town hall in Houston, Biden said, ""The current school psychologist to student ratio in this country is roughly 1,400 to 1, while experts say it should be at most 700 to 1."" That matters because children’s mental health care issues are often detected in school settings. The school psychologists provide the first line of treatment and often set in motion any necessary referrals to specialists. Their role is complicated by the fact that, beyond school walls, there is a serious shortage of adolescent and child psychiatrists. It’s a problem, Biden said, given that ""too many of our children are not getting the mental health care they need from a trained professional."" This talking point about school psychologist ratios suggests a glaring gap in health care services, and in an area where need is only growing. With that in mind, we decided to dig in. We reached out to Biden’s press team for comment but never heard back. A controversial figure Biden appears to be using a number promoted by the National Association of School Psychologists, a Washington-based trade group. That statistic comes from the organization’s 2015 membership survey, which found a 1,381-to-1 ratio of students to psychologists — which is ""roughly 1,400."" But this tally is not ironclad.   Though NASP sent the survey to a nationally representative sample, the requirement that participants send back responses affects the results of such a survey. ""There are always limitations when you have a process of self-reporting. Those limitations are recognized,"" said Eric Rossen, NASP’s director of professional development and standards. ""For now, this is the best data we have. … It’s not perfect, but it’s the best there is."" There are other numbers and sources to consider, too. The Department of Education sent us its data from the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey. It found about 49 million kids enrolled in public schools, and, nationally, about 44,210 full-time psychologists employed by schools. That yields a ratio of roughly 1,115-to-1 — still nowhere near what experts say is appropriate, but slightly less stark than the 1,400 figure. This is at least in part because DOE’s survey does not differentiate between a school psychologist —a specific discipline within the field — and any other kind of psychologist a school might employ. This category could include specialties such as clinical, developmental, cognitive or child psychology, among others. The DOE tracks the extent to which schools employ guidance counselors, nurses, psychologists, social workers, speech therapists and ""other professional staff."" (If one counted those, it would yield an even more favorable ratio.) Do these distinctions matter? NASP says yes, arguing that school psychologists are trained in a way that gives them specific, distinct advantages in navigating the educational system — for instance, helping teachers adapt their work to better educate kids with learning disorders — and that they better understand school-specific concerns like discipline, violence prevention and helping families adapt to a school culture. Still, it’s not a settled issue. ""A school psychologist is great. I would even say a counselor, a therapist, a social worker — there are any number of potential therapists that have the skills and can detect these issues and refer,"" said Dr. Brian Greenfield, a child psychiatrist who directs the emergency psychiatry service at the Montreal Children's Hospital, and who has researched children’s mental health in the United States. A growing need, but no one solution That said, whichever number you look at, Biden’s bigger point appears true — children don’t have enough opportunities to get mental health care in schools. Biden’s 700-1 aspirational ratio also comes from an analysis by NASP, Rossum said. The group looked at previous surveys, finding that school psychologists were best able to care for students when the ratio hovered between at least 500-to-1 and 700-to-1. Both the 1,115 and 1,400 ratios mask wide national disparities. DOE’s data suggests that more than 13 million students go to school without any psychologist on staff. More than 1 million students go to schools that not only do not have a psychologist on staff, but also no guidance counselor or social worker. For its part, NASP’s data shows that in some parts of the country, the ratio can be as high as 1 school psychologist per 4,000 students. And the consequences are significant. Evidence suggests children are experiencing increased rates of mental health problems. For instance, research published in April found that the number of kids reporting suicidal thoughts in the emergency room went up significantly between 2007 and 2015. (Greenfield, the Montreal psychiatrist, co-authored that paper.) Preventive mental health care could help address this trend. Most students who receive this care get at least their first assessment in schools. And if there isn’t someone on hand to provide it, they probably go without. That said, Greenfield noted, the school psychologist is only one part of a team. Lots of school employees — teachers, guidance counselors and administrators — could be trained to notice when something is wrong. The next step is likely more crucial, he said: referring the child to a clinic or other specialized setting for mental health care. That brings its own set of challenges, like confronting the shortage of pediatric psychologists nationally. ""Bravo to our politicians that have this in their heads and want to address it, but we can’t expect one school psychologist to be able to do it all, even if you increase the ratio in the school,"" he said. Our rating Biden’s specific claim about school psychologist-to-student ratios is correct, and it reflects a substantial problem for adolescent and pediatric mental health. But focusing on school psychologists alone doesn't encompass the entire issue.  And given the broader point he is making — that many kids cannot access mental health care in schools — his statement would benefit from more context.  Children may not have a ""school psychologist,"" but may still attend a school where another kind of psychologist or mental health professional is employed. That means they can still get care from a ""trained professional,"" even though the provider doesn’t have the same level of specialty training. Biden’s claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A29BDC0>],/factchecks/2019/jun/05/joe-biden/biden-highlights-nations-lack-school-psychologists/
"['Immigration', 'North Carolina', 'Garland Tucker']","
Garland Tucker mostly wrong about Tillis supporting 'amnesty'
","Immigration policy is sure to be a top issue in North Carolina’s 2020 Republican primary for U.S. Senate. For Garland Tucker III, it is part of the reason why he is challenging incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis. When Tucker appeared on The Sean Hannity Show May 8 to announce his campaign for Tillis’ seat in 2020, he said he was most concerned with Tillis’ ""weak"" immigration policies. ""He co-sponsored a bill that not only provided amnesty, but provided a clear path to citizenship for illegal immigrants,"" Tucker said on the radio show. PolitiFact reached out to Tucker’s campaign to ask what he meant. Carter Wrenn, spokesman for Tucker, said Tucker was referring to the 2017 ""Solution for Undocumented Children through Careers, Employment, and Defending our Nation,"" or Succeed Act. As it turns out, the Succeed Act would only pertain to people who were brought to the country illegally as minors. They are sometimes known as DREAMers, a term derived from the Dream Act, a legislative bill that was first introduced in Congress in 2001 but never passed. It’s an increasingly vocal group of young people who argue that after being raised and educated in the U.S., they have nowhere else to call home. Tillis sponsored the legislation as a more GOP-friendly immigration solution for that group of immigrants, as compared to the bipartisan Dream Act or President Obama’s DACA policy. Tillis’ bill did not pass the Senate. The Tillis campaign said the Succeed Act was introduced as part of a larger plan to reach a compromise on border security. When the bill was introduced, Tillis and another sponsor, Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma stressed that the bill should not be passed if it was not paired with a solution for the border. ""Sen. Tillis does not support amnesty. What Sen. Tillis has strongly supported is President Trump’s plan to secure our borders, modernize our immigration system, and stop illegal immigration,"" Tillis’ campaign manager, Luke Blanchat, said. The word ""amnesty"" has been the subject of many a fact-check by PolitiFact — including checks about Sen. Marco Rubio and Florida candidate Adam Putnam’s stances on immigration — but we wanted to see if there was any truth to Tucker’s claim. WHAT IS THE SUCCEED ACT? The Succeed Act is comprised of five steps to citizenship that would occur over at least a 15-year timeline. The first step of the bill is to meet all eligibility requirements for conditional status. In order to even qualify for this, an immigrant must have entered the United States illegally before age 16 and lived there continuously since June 15, 2012, when DACA was announced. They also would have to have been younger than 31 on June 15, 2012. DACA refers to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that gave young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children the opportunity to work, study and get a driver’s license without fear of deportation. Under the Succeed Act, immigrants are required to obtain a high school diploma or equivalent, pass a criminal background check, submit biometric and biographic data to the Department of Homeland Security, pay off any existing tax liabilities, be of ""good moral character"" and sign a waiver from future immigration benefits if they violate the terms of their status. If a minor had applied for and received conditional permanent resident status, they would have to reapply when they turned 18 and would be required to either maintain gainful employment for 48 out of 60 months, earn a post-secondary or vocational degree, or serve honorably in the U.S. military for at least three years. After five years, they would then have to apply yet again, and if they had maintained conditional permanent residence for 10 years, they would finally have the opportunity to apply to be lawful permanent residents. After five years of lawful permanent residence, they could apply for naturalization and become U.S. citizens. Despite the many restrictions specified in the Succeed Act, Carter Wrenn, a spokesman for Tucker, said that it still qualifies as amnesty because ""amnesty is a pathway to citizenship."" The real question is: what is amnesty? And does the Succeed Act fit the bill? WHAT IS AMNESTY? Amnesty means a pardon for a large group of people, and in the context of immigration, it has become a politically charged word. Amnesty does not have a ""black and white definition,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Migration Policy Institute. Some people say that any path to legal status for migrants is amnesty, and others say there is more to it. However, she said, compared to many other immigration reform proposals, the Succeed Act was one of the narrower options. Steven Camarota, the director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for less immigration, said that immigration amnesty is just like any other amnesty. In the simplest terms, he said, amnesty is forgiveness for a crime. Most amnesties have requirements that ultimately result in forgiveness, so having stringent requirements does not disqualify the Succeed Act from being considered an amnesty. ""Every parking ticket amnesty, every tax amnesty and every other amnesty always had requirements,"" he said. ""The 1986 IRCA amnesty did."" IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan, usually serves as the standard for amnesty in immigration policy. In addition to a few minimal requirements, the bill said illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents, or green card holders, as long as they could prove they were in the U.S. by Jan. 1, 1982. This means that any immigrant who had been in the country continuously for about four years when the bill was signed into law in 1986, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated ""good moral character"" would be granted legal status. In comparison, the Succeed Act would not qualify an immigrant for permanent resident status unless they qualified as a minor who entered the country before they were 16, lived there continuously since and were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012. They must have also already applied for, obtained and sustained conditional legal status for 10 years. ""I consider (Tucker’s claim) a deeply misleading use of the word amnesty,"" said Edward Alden, the Bernard L. Schwartz senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank. Alden said that the Succeed Act was written for children who were brought here by their parents while they were still minors. Since amnesty is the act of forgiveness of a crime, and these children were legally unable to commit a crime, they could not be found legally responsible for their actions or even need amnesty, Alden said. Compared to other immigration proposals, such as the Reagan-era IRCA, the Succeed Act is far more restrictive, and it only covers a group of people who fall under a gray area in the law. OUR RULING Tucker argued that Tillis’ Succeed Act was pro-amnesty because it gave illegal immigrants a clear path to citizenship. He is correct that the bill would help pave the way for citizenship for a select number of immigrants in the country illegally, but it only concerns those who were minors when they first entered the country. It would give them the opportunity to apply for citizenship only after a long and highly restrictive 15-year process. Additionally, Tillis said the bill should not pass unless it was combined with a border security plan. Tucker did not specify that the Succeed Act only pertained to that group, so his claim gave the false impression that the proposed bill would grant a general amnesty for illegal immigration.

Donald Trump said the UK is America’s largest trading partner. It ranks 5th
","At a business roundtable on his visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump said there was a great opportunity to expand the trading relationship between the two nations. ""We are your largest partner,"" Trump said June 4. ""You’re our largest partner. A lot of people don’t know that. I was surprised. I made that statement yesterday, and a lot of people said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know that.’ But that’s the way it is."" Trump was right that the United States is Britain’s biggest trade partner, according to British government data. But he’s very wrong that the United Kingdom is America’s largest trading partner.  We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. U.S. trade data shows that in combined trade — the sum of exports and imports for goods and services — the United Kingdom ranks fifth, behind China, Canada, Mexico and Japan. The United Kingdom moves up into fourth in terms of exports. And it falls to sixth in terms of goods and services imported to the United States. Any way you look at it, University of Notre Dame finance professor Jeffrey Bergstrand said Trump has it wrong. ""The U.K. is not our largest trading partner, whether measured by U.S. bilateral imports from the U.K., exports to the U.K., or the sum of the two,"" Bergstrand said. ""It is a large partner, but not nearly among the largest."" Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the numbers are unambiguous, calling the United Kingdom ""a small partner"" of the United States. The United Kingdom’s combined trade with the United States comes out on top compared with the other large European economies. But in the context of America cutting a separate trade deal with the United Kingdom in a post-Brexit era, it is worth noting that Germany, France and Italy are part of the European Union trading bloc. Their combined trade with the United States dwarfs that of the United Kingdom. Trump said that the United Kingdom is the largest trading partner of the United States That’s wrong. The United Kingdom ranks fifth, behind China, Canada, Mexico and Japan in combined trade with the United States. As a market for American exports, it ranks fourth after Canada, Mexico and China.
