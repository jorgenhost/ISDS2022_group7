Donald Trump calls out Ted Cruz ad about Trump bulldozing a widow's home as 'false advertising'
","Donald Trump’s first words Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press were an attack on his biggest rival in the Iowa caucuses, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Before bringing on Trump, host Chuck Todd showed a new Cruz ad criticizing the real estate tycoon’s support for eminent domain, the government’s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects. The ad quotes Trump as saying, ""I think eminent domain is wonderful."" ""It made him rich — like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino,"" the ad says.  Trump launched into his critique right away. ""Good morning,"" said Trump in the clip, ""and I have to tell you his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get that house to build a major building that would have employed a tremendous numbers of people, but when the woman didn’t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it. So he’s got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down, it’s false advertising."" Todd said, ""Well, all right, the accusation was that that’s what you wanted to do."" Trump stood by his takedown: ""No, the accusation was that I did it, and I didn’t do it."" It turns out that both Cruz and Trump are stretching the truth about what happened with a widow’s home. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Trump saying Cruz has ""got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising."" Donald vs. Vera In a prior fact-check, we found Trump is sort of a poster boy for eminent domain (and he really did call the practice ""wonderful"" as recently as October.) Eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a government-run project. However, the Supreme Court’s decision in the 2005 case Kelo vs. New London, Conn., said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. Cruz’s ad references a period in the 1990s, prior to Kelo, when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking. Trump has said he offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn’t give up her home. In 1994, New Jersey’s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government in 1998. After losing the case, Trump gave up his plan to buy Coking’s house, telling the New York Daily News that he was ""no longer an interested buyer."" ""The bottom line is it's too bad for Atlantic City, but it's not too bad for me because I'm not interested in the property,"" Trump said. ""Nobody gets under my skin."" Coking’s supporters painted Trump as a villainous fat cat. Coking herself called him ""a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb."" Trump Plaza closed in September 2014 after struggling financially. Trump told the New York Times that ownership of Coking’s property would not have saved it. Back to Cruz’s ad, Trump has a point that it is misleading to imply he got ""rich"" after bulldozing an elderly widow’s home, given that Coking kept her property, and Trump never got anything out of it. But Trump exaggerated  when he said ""when the woman didn’t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it."" It took several years of failed negotiations and losing a lawsuit for him to decide he was no longer interested. Our ruling Trump says Cruz's ad has ""got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising."" If you read the ad as Trump does, he is right: The woman’s home was never destroyed as a result of eminent domain. He never got rich off of this deal because the case for eminent domain didn’t pan out. But that reading ignores another interpretation of Cruz’s point: Trump certainly tried to take over the property before the state Superior Court stepped in and ruled in the woman’s favor. Trump didn’t mention the years-long legal battle on Meet the Press.

What Donald Trump said about the Chinese inventing the 'hoax' of climate change
","For the second time in a week on national TV, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders attacked Republican candidate Donald Trump by citing Trump’s views on climate change. Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese,"" Sanders said Jan. 24 on NBC’s Meet the Press, echoing a similar statement he made in the Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C. (Watch the clip.) Did Trump really say that? He definitely tweeted that view once in 2012, though he has since distanced himself a bit from that theory. The clearest example comes from a tweet sent by Trump on Nov. 6, 2012. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  So Sanders certainly has evidence to support his claim. But Trump has somewhat backed off after Sanders' comments, calling the Chinese link a ""joke."" On Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump’s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, ""Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business."" So Trump has said his 2012 tweet was a joke. However, he has used the word ""hoax"" repeatedly in describing climate change, although he doesn’t always fault China. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a ""hoax"" Pants on Fire.) Most recently, on Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., ""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it."" That’s three times using ""hoax"" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since that 2012 tweet. On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, ""NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""  On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: ""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  That same day, he tweeted, ""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  Trump also called climate change a ""hoax"" on Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. Trump said on Sept. 24, 2015, on CNN’s New Day, ""I don’t believe in climate change."" And as we noted earlier, even when calling his earlier tweet a joke, Trump on Jan. 18, 2016, said that climate change ""is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change."" Our ruling Sanders said that Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese."" Trump did tweet that view in 2012. Whether Trump still feels that way is less clear. Asked about it recently, the real estate developer called it a joke. However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China.""

"['Rhode Island', 'Climate Change', 'Public Health', 'Environmental Justice League of R.I']","
Could fracking be worse for the climate than coal?
","The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island asserts that a new liquefied natural gas facility at Fields Point would accelerate climate change. The league’s position paper, posted at RIFuture.org, predicts that the storage facility proposed by National Grid would increase emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  ""While the oil and gas industry and their supporters like to present ‘natural gas’ as a ‘cleaner’ alternative or a ‘bridge fuel’ towards a renewable future, in reality, gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal,"" the paper says. So coal is cleaner than natural gas? The primary source for this material is Cornell University’s Robert W. Howarth, who has researched the climate-warming effects of methane that escapes into the atmosphere during the lifespan of fracked gas — from drilling to combustion.   In fracking, water is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale to free up gas or oil. Methane is released in the process. The impact of gases — methane from coal-burning plants and carbon dioxide from automobiles — depends on how potent they are and how long they remain in the atmosphere. Methane is 100 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas during the 10 years following its emission, according to Howarth. But methane stays in the atmosphere for a little more than a decade, while carbon dioxide, some say, hangs around for 1,000 years. The point, Howarth says, is that global warming has moved into a critical period. It’s urgent, he says, to stave off what he calls ""runaway global warming"" — a scenario he believes is possible during the next 20 years. In the short-term, fracked gas is worse for the climate than coal-burning. Reducing methane emissions, he wrote to us in an email, is the only way to keep atmospheric temperatures below the 2 degrees Celsius mark set during last month’s accord at the Paris climate conference. ""Methane emissions from fracked shale gas are horrendously high; so yes, it’s unequivocally worse for the climate than is coal,"" Howarth says. Other scientists disagree. In 2014, Raymond Pierrehumbert, a geoscientist at the University of Chicago, presented research that shows carbon dioxide ""is in a class by itself"" among greenhouse pollutants. The lifetime of carbon dioxide, says the paper, can’t even be characterized, and the gas’s significant greenhouse effects ""persist for millennia."" Pierrehumbert likens the greenhouse effects of carbon dioxide to irreversible lead poisoning and the effects of methane gas to a hangover. ""The important thing to note,"" Pierrehumbert was quoted as saying in an online post for The New York Times, ""is that essentially all of the climate effects of methane emissions disappear within 20 years of cessation of emissions. In this sense, the climate harm caused by methane leakage is reversible. In contrast, CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, ratcheting up the temperature irreversibly, at least out to several millennia."" In a different online Times post, Louis A. Derry, a Cornell colleague of Howarth’s, and an associate professor in earth and academic sciences, was quoted as saying that between 2007 and 2011, the climate impact from increased carbon dioxide was 13 times greater than that of methane. ""For me, the picture is pretty clear,"" he wrote, ""Displacing coal emissions with gas emissions is beneficial from a climate standpoint."" Another prominent climate expert, James Hansen of Columbia University, recently acknowledged that gas can serve as a temporary alternative to burning coal.  Does this mean natural gas, including fracked gas, is better for climate than coal-burning? Hansen said that he would need to know more about methane emissions. ""I'm not sure anybody has it nailed down,"" said Hansen, the former NASA climatologist whose testimony before Congress in 1988 helped spread awareness of global warming. If he had to guess, Hansen said, the negative side effects of producing natural gas are small compared to those of burning coal, ""or they could be made small."" Pierrehumbert, Howarth, Hansen agree on one thing: the safest path is to develop more renewable energy such as wind and solar. Our ruling The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island asserts: ""...in reality gas produced by fracking is worse for the climate than coal."" The chairman of the University of Rhode Island’s geosciences department, David Fast-Ovsky, agrees with Pierrehumbert and shares many of Howarth’s concerns, too. But without appropriate historical context, he says he isn’t ready to say that fracked gas is worse for the climate than coal. That is a very aggressive statement to make, he says. The Justice League did not qualify its claim with a nod to the transient nature of methane emissions. The league mentioned a concern about the potential for ""runaway climate change,"" but did not give the historical context behind Howarth’s assertion that a failure to control methane emissions in the short-term, within the next 20 years, makes fracked gas more damaging to climate. This is complicated stuff and the League oversimplified. ""The statement is not false and it’s not exactly true because it’s not well-constrained,"" says Fast-Ovsky. We agree with Fast-Ovsky. We rate this claim Half-True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/24/environmental-justice-league-ri-environmental-just/could-fracking-be-worse-climate-coal/

Jeff Judson claims Texas has the sixth-highest property taxes in the nation
","Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio faces two opponents in the March 2016 Republican primary, including Jeff Judson, a former San Antonio Tea Party director who is citing his record of ""fighting for low taxes and limited government"" in his campaign to represent District 121. A Dec.1, 2015, post on the Conservatives in Action blog quoted Judson saying, ""Texas has the 6th-highest property taxes in the country even though we have very conservative state officials, but not municipal officials."" Judson made the statement as a criticism of Straus' leadership. Texans are probably not paying the nation’s highest total taxes. According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, in 2012 Texas ranked 46th in state-local taxes per resident. Still, Judson made us wonder if Texas property taxes are comparatively steep. From the top, we noticed a couple of considerations distinguishing Texas. Property taxes might be higher here because unlike most states, Texas levies no state personal income tax. Notably too, unlike in some states, Texas property tax rates are set locally, not by the state, according to the Texas comptroller. That’s because the state lacks the constitutional authority to levy a property tax, according to the Texas Legislative Council. Generally under the current system, a county appraisal district does an annual property valuation, then each area city, county, school and special district (like hospital and road districts) set the respective tax rate necessary to raise the money needed to fund the related adopted budget. And according to U.S. Census Bureau data, property taxes in 2013, the latest year of available data, were the source of 81.6 percent of local tax revenue in Texas (the national average for this figure was 46.7 percent). When we asked Judson how he reached his Texas ranking, he directed us to an Aug. 13, 2015, post on his Facebook page that cited a blog post published that day by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on national, state and local tax policy. The foundation tends to argue for lower tax rates under the premise that, as a 2015 foundation report put it, "" a state with lower tax costs will be more attractive to business investment and more likely to experience economic growth."" The foundation’s August 2016 post, drawing on 2013 Census data, calculated and mapped the average amount of residential property tax paid as a percentage of home value state by state; the Texas rate proved lower only than those of New Jersey, Illinois, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Wisconsin and higher than the rates in the other 44 states. According to the post, written by Tax Foundation policy analyst Jared Walczak, the calculation only considered taxes on owner occupied-housing, not property taxes paid by businesses and those passed along from landlords to renters. So, according to the foundation’s calculations of home property taxes as a share of home values, property taxes in Texas in 2013 were the nation’s sixth-highest, as Judson said. Mindful the foundation looked at average residential taxes, we wondered about taking into account the variety of property values and tax rates around Texas. Were average rates alone fairly representative? Maybe so. A 2013 report on property taxes from the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, notes that in general, ""most of the variation (in property tax burdens) is due to variation across rather than within states;"" however, the researchers found that Texas was among three states with the most variation in property tax levels as a share of home prices. Another analysis We wondered how organizations other than the Tax Foundation went about comparing property taxes across the country. Texas advocates including Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities and Dale Craymer of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association suggested we consider a 2015 comparison study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy which calculates the rates of four different types of property taxes in the biggest city in each state, a rural city in each state, plus the country’s 50 largest cities overall. The report’s rankings suggest that Texas’s biggest cities (especially Houston, San Antonio, El Paso and Fort Worth) have had some of the highest urban homestead property taxes, industrial property taxes and apartment property taxes compared to large cities in other states. But what about on the county level? In some counties, like Jeff Davis, Pecos, Zapata, Starr, and Mason, homeowners paid less than 1 percent of their home value in annual property taxes from 2007 to 2011, while in Wilson, Bastrop and Travis counties, homeowners paid more than 1.5 percent of home values annually, according to the report. Residents of Bexar and Harris counties paid over 2 percent of their home values in property taxes in that period, according to Census data. The disparity between counties also comes through in real-dollar terms, although measures of taxes in terms of dollars paid can be distorted by the difference in home prices from county to county. Another map from the Tax Foundation used real dollar amounts and illustrates just how much property taxes can vary from county to county.  This one estimates the property tax burden using IRS data on the amount of real estate taxes people declare on their taxes. The counties paying the most in dollar values are Travis ($7,553), Kendall ($6,916) and Fort Bend ($6,813), while those paying the least are Dickens ($1,325), Stonewall ($1,425) and Hudspeth ($1,450). Lavine, asked how best to compare taxes between different jurisdictions within and across state lines, suggested we consider the share of personal income paid in taxes. Using IRS Statistics of Income data to calculate a rough average amount of real estate taxes paid as a percentage of average income reveals huge differences from county to county -- residents of Crane County pay as little as 2.9% of their income by this metric, while in Dallas County, it’s closer to 13.9% -- a large spread. So there’s a great deal of variation in the property tax rate within Texas whether it’s measured in percentage of income, percentage of home value, or raw dollar amounts. Yet another factor to think about when considering the property tax burden for the average Texan is the rate of home ownership. The Tax Foundation map Judson cited considered the percentage of home value that’s paid in property taxes on owner-occupied housing, but only 62.7% of housing in Texas is owner-occupied. Texas had the ninth-lowest rate of homeownership in the nation from 2010 to 2014, according to Census Bureau data. But lest one think property taxes are paid only by the rich, it should be noted that while the property tax burden in Texas is not necessarily shouldered by every taxpayer, it consumes a fairly equal percentage of family income across earning groups. The lowest 20% of earners pay 3.8% of their income in property taxes, the next quintile pays 2.8%, the middle quintile pays 2.6%, the fourth quintile pays 2.8%, the next 15% pays 3.2%, the next 5% pays 3.1%, and the top 1% pays 2.1%, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Because so much is determined on the local level, it’s worth noting that state legislation is limited in its ability to reduce the property tax burden, even through expanding exemptions. Although an amendment expanding exemptions for school district property taxes was approved by voters in November 2015, an analysis by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee found that such legislation was unlikely to lower property tax bills for many homeowners because increasing home values will offset whatever relief is provided by the legislation. Our Ruling Jeff Judson, in a criticism of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, said Texas has the sixth-highest property taxes in the nation. While it may be true that on average, Texas property taxes are the sixth-highest in the nation, the actual taxpayer burden on state residents varies hugely from county by county, making the average less representative. We rate this claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Ted Cruz ridiculously says Blue Cross Blue Shield 'cancelled' all individual health plans in Texas
","Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz revealed at a campaign stop that he lately lacks health coverage because, he proclaimed, an insurance provider governed by the Obamacare law announced it was ditching the Texas market. According to a video snippet of Cruz’s Jan. 21, 2016, Manchester, N.H., remarks, emailed to reporters by the Democratic National Committee, Cruz followed up general criticisms of the 2010 law requiring most Americans to have health coverage by saying: ""I’ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who has lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me. ""I don’t have health care right now,"" Cruz said. ""I had purchased an individual policy and Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31. So our health care got cancelled. We got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market. And so we’re in the process of finding another"" policy. The day we published this fact check, Cruz’s campaign separately said Cruz hadn’t realized when he spoke in New Hampshire that after Dec. 31, 2015, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas shifted Cruz’s family from the policy it was losing to an HMO plan. Bloomberg News quoted Catherine Frazier, a Cruz campaign spokeswoman, saying: ""On December 31, Blue Cross cancelled the PPO health insurance policy covering the Cruz family. That plan was purchased on the individual market, using a private insurance broker, with no government funds. At the time, the broker informed Sen. Cruz that the plan was being cancelled. The broker did not inform him that Blue Cross had automatically enrolled the family in another policy, an HMO with far more limited coverage. Based on this information, Sen. Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy. Frazier further said Cruz's family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO but planned to be covered by a Humana PPO effective March 1. A Politico news story on Cruz’s Manchester remarks said that in 2015, Cruz and his wife, Heidi, on temporary leave from her job with Goldman Sachs, had purchased an individual plan after previously receiving coverage through the Wall Street firm. For this article, we looked into Cruz’s claim that Blue Cross Blue Shield stopped selling health coverage in Texas at the end of 2015, leaving the market, as Cruz put it. Not so, we found, and the ""notice"" Cruz mentioned in New Hampshire may have been sent his way a couple months before the year ended, leaving time to consider options. July 2015 announcement We didn’t hear back from Cruz about the basis of his statement. Meantime, the insurer in summer 2015 did announce changes to its Texas offerings. According to a July 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas said it would offer fewer health insurance plans when open enrollment began in the fall on the online marketplace mandated under the Obamacare law, which Cruz has vowed to repeal and replace. At the time, the insurer’s chief medical officer, Dan McCoy, said preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans would not be affordable in 2016, and the company wouldn’t continue to make them available. McCoy also said the company would continue to offer health maintenance organization, or HMO, plans. An HMO requires enrolled patients to pick a primary care physician through which the patient and family members obtain all but emergency services, sometimes by referral. Visits to health care professionals outside of the HMO network typically aren’t covered. PPO plans give more flexibility; you don’t need a primary physician and can go to any health care professional without a referral inside or outside its network, though it costs less to stay in the network. Costs cited Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas’ July 23, 2015, announcement said it had been ""the only insurer to offer an individual PPO insurance plan across the state to individuals in 2014 and 2015. Since the Affordable Care Act began,"" it said, ""the market has changed."" The company further said it couldn’t simply offer the PPO option at higher rates, saying: ""The law requires that we set our individual plan rates based on all of our individual members' claims history. This means that if the costs of one plan are high, it will raise the rates of all other plans, not just the high-cost plan. If we kept the Blue Choice PPO, this would have raised the rates so much for all our other plans that most people wouldn't be able to afford them. By dropping the PPO, we can still offer our other plans at reasonable rates."" McCoy said then: ""We felt it was important to make sure that we offer a sustainable product. Clearly, the individual marketplace is evolving."" To our own inquiry, Edna Pérez-Vega, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, said by email the company’s ""retail market PPO plan, offered directly to individual consumers on and off the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange,"" had become ""economically unsustainable, paying out more than $400 million in claims"" more ""than it earned in premiums."" The 2015 Statesman story further said the announced change wouldn’t affect customers with employer group plans or grandfathered PPO individual plans, meaning plans that existed on March 23, 2010, when the Obamacare law came to be. However, the story said, customers who bought PPO plans in or outside of the marketplace--including 367,000 Texans--would have to find new options. The company’s announcement suggested its announcement was timed to give customers time to prepare before open enrollment began anew Nov. 1, 2015: ""If you enrolled in the individual Blue Choice PPO plan last year, you won't be able to keep your PPO plan in 2016. We're sharing this information well in advance of the required notification date so that you have plenty of time to research the plan options that best suit your needs,"" the company said. Company: Health coverage available all over Texas We asked Pérez-Vega if Cruz was right that the company bowed out of the Texas health insurance market. Without mentioning Cruz or his statement, Pérez-Vega replied that the company offers health plans in every Texas county and it’s the only company offering coverage to individuals in 58 of the 254 counties. She also reaffirmed that the company told members in 2015 ""we would no longer offer PPO's to individual policyholders,"" though, she said, the company said it ""would work to transition them to other available insurance plans for individuals so they would not experience a gap in coverage. Those who have been transitioned also have the option of choosing different plans for 2016. "" Asked generally when plan holders like Cruz would have been notified of changes, Pérez-Vega said: ""Members were notified in the days leading up to Oct 1,"" 2015. Our ruling Cruz said: ""Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual (health care) policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31."" Actually, the company continues to sell coverage all over Texas, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. The company also says individual customers like Cruz were notified months before 2016 changes—including an end to individual PPO plans--kicked in. So, Cruz was both incorrect about Blue Cross’ offerings in Texas and evidently mischaracterized how his own coverage came to lapse.

Scott Walker says Wisconsin's high school graduation rate increased, rising to third in U.S.
","State of the State addresses tend to be bursting with boasts and brags. But given the preparation that goes into such speeches, claims made in them are probably more likely to be on target than off-the-cuff remarks. That’s essentially what we have with one in a string of education boasts made by Gov. Scott Walker during his sixth State of the State, given Jan. 19, 2016. ""In our state, fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores went up again in 2015,"" the governor said. ""And according to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to the third-best in the country."" Given the nature of his speech, Walker clearly was taking some credit for the graduation rate apparently rising and the ranking being so high. Let’s take a look. Old claim, new claim Walker made a similar statement in April 2014. He said the state’s high school graduation rate and third-grade reading scores had improved on his watch. Our rating was Mostly True. Both numbers were up since 2010, the year before Walker took office. But some credit could have been to due prior elected officials, and the trend lines hadn’t changed much going back to prior to 2010. The graduation rate covers students in public high schools who earn a regular diploma within four years of starting high school. To back Walker’s new claim, his office cited an October 2015 news release from the state Department of Public Instruction about the latest graduation data. The release said federal data released that month showed Wisconsin’s graduation rate for the 2013-’14 school year was 88.6 percent. That rate was up 0.6 percentage points from the previous year, ranking Wisconsin third in the country, according to the release. Here’s how the federal data listed the top states: Public high school graduation rate, 2013-’14 school year Rank/State Rate 1. Iowa 90.5% 2. Nebraska 89.7% 3. (tie) Wisconsin and New Jersey 88.6% Now the federal data for the previous school year: Public high school graduation rate, 2012-’13 school year Rank/State Rate 1. Iowa 89.7% 2. Nebraska 88.5% 3. (tie) Wisconsin and Texas 88% So, Wisconsin’s graduation rate did improve, but its rank did not. Our rating Walker said: ""According to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to third best in the country."" The latest-available graduation rate for public high school students in Wisconsin was 88.6 percent in the 2013-’14 school year. That’s up sixth-tenths of a percentage point from the previous year. But Wisconsin’s rank -- third -- did not change. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True. More on education Wisconsin Democratic Party: Wisconsin dropped ""from second in the country to 41st"" among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam. Pants on Fire.

Roger Williams falsely says 'fewest number of adults' working since Jimmy Carter's presidency
","After the president talked up national job gains, a Central Texas member of Congress suggested things haven’t been rosy. U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, whose district stretches nearly to Fort Worth, said in a Jan. 12, 2016, response to the State of the Union address: ""It’s been seven years since President Barack Obama took office. In that time, the United States has accumulated the largest national debt in its history, the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency and the executive branch has expanded its power immensely – the president has chosen which laws to enforce and created new ones without Congress’ approval."" The national debt, in raw dollars, is at a record high, and Obama has issued provocative executive orders though, PolitiFact found in 2014, fewer orders than most recent predecessors. A reader asked us if Williams was correct about the country having fewer working adults than when Carter was president from 1977 into January 1981. Just given population growth, could that be? We asked Williams’ spokesman Vince Zito how Williams reached his conclusion and didn’t hear back. In 2012, PolitiFact explored similar territory, finding Mostly False a claim that the American ""workforce"" was smaller than when Carter was president. The word ""workforce"" refers to the absolute number of people employed or seeking work; that tally was way up by 2012 compared with Carter’s era due to population growth and, through the 1990s, the expansion of working women. Counting workers So, did the number of working adults subsequently plunge to Carter-era levels? No, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose figures indicate that in 1980, around 100 million people were in the civilian workforce. In 2015, bureau figures show, nearly 150 million Americans were in the workforce -- up about 50 percent from Carter’s last year as president. By phone to our inquiry, economist Stephen Rose of the Urban Institute, a former deputy in the Department of Labor, told us Williams’ claim isn’t supported. ""Not close,"" Rose said. A  chart in the 2015 Economic Report of the President shows 99.3 million people comprised the civilian workforce in 1980 and 146.3 million were in the workforce in 2014. Another bureau chart indicates 149.7 million people in the workforce in December 2015 and also that the workforce increased nearly every year from 1980 through 2015 -- with the exceptions of 1982, 1991, 2002 and 2008 through 2010, a period encompassing the end of George W. Bush’s terms and the first two years of Obama’s tenure. From 2010, when an Obama-low 139 million people were in the workforce, the count inched to nearly 140 million in 2011; 143 million in 2012; 144 million in 2013 and 146 million in 2014, according to the bureau. Employment-population ratio By another indicator, Rose said, it’s possible to compare the share of Americans who had jobs in Obama’s years with the share of job-holders when Carter was president. The BLS, drawing on results from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, calculates the employment-population ratio to reflect the proportion of the civilian noninstitutional population aged 16 years and over that’s employed. The highest ratio under Obama was 60.6 in January 2009, the month he was sworn in. The lowest ratio on his watch, 58.2, was set in November 2010 and June and July 2011. In Carter’s four years as president, according to the bureau, the highest ratio, 60.1, was reached in February and December 1979 and the lowest ratio, 57.0, occurred in January 1977, the month he was sworn in (it nudged to 57.2 the next month). Labor force participation We wondered if another indicator might be relevant. That statistic is the civilian labor force participation rate -- meaning the labor force, civilians 16 and older working full- or part-time, divided by the civilian population. According to the BLS, 62.6 percent of the population comprised the labor force in December 2015, the latest month of available figures. While Carter was president, a bureau chart indicates, the participation rate fluctuated from 61.6 percent in January 1977 to 64 percent in January and February 1980. Score one for Williams, though the rate on Obama’s watch peaked at 65.8 percent in February 2009--which was higher than any rate in Carter’s years or the first seven years of successor Ronald Reagan’s tenure. The rate was 66.5 percent when Reagan left office in January 1989. Labor force changes There’s another chewy issue: Demographics, particularly the aging of the population, have affected changes in the workforce, making comparisons between current times and Carter’s era tricky. In the 2000 Census, Americans aged 60 to 69 -- that is, those who had recently hit retirement age or would do so soon -- numbered about 20 million. But thanks to Baby Boomers, that number surged in the 2010 Census to more than 29 million, for almost a 50 percent increase. This matters because the more people aged 60 to 69, the more people who pass into retirement age -- or, put another way, leave the labor force. Even though more people proportionally remain in the workforce after retirement age, the difference isn’t big enough to cancel out the flood of new retirees. In 2015, Atlantic magazine published a chart contrasting the workforce in October 1977, in Carter’s first year as president, and June 2015, in the seventh year of Obama’s tenure:  SOURCE: Story, ""How America's Workforce Has Changed Since 1977,"" the Atlantic, July 2, 2015 (accessed Jan. 21, 2016) Our ruling Williams said that under Obama, ""the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency."" This claim doesn’t hold up in that far more people were working the past few years than in Carter’s time as president. According to a government calculation, about the same share of adults was employed during each Democrat’s presidency. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Mike Rogers says Trump appeals to Democrats as much as Republicans
","Can the Republican establishment steer GOP voters away from Donald Trump? Pundits on CNN chewed over the matter recently, with one conservative arguing they shouldn’t try. ""I think we're missing one important point here. Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,"" said Mike Rogers, a former Republican congressman from Michigan and CNN's national security commentator, on Jan. 12. Rogers said people who don't see this are ""missing the folks on the street who are drawn to his campaign. He's got this whole group of Democrats for Trump, it's an economic issue. … This is a Republican Party attracting Democrats, independents, Reagan Democrats to a message that says this town is broken. The institutions of government are broken. The economy is broken."" We were intrigued by the idea that Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans, so we asked Rogers' office for his sources. We also checked some national polls. First stop: the latest Fox News Poll, jointly conducted by a Democratic and Republican polling firm from Jan. 4 to 7. The results were reported four days before Rogers' statement. It surveyed 1,006 registered voters by phone and found that in a matchup with Hillary Clinton, Trump's level of support was 84 percent among Republican but only 9 percent among Democrats. The latest Quinnipiac poll to look at the question, conducted Dec. 16-20 among 1,140 registered voters, found that while 82 percent of Republicans would support Trump, only 4 percent of Democrats would vote for him in a matchup with Clinton. So Democratic support for Trump doesn't come close to his level seen among Republican voters. When we asked Rogers about his sources, his spokeswoman sent us two articles, one from the New York Times and the other an opinion piece from U.S. News & World Report. The Times analysis is based on surveys by Civis Analytics of more than 11,000 people who say they lean Republican. Trump's support was 43 percent among Republicans who are still registered as Democrats. But that group makes up only 8 percent of the respondents who said they tend to support the GOP, and Civis spokeswoman Lisa Kornblatt told us no Democrats were included in the survey. Arguing that Civis polling shows that Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans ""is a misrepresentation of our data,"" she said. The results from Mercury Analytics, cited in the U.S. News & World Report opinion piece, found that a hefty 19 percent of likely Democratic voters would cross party lines and vote for Trump if the election were held when the online survey was conducted, January 6-8. But, in contrast, Trump was supported by 73 percent of Republicans, making him nearly four times more popular among Republicans. ""If the claim was truly 'Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,' this is completely untrue – ridiculous,"" Mercury CEO Ron Howard wrote in an email. The Mercury poll also found that 14 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Our ruling CNN commentator and former congressman Mike Rogers said, ""Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans."" A January 2016 Fox News poll found Trump was nine times more popular among Republicans than Democrats, when matched up against Clinton. A December 2015 Quinnipiac poll found that the billionaire was 20 times more popular. Rogers, in contrast, cited one survey that didn't even poll people who said they leaned Democrat and another that found Democrat support for Trump was only about one quarter of what it was among Republicans. The relevant numbers render Roger's assertion ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2016/jan/21/mike-rogers/mike-rogers-says-trump-appeals-democrats-much-repu/

Donald Trump exaggerates when he says China has 'total control' over North Korea
","During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea. Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us."" With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea."" When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea’s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control."" ""China does not ‘control’ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies. Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager. ""It’s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,"" Ross said. ""Do the parents have total control? Perhaps – they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive – driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable."" China’s leverage over North Korea The strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel. North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea’s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea’s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows. ""North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,"" Haggard told PolitiFact. Why ‘total control’ is an exaggeration Yet while China’s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn’t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump’s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border. ""China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,"" Haggard said. It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn’t exactly listen to outsiders. ""Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. ""This is hardly control."" Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country’s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance. ""North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,"" Revere said. ""This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large."" Indeed, despite North Korea’s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, ""it is not clear that the leadership cares,"" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. ""For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well."" Meanwhile, North Korea’s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China’s situation. This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb. ""China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,"" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader."" That does not sound like a country in ""total control"" of another. Trump’s claim ""suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,"" Revere said. ""It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test.  In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community."" Our ruling Trump said China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea."" He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea’s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump’s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government’s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching ""total control"" over North Korea. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-when-he-says-china-has-to/

Bernie Sanders’ NRA report card: D-minus is most recent grade
","Sen. Bernie Sanders is wearing a bad grade as a badge of honor. The Democratic presidential candidate is under fire since Sunday’s debate for his votes on gun legislation, with chief rival Hillary Clinton eagerly highlighting his flip-flops on immunity for gun dealers, among other issues. Sanders got his chance to explain himself in Underwood, Iowa, when an audience member asked him about his past positions, which she said seemed more Republican. Sanders said that impression wasn’t right.   ""I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA,"" he said. ""Does that sound like a tool of the NRA? D-minus."" We wanted to know if his statement earned perfect marks. A spokesman for Sanders’ campaign said Sanders’ NRA grade came during the 2012 election cycle, as shown in the lobby group’s subscriber-only database. The group awarded Republican John MacGovern, Sanders’ unsuccessful challenger, an A.  The NRA corroborated Sanders’ D-minus grade. Of course, 2012 wasn’t Sanders’ first public-office rodeo. The NRA (or technically its political action committee, the NRA-Political Victory Fund) has grades for Sanders as far back as 1992, when he ran for his second term for Congress as an independent from Vermont. (The NRA did not have earlier ratings available even though Sanders first ran for Congress in 1988 before winning in 1990.) The grades the gun lobby did have on file show Sanders has never exactly been in its favor, with one sort-of exception. 1992 D 1994 F 1996 F 1998 F 2000 F 2002 F 2004 D+ 2006 C- 2012 D-   Our first thought: Man, the NRA really didn’t like Sanders in the 1990s and early 2000s, awarding five straight Fs. The NRA slightly warmed to Sanders in the mid 2000s, giving him a D-plus in 2004 and a C-minus in 2006, his first bid for the Senate. That’s mediocre but passing, right? The change of heart corresponds with Sanders voting in favor of the gun liability bill, which passed in October 2005 with NRA support. The bill also contained provisions for childproof trigger locks and a ban on body armor-piercing bullets, which Sanders mentioned as he explained his vote to the audience in Underwood. However, its most controversial provision was broad immunity for gun sellers, with a few exceptions, such as if the seller was negligent or knowingly broke the law in making the sale. The Democrats opposed this section, but the bill passed 283-144 in the House. (You can read more about Sanders' votes on guns over his congressional career in this fact-check.) NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter gave us a little more insight into the group’s grading process. Ratings are compiled by lobbyists and analysts who know the issues in their specific region well, she said, and are generally not done for primaries. Each grade represents each election cycle, including all of the relevant gun issues in that politician’s state and the country at that time. ""They only last through that election,"" Hunter said. Clinton’s most recent grade came in 2006 as she ran for re-election to the Senate in 2006. It was an F. Our ruling Sanders said he has a ""D-minus grade"" from the NRA. He’s accurately referring to the most recent assessment from the gun lobby group in 2012. The NRA has not issued a more recent evaluation for Sanders for the 2016 primary election. It’s worth noting that the grade is a few years old, and that his rating has been higher in previous election cycles. Still, a D-minus is far from a full-throated endorsement.

Carly Fiorina incorrect that U.S. has a 'record number of abortions year after year'
","Carly Fiorina may be a former CEO, but her campaign hasn’t been all about business and economics. Fiorina has made abortion one of her top issues, most notably referencing a controversial anti-abortion video during a Republican debate. (We rated her claim on the video Mostly False.) On Jan. 20, 2016, at an Iowa Right to Life event in Des Moines, she cited a statistic sure to trouble her audience, among others. ""I think we're being told to settle for a nation where record numbers of men are out of work, record numbers of women are living in poverty,"" Fiorina said. ""We have record number of abortions year after year after year."" Here, we’ll look at her claim that the United States has a ""record number of abortions year after year after year."" There are two data sets for tracking abortions over the long term. One is compiled by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the other is compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. The data from the CDC is current through 2012, while the Guttmacher data -- which includes information for a few states not captured in the CDC data -- is current through 2011. Both groups’ data show the same general pattern -- a small but steady decline in abortion since the early 1980s. In plain figures, there were 1.6 million recorded abortions in 1990 compared to a little over 1 million in 2011. This chart, using CDC data, shows the declines between 2003 and 2012 in the raw numbers of abortions (the solid line), the abortion rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44), and the abortion ratio (the number of abortions per 1,000 live births).    The Guttmacher data shows a similar trend. Here’s the decline in the abortion rate and the abortion ratio going back to 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationally in the case Roe vs. Wade.    It’s worth noting that this second pair of charts doesn’t come from an abortion-rights advocacy group. It was disseminated by the National Right to Life Coalition. ""After reaching a high of over 1.6 million in 1990, the number of abortions performed annually in the U.S. (has) dropped to around 1.06 million a year,"" the National Right to Life Coalition wrote in its fact sheet, adding, ""By 2011, the (abortion) rate had dropped to 16.9, nearly half the peak rate, meaning abortion was a significantly less common feature in women’s lives in 2011 than it was in 1980."" And Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, told PolitiFact that ""we have no reason to believe that the long-term decline has reversed itself in recent years."" We should note that even though the abortion rate has decreased, the annual number of abortions is still significant -- 1,058,500 in 2011, according to Guttmacher, the higher of the two estimates. Still, Fiorina’s claim -- that the United States has a ""record number of abortions year after year after year"" -- is flat wrong. Our ruling Fiorina said the United States has a ""record number of abortions year after year after year."" In reality, the raw number, the rate and the ratio of abortions compared to live births has been falling since the early 1980s, and the decline shows no signs of stopping.

Democratic debates set to 'maximize' exposure, Wasserman Schultz claims, but evidence is dubious
","Responding to rampant criticism about the Democratic Party’s presidential debate schedule, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has boasted about viewership numbers. The critics include party leaders as well as Hillary Clinton’s primary rivals, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Some Democrats say that the schedule of six debates including some on weekends limits voters’ exposure, giving Clinton an edge. But Wasserman Schultz says ratings show that voters have had plenty of TV face time with the Democratic candidates. ""In fact, our first debate beat at least two of the Republican debates. And our last debate, compared to the Republican last debate, was just a little bit less than theirs,"" the Democratic National Committee chair told CNN’s Brian Stelter Jan. 17, hours before the debate over the Martin Luther King weekend in Charleston. After Stelter pressed her, Wasserman Schultz, a Broward County congresswoman, replied: ""Brian, there's no number of debates that will satisfy everyone. So, I did my best to make sure, along with my staff and along with our debate partners, to come up with a schedule that we felt was going to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates."" Clearly, we can't rate what people within the Democratic party intended. Our fact-check looks at what the outcome was. Did the Democrats ""maximize the opportunity"" for voters to see their candidates? We found there’s no fair reading of the Democratic debate schedule that supports this. Democratic and Republican debate schedules in 2016 The Democrats scheduled six primary debates; the Republicans scheduled 11 primary debates (plus one more in March that is unscheduled). So far, Democrats have held four debates with a cumulative viewership of about 42.5 million while Republicans have held six debates with a cumulative viewership of about 103.7 million, according to Nielsen ratings of same-day viewership. Democratic debates: Date Day of week Network Viewership Oct. 13, 2015 Tuesday CNN 15.8 million Nov. 14, 2015 Saturday CBS 8.5 million Dec. 19, 2015 Saturday ABC News 8 million Jan. 17, 2016 Sunday NBC News 10.2 million Feb. 11, 2016 Thursday PBS TBD March 9, 2016 Wednesday Univision TBD   Republican debates: Date Day of week Network Viewership Aug. 6, 2015 Thursday Fox News 24 million Sept. 16, 2015 Wednesday CNN 23 million Oct. 28, 2015 Wednesday CNBC 14 million Nov. 10, 2015 Tuesday Fox Business Network 13.5 million Dec. 15, 2015 Tuesday CNN 18.2 million Jan. 14, 2016 Thursday Fox Business Network 11.1 million Jan. 28, 2016 Thursday Fox News TBD Feb. 6, 2016 Saturday ABC TBD Feb. 13, 2016 Saturday CBS TBD Feb. 25, 2016 Thursday CNN TBD March 10, 2016 Thursday CNN TBD   Back in 2008, when Barack Obama won the nomination, the Democrats held about 25 primary debates while the Republicans held 21. Overall, it looks like the GOP is doing a significantly better job of reaching viewers. Wasserman Schultz response In defense of Wasserman Schultz’s statement, DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett raised several points: • There are more GOP candidates than Democratic candidates. At the outset of the 2016 race, there were 17 Republican candidates but only five Democratic candidates. • Only three Democratic debates in 2008 topped the Democrats’ lowest rated debate this cycle. • The first Democratic debate drew 15.8 million viewers, surpassing the viewership of three of the Republican debates this cycle. • All but one of the Democratic debates are on broadcast network TV, which makes it more likely for people without cable to tune into the debates. • The schedule of one debate a month for six months doesn’t pull the candidates away from town halls and other events with voters. Still, Wasserman Schultz has faced constant questions about the debate schedule, specifically whether it was intended to help Clinton or minimize viewership. ""That’s ridiculous,"" she said on Jan. 11 in Broward County. ""I don’t know how many times I have to say it."" She said that the Sunday debate in Charleston -- the city where nine African-Americans were killed at a church in 2015 -- was a recommendation by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and NBC to coincide with Martin Luther King weekend. Experts dispute Wasserman Schultz’s characterization We contacted five professors of political science and communications. None of them bought Wasserman Schultz’s statement. ""By the time voting starts in Iowa, potential voters will have seen about 40 percent less of Democratic candidates on the debate stage than their Republican counterparts,"" University of Michigan’s Director of Debate Aaron Kall told PolitiFact. Kall cited several factors contributing to the larger Republican viewership: • The first Republican debate occurred in early August, before the start of the NFL and NCAA college football seasons. Viewer anticipation is usually highest for the first debate. The Democrats didn't host their first debate until over two months later.   • Of the four Democratic debates so far, three were on weekends, including the Dec. 19 debate a week before Christmas and the same night as the New York Jets vs. Dallas Cowboys NFL game. The Jan. 17 debate was the day before the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday. Kall cited two major factors beyond the Democrats’ control that have aided superior Republican ratings: a much larger GOP field and the phenomenon of Donald Trump, an entertainment star in his own right from his time on The Apprentice. John Schroeder at Northeastern University noted that the two highest Republican debates each drew between 23 million and 24 million, much higher than the Democratic debates. While a lot of the disparity is due to Trump, another factor is that all the Republican debates so far have been held on weekdays. ""I think we can safely say that weekend time slots are not the key to maximizing the viewing audience,"" Schroeder said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz says the party came up with a debate schedule ""to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates."" Wasserman Schultz’s best point is that the Democrats largely scheduled their debates with TV networks, which means viewers without cable can see them. But other than that, her statement is very disingenuous. There are six Democratic party debates compared with 11 scheduled for the Republicans, and half of the Democratic debates are on weekends -- including one the weekend before Christmas and another on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. If the Democrats had wanted to ""maximize"" opportunities for viewers, the party could have added more debates, scheduled them on weekdays and avoided holidays.

Spot check of Hillary Clinton's Senate record fails to support bipartisanship claim
","Voters concerned about gridlock in Washington want to know if a presidential candidate is going to be able to take a bipartisan approach to resolving the nation's problems. So on the campaign trail in Iowa, Democrat Hillary Clinton said she could work with Republicans because that's what she did when she served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2009. ""When I was in the Senate, of course I had to work with Republicans. I think every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced had a Republican co-sponsor,"" she said at a campaign organizing event in Toledo, a small town between Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. PolitiFact, which is in Iowa this week covering the caucuses, wanted to see if Clinton had that right. We used GovTrack.us to see any Republican senator who co-sponsored a bill by Clinton. Of the 355 bills she sponsored that were referred to a Senate committee, Republicans were listed as a co-sponsor 241 times. That means, in theory, up to 68 percent of Clinton’s bills could contain a Republican co-sponsor. But the real percentage is likely much lower. Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, for instance, co-sponsored six pieces of Clinton legislation. Four of those pieces of legislation had 10 or more Republican co-sponsors. We also did a spot check of Clinton’s record by looking at legislation directly. Congress.gov is the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. It says that Clinton sponsored 703 pieces of legislation while representing New York. They include bills, amendments and resolutions. We sorted the list by ""Latest Action - Newest to Oldest"" and then spot-checked every 10th bill, starting with the Paycheck Fairness Act, to see which ones had at least one Republican sponsor. From that list, we focused on the 44 pieces of legislation that were introduced, the term Clinton used. We found at least one Republican co-sponsor in 4 of 7 resolutions or continuing resolutions (57 percent) but only 9 of 37 bills (24 percent). Overall, that's 13 out of 44, or just under 30 percent. Focusing on the 18 bills that Clinton sponsored and brought to the Senate floor for consideration, four had at least one Republican co-sponsor (22 percent): • A bill commemorating the 225th Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemoration Act (two GOP co-sponsors); • A bill dealing with respite care (four GOP co-sponsors); • A bill concerning the labeling of pediatric medication (two GOP co-sponsors); • A bill seeking to assist the victims of landmines (four GOP co-sponsors). So neither metric supports Clinton’s claim. None of this is to say she didn’t work with Republicans during her time in the Senate. But if someone says, as Clinton did, that ""Just about every piece of legislation I introduced had a Republican co-sponsor,"" we think most listeners would expect better than 30 percent of the legislation introduced by Clinton would include a GOP co-sponsor. When we heard back from the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin said, ""She meant to say,  'Just about every Republican senator I served with co-sponsored a piece of legislation I introduced.'"" ""In total, 57 (Republican) colleagues cosponsored at least one piece while only 8 did not,"" he reported in an email, and Schwerin supplied a list of 42 pieces of legislation to support that assertion. The list can be viewed here. However, that claim is a significantly different from what voters heard in Iowa on Jan. 18. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced (in the U.S. Senate) had a Republican co-sponsor.""  By our review of legislation introduced by Clinton, she isn't even close. Her campaign says she meant to cast the statement differently, but we cannot rule based on what candidates intended to say. Clinton introduced a significant amount of legislation without Republican co-sponsors. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jan/20/hillary-clinton/spot-check-hillary-clintons-senate-record-immolate/

It's true, Texas has removed more Confederate monuments than other states
","In the wake of several high-profile efforts to remove monuments and other symbols linked to the Confederacy from cities across Texas, the state Senate approved a bill that would restrict the ability of state agencies, cities, counties and public universities to remove or alter such memorials. Republican Sen. Brandon Creighton, the author of the bill, said it is important for people to remember the history of their nation and state — the good and the bad. ""Every month, I see a new story of a historical monument destroyed or removed,"" he said from the Senate floor on Tuesday. ""It’s happening across the country, and Texas actually leads in the number of monuments removed. Senate Bill 1663 will protect all monuments."" It may be true that Texas leads in the number of monuments that have been removed, but it’s also true that it was among the states with the most symbols of the Confederacy to begin with. Removals started after Charleston Erin Wilson, a spokeswoman for Creighton, said the information came from an article in the Austin American-Statesman that said Texas had removed more Confederate symbols than any other state since 2015. The story cited a report produced by the Southern Poverty Law Center that looked at the rise in local efforts to remove monuments and memorials tied to the Confederacy after a white gunman shot and killed nine people at a black church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. Thirty-two states in the nation at one point had confederate symbols on display in public places, according to the study. Just Kansas and Massachusetts, which each had one symbol, have removed all public memorials honoring the Confederacy. The center advocates for the removal of Confederate monuments and symbols from public spaces. The report, which was originally published in 2016 but has been continually updated, found that between June 2015 and this February, 114 Confederate symbols had been removed across the country, including monuments, flags and the names of several schools and roads. But Creighton’s claim was not limited to removals since 2015, so we looked at all removals recorded by the Southern Poverty Law Center in a public facing dataset with removals dating back to 1880. In Texas, 34 symbols tied to the Confederacy were listed as being removed, about 27% of all such symbols removed across the country. These 34 account for about 14% of the 240 symbols to the Confederacy recorded in Texas before any removals took place — the second highest number of symbols in any state in the nation. Virginia is the only state with more Confederate symbols than Texas: It had 262 before 15 were removed, all in the years after the shooting in Charleston.   Symbols vs. Monuments But is Texas the leader when it comes to removing ""monuments,"" the term Creighton used in his claim? ""Texas is the clear leader out of all US states that have removed Confederate monuments from public land,"" said Kimberly Allen, spokeswoman for the center. Texans have removed 9 of the state’s 76 monuments tied to the Confederacy (these numbers are included in the total symbol count explored above) — about 19 percent of all monuments removed nationwide. Before any removals happened, three states had more monuments than Texas: Georgia with 117 (3 have since been removed), Virginia with 111 (1 has been removed) and North Carolina with 100 (4 have been removed). Texas has also removed a larger share of monuments statewide than almost every other state, with some exceptions. Texas has removed about 12% of its Confederate monuments statewide. Looking at states with at least 10 monuments to start with, just two removed a larger share of their monuments: Florida and Missouri. Both removed about 19% of their monuments. Florida had 31; Missouri had 13. Study may exaggerate some ‘removals’ At least two schools with names tied to the Confederacy included in the law center’s list were marked as ""removed,"" even though the schools closed their doors for reasons unrelated to their names. Fort Davis AEC High School closed in 2014 and Robert E. Lee Elementary School in Marshall closed in 2017 when the district consolidated its elementary education into three new schools. Allen said the list aims to keep track of symbols that are still in place on public lands, so it includes all removals of symbols in the study, no matter the reason. ""The SPLC does not factor the nature of the removal into our spreadsheet, only whether a symbol is active or removed,"" Allen said in an email. ""This ensures that we are keeping an accurate, up-to-date record of Confederate symbols located on public land."" It’s also worth noting that at least one symbol in Texas was inaccurately labeled as being active, when it was actually removed in 2014: Robert E. Lee Road in El Paso, which was renamed Buffalo Soldier Road. Still, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s list is the most comprehensive that has been compiled of existing and removed symbols to the Confederacy in public spaces. Our ruling Creighton said, ""Texas actually leads in the number of monuments removed."" Creighton’s claim was based on an active study from the Southern Poverty Law Center of monuments, memorials and other symbols to the Confederacy that have been removed or are still standing. The study showed that Texas, which is among the states with the most Confederate symbols to start with, has removed more symbols and monuments than any of the 32 states with such symbols.

Have 20 million Americans gained health insurance from the ACA?
","With the battle over the Affordable Care Act continuing in the courts, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., took to Twitter to argue that millions of Americans have benefited from the law. Manchin wrote, ""Let’s be clear: throwing out the #AffordableCareAct without a plan in place would be horrific for West Virginians and Americans with preexisting conditions, and the nearly 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance since the law passed in 2010."" Let’s be clear: throwing out the #AffordableCareAct without a plan in place would be horrific for West Virginians and Americans with preexisting conditions, and the nearly 20 million Americans who have gained health insurance since the law passed in 2010. pic.twitter.com/vCO7BgBPqQ Have nearly 20 million Americans gained health insurance since the law’s passing? We took a closer look. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-rofit that focuses on health care policy, has published data through 2017 that sheds light on Manchin’s statement. The foundation’s data shows that since 2010, the number of Americans with health insurance has increased by about 35 million, an even higher number than Manchin cited. However, while the law passed in 2010, it didn’t fully take effect until 2014, so the more accurate year to use as the baseline is 2013. However, the data still supports Manchin’s claim. In fact, he undershot the actual number. Since 2013, about 26.6 million people have gained health insurance. It’s worth noting that the Affordable Care Act, while a major factor in this increase, is not the only one. As the Baby Boom generation ages, more and more Americans transition into guaranteed health care under Medicare -- about 10,000 a day. Because of this, some previously uninsured people would suddenly be counted as being insured upon turning 65. For this, they have Medicare to thank, rather than the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the continuing economic recovery played a role in expanding the pool of insured people, by increasing the number of Americans who were employed and who, as a result, were able to secure health insurance through their employment. That said, there’s little question that the Affordable Care Act played a role. Between 2008 and 2012 -- an equivalent five-year period before the ACA took effect -- just under 10 million people gained health insurance, a much smaller number than the 26 million between 2013 and 2017. Manchin tweeted, ""Nearly 20 million Americans ... have gained health insurance since (the Affordable Care Act) passed in 2010."" From 2013, the year before the law took effect, to 2017, the number of Americans with health insurance rose by 26.6 million, meaning that Manchin actually understated the gains. It’s worth noting, however, that gains in Medicare and from employer-sponsored health care account for a portion of that increase, so the increase can’t be credited entirely to the Affordable Care Act.

Does West Virginia rank in the top quarter of states for education spending?
","Does West Virginia rank among the top quarter of states for public education spending? That’s what the West Virginia Republican Party said in a Twitter thread recently that criticized the school system for subpar performance benchmarks. In the April 5 thread, the party made the case that ""West Virginia’s education system is not successfully serving our students. Comprehensive education reform will ensure students have what they need to succeed, parents have the freedom to decide the best education path for their children, and we invest in good teachers."" Later in the thread, the party said that ""according to the 2016 Annual Survey of School System Finances, U.S. Census Bureau, West Virginia spends more tax dollars on public education than all but 13 other states and the District of Columbia."" According to the 2016 Annual Survey of School System Finances, U.S. Census Bureau, West Virginia spends more tax dollars on public education than all but 13 other states and the District of Columbia. Is it accurate to say that West Virginia is in the top one-quarter of states for public school spending? We didn’t hear back from the state party, but we took a look at the original data. The report in question is published annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. We first looked at raw dollars spent, listed in Table 3 in the report. Rather than ranking towards the top, West Virginia ranked 13th lowest in this category among the 50 states, with $3.1 billion. The states with smaller expenditures were, in alphabetical order, Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. Of course, there’s something that those 12 states below West Virginia share: They’re all small, and that is a major factor determining their low levels of spending. So, to eliminate a state’s size as a factor shaping the data, we next turned at expenditures per pupil. In the report’s Table 4, the report shows that West Virginia was right around the national average in spending per pupil -- $11,424 in West Virginia, compared to $11,841 for the United States as a whole. We found 22 states that spent more per pupil than West Virginia, not 13, as the tweet said. Finally, since the tweet used the wording ""tax dollars,"" we looked at the tax burden for revenues spent in each state on education. The data in the report’s Table 2, shows the amount of local, state, and federal tax dollars that were raised in each state on a per-pupil basis. By this measure, West Virginia raised $12,375 in tax revenues per pupil. In all, 28 states had higher figures, and the national average was $13,474. Bottom line: None of these measurements supported the assertion in the tweet. The West Virginia Republican Party said, ""West Virginia spends more tax dollars on public education than all but 13 other states and the District of Columbia."" Using the specific federal data source cited in the tweet, neither the revenue level nor the spending level in West Virginia had that ranking, either in raw dollars or per pupil. In fact, using per-pupil spending, West Virginia is right around the national average, rather than ranking in the top one-quarter of states.

This includes prejudice-motivated property damage (including graffiti), stalking and assault."" Reporting citizens who ""criticize Islam"" is not listed. At the time, Velma Korbel, director of the city’s Department of Civil Rights, said ""hate-motivated speech"" had no place in Minneapolis. That raised suspicions about free speech. But Korbel later said the hotline ""is not a tool to curtail anybody’s free speech, nor is it set up to compel anybody to worship or not worship in a way that they choose."" The city isn’t the first to debut such a hotline (see: New York City and Seattle, among others), but as the Star Tribune reported in July 2017, it became ""a focal point of criticism in the blogosphere, where it was called a political move designed to quell speech in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election.""

Cory Booker’s claim about regulations on toy guns and not firearms misses the point
","Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker wants more regulations on guns, an industry he said is even less regulated than their toy imitations. Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, laid out his plan for tougher gun control on Medium on May 6. In his multi-pronged plan, Booker made a case for more oversight of gun manufacturers. ""Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones,"" he wrote. Booker repeated this talking point in a CNN interview, saying that firearms are currently exempt from oversight from the Consumer Product Safety Commission: ""We have different regulations for toy guns and no regulations for weapons on our streets that are killing so many people."" Are there more regulations on the actual weapons than on their toy replicas? We decided to look at the regulations for both. We found Booker’s statement misleading. He oversimplified regulations to manufacturing standards only, while regulations on guns, real ones or imitations, don’t stop at that stage. Toy guns and real guns are regulated very differently, said Timothy Lytton, law professor at Georgia State University. Booker was on point citing federal consumer safety standards for toy guns and a lack thereof for firearms, which were exempted from Consumer Product Safety Commission oversight under a 1972 law. Toy guns must abide by general mandatory safety standards set by the commission for all toys, including labeling, preventing choking hazards and toxic substance testing. On top of that, toy gun manufacturers also need to meet federal requirements, so as to prevent the toys from being mixed up with lethal lookalikes. Toy guns need to either display a predominant color chosen from an approved list, or a blaze orange plug or a blaze orange band around the muzzle. Non-powder guns, including air, pellet and BB guns, are separate from toy guns. They are subject to general rules by the commission, which hasn’t adopted specific mandatory design standards. Booker has a point that unlike most consumer products, these federal consumer product safety standards are lacking for real firearms. No federal law in place regulates the safety design standards for firearms, and the commission also cannot recall defective firearms. Manufacturers can follow voluntary standards set by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute on a voluntary basis. Those standards are not incorporated into U.S. federal law. But all of this doesn’t mean that firearms are unregulated. Seven states and the District of Columbia have set their own rules about safety standards and design related to firearms, for example, drop testing to ensure a gun doesn’t misfire when it is dropped. When it comes to defects of products, both toy guns and real guns manufacturers are subject to tort liabilities, said Eugene Volokh, law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. That means people can sue manufacturers if they are injured by defective products. But the debate about gun policy today is hardly about defective products, Volokh said. Instead, the issue is criminal misuse, suicide as well as accidental shootings. The laws aimed at preventing harm, regulating sales and the distribution of firearms are much more extensive than for toy guns. ""It’s just wrong to say that there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones,"" said Volokh. Booker’s comparison leaves out laws for the distribution and sales of firearms and failed to mention the various legislations at the federal, state and local level. Federal laws have imposed restrictions on firearms licensing and ownership including background checks, banning certain types of guns (mostly assault weapons), and barring certain people from purchasing guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is the primary agency to enforce federal firearm laws, including the Gun Control Act, the National Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act. They generally cover rules about importation of firearms, provisions regarding people banned from acquiring guns, taxing duties, etc. State laws have more detailed regulations concerning a range of topics including concealed carrying of firearms, owners’ responsibilities, and dealer regulations. Such restrictions generally don’t apply to toy guns. Alan Kaufman, the senior vice president of technical affairs at The Toy Association, told PolitiFact in an email, ""We are not aware of any restrictions on sale, distribution, or ownership of toy guns which comply with 15CFR 272,"" referencing the federal product safety requirements. One other key difference about toy and real gun regulations: federal funding for research. The Centers for Disease Control was explicitly barred from funding research to promote gun control due to the Dickey amendment. Only until recently a spending bill approved research on the cause of gun violence after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, but no such restriction on public funding for research exists for toy guns. ""We spend a lot more government money on research in toy safety than we do government money in gun safety,"" said Lytton. ""And that's probably a more useful comparison."" Booker said, ""Nowadays, there is more regulation over toy guns than real ones."" His claim only factors in consumer safety standards and discounted a volume of federal, state and local laws and rules regulating the sales and distribution of firearms, which are more restrictive than and outnumber those regulating toy guns. Since Booker’s claim mischaracterized the scope of regulations for toy guns and firearms, and overlooked a body of key legislations, we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/may/10/cory-booker/cory-bookers-claim-about-no-regulations-firearms-m/

Wisconsin senator makes point, but goes overboard with birth cost recovery claim
","GOP lawmakers, who control both chambers of the Legislature, have made it clear that Gov. Tony Evers’ two-year, $83 billion spending plan unveiled Feb. 28, 2019 faces an uphill climb.   In addition to stark differences about Medicaid expansion, medical marijuana, a proposed gas tax increase and more, there has been pointed criticism on lesser-discussed aspects, such as this shot from state Sen. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield: ""Tony Evers is cutting child support,"" Kooyenga said April 12, 2019, on the Jay Weber Show on NewsTalk 1130 WISN, which was hosted that day by WISN’s Dan O’Donnell and Matt Kittle of MacIver News Service. ""Why would you cut child support, money for the counties that is for child support?"" Kooyenga, went on to say: ""We asked about this"" and ""the reason they gave is there is a progressive element that believes that women don’t need men."" A check of Evers’ budget shows general fund payments to county child support agencies increasing by $750,000 in the first year of the budget, and $1,500,000 in the second year, according to a state budget summary by the Wisconsin Counties Association. What’s going on here? Let’s take a deeper look. The evidence When asked to provide backup, Kooyenga’s communications director Bill Cosh pointed to a particular, narrow aspect of the child-support system -- birth cost recovery. The child-support system, of course, is based on court-ordered payments made from one parent to another, with the aim of assuring financial support for their child or children. For instance, after a divorce, one parent may be required to make payments to the parent who has primary custody. Or an unmarried biological father may be required to make payments to the mother of his child. These payments do not come from state taxpayers. But government offices at the county-level do focus on enforcement -- that is collecting money from those ordered to pay. The thinking goes this way: The stronger the enforcement, the more money is paid and the less likely individuals wind up on welfare. So, the state and its taxpayers have a clear interest in assuring payments are made. Aside from administering that program, the state has been allowed to recover some of the cost of childbirth -- for instance, doctor and hospital costs -- when the mother is on Medicaid. That’s what Kooyenga was referring to in his claim. ""The amount repaid by the father depends on the birth cost, the father’s monthly income, and regional averages of birth costs,"" Kooyenga spokesman Bill Cosh said in an email. ""Under federal rules, child support agencies will ask the court to set the repayment amount to 5% of the father’s monthly income over a three- year period."" Cosh said that with the money that is collected, 85% must be deposited back into the Medicaid budget. The other 15% is retained by the county child support enforcement agencies. In 2017, Wisconsin counties retained nearly $2.3 million of the $15.2 million that was collected. Evers’ budget calls for eliminating the requirement that a court include an order for a father to pay for a portion of pregnancy and birth expenses. The budget also eliminates orders relating to pregnancy and birth expenses and prohibits the state from seeking recovery of birth expenses. ""As originally proposed, Governor Evers’ budget includes a massive decrease to county child support programs that will prevent local child support enforcement agencies from carrying out their basic functions,"" Kooyenga said in a May 2, 2019 post on his legislative website. ""If the Governor’s budget were to come to fruition as proposed, local child support programs would need to lay off staff and reduce services."" Kooyenga called the repayment program ""reasonable public policy,"" writing in the post that: ""It reminds the father that they have a child in this world for which they are responsible including reimbursing the state for costs associated with the birth of the child."" How does the reduction in this area square with the general increase included by Evers in his budget? Cosh argues the increased funding is still less than the amount the counties are able to retain under the birth cost recovery program. ""With the removal of the birth cost recovery program and a general increase, the child support agencies will still inherit a $2.5 million shortfall over the biennium. When accounting for the loss of federal matching dollars, that number increases to $7.5 million over the same time period."" Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, considered the gold standard on state fiscal matters, confirms that as part of the 2019-’21 budget bill, Evers has proposed eliminating recovery of expenses related to child birth.   The Fiscal Bureau also pointed out that the budget proposes an increase in funding for local child support enforcement under the state incentive payments to counties provided by the state Department of Children and Families (DCF). That said, the net result on the enforcement side is a reduction in money. ""The overall net effect from these two proposals on individual counties may differ depending on the amount of funding they would have recovered in births costs compared to the increased amount they would receive under the increase in state incentive payments from DCF,"" the Fiscal Bureau said in a report. ""The overall net effect of the two proposals would be to reduce funding for local child support enforcement agencies because the amount of birth cost recoveries exceeds the proposed increase in incentive payments.""   But is it child support? The Fiscal Bureau report notes the reduction is in the area of enforcement. That can indirectly mean less child support is collected, though it would not affect what is ordered by the court. So, in that respect, Kooyenga’s statement that Evers ""is cutting child support"" is overbroad, leaving listeners thinking Evers is asking that non-custodial parents pay less. Indeed, when asked about the reason for the proposal, Kooyenga said ""the reason they gave is there is a progressive element that believes that women don’t need men."" When asked what basis Kooyenga had for that comment, Cosh did not clarify the statement, instead saying: ""If you are trying to find the reason as to why this provision was proposed, I encourage you to ask Governor Evers why it was included in his budget. "" In an email, Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff slammed the comment, saying: ""The senator is purposefully misconstruing this issue and making misogynistic comments in the process."" On the claim at hand, Baldauff said the elimination of the birth cost recovery program ""is decidedly not a direct reduction in child support funding."" She noted that parents pay child support at an amount determined by statute and the courts and ""the governor can’t reduce the amount of child support a parent is obligated to pay."" As to the birth cost recovery program, she said: ""Birth cost recovery dollars are intended to repay for the actual cost of a birth. Many counties, however, elect to retain a portion of these funds. The governor’s overall budget makes a significant investment in counties, well beyond the child support increase discussed, and empowers counties to make funding decisions to best serve their citizens."" That point, though, is disputed by the fiscal bureau, which scores the net result as a loss for counties. Advocacy group report Meanwhile, a report by HealthWatch Wisconsin ""Birth Cost Recovery in Wisconsin: It’s Not Child Support,"" argues ""the policy does not support children; rather it supports child support offices."" The Birth Cost Recovery policy ""is a collections process directed by the State of Wisconsin and implemented by County Child Support Agencies that aggressively pursues the recovery of Medicaid supported birthing costs from unmarried, often non-custodial fathers,"" the report says. HealthWatch Wisconsin also pointed out that child support is not the same as child support enforcement. ""Unlike child support, none of the recovered dollars go to support the children and families -- it is all directed to reimburse the government at the federal, state and local level."" HealthWatch Wisconsin, according to its LinkedIn profile, is membership organization that is a project of ABC for Health, which is a nonprofit promoting access to health care. Our ruling Kooyenga said ""Tony Evers is cutting child support."" Evers’ budget does seek to eliminate the state’s birth cost recovery program. And, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the hole that leaves in the budget would exceed additional money included by Evers for local child support enforcement agencies. Kooyenga’s statement was overbroad in that it suggests Evers is advocating a reduction in support paid to children by non-custodial parents. But with less money available for enforcement, it could indirectly reduce the amount collected from court-ordered judgements.

Yes, Missouri is in the minority of states without a ban on powdered alcohol
","Missouri Rep. Patricia Pike, R-Adrian, proposed a bill that would tighten restrictions on powdered alcohol in Missouri. ""Over 30 states passed the legislation to ban powdered alcohol,"" she said in a April 11 House of Representatives debate on powdered alcohol. A former school counselor, Pike said she noticed the issues of powdered alcohol. She said the product can be easy concealed and carried, possibly increasing underage drinking. What is it, exactly? According to previous Missourian reporting, powdered alcohol resembles a packet of instant coffee or Kool-Aid once mixed with water or other liquids. The product name is Palcohol, marketed as ""a powder version of vodka, rum and three cocktails....with the same alcoholic content."" Invented by five Dutch students in 2007, powdered alcohol was approved in April 2014 by the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and in March 2015 by the federal government. The product is legal and unregulated in Missouri. The House passed Pike’s bill House Bill 65, by a 142-4 votes on April 11, which would add powdered alcohol to the legal definition of ""intoxicating liquor."" On April 18, the bill was referred to the Senate General Laws Committee. We decided to take a closer look at Pike’s statement that more than 30 states have banned the substance. When we asked Pike about her claim, she said she was referring to 2017 data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan research group. In 2017, 34 states and Washington, D.C., had banned powdered alcohol.
   Source: National Conference of State Legislatures, Powdered Alcohol 2017 Legislation In 2015 when New York enacted its ban, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he was concerned about the safety of the substance. ""This dangerous product is a public health disaster waiting to happen,"" Cuomo said according to the Washington Post. ""I am proud to sign this legislation that will keep powdered alcohol off the shelves and out of the wrong hands."" Pike said 2017 was the last year the NCSL published powdered alcohol legislation. We reached out to the NCSL to find out if they had more recent data. Heather Morton, program principal in fiscal affairs, gave us the 2018 and 2019 legislation lists regarding powdered alcohol. Two more states, Delaware and Oklahoma, banned powdered alcohol in 2018, she said. Colorado and New Mexico have included powdered alcohol in their statutory definitions of alcohol so that the product can be regulated under their existing alcohol statute. That’s how Pike’s measure would work in Missouri. Pike said, ""Over 30 states passed the legislation to ban powdered alcohol,"" and Missouri is not one of them. The latest count shows Pike is safely in the right ballpark, with 36 states and Washington, D.C., cracking down on this substance..

Skeptic of Elizabeth Warren's plan says 10 European countries scrapped wealth taxes
","Elizabeth Warren pins a lot of hopes on her ultra-millionaire tax. The Democratic presidential candidate would like to put a 2% levy on assets over the $50 million mark, and 3% on those over $1 billion. The revenues would pay for her plans to pay for universal child care, student debt forgiveness and other programs she has in mind. In a Fox News op-ed, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation noted that a wealth tax isn’t a new idea. Joel Griffith said many European nations have tried it. And scrapped it. ""Of the 14 wealthy (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries with a wealth tax in 1996, 10 have since then abandoned it,"" Griffith wrote April 28. We found different numbers, but there has been a turn away from wealth taxes. And with Warren’s plan on the table, the European experience is worth exploring. Griffith got his numbers from an article on the website of the Tax Foundation, a group that is concerned about the ways that taxes distort business decisions. The foundation’s analysis drew on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based international body that has its roots in the post-war recovery of Europe. The OECD data shows 13 countries collected revenues from net wealth taxes in 1996, measured in local currency. But it shows 14 when measured as a percentage of GDP. We can’t account for the difference. There’s another twist. One of those countries is Austria, but Austria ended its wealth tax in 1994. So the actual count that year was either 12 or 13. (It’s only slightly off from what Griffith wrote, but we care about these details.) Tallying the countries that have a wealth tax today is even trickier, largely because definitions vary. We found room for debate over what constitutes a wealth tax. All wealth taxes tax things that are owned, not money earned, but they vary in a couple of key respects. They might target the wealthy (Norway’s tax, for example, affects net worth above 1.48 million Norwegian Kroner) or a broader swath of residents. And some tax all assets, while others — such as Belgium with stocks and bonds, or France with real estate — focus only on specific assets. A 2018 report from the respected German-based think tank Ifo Institute for Economic Research counted just three countries with a wealth tax: Switzerland, Norway and Spain. But the authors noted that Italy and the Netherlands also tax wealth in limited ways, and France swapped a broad wealth tax for a narrow one on real estate wealth that kicks in on property worth at least 1.3 million Euros. The international accounting firm Ernst and Young affirmed that Italy does have a wealth tax. Another accounting firm KPMG reported in 2018 that Belgium added a wealth tax when it imposed a tax on securities, such as stocks and bonds. To make things even more complicated, some OECD countries dropped, added, or changed their wealth taxes since 1996. The Tax Foundation article Griffith relied on said that today, six OECD countries had wealth taxes in one form or another. (One of its charts showed four, but that stopped counting in 2017.) How to sort this out? By the strictest definition, today only three wealthy OECD countries have a wealth tax. With a looser standard, as many as seven do. (Some tallies include Hungary, but it might not count as a ""wealthy"" country, as the claim says.) The general reason European countries dropped their wealth taxes was they were more trouble than they were worth. In Germany, the tax was found unconstitutional, but it wasn’t raising that much money anyway. A review of the wealth tax option by the European Commission said that in the past, determining the value of assets was challenging and cheating was easier. ""Opportunities of avoidance and evasion reduce the capacity of wealth taxes to generate revenue, and they contribute to the perception that wealth taxes produce little net benefit,"" the report said. ""Decisions to repeal net wealth taxes have often been justified by efficiency and administrative concerns,"" OECD analysts wrote in a 2018 report. ""The revenues collected from net wealth taxes have also, with a few exceptions, been very low."" Switzerland reaps far more than other nations, taking in revenues equal to 1% of GDP. But Norway brings in 0.4% and Spain 0.2%. Of the countries that did away with a wealth tax, Denmark was typical. In 1996, the tax brought in just 0.1% of GDP. The earlier taxes also tended to reach down into the middle class, not just the uber-rich. Getting rid of them was politically popular. For some, the European experience casts a deep shadow over Warren’s proposal. Wojciech Kopczuk, an economist at Columbia University, warned that no matter what, valuing assets is tough. ""(Warren’s) plan would apply only to the very rich,"" Kopczuk said. ""That does not at all resolve administrative problems. Those are as daunting in the United State as in Europe."" On the other hand, Kopczuk added that a tax that starts at $50 million could hold popular support. There’s also a difference in overall tax regimes. The OECD analysts said that the arguments for and against a wealth tax depend on all the other tax laws in a given country. In that light, Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, said Europe is not at all like America. ""Income tax rates and sometime inheritance taxes are higher in Europe,"" Avi-Yonah said. ""This means there is less need to tax the rich through a wealth tax."" We’ve looked before at the debate whether Warren’s plan would raise as much as she hopes. Warren’s campaign staff told us that they have learned the lessons from Europe. They argue that focusing on the 76,000 wealthiest people and taxing all assets with no complicating exceptions would lighten the administrative burden. There’s also a hint that Europe is taking a second look at wealth taxes. Both the OECD and the European Commission wrote of a ""renewed interest in wealth taxation."" Griffith said that ""of the 14 wealthy OECD countries with a wealth tax in 1996, 10 have since then abandoned it."" We found there are different ways to consider wealth taxes, and Griffith used the strictest one based on dated information. We found that either 12 or 13 countries had a wealth tax in 1996, and nine ended their taxes since then. Today, six or seven European nations have some form of a wealth taxes, either broad ones or narrow ones. The meaning of the European experience from two decades ago is debatable, but that’s not the basis for our ruling. We looked only at the countries and their tax laws. The numbers in the statement are off. European countries did move away from the wealth taxes, but not quite to the extent stated in the op-ed.

Trump wrongly says Democrats oppose hurricane disaster aid for Florida
","President Donald Trump blamed Democratic lawmakers for standing in the way of hurricane disaster money for northwest Florida. ""Getting ready to leave for one of my favorite places, the Florida Panhandle, where we’ve given, and are giving, billions of $$$ for the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Even though the Dems are totally in our way (they don’t want money to go there) we’re getting it done!"" Trump tweeted May 8. Hours later at his Panama City Beach rally, Trump called on Democrats to work together with Republicans to pass disaster aid for the region affected by Hurricane Michael in 2018. Trump then talked about Democrats not wanting to build the wall on the U.S-Mexico border — a connection we’ll explain later. Trump’s comments that Democrats ""don’t want"" money to go to the Panhandle oversimplified a partisan fight over hurricane relief dollars. Lawmakers in both parties support disaster aid, including for Florida, but the partisan battle has been over how much to give Puerto Rico. Trump’s tweet echoes statements by U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who has also blamed Democrats for the lack of an agreement. Trump seems to be referring to failed efforts in the Senate to pass disaster aid. The holdup has been in the Senate over how much money to give to Puerto Rico to recover from the 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria. The negotiations have taken place amid Trump’s criticism of politicians in Puerto Rico and his false claim that the island already got $91 billion. In the House on Jan. 16, six Republicans joined the Democrats to pass HR 268, which included $14 billion for recovery from wildfires, hurricanes, and other recent natural disasters. The legislation included $600 million for Puerto Rico in disaster nutrition assistance. That same day, the Trump administration wrote a letter calling the funding for Puerto Rico ""excessive and unnecessary."" That prompted questions about whether Trump would sign a bill that included money for Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans wrote a few versions for disaster relief in 2019, including a $13.45 billion proposal in March by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala. He also included the $600 million in food assistance for Puerto Rico, calling it ""a key Democratic priority in the bill."" But on April 1, the Senate failed to move forward on two versions of disaster aid. The GOP version failed 44-49 with nearly all Democrats voting against it. The House Democratic version failed 46-48, with Republicans voting against it. For Florida, the legislation would have delivered money for farmers who lost crops and expenses related to flood mitigation, disaster relief, long-term recovery, and restoration of infrastructure. Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the Democrats’ version added up to $2.6 billion for Florida. That tally includes money for farmers, to rebuild roads and communities, and military projects. Exactly how much money would end up going to any state could change, however, depending on eligibility.  Pressure mounted to reach a new agreement, with weeks to go before the start of the June 1 hurricane season. On May 10, the House is expected to vote on HR 2157, which would provide $17 billion in aid, but the chances of a resolution in the Senate remain murky. News reports in early May said senators were close to a $17 billion deal that includes speeding up access to money for Puerto Rico and money for the Midwest for flooding in 2019. However, the Washington Post reported about a new wrinkle: the Trump administration wanted to add $4.5 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border. Lawmakers from both parties resisted that idea. Disaster aid was a subject of a luncheon with the GOP senators and Vice President Mike Pence. Shelby told the Washington Post that both parties want disaster aid. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Democrats clearly want disaster assistance to go to Florida. ""Considering the President has consistently and incorrectly complained about how much assistance has been given to Puerto Rico, I would say most of the blame goes to him. I believe Senate Republicans are tired of this fight, and with both Florida Senate seats in Republican hands,they want this done,"" he said, referring to Marco Rubio and Scott. ""If he gave his blessing, I think the disaster supplemental would move through Congress like greased lightning."" Trump said Democrats ""don’t want money"" to go to the Florida Panhandle for Hurricane Michael aid. His swipe appears to a reference to the Senate Democrats’ April 1 vote against a GOP version of disaster aid, because Democrats wanted more money for Puerto Rico. But Trump omits that Senate Democrats voted in favor of their own version that included money for Florida and other areas hit by disasters. Also, the Democratic-led House passed a bill months ago. Trump also omits his own role in the delays, including his critical comments about Puerto Rico and his recent request to add money for the border wall.

NC Republican claims credit for 'born alive' veto override
","Gov. Roy Cooper recently vetoed a bill that would place new penalties on any medical professional who willingly allows infants to die if they survived an abortion. Cooper and most Democrats said the legislation brings needless government rules into complicated medical situations. Republicans, though, say the rules are necessary. And on April 30, the state Senate voted to override Cooper’s veto. Afterward, legislator Dan Bishop, who’s running for Congress in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, took credit for advancing the override. ""I was proud to cast the deciding vote tonight in the State Senate to end infanticide in North Carolina, over liberal Governor Roy Cooper’s veto,"" Bishop posted on his Facebook page and website. First, Bishop’s claim that he voted to ""end infanticide"" in North Carolina is misleading because current federal laws already protect newborns born alive through the course of an abortion, as PolitiFact reported last month. Since we’ve already written about that, let’s look instead at Bishop’s claim that he was the ""deciding vote."" We believe this statement warranted attention because it suggests Bishop was a swing vote and that the bill’s fate depended on Bishop and Bishop alone. This is a type of claim that PolitiFact has been reviewing for years. It’s common for politicians to try to take sole credit for a law’s success or, conversely, for their opponents to try to assign someone sole blame. But often those claims are exaggerated, and that’s the case with Bishop too. Thirty votes were needed for the override and Bishop provided one of the predicted Republican votes. But the GOP-authored bill wouldn’t have advanced without the help of a Democrat. 1 OF 30 NEEDED VOTES To override a veto, the state House and state Senate each need three-fifths of their present members to support the idea. On April 30, the Senate’s override vote was 30 in favor and 20 opposed — meaning the effort advanced by one vote. While Bishop’s vote mathematically was important, it’s misleading for him to say he cast the ""deciding"" vote. Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer, described Bishop’s claim as a ""non sequitur."" ""I suppose with an oral roll call vote you could definitively say who the 30th yes vote was,"" Cohen said. ""Otherwise it’s puffery (though) not incorrect from a technical sense."" In North Carolina, key votes are typically conducted electronically at the same time. It’s not like an elementary school classroom where a teacher calls out each student’s name, one by one. So there’s rarely the kind of drama that the late U.S. Sen. John McCain generated in 2018, when he walked to the center of the Senate floor and made a thumbs-down motion to vote against a ""skinny repeal"" of the Affordable Care Act. HOW IT WORKS North Carolina’s voting procedure is more like a silent auction, or the final round of the television show ""Jeopardy!"" The chamber is silent, and senators are given time to press a button. Votes are anonymous until the results are displayed on a screen. And the screen doesn’t show results until each vote is cast. The system is structured in a way that it rarely places pressure on any one legislator. However, lawmakers sometimes bring the spotlight upon themselves by voting out-of-lockstep with their party, by trying to change their vote, or both. In 2012, for instance, fracking was legalized in North Carolina after a Democrat from Charlotte accidentally pushed the wrong button and voted with Republicans. Rep. Becky Carney made the mistake late at night. Just after the vote, her voice could be heard on her microphone, saying ""Oh my gosh. I pushed green,"" WRAL reported. She asked Thom Tillis, who’s now a U.S. Senator but at the time was NC House Speaker, if she could change her vote. Changing votes is sometimes allowed, but Tillis said no. In the vote Bishop referenced, Sen. Don Davis of Pitt County received the most attention. He was the only Democrat who voted with Republicans to support the override, giving the GOP the one vote it needed to advance the override effort. As of May 8, Cooper’s veto still stands because the House hasn’t taken an override vote. OUR RULING Bishop said he ""cast the deciding vote"" to override a vetoed ""born-alive"" bill. His vote was important because, without it, the override effort would fail. But it would have also failed without any of the other 29 votes. So it’s misleading for Bishop to say he cast the ""deciding"" vote. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Was Joe Biden a climate change pioneer in Congress? History says yes
","Joe Biden may not be the most progressive candidate in the crowded Democratic primary field. But one thing is for certain: Among 2020 presidential candidates, he has the longest legislative record on climate change. In fact, Biden has taken this title a good deal further by claiming to have pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in U.S. history. ""I’m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in ‘87,"" Biden said during a stump speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on May 1. We were curious if that was accurate. A review of the legislative history shows Biden is right. The Delaware senator’s first climate change bill, introduced in 1986, died in the Senate. But the following year a version of Biden’s legislation survived as an amendment to a State Department funding bill. President Ronald Reagan went on to sign it into law. The upshot of Biden’s Global Climate Protection Act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming. Biden spoke about the bill on the Senate floor in January 1987 in terms that seem uncannily familiar to present-day warnings. He discussed, among other ills, the threat to human habitat resulting from melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels. ""Life on this planet exists only under highly specialized circumstances,"" Biden said during a Senate session. ""Indeed, so special are these circumstances that even a small rise in temperature could disrupt the entire complicated environment that has nurtured life as we know it."" The measure also called on the president to make climate change a higher priority item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda. ""President Reagan told Secretary General Gorbachev ‘that if we had an invasion from Mars, both sides would put aside our differences.’ While not an exterrestrial threat, global warming could prove no less dangerous,"" Biden said. Biden’s amendment became law when Reagan signed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act on Dec. 12, 1987. Biden’s bill was not the first time Congress focused on climate change. In 1976 — decades before making the Academy Award-winning documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth"" — a 28-year old freshman congressman named Al Gore, D-Tenn., held House hearings on climate change. In 1985, then-Sen. Gore introduced a concurrent resolution — a non-binding legislative measure — in which both chambers of Congress asked the president to an international research program on greenhouse gas emissions.   But it was a Senate hearing in June 1986 that historians recall as a watershed moment in the public’s understanding of the threat posed by global warming. Biden’s Republican colleague in the Senate, John Chafee of Rhode Island, held the hearings.  ""This is not a matter of Chicken Little telling us the sky is falling,"" Chafee said at the hearing. ""The scientific evidence … is telling us we have a problem, a serious problem."" The show-stopping moment came when Dr. James Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies declared that, based on his climate modeling, significant warming could be observed much earlier than previously thought, perhaps as soon as 5 to 15 years.  Source: The Washington Post front page on June 11, 1986. It was several months after the Chafee hearings that Biden introduced the prototype of his bill, a version of which would clear Congress the following year. It’s worth noting that Biden introduced his measure several months before Chafee sponsored a separate bill, the Stratospheric Ozone and Climate Protection Act. Most experts we consulted said yes. ""I think Biden’s 1986 bill was the first introduced in Congress on this issue,"" said Sean Hecht, an environmental law professor at UCLA. ""He gets credit for that."" While other legislation predates Biden’s bill, they addressed climate generally and didn’t cite global warming mitigation as a specific goal, wrote Roel Hammerschlag, an associate scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute, in a 2007 law review article. At the same time, it’s important not to overstate the impact of Biden’s bill, said Josh Howe, a professor of history and environmental studies at Reed College. ""It's significant insofar as Biden has been more or less on top of the issue since the mid '80s. But let's not stretch the intent of the bill and suggest that this was a comprehensive plan for reducing emissions or adapting to the consequences of climatic change,"" he said. ""It was a plan to make a plan. Which, of course, neither Reagan nor Bush ultimately did."" Some historians argue that climate change and greenhouse gases were the motivation behind a provision of the Clean Air Act of 1963, according to John Reilly, an MIT professor and climate change expert.  Even if you take the view that the Clean Air Act, or Gore’s non-binding resolution, should be classified as climate change bills, Biden didn’t claim to propose the first climate change bill — rather, he claimed he was one of the first. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate staff member who is now a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute, told us Biden deserves his due. ""Without question, Biden was among the earliest supporters of climate change action in Congress,"" Bledsoe said. ""His 1987 bill was focused on forcing the Reagan Administration to establish a wide-ranging White House Task Force on Climate Change, a critical action that in fact was not taken until the Clinton Administration, so it was both prescient and influential on long-term policy."" Biden said, ""I’m one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill, way, way back in ‘87."" There had been some high-profile hearings about climate change on the Hill, as well as a non-binding resolution prior to Biden’s proposal. But he is credited with introducing the first climate change bill. We rate this True. ",/factchecks/2019/may/08/joe-biden/was-joe-biden-climate-change-pioneer-congress-hist/

Fact-checking prison capacity in Missouri
","The U.S. prison population remains a challenge, especially in Missouri, which had the eighth-highest prison population in 2017. Missouri’s prison population has been widely discussed in the state legislature with the House passing House Bill 113 on Feb. 21. Known as the Justice Safety Valve Act, the bill allows flexibility in mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenders. This reduces mandatory minimums for first-time offenders, but more importantly, it lightens the sentences for people who have already been to prison. The largest contributor to the prison population is inmate recidivism, or the re-incarceration of released inmates due to parole violation or other offenses. According to state prison data, from 2008-2012, an average of 48.1 percent of inmates returned to prison within five years of release. At a Feb. 19 hearing for legislators to discuss and amend the bill, sponsor Rep. Cody Smith, R- Jasper, said, ""On our current trajectory, we’ll be 2,000 prison beds short by 2021...We’ll need two new prisons soon, at the cost of $485 million over the next five years."" This statistic seemed surprising since Gov. Mike Parson recently announced a plan to merge two correctional centers because of a decline in inmate population. How could Missouri’s prisons be overcrowded enough to require two new facilities, but also able to consolidate buildings because of low inmate populations? We decided to find out. After reaching out to Smith’s office, we were sent to the Council of State Governments’ Justice Center. The state of Missouri partnered with the Justice Center to evaluate the prison system in 2017 the Justice Reinvestment Task Force. Smith’s numbers came from the council’s reports on Missouri’s system. The task force reported in a September 2017 presentation, ""If current trends continue, MDOC will be 2,351 prison beds short of needed capacity by the end of FY2021."" This data came from the Department of Corrections’ 2016 Offender Profile combined with its August 2017 Population Forecast. Smith also got the ""two new prisons"" part of his claim from the presentation. The homepage of the Missouri section of the Justice Center’s website says, ""the state will need to build two new prison facilities by FY2021, which will cost nearly half a billion dollars in combined construction and operating costs."" The slides from September 2017 say, ""The cost of constructing a new 1,636-bed facility (e.g., Chillicothe women’s facility) is about $175 million."" Two prisons would then cost around $350 million in construction costs alone. With operating costs, the cost climbs to about $404 million. The first three years’ operation of the facilities would bring the cost to $485 million. Sheridan Watson of the CSG’s Justice Center said that Missouri’s prison population has declined since 2017. This is due in part to June 2018’s HB 1355, which aims to help law enforcement reduce violent crime while creating better support systems of support for people with mental illness or substance abuse issues within the criminal justice system. These systems of support include counseling, drug rehabilitation, and more to help break cycles of addiction. Bills like Smith’s HB 113 also help by lowering the amount of time nonviolent inmates spend behind bars. ""However, the patterns and trends driving prison admissions and prison capacity in Missouri remain and are being addressed by the Justice Reinvestment process,"" Watson said in an email. There isn’t data yet to compare Missouri to other states in 2019, so it’s unknown where Missouri ranks. However, Karen Pojmann, communications director for the Missouri Department of Corrections, pointed out that the population ""declined from over 32,000 in 2017 to 29,500 this year,"" an eight-percent decrease. ""We’re not banking on numbers staying down, but we have introduced programs to reduce recidivism,"" Pojmann said. ""The population has dropped enough to consolidate two prisons...we have all the prison beds we need."" Smith said, ""On our current trajectory, we’ll be 2,000 prison beds short by 2021...We’ll need two new prisons soon, at the cost of $485 million over the next five years."" Smith based his statement on data from 2017. Initiatives to reduce the prison population in the state have lowered the population in the last two years. Smith’s claim needs more context. More importantly, it ignores previous changes in the law that reduced the overpopulation issue. While more progress can certainly be made to eliminate recidivism, Missouri’s situation is no longer so dire as Smith’s claim would make it appear.

No, an American Indian group did not jokingly give Donald Trump a disparaging Indian name
","A meme targeting various politicians that has circulated the internet in one iteration or another for years has resurfaced on Facebook, this time using President Trump as the butt of the joke. The post reads: ""Donald Trump addressed a major gathering of the American Indian Nation. He spoke for almost an hour about his plans for increasing every Native American’s present standard of living. Though vague in detail, he spoke about his ideas for helping his ‘red sisters and brothers.’  Afterwards, the Tribes presented him with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name, ‘Walking Eagle,’ which he proudly accepted.  After Trump left, a news reporter asked the chiefs how they came to select this name. They explained that ‘Walking Eagle’ is the name given to a bird so full of s*** it can no longer fly."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Just as this didn’t happen when John Kerry was named in the ""joke,"" or George W. Bush or Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, it also did not take place with Trump. We found the George W. Bush version of the joke in the 2008 book, ""Celebrity Smackdown: A Very Rude Joke Book"" by Luther Blisset, though it likely didn’t originate there, as there have been versions of the joke reported as early as 2004. It is simply a regurgitated joke that routinely swaps out the politician. It is just as untrue now as it was 15 years ago. We rate it Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2019/may/08/facebook-posts/no-american-indian-group-did-not-jokingly-give-don/
