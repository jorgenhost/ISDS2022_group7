Michael McCaul makes Half True claim that New York attack the ninth vehicular assault ""by ISIS""
","U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul said that when a man drove a truck into pedestrians and bicyclists in New York, killing eight, the attack fit a perilous international pattern. The Austin Republican, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, made his claim after being asked by Bret Baier of Fox News to share what he knew. McCaul replied: ""This was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS. Remember Nice (France)--we saw this happen previously."" Baier: ""So you think this is ISIS,"" the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. McCaul: ""I believe when an individual yells out, ‘Allahu akbar,’ all the indicators and hallmarks of an act of terror and, I think, yeah, that’s true in this case."" Baier asked about the difference between individuals self-radicalized or inspired by ISIS as opposed to being directed by ISIS. McCaul replied: ""You know, I think those lines are blurred now"" because of the ability of ISIS to radicalize people using online posts. We asked McCaul how he reached his conclusion that the New York attack was the ninth vehicle assault by ISIS. By email, Margaret Anne Moore, staff spokeswoman for the homeland security committee, sent a list she described as specifying eight previous ""vehicular attacks to the West by ISIS"" from March through September 2017. Asked how McCaul determined each attack was ""by ISIS,"" Moore said that in each instance, ""either ISIS claimed responsibility or the perpetrator claimed to be doing it in the name of ISIS, as reported by the press and/or local law enforcement."" The staff-provided list: 3/22/2017 – London, United Kingdom  – Westminster Bridge attack  4/7/2017 – Stockholm, Sweden – Hijacked truck attack on central street in Stockholm 6/3/2017 – London, United Kingdom – London Bridge and Borough Market attack 6/19/2017 – Paris, France – Champs-Elysee car ramming attack 8/9/2017 – Paris, France – Soldier barracks attack   8/17/2017 – Barcelona, Spain – Las Ramblas attack 8/18/2017 – Cambrils, Spain – Vehicle ramming 9/30/2017 – Edmonton, Canada – Police ramming and stabbing 10/31/2017 – New York – Lower Manhattan bike path attack McCaul’s list, limited to attacks in 2017, didn’t include the attack in Nice he mentioned on Fox News. Earlier, an April 2017 Newsweek story counted that attack among several ISIS-linked vehicle attacks; the story said that Tunisian Mohamed Bouhlel in July 2016 drove a truck into revellers in Nice celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people. Newsweek’s story also singled out Tunisian Anis Amri driving a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, killing 12 people. ISIS conducted? For our part, we reviewed news stories listed in connection with the attacks on the staff-provided list supplemented by our own finds and additional stories flagged by Moore. In most instances, we found, the stories suggest an ISIS claim to responsibility or inspiration by ISIS. A U.S. expert on terrorist attacks separately told us she saw no corroboration of ISIS being directly involved in any of the attacks tallied by McCaul’s aide. Our breakdown: In March 2017, six people died after Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians on a sidewalk near London’s Westminster Bridge. A BBC news story said the so-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack. According to an Oct. 31, 2017, ABC News story, ISIS called Masood, who was shot dead by police, ""a soldier of the Islamic State."" The next month, Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek man, drove a stolen truck into a Stockholm department store, killing four people. A BBC news account quoted Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, calling the incident a terror attack. A subsequent New York Times news story said the Islamic State had not claimed credit though it quoted Uzbekistan’s foreign minister, Abdulaziz Kamilov, saying Akilov had been recruited by the Islamic State. At a press conference, according to Reuters, Jonas Hysing, chief of national police operations, said: ""The suspect had expressed sympathy for extremist organizations, among them IS,"" described as an acronym for the ultra-hardline militant group. A subsequent news story in the Independent, a British online news service, said Akilov told authorities ​he got his ""order"" for the attack directly from Isis in Syria. In June 2017, Khuram Butt, a British national, was believed to have led a trio of terrorists who used a van to plow into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing customers in pubs and bars, killing seven people. In 2016, the Telegraph newspaper reported, Butt appeared in a documentary entitled ""The Jihadis Next Door."" ISIS claimed responsibility, ABC News reported. The same month, Karim Cheurfi drove a car into a police van on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. CNN reported that according to its affiliate, BFMTV, that the driver, shot dead by police, ""was under what is known as a ‘Fiche S’ file, a French terror/radicalization watch list composed of thousands of names, of which some are under active surveillance. Active surveillance means that they are on law enforcement's radar, not necessarily under rigorous surveillance,"" CNN said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a message posted on a jihadi channel, the New York Times reported.  Also, according to a June 2017 news story posted by The Daily Beast, the driver had mailed letters on the day of his death pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In France in August 2017, a man identified by authorities as Hamou Benlatreche allegedly injured six soldiers by driving into them at Place de Verdun, not far from the town hall in Levallois-Perret, which is home to France’s main intelligence agency. The Guardian newspaper reported that French authorities remained cautious per the driver’s motives. An August 2017 Associated Press news story quoted prosecutor Francois Molins saying Benlatreche was a member of a fundamentalist Islamic movement, Tablighi Jamaat, but there was no evidence that he had connections with ISIS members. Less than two weeks later, a driver plowed a van through crowds on Las Ramblas, Barcelona’s main pedestrian boulevard, leaving 13 people dead, CNN reported, with Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, calling it an act of ""jihadi terrorism."" CNN said ISIS' media wing, Amaq, had said the perpetrators were ""soldiers of the Islamic State"" yet ISIS hadn’t ""explicitly claimed responsibility."" The next day, police in the Spanish resort town of Cambrils, south of Barcelona, shot five people after they drove their car at pedestrians and police officers, Reuters reported. ISIS claimed responsibility in a communique, the Independent reported. In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, was accused of running down a police officer with his car and then stabbing him repeatedly on the last Saturday of September 2017. CBC News quoted Edmonton’s police chief, Rod Knecht, confirming that a black ISIS flag was seized from a car where the officer was attacked. Police said the driver fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an unsuccessful attempt to evade capture. Vehicular attacks not uncommon In December 2016, Aki Peritz, a former CIA analyst, said in a post on NPR’s website that driving a car into people in a terror attack wasn’t a new tactic nor one uniquely employed by Islamic State believers. For example, in mid-2008, at least three separate Palestinian attackers used cars and bulldozers to kill and injure multiple people in and around Jerusalem, Peritz wrote, and a Uighur militant group rammed a dump truck into a group of 70 Chinese police officers and then attacked them with machetes, killing 16. By email to our inquiry, Peritz suggested the accuracy of McCaul’s claim might turn on how you categorize attacks linked to, or inspired by, ISIS. It’s also unwise, on the other hand, to limit counts to attacks in the West, Peritz suggested. ""Do Iraqi civilians and soldiers count in this metric? ISIS has been using suicide car bombs for a long time, against military and civilian targets. Let us not be so ethnocentric as to forget those individuals as well,"" Peritz wrote. At Peritz’s suggestion, we checked on whether the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, based at the University of Maryland, tracks vehicular attacks by ISIS. A consortium spokeswoman, Jessica Stark Rivinius, replied by email that the consortium drew on news reports to identify 20 such attacks globally over the years involving vehicles employed as contact weapons--including nine attacks attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or its predecessor; four attributed to affiliated groups; and seven attributed to ISIL-inspired individuals lacking a direct link to the organization. The consortium’s list of the 20 incidents, dating from June 2007 into June 2017, shows that half a dozen occurred in Iraq with others taking place in Israel, Indonesia, Sweden, France, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada, Indonesia, Glasgow in Scotland, London, Berlin--and Columbus, Ohio, where the consortium says ISIL claimed responsibility for an assailant in 2016 ramming his vehicle into students and bystanders, though the driver’s ISIL connection couldn’t be confirmed. A 2016 background paper spells out five ways the consortium classifies attacks possibly related to ISIL; the paper further lists 30 groups as ISIS affiliates. ""In order to classify an attack as ISIL-inspired,"" the consortium says, ""we relied on statements made by the perpetrator(s) or other direct evidence (e.g., journals, social media messaging)."" An August 2017 update states: ""Several terrorist attacks in Western Europe in 2016, including two of the mass-casualty ISIL-related attacks in France and Germany, involved vehicles used as contact weapons (rather than as vehicle-borne IEDs). Although this tactic is not unprecedented, there has been a marked increase in the frequency and lethality of these attacks."" An accompanying chart depicts ups and downs in vehicular attacks since 2002, indicating spikes in deaths of late:            SOURCE: Report, ""Overview: Terrorism in 2016,"" National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, August 2017 (accessed Nov. 8, 2017) A consortium specialist, Erin Miller, told us the organization considers an attack outside of Iraq or Syria, where ISIS is known to be based, to be connected to the group only if perpetrators show, or proclaim, inspiration by the group. Miller said that it’s not enough solely for the group to claim responsibility as it did after the Westminster Bridge attack. Miller elaborated in an email: ""Likewise, in order to classify an attack outside Iraq/Syria as perpetrated by ISIL (not just ISIL-inspired individuals) we need some evidence that ISIL members they were tactically/operationally responsible. The 2015 Paris attacks are a good example of this. The actual perpetrators who orchestrated and carried out the attack were ID'd by authorities as members of ISIL."" Oft-reported claims about ISIS’s responsibility, Miller said, are typically brief and vague, for instance describing attackers as ""soldiers of the Caliphate."" She allowed, though, that this distinction splits hairs ""between the concept of responsibility in a tactical/operational sense and responsibility in an abstract philosophical sense."" At our request, Miller reviewed the list of vehicular attacks provided by McCaul’s aide. Her conclusion: The consortium wouldn’t attribute any of the nine attacks to the Islamic State itself yet up to five of the attacks may have been ISIS-inspired--those in New York, on the Champs-Elysee and London Bridge, Edmonton and maybe Stockholm. Miller suggested no corroborated ISIS connections to the attacks in Spain or those on Westminster Bridge and on soldiers in Paris. Miller cautioned too that consortium determinations for attacks after June 2017 remain preliminary ""as we haven't done the data collection for these attacks yet."" We shared Miller’s assessment with Moore, McCaul’s aide, who reaffirmed her previous broader claim than what McCaul said to Fox News: ""Based on the open-source information we provided, the Committee believes the 9 vehicular attacks the chairman cited were either claimed by ISIS or the perpetrator was inspired by ISIS."" Our ruling McCaul said the New York bike path assault ""was the ninth vehicle assault used by ISIS."" McCaul based his claim on nine 2017 attacks--none of them confirmed to have been conducted by ISIS. Regardless, it looks like more than half may have been ISIS-inspired and if you consider actions globally over time, ISIS merits blame for at least nine vehicular assaults.

Bloggers invent (another) nonsensical claim about Malia Obama, Antifa-linked arrest
","Fake news sites spread false rumors that former first daughter Malia Obama was arrested for participating in an Antifa attack — and to notch up the drama, they added that the arresting officer was found dead of a heart attack. Sure sounds suspicious, if true! But it’s not. The Last Line of Defense published an article on Nov. 4 with the headline, ""UPDATE: Malia Obama among 10 arrested In racist Antifa attack."" Another fake news site, Info Media, published an identical article that cites The Last Line of Defense as a source at the bottom. Popular News Today published a fake article on Nov. 6 that added a plot twist to the original fake news story: ""BREAKING: Cop who arrested Malia Obama found dead under suspicious circumstances."" None of this is true. The Last Line of Defense is a satirical site that tries to fool conservatives into clicking on false headlines. The author’s work, which we’ve debunked before, often ends up on other fake news sites. Beyond the site’s disclaimer, there are many other ways to show the story is fake. The article says that Malia Obama, and nine other Harvard students, attacked an elderly woman. The Cambridge Police Department daily log, an overview of the department's daily calls for service, does not mention an attack involving 10 assailants, Antifa or any of the names listed in the fake news article. The department’s News & Alerts page also does not have a post announcing the death of an Officer Patrick Farley, Malia’s fake arresting officer.

"['Education', 'Illinois', 'Chicago Public Schools']","
“CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States.”
","A Nov. 2 press release from Chicago Public Schools touted significant test score gains made in the district over recent years that were included in a high-profile analysis. Students in CPS, according to research from an expert on education equality at Stanford University, improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. The findings were clearly a plus for the often-maligned CPS, and the district wasted little time advertising them in a press release headlined, ""CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States."" The glow of that phrasing suggests that CPS has not just turned a corner when it comes to educational achievement but is dancing circles around most other school districts in the nation. Reconciling that with the district’s problem-plagued reputation merits a closer look. CPS’ fast-paced gains were assessed in a report prepared recently by Sean Reardon, a professor of education inequality at Stanford’s Center for Education Policy Analysis. By comparing Chicago Public Schools students’ scores on standardized tests to those of students nationally, Reardon found that the scores of CPS students in grades three through eight improved more from 2009-14 than did the average scores of all U.S. students during that time. Reardon used scores from a standardized test all Illinois students are required to take to measure that growth. But because other states rely on different tests to gauge the same thing, he averaged actual scores in math and English across the nation to benchmark proficiency. ""We define grade level as the average of that grade in the country,"" Reardon said in a phone interview. ""The proficiency levels that states set for their tests are defined by groups of experts that say, 'This is what we think a kid should know in this grade.’ "" By Reardon’s metric, CPS third-graders taking the test in 2014 performed significantly better than did third-graders who sat for it in 2009. The same held true for the other grades covered by the analysis as well. This improvement factored out to about two-thirds of a grade level over the five-year period for CPS, compared to an average increase for the rest of the nation of just one-sixth of a grade level in performance within that timeframe. So far, so good. But Reardon’s report posed another key question: Improvement aside, how does CPS’ overall academic performance stack up against the rest of the country? Here, the picture was not as rosy. Third- through eighth-graders in the nation’s third-largest district still perform at roughly one half to one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average, which the report describes as a ""significant concern."" In short, CPS test scores started low, improved significantly, but remain subpar. There’s no reference to that gut check in the CPS press release highlighting Reardon’s work, though the release does provide a link to the full report for those so inclined to read it. Indeed, results from the state’s most recent round of standardized tests point to significant problems at CPS, where only 22 to 30 percent of third- through eighth-graders reached proficiency in core subjects, according to data from the Illinois State Board of Education. A CPS spokesman declined to address questions about the district’s characterization of Reardon’s report. Chicago Public Schools stated that ""CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States."" The claim appears to accurately represent the main conclusion of the Stanford University report from which it was drawn. At the same time, the CPS press release touting the study’s findings omits mention of other information contained in the report that provides more context. Test scores among CPS’ third- through eighth-graders are indeed growing faster on average than the average growth rate in 96 percent of districts nationwide, according to the Stanford study. But the report also found that students in the district, which remains beset by large achievement gaps between students of different racial and socioeconomic groups, still generally perform between one-half and one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average. CPS’ claim is accurate as far as it goes, but ignores the significant gap in achievement its students still must overcome.

The False claim California has built far more prisons than colleges since 1965
","Candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin bills herself as the education candidate. She has, after all, spent her career in education - serving as a community college professor, as the state’s superintendent of public instruction and on the boards of the University of California and California State University systems. Early in her campaign, the Democratic candidate has called for a ""reinvestment in education,"" including funding for universal preschool and tuition-free college. Also on the topic of higher education, Eastin has claimed in recent months that California has failed to prioritize college construction in favor of prisons. ""We’ve built six total (college) campuses — one UC, three CSUs, two community colleges — since 1965. That’s six campuses but 23 prisons,"" Eastin said in an interview with Capital Public Radio on Oct. 16, 2017. This is not the only time Eastin has made this colleges-to-prisons comparison. In May, during her speech at the 2017 California Democratic Party State Convention, Eastin asserted that California had built ""just six colleges but 22 prisons"" since 1985. Was Eastin right? Has California built nearly four times as many prisons as colleges since 1965, or perhaps since 1985? We set out on a fact check. Our research First, we looked at prisons. The portion of Eastin’s claim about 23 prisons built since 1965 is correct, according to a chronological list produced by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Twenty-one have opened since 1985. Altogether, California operates 35 state prisons and houses about 129,000 inmates, according to a March 2017 report by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. California is also home to 12 federal prisons. But because the state is not responsible for their construction or operation, we have decided not to include them.   Colleges A glance at the history of the UC and CSU systems shows Eastin is again correct, at least on this portion of her claim: The University of California at Merced opened in 2005, the lone campus in the 10-campus UC system added since 1965. Meanwhile, the state has constructed three California State University campuses during this period: Cal State San Marcos in 1990, Cal State Monterey Bay in 1995 and Cal State Channel Islands in 2002. They are the newest additions to the 23-campus CSU system. We found, however, a glaring error on Eastin’s count of community colleges. There have been 41 of those campuses built since 1965 -- not the two she claimed in the radio interview. That’s according to a list on the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office website. See a list of the colleges below: ""I think it speaks to the important role that California community colleges play in meeting local education demand,"" said Erik Skinner, the community college system’s deputy chancellor, about the pace of construction. Skinner said the system has also opened 70 smaller community college ""satellite centers,"" across the state during this period. Nine of the system’s full-scale community colleges have been built since 1985, again far more than the two Eastin claimed for this time period in her convention speech. ""An error in good faith"" Eastin’s spokesman Jon Murchinson acknowledged the inaccuracy of the community college statistic -- a figure that greatly throws off her ""six colleges"" to ""23 prisons"" comparison. He told PolitiFact California it was ""an error in good faith as (Eastin) had heard the number from someone,"" and that she ""regrets using it without verifying the source."" He said she won’t be using it in the future. While Eastin missed the mark, a look at campus data shows the California community college system has significantly slowed its pace of construction. It built a combined 32 campuses in the 1960s and 70s but only nine in the nearly four decades after. Skinner, the system’s deputy chancellor, said construction is driven by population growth and economic conditions, which fueled the campus boom in the ‘60s and ‘70s. It has focused on adding to its existing colleges and on student completion rates in recent decades. Our ruling In a recent Capital Public Radio interview, candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin claimed the state has built only six college campuses, including two community colleges, ""but 23 prisons"" since 1965. Eastin was right in her count of state prisons. But she was way off the mark on colleges: California has opened 41 community colleges, three California State University campuses and one University of California campus for a total of 45 campuses since 1965. Eastin made a similar claim at the California Democratic Convention in May, though she used a more recent timeline. She said California had built ""just six colleges but 22 prisons"" since 1985. That statement is also inaccurate. Eastin’s campaign told us the candidate made a mistake and will correct her figures in future statements. We rate Eastin’s claim from her radio interview False.

Fake news story says Supreme Court issues bogus warrant in fictional case
","A fake news story spread by a liberal troll website said the U.S. Supreme Court issued a bench warrant for the arrest in a fictional case against the Treasury Department. ""Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever,"" read the headline on a Nov. 6, 2017, post on FreeInfoMedia.com. We saw the same article on the same day posted to FreedomJunkshun.com, the fake news site where it originated. Facebook users reported both posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. We also saw the same story on other sites. The fake story said that Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas had issued the warrant to compel a man named Donald M. Allard to testify ""on a case involving the Treasury Department’s mishandling of funds during the Obama administration."" A bench warrant is a written order by a judge authorizing the police to find someone and bring them to court. The story said Allard, described as ""a close friend and college activist friend of Barack Obama,"" had previously been found in contempt in two fictional courts. The Supreme Court wanted him to answer whether he was ""ordered by the chief executive to transfer funds from the trust fund to the general fund without the approval of Congress,"" the story said. There is no warrant, of course, just as there is no such case before the Supreme Court. The story is completely bogus. FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites and carries a disclaimer that reads, ""All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations."" Just to be sure the assertions in the story were fake, we asked a couple of legal experts whether there was any sort of case like the one described, or if the court had issued any bench warrants. Tom Goldstein, who runs SCOTUSblog.com with his wife Amy Howe, told us that ""every possible aspect of that is fiction."" Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was unaware of any bench warrant ever being issued by the Supreme Court. ""Bench warrants are issued to cause the arrest of someone who violated a court rule or showed contempt for the court, so in theory the Supreme Court could indeed issue one. But I’ve never heard of it,"" Shapiro said. ""Even in the handful of recent protest cases, the Supreme Court marshals or Capitol Police simply arrest the people on their pre-existent authority to do so."" As a final note, we have to point out the tomfoolery surrounding the name of the supposed witness, Donald M. Allard.

Flake: Roy Moore said Muslims shouldn't serve in Congress
","Until allegations of sexual misconduct emerged, the worst criticism that Roy Moore heard from Republicans in the Senate centered on his views about Islam. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was one of just two GOP senators who condemned Moore, the party’s Senate nominee in Alabama.  ""When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith, it was wrong,"" Flake said Oct. 31 on the Senate floor. ""That this same judge is now my party’s nominee for the Senate should concern us all. Religious tests have no place in the United States Congress."" Moore is known for many strong stands, including opposing homosexual marriage and defying a court ruling to remove a display of the 10 Commandments from his courtroom. But did he say that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress simply because of his faith? He did, back in 2006. That year, Moore wrote an op-ed for the website WorldNetDaily.com. Keith Ellison from Minnesota had become the first Muslim to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Moore said Ellison’s faith had no place in the government of the United States because the ""Islamic philosophy (is) directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution."" ""The Islamic faith rejects our God and believes that the state must mandate the worship of its own god, Allah,"" Moore wrote Dec. 13, 2006. ""Common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine. In 1943, we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on ‘Mein Kampf,’ or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the ‘Communist Manifesto.’ Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today!"" As far as we can tell, Moore did not take up the issue again. That is, until he was criticized for it by Flake, which Flake first did during an exchange with a Washington Post reporter on Oct. 26. Soon after that, at an event in Decatur, Ala., a reporter asked Moore if a Muslim could serve in federal office. ""Of course they can serve,"" Moore said Oct. 28. ""But they understand what they swear the Bible on, they swear to on the Bible, is the God that is not of their faith."" Moore had shifted his position, but how much remains unclear. On Oct. 31, the same day Flake spoke, Moore was on Capitol Hill. An MSNBC reporter asked him if he still thought Ellison should be ousted from Congress. ""Read my article and you’ll find out what I believe,"" Moore said. ""It’s clarified very clearly in my article."" Since Ellison's election, André Carson, D-Ind., became the second Muslim member of Congress. We reached out to Moore’s campaign and did not hear back. Flake said that Moore had expressed the belief that a ""practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith."" That’s what Moore wrote in an op-ed in 2006. He said Rep. Ellison should not be seated in Congress solely because he is a Muslim. Moore’s response to recent criticism has been equivocal. In one encounter he said that Muslims could serve in federal office. In another, he said his 2006 op-ed clearly explained his beliefs. There is no question that Flake accurately described what Moore had written.

Will 'every American' get a tax cut from House GOP bill?
","Republican lawmakers have been working to energize support for their pending tax bill by arguing that it would have a broad-based, positive impact for American taxpayers. On the Nov. 5 edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California joined the chorus. Referring to his chamber’s tax bill, McCarthy said that ""it lets every American keep more of what they earned."" This comment echoed what McCarthy had said a few days earlier, at the event where House Republican leaders officially unveiled the bill. ""Every single American is going to keep more of what they earn,"" McCarthy said at the event. However, both of McCarthy’s statements are misleading. The analysis of the bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of tax bills, does show that, on average, every income range will see a tax cut. However, that’s not the same as saying ""every American"" will see a tax cut. Some will see an increase, perhaps because of changes in the bill that scale back the mortgage-interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction.   The committee’s analysis projects that, between 2019 and 2022, the Republican tax bill would cut taxes for each of the 11 income ranges into which it breaks down taxpayers. On the smaller end, those earning less than $10,000 would see a cumulative tax decrease of $557 million for 2019. On the larger side, those earning more than $1 million would see a cumulative tax decrease of almost $41.6 billion for 2019. Here’s the full table:   However, it’s worth noting two important caveats. The joint committee found that by 2023, the tax cuts would disappear for groups with modest incomes. Specifically, those earning under $10,000 would see their taxes rise by a cumulative $100 million; those earning between $10,000 and $20,000 would see taxes rise by $638 million; those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see taxes rise by almost $1.2 billion; and those earning between $30,000 and $40,000 would see taxes rise by $653 billion.   For a sense of scale, households with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or below account for somewhere around half of households, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. These 2019 cuts show the general pattern for all income groups, but shouldn’t be taken as gospel for every individual taxpayer and family. The figures just mean that, when all the individual cuts and increases are added up, they cumulatively produce a decrease. However, some percentage of individuals in each income group may face higher taxes right away. ""Taxes go down on average for each income group in 2019, but that doesn’t mean that taxes go down for every single household,"" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. One backer of the tax bill, Grover Norquist, explained this phenomenon more accurately when he wrote a column in the Washington Examiner. The headline of his article refers to how the bill ""cuts taxes for all income levels."" McCarthy didn’t word it that carefully. So how many Americans could face tax increases under the GOP bill? Two days after McCarthy’s comment on Face the Nation, the Joint Committee on Taxation released data that provides us with a better idea. For all income groups in 2019, the committee found that 61 percent would see a tax decrease of at least $100. Another 31 percent would see a tax change of less than $100 in either direction. That leaves 8 percent of tax filers seeing a tax increase of at least $100. In other words, while most Americans would indeed see a tax cut or a minor increase in the first year, 8 percent, or roughly 14 million American households, would see an increase of at least $100. (We approximated the raw number using Tax Policy Center data.) Meanwhile, the number of Americans facing a tax increase would grow over time. By 2027, 46 percent would see a decrease and 34 percent would see a change of less than $100, but 20 percent would see a tax increase. That could mean close to 40 million Americans would pay higher taxes in 2027 than they would under today’s tax laws. The Tax Policy Center’s own analysis largely echoed what the joint committee found. In 2018, 7.3 percent of taxpayers would see a tax increase in 2018. By 2027, that percentage would rise to 26 percent. When we checked with McCarthy’s office, they didn’t back away from his previous phrasing. ""This plan reduces tax rates for every American, delivering immediate relief on income taxes on income above the standard deduction,"" said spokesman Matt Sparks. ""And throughout their lives, this bill will let every American keep more of what they earn because the deductions, preferences, and carve-outs that are being eliminated are available to taxpayers in only a small number of years, while the benefit of lower rates and higher standard deduction are available to everyone, every year."" McCarthy said the Republican tax bill ""lets every American keep more of what they earned."" By the Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis, the tax bill does, on average, produce tax cuts for each of the 11 income groups it studied. But that’s not what McCarthy repeatedly said -- that it would produce a tax cut for ""every American."" Individual taxpayers’ situations will be affected differently by provisions in the bill, and for 2018 alone, the committee found that 8 percent of taxpayers would pay more in taxes. That translates to millions of Americans. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2017/nov/09/kevin-mccarthy/will-every-american-get-tax-cut-house-gop-bill/
"['Ethics', 'Illinois', 'Michael  Madigan']","
Madigan’s ethics panel (mal)function
","An open letter alleging years of flagrant sexual harassment by members of the Illinois General Assembly toward female lobbyists and others sent lawmakers scrambling to ensure such behavior would not be tolerated going forward.

House Speaker Michael Madigan appeared at a House committee hearing to introduce new legislation that adds specific language on sexual harassment to state employee and lobbyist ethics laws. It also sets up required training and reporting procedures on sexual harassment for state elected officials, lobbyists and employees.

But another speaker at the same hearing said this action, though laudable, was arriving far too late. In emotional testimony, crime victim advocate Denise Rotheimer delivered detailed allegations of improper behavior toward her by Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, as she worked with him to get a bill passed in the legislature.

Rotheimer described a circuitous path as she tried to file a complaint about Silverstein’s alleged harassment only to see her case gather dust. Normally, such complaints would go to the Office of Legislative Inspector General, but there has been no legislative inspector general since Dec. 31, 2014. It was the responsibility of the House and Senate to fill the vacancy, but it never got done. Madigan, however, said the lack of an inspector general for just shy of three years was no cause for alarm.

""It’s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general, but I think it’s important to know that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function,"" Madigan said. He said the ethics commission’s executive director, Randy Erford, ""has provided for the commission to continue to function"" and had fielded 26 complaints since 2015. Madigan also said the commission is empowered to appoint a temporary inspector general, but had not done so. This made little sense to us. How could the ethics commission ""continue to function"" in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it? Isn’t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations? And if it was functioning, why did Rotheimer’s case languish until she went public with her allegations? We should note up front that no sooner did Madigan conclude his testimony than lawmakers moved swiftly to get an inspector general in place. In a meeting on Saturday, Nov. 4, the eight-member Legislative Ethics Commission voted unanimously to appoint former Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie B. Porter as temporary legislative inspector general through June 30. So Illinois now has someone to receive and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Just three days later, on Nov. 7, the General Assembly passed legislation revising the ethics code that applies to elected officials, state employees and lobbyists to include clear language specifying behavior that qualifies as sexual harassment. It also waived the one-year statute of limitations that would have nullified complaints filed more than a year before Porter’s appointment. A day after Rotheimer’s testimony, Silverstein stepped down from his Majority Caucus Chair leadership post -- which added $20,649 to Silverstein’s annual base pay of $67,836 -- as Cullerton prepared to remove him. But none of this erases the nearly three-year void in which no one was assigned to field and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. As described on the Legislative Ethics Commission’s website and in Illinois statutes, the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a Legislative Inspector General. This includes conducting administrative hearings and making rulings ""only upon the receipt of pleadings filed by the Legislative Inspector General and not upon its own prerogative… Any other allegations of misconduct received by the Commission from a person other than the Legislative Inspector General shall be referred to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General."" Madigan said the commission had continued to receive reports -- 26 of them, though published reports said there were 27 -- even when there was no inspector general. But the law makes clear that those allegations were to be referred to the inspector general. Further, the law says the commission can act on cases only after they have gone through the inspector general. Other duties listed on the commission’s site pertain to administrative functions like publishing manuals and guides, submitting reports, employee training and preparing public information materials on ethics compliance. By law, the commission is required to meet monthly or ""as often as necessary."" Those would not be impeded by lack of an inspector general. The office of Legislative Inspector General had been vacant since Jan 1, 2015. Though Illinois law says the legislative inspector general is to be appointed by ""joint resolution of the Senate and the House,"" lawmakers never filled the vacancy. Republicans had accused Madigan, generally regarded as the most powerful politician in Springfield, if not the entire state, of sandbagging the appointment. Illinois News Network quoted ethics commission member Rep. Chad Hays, R-Catlin, voicing that complaint: On his Facebook page, Hays said he and another ethics commissioner, Rep. Norine Hammond, pressed for the inspector general position to be filled.

""My read on the matter is that the Speaker has thwarted efforts to finalize this dynamic,"" Hays said. ""No rationale for foot dragging on this matter is acceptable. The length of time that the position has remained unoccupied is absurd."" Madigan spokesman Steve Brown called allegations that Madigan impeded a permanent replacement ""baseless."" Senate President John Cullerton on Nov. 1 said in a press release that three candidates for the job had turned it down in the past year: ""It’s our duty to fill that post. I take responsibility for my role in that lapse, and I apologize for it,"" Cullerton said. ""These corrective actions are a first step in changing an unacceptable culture that has existed for too long."" Madigan said the Illinois Legislative Ethics Commission continued to function for nearly three years while the Office of Legislative Inspector General was vacant. To the extent that the eight-member commission continued to schedule monthly meetings and saw to internal matters, it did ""continue to function."" This included its executive director receiving numerous reports of alleged ethics violations. But without an inspector general, it could not function in its capacity to take substantive action on alleged ethics violations. This is why Denise Rotheimer’s complaint saw no action until she went public with her allegations in a House committee hearing. There’s an element of truth in Madigan’s statement but there’s a lot more that’s missing. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/nov/09/michael-madigan/madigans-ethics-panel-malfunction/

Adam Putnam right about the demand for more nurses in Florida
","In the Florida governor’s race, both Republicans and Democrats have highlighted an issue facing the Sunshine State: a shortage of nurses. For months now, Republican Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam has highlighted a surprising factoid about Florida’s nursing workforce, often while emphasizing the importance of trade education and career training outside of a four-year bachelor’s degree. ""The No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing,"" Putnam said Oct. 31 during a campaign stop at Whitey's Fish Camp in Fleming Island. Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (and Putnam’s possible opponent) has also mentioned a nursing shortage in the state, so we wanted to take a look at it. We found that Putnam’s claim is backed up by state data, and experts in Florida agreed that the shortage of nurses has been a problem since the 1990s. Data from the Department of Economic Opportunity shows that registered nurses have consistently topped the lists of monthly online job advertisements and annual job openings. Department spokeswoman Karen Smith told PolitiFact Florida the top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years. We asked for a sample of that data and got a year’s worth of monthly reports for Help Wanted OnLine, a tool used by the Department to measure real-time labor demand. These reports are posted on the DEO’s site and updated monthly. The most recent month of data (October 2017) shows there were 13,619 online ads placed for registered nurses. The second-most popular ads sought retail salespersons at 7,207 postings, followed by ""first-line supervisors"" for retail sales workers with 6,467 ads. Putnam has also talked about the need for truck drivers, which place fourth for online job ads. In addition, Florida's Statewide Demand Occupations List shows that registered nurses have consistently ranked as the most in-demand occupation since at least 2011. Mary Lou Brunell is the executive director of the Florida Center for Nursing, which was set up in 2001 by the Florida Legislature to address the nursing shortages in the state. In recent years, she said the problem has been exacerbated by a lack of students studying to become nurses, a shortage of faculty teaching future students, and an aging workforce and state population. ""You put all those pieces together, and it’s just not getting better,"" said Dianne Morrison-Beedy, the former dean at the University of South Florida College of Nursing. The nursing workforce is also aging. According to a 2017 report from the Florida Center for Nursing, 44 percent of registered nurses are over the age of 50 and expected to retire in the next 5 to 10 years. The economic turnaround in the late 2000s also decreased the number of nurses in the workforce. When the economy plummeted in 2008, many people trained in nursing but not working returned to their job or delayed retirement. As the economy improved, there were once again more vacancies because those nurses returned home or retired. Brunell also said she’s also concerned about the need for licensed practical nurses, which work under the guidance of registered nurses or physicians. She said there’s been an increase in home care facilities, which is why she predicts more licensed practical nurses (LPNs) will be needed in the future. Morrison-Beedy said that in order to fix the problem, the focus has to be on the how to develop faculty and support for people who want to become nurses. In Florida, becoming a registered nurse requires either a two-year associate degree or a bachelor’s of science degree in nursing. ""We need more students in the baccalaureate program, we need to provide financial support for students to go to school, and in order to do that we have to have enough faculty to teach those students,"" she said. ""We want the best educated and the best kind of nurses because that’s where we’ll see better outcomes."" Putnam said the No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing. He’s right. The top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years. Experts agreed that the shortage has been an issue for awhile in Florida.

"['Bipartisanship', 'Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Wisconsin', 'Dan Kohl']","
Is Wisconsin's Glenn Grothman, as his rival claims, the most-partisan member of the U.S. House?
","In 21 years as a state lawmaker, Republican U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman was known for making provocative comments, such as: Homosexuality should not be discussed in sex education classes and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday is ""an insult"" to taxpayers. Grothman’s remarks have gotten less attention since he was elected in 2014 to a House seat in east-central Wisconsin that has been safely Republican for decades. So, it was a surprise when Grothman, who is seeking a third House term in 2018, said he is facing the toughest race of his political career against Democrat Dan Kohl. Kohl himself isn’t well known, though he is the nephew of multimillionaire and former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis. A mantra of Kohl’s campaign -- that Grothman ""is the single-most partisan member of the House"" --  is something we want to check. The charge (sometimes with the word Congress instead of House) appeared as recently as Nov. 7, 2017 on Kohl’s campaign Facebook page. And it is one he has made repeatedly, including on TV, on Twitter, in a campaign video and in his campaign announcement. As we’ll see, there’s a solid source to back up the claim. But its data is nearly a year old and it acknowledges it uses only one way to measure partisanship. One ranking The latest Bipartisan Index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan House member, ahead of only Kansas Republican Tim Huelskamp. Kohl argues that Grothman is currently the most-partisan because Huelskamp, who lost his run for re-election in 2016, is no longer in the House. But the rankings are for the 114th Congress, which covers Grothman’s first two-year term in the House (2015-’16). They don’t take into account any activity since 2016, including any new member now in a first term. The rankings are done by the Lugar Center, a think tank formed by Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican who served in the U.S. Senate from 1977 to 2013; and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. The rankings have been reported on by Politico, The Hill, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Roll Call and other media that cover Congress. The index measures bipartisanship in two ways -- the frequency with which members of Congress sponsor bills that include at least one co-sponsor from the opposing party and co-sponsor bills introduced by members of the opposing party. As the Journal Sentinel has reported, it’s just one of many ways to define bipartisanship, but it’s a concrete, quantifiable measure of the effort members make at the front end of the legislative process to work across party lines. According to the Bipartisan Index, during the 2015-’16 session, Grothman sponsored eight qualifying bills, none of which gained a single Democrat co-sponsor; and co-sponsored 276 qualifying bills, only nine of which were introduced by a Democrat. Other measures Grothman’s House office noted that GovTrack.us, which tracks Congress, also does bipartisanship rankings. We found two for House members for the 2015-’16 session, though each is less comprehensive than the Bipartisan Index. One had the same finding as the Bipartisan Index -- that Grothman did not introduce any bill that had a Democratic cosponsor. For the percentage of bills cosponsored by each legislator that were introduced by a member of the other party, Grothman ranked fifth from the bottom.

Grothman's office also cited to us a number of Grothman’s bipartisan actions, all during 2017, including: Grothman expressing disagreement with fellow Republicans over legislation; working with U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, on legislation for refinancing student loans; and co-sponsoring a GOP-sponsored bill, also supported by Democrats, to legalize hemp. Our rating Kohl says Grothman ""is the single-most partisan member of the House."" One widely noted index ranked Grothman as the second-most partisan member during the 2015-’16 congressional session, above only a member who is no longer in the House. That arguably makes Grothman the most-partisan currently. But the index is only one way of defining partisanship, and it doesn’t account for any House member activity after 2016. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. div class='artembed'>",/factchecks/2017/nov/08/dan-kohl/wisconsins-glenn-grothman-his-rival-claims-most-pa/

A closer look at the classroom-expenses deduction for teachers: How big is it?
","As congressional Republicans tout the benefits of their party’s tax proposal, Democratic lawmakers are trying to pick the bill apart, provision by provision. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took aim at one specific element of the bill that is of interest to many K-12 teachers. ""Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses,"" Feinstein tweeted on Nov. 6. Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses.   She’s referring to a provision in the tax code that allows teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was expanded and made permanent in December 2015. The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans would have scrapped the deduction. Feinstein’s tweet was retweeted at least 26,000 times, and received at least 34,000 likes. The California Democrat has a point in her tweet, though we found two elements of it that are worthy of some caution. The $1.6 billion figure stems from a study by the National School Supply and Equipment Association. The study found that ""on average, teachers reported spending about $149 of their own money on school supplies, $198 on instructional materials, and $138 on other classroom materials for a total of $485 in the 2012-2013 school year."" Note the time frame: The study goes back five years. To be fair, there has been at least one more recent survey along these lines, from 2016 by a group called AdoptAClassroom.org. This study offers a higher figure for out-of-pocket classroom spending by teachers -- $600 a year. But if Feinstein had used the $600 figure, she would worsened the second, and more significant, problem with her tweet. As we noted above, the limit for deducting unreimbursed classroom expenditures is $250 per teacher. So of that $485 spent out-of-pocket by the average teacher, $235 would not be deductible. (Teachers who itemize also can deduct more than that, but only if the out-of-pocket amounts are especially large, meaning few would qualify to do so.) If you adjust the calculation to take that into account, the approximate value of the lost deduction would be $825 million, not the $1.6 billion Feinstein cited in her tweet. Feinstein’s office said they sent out a subsequent tweet that provided some more specificity. That tweet said, ""The average teacher spends $500 per year on school supplies. Republican plan says they can't deduct even $250 from their tax bill. Terrible!"" The average teacher spends $500 per year on school supplies. Republican plan says they can't deduct even $250 from their tax bill. Terrible!   For what it’s worth, that tweet sent about three hours later attracted only a fraction of the attention the earlier tweet received -- 4,600 retweets and 8,600 likes. Finally, we should note that the $825 million figure is a maximum amount that could theoretically be deducted. In reality, not every teacher who qualifies for this deduction takes advantage of it, for whatever reason. The Treasury Department estimates that in tax year 2016, the classroom expense deduction reduced federal tax revenue by $210 million. That makes Feinstein's $1.6 billion figure even more overstated.  Feinstein tweeted, ""Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses."" She has a point that the GOP plan would get rid of the existing deduction for out-of-pocket classroom expenses for teachers. But the tweet overstates the value of the deduction in two ways -- first, because only a portion of that amount can actually be deducted under the law, and second, because not all teachers use the deduction. We rate the statement Half True. CORRECTION, Nov. 7, 2017, 7:30 p.m.: After this article was published, several readers informed us that teachers do not have to itemize to benefit from this deduction. Any qualified teacher can reduce their taxable income by $250 off the top, whether they itemize or not. Some teachers with very large out-of-pocket expenses may be able to deduct additional amounts if they itemize. We have changed the article to reflect this. The rating remains the same.",/factchecks/2017/nov/07/dianne-feinstein/closer-look-classroom-expenses-deduction-teachers-/

Donald Trump wrongly repeats that Chicago has strongest gun laws
","President Donald Trump might be in Asia, but violence on the homefront followed him to South Korea. In a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a reporter asked Trump if he would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas church. Trump said a longer waiting period would have made no difference and then drew on a familiar talking point. ""You look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,"" Trump said. Trump used this line during the presidential campaign, with particular emphasis on Chicago’s high murder rate. Our partners at PolitiFact Illinois said he had a point about the murders, but his description of the Windy City having the toughest gun laws was way off the mark. Since then, the administration has taken the line even further into inaccurate territory. Here’s why. There are two ways to measure the toughness of gun laws. You can look at the rules controlling gun ownership and the penalties for misuse of a weapon. From 1982 to 2010, Chicago prohibited people from keeping handguns in their homes. When Washington, D.C., saw a similar ban overturned, Chicago did have the toughest gun law in the country. That lasted about two years. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Chicago ordinance in 2010. The plaintiffs in the case of McDonald vs. City of Chicago argued that the ban left them vulnerable to criminals, and the court agreed. The court said that the Second and 14th Amendments protected the right to bear arms and that neither Chicago nor Illinois could interfere with that. At one time, the state of Illinois prevented gun owners from carrying a concealed weapon. That ended in 2013 when the state became the last in the country to allow the practice. To get a gun in Chicago, you must take a firearms training class and get a Chicago firearms permit. The course costs between $100 and $150 and the permit costs $100. You would also need a state firearms owner identification card, which can take as many as 50 days for processing. It’s harder and requires more time to do the same in New York. It takes about three to six months to get a permit and costs over $400. And unlike Chicago, New York runs its own concealed carry permit process, as does Los Angeles. Chicago also isn't particularly tough when it comes to enforcement. A 2014 Chicago Sun Times analysis found that Chicago judges tended to hand down the minimum sentence of one year for illegal gun possession while the maximum is three years. Felons with a weapon got four-year sentences on average while they could have received 10. On the state level, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control group, gives many states higher rankings for restricting gun ownership and use. A total of seven states, including New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, California and Hawaii, have rules that go beyond what Illinois has. The group said Illinois could bring up its score if it allowed local governments to pass gun laws, required guns be stored safely at home and gave local law enforcement more leeway to deny conceal carry permits. The one area where Chicago is trying to reduce access to weapons is by not allowing gun stores or firing ranges to open within the city limits. So far, courts have ruled against Chicago. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said Chicago has the strongest gun laws in the nation. The statement is years out of date. After a Supreme Court ruling, Chicago residents can own handguns and carry them unseen on the streets. A national gun control group puts seven states above Illinois in regulating gun ownership. Trump needs to refresh this talking point. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2017/nov/07/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-repeats-chicago-has-strongest-gun-la/

Warner says Gillespie's firm lobbied for brutal dictator
","A new ad by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner tags Republican challenger Ed Gillespie as ""million dollar lobbyist"" and links him to a notorious client. ""His firm even lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes,"" narrator says. We decided to take a look. The dictator Although the ad doesn’t name the dictator, it leaves no doubt of his identity. The screen flashes an Ivory Coast flag and a headline from the Daily Mail in England on April 12, 2011 saying ""Defiant dictator arrested."" That article detailed the overthrow and capture of Laurent Gbagbo, who had ruled the Ivory Coast since 2000 and is now awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. The West African nation faced violent division during Gbagbo’s reign and for years, the ruler resisted international pressure to stand for reelection.   Gillespie, meanwhile, co-founded his lobbying firm in 2000 with Democrat Jack Quinn, a former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore. On Nov. 10, 2004, Quinn Gillespie and Associates signed a six-month contract, worth $510,000, with the Ivory Coast to improve the nation’s relations with the United States. Among other things, the firm agreed to organize a visit to Washington for Gbagbo and meetings with U.S. leaders. You won’t find Gillespie’s signature on the contract, however. That’s because he was absent from the firm for almost two years when the contract was signed, according to Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman. Logan said Gillespie went on leave in January 2003 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee and didn’t return until March 2005. The contract and the firm’s subsequent federal disclosure that it was representing a foreign agent was signed by Quinn. The firm’s work for Gbagbo started Dec. 22, 2004 and ended June 30, 2005, according to a disclosure statement it filed with the U.S. Department of Justice. Jeffrey Connaughton, then vice chairman of Quinn Gillespie, told The New Yorker in 2012 that firm was hoping to demonstrate that Gbagbo was willing to have free and fair elections. Those hopes soured, the article said, when Connaughton flew to the Ivory Coast, met with Gbagbo, and concluded the leader ""had no interest in democracy -- he just wanted P.R."" Connaughton sent us a statement, which he also gave to The Washington Post, saying Gillespie made it ""clear"" when the firm started that he would not represent foreign governments. ""He was at the RNC when I decided to take the lead on Ivory Coast, so if anyone had checked with (the firm) or me, we would have confirmed that Ed had absolutely nothing to do with it."" Gbagbo finally agreed to hold elections in November 2010, but lost to Alassane Ouattara, refused to give up power and ignited a civil war. Gbagbo was arrested in May when French and rebel forces took control of the capital, Abidjan. He has been sent to The Hague, where International Criminal Court has charged him with four counts of being an indirect co-perpetrator of violent acts committed his troops. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 3,000 people were killed and 150 women were raped during the six-month crisis. Other nations Warner’s ad also flashes the flags of four other countries it says Gillespie’s firm represented. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman, backed the claim by sending us Quinn Gillespie disclosure forms. They showed the company worked for: Pakistan from April 2006 to April 2008 Costa Rica from a few weeks near the end of 2006 Macedonia from April 2007 to April 2008 Bosnian Serb Republic from January 2007 through December 2007 The firm reported earning a total of $3 million from all five nations. For perspective, Quinn Gillespie was paid $52.3 million by domestic clients from 2006 to 2008, according OpenSecrets.org. The payments from foreign nations came to 5.4 percent of the firm’s revenues during the three years. Gillespie says he’s never personally lobbied for a foreign government and the records back him up. Disclosure forms filed by the firm do not list him on its lobbying team for any of the nations. The teams generally had Democratic lobbyists, as indicated by their campaign donations, which were part of the disclosures. Gillespie left the firm in June 2007 to work in President George W. Bush’s administration. The company continued its relationship with Bosnia and Macedonia after his departure and signed new contracts with Japan and Indonesia. Our ruling Warner’s ad says Gillespie’s ""firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes."" The ad -- which is carefully worded -- has a point that Gillespie’s firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including the Ivory Coast, whose former ruler, Gbagbo, is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court. But the ad’s effort to link Gillespie to a brutal dictator lacks important context. Gillespie had been on leave from the firm for more than a year when the Ivory Coast deal was signed.  None of the company’s federal disclosures indicate Gillespie was involved in the representation of any foreign clients, and Gbagbo was charged with crimes against humanity for events that happened in 2010 and 2011, well after the firm’s relationship with the Ivory Coast ended. While there’s accuracy to Warner’s claim, it leaves out vital details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/24/mark-warner/warner-says-gillespies-firm-lobbied-brutal-dictato/

EMILY's List: Scott Walker is forcing some women to get transvaginal ultrasounds to get an abortion
","In backing Mary Burke in the Nov. 4, 2014 election for governor, at least three abortion rights organizations have produced ads highlighting Gov. Scott Walker’s opposition to abortion. But one TV ad from EMILY’s List, a Washington, D.C.-based group, might be the most blunt. Halfway into the 30-second spot, released Oct. 21, 2014, the narrator says Walker ""is forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion."" As the words are spoken, a headline appears on the screen that reads: ""Scott Walker endorses mandating transvaginal ultrasounds."" It is made to look like a newspaper headline, but it comes from an article on the left-leaning Think Progress blog. A medical device is also shown. A series of readers asked us to check the claim. ""Transvaginal"" is the attention-grabbing word in the claim. But as we’ll see, the reference to ""some women"" is important, too. Abortion and ultrasounds The ad alludes to a July 2013 Wisconsin law that requires women seeking an abortion to get an ultrasound -- either transabdominally, which is done externally, or transvaginally. Wisconsin is among two dozen states that require an ultrasound before an abortion is performed. In Wisconsin, exceptions are made in cases of sexual assault or medical emergency. The governor’s office praised the measure, saying it ""improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future."" The law was opposed by the Wisconsin Medical Society, among others. The society said the measure as a ""direct infringement on the patient-physician relationship"" and for injecting ""non-evolving government mandates into medical science."" (Another part of the law, which would require doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, has been blocked in an ongoing court battle.) As we turn to the EMILY’s List claim, one note: The use of ultrasounds among abortion providers is not new, even though the Wisconsin law requiring them is. A couple of weeks after Walker signed the measure, the clinic director and another worker at Affiliated Medical Services, a Milwaukee abortion provider, noted in an opinion piece in the Huffington Post that their clinic has ""always"" required ultrasounds.  ""If you go to an abortion clinic that doesn't insist on an ultrasound, you should walk out the door. It's just bad medicine,"" they wrote. The Milwaukee clinic workers also pointed out, however, that the Wisconsin law does not require a transvaginal ultrasound and that they would have opposed that requirement. They said their clinic only does transvaginal ultrasounds when it is deemed medically necessary -- in cases of early pregnancy, morbid obesity, or ""anatomical variants"" in the uterus.
  Tracy Weitz, associate professor and director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco, said that nationally, transvaginal ultrasounds are routine among abortion providers in the early stages of pregnancy. They can verify a pregnancy as early as four weeks, meaning women don’t have to wait through weeks of pregnancy symptoms and distress before choosing to have an abortion, she wrote. Evidence for the claim As we’ve indicated, the law Walker signed does not mandate a transvaginal ultrasound -- though the headline used in the ad says Walker endorsed mandating that procedure. Rather, the law requires ""an ultrasound on the pregnant woman using whichever transducer the woman chooses"" -- either transvaginal or transabdominal -- according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Council. But there is more to consider. Under the law, the person doing the ultrasound must tell the pregnant woman during the procedure ""what the ultrasound is depicting,"" including the ""dimensions of the unborn child and a description of any external features and internal organs that are present and viewable on the image."" The person must also display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view them, but the woman can’t be forced to view them. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin told us that only a transvaginal ultrasound would enable a clinician to meet the requirements of the law for early-stage pregnancies, up to 12 weeks. And according to an August 2014 report from the state Department of Health Services, 84 percent of abortions in Wisconsin are performed at 12 weeks or less. EMILY’s List, meanwhile, noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says transvaginal ultrasound often is used in early pregnancy, whereas transabdominal ultrasound often is used after about 10 weeks of pregnancy. And the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights, says ""routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary as a component of first-trimester abortion.""
  Barbara Lyons, the former executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion, told us that even if a medical situation indicates that a woman seeking an abortion should get a transvaginal ultrasound, the woman still has the final say and the Wisconsin law doesn’t mandate one over the other.  ""In the end, she gets to make the decision,"" Lyons said. ""There is no mandate."" To sum up: The law doesn’t mandate a transvaginal ultrasound. But for some women, the fact that an ultrasound is required means they would have to get the transvaginal procedure, rather than a transabdominal one, in order to get an abortion. Our rating In a TV ad, EMILY’s List said Walker is ""forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion,"" while an image on the screen said Walker ""endorses mandating transvaginal ultrasounds.""   The law doesn’t mandate transvaginal ultrasounds, rather it says the woman seeking an abortion can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound. But medical professionals say that the new requirement, as a practical matter, means some women have to get a transvaginal ultrasound. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.

Nearly all Wisconsin job creators say state going in right direction, GOP group says
","The Republican State Leadership Committee, a Washington, D.C.-based group that works to elect GOP lieutenant governors and other ""down-ballot"" state officials, is new to PolitiFact. And it is newly making an eye-popping claim -- albeit one quite similar to a claim we rated more than a year and a half ago. In a Wisconsin radio ad released Oct. 9, 2014, the GOP group promotes the campaign of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who is running on the ticket with Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 4, 2014 election. They face Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke and her running mate, state Sen. John Lehman of Racine. The ad makes a number of boasts about the Walker-Kleefisch administration, including this one: ""95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction."" That's decidedly favorable; but, the way the group states it, also misleading. Previous claim Walker made a similar claim in February 2012, saying 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state ""is heading in the right direction"" and a majority say they will ""grow their companies in 2012."" We rated his statement Half True. Both numbers were correct. But they came from a small survey by the pro-Walker Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of some of its members. The December 2011 survey of 281 chief executive officers amounted to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. For example, a majority of the survey respondents were manufacturing executives, but manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. Walker, however, presented the statistics without noting the critical limitations. New survey WMC does its survey every other year. The latest one was conducted in November and December of 2013. This time, 95 percent of 341 CEOs said the state was going in the right direction. And that's the survey the national GOP group relies on in making its claim. But that claim has the same problems as the one Walker made. Our rating The Republican State Leadership Committee said: ""95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction."" The number is correct, but it comes from a small survey by one trade group and amounts to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of state businesses. We rate the claim Half True.

Allan Fung: Former R.I. Gov. Donald Carcieri has not been campaigning with me
","The ill-fated 38 Studios loan guarantee took up the biggest block of time during the Oct. 21 Providence Journal-WPRI-12 debate between the three candidates for Rhode Island governor, and part of the focus was Donald Carcieri, the former Republican governor who shepherded the deal. Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung sparred over who had fought hardest against the loan. Raimondo said she fought the deal from the beginning, but said Fung, who was Cranston’s mayor at the time, ""was silent."" Then she went a step further. ""In fact,"" Raimondo said, ""a week ago, he was campaigning with Governor Carcieri, the architect of this."" Fung's response a few minutes later: ""Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with me, so that's false."" It would be surprising if the two had campaigned together because Carcieri, who is widely criticized for his role in the 38 Studios deal, has been keeping a low profile. Because Fung had the last word in the exchange, we decided to assess his denial. We were also motivated by a ""fungfacts Fact Check"" news release from Rhode Island Democratic Party spokesman Peter Baptista, which claimed to prove that Fung lied. The news release said Carcieri attended a fundraiser for Fung that featured Mitt Romney and noted that Carcieri was on Fung’s gubernatorial exploratory committee. We know it can be difficult to prove that something didn't happen, but here are the facts. Carcieri did attend the Oct. 16 fundraiser for Fung that featured Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate, who served as Massachusetts' governor from 2003 to 2006. But most people would define campaigning with someone as being out and about with the candidate, meeting people, shaking hands, and trying to convince them to vote for the candidate and/or give money. Serving on an exploratory committee or attending a fundraiser as a spectator does not constitute campaigning with a candidate, at least not in the way Raimondo made it sound. Fung spokesman Robert Coupe said, ""Governor Carcieri contributed to the campaign and he attended the lunch with Governor Romney last week. He has had no 'role' in the campaign. Prior to Mayor Fung's announcement, Governor Carcieri was a member of the exploratory committee."" We also contacted Carcieri directly. ""Both my wife and I have contributed to Allan and support him, but that's the whole extent. I have not campaigned with him,"" the former governor said. ""I know what campaigning is. I did enough of it."" Carcieri said he went to the event to see Romney ""because Mitt and I go back to when we first came into office together, and we worked very closely together as New England governors. I was a big supporter for both of his runs for the presidency, and I hadn't seen him or talked to him in a while, so it was an opportunity to catch up and visit a little bit, which we did."" We asked the Raimondo campaign if they had any better evidence that, for example, Carcieri addressed the crowd at the fundraising event. Spokeswoman Nicole Kayner produced a photo taken outside the Providence Biltmore of Carcieri going in, and cited a report in The Providence Journal that said: ""Through the closed doors of the ballroom, cheers followed mention of both Fung’s name and that of the state’s last Republican governor, Donald Carcieri."" But that’s pretty weak evidence for a loaded claim. In summary, we could find no convincing evidence that former Gov. Donald Carcieri has been campaigning with Allan Fung. Until we do, we rate Fung's statement True.

"['Georgia', 'States', 'Nathan Deal']","
Deal correct: Carter hasn't passed a bill
","Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has accused Democratic challenger Jason Carter of lacking the political chops for the job. During two recent debates, Deal asked Carter why he never assumed even minor leadership roles as a state senator or sponsored a successful bill in his tenure under the Gold Dome. ""You’ve been in the (state) Senate since I’ve been governor, and you’ve never passed a bill,"" Deal said in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. ""Why would anybody decide you have the leadership skills needed to lead this state?"" PolitiFact decided to delve deeper into Deal’s claim that Carter never passed a bill. Carter, an attorney and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, was elected in May 2010 to replace state Sen. David Adelman of Atlanta, who resigned to become the U.S. ambassador to Singapore. A few months later, Deal, a longtime congressman, was elected to succeed Sonny Perdue, Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Now, Carter, 39, is hoping to unseat Deal, 72, in the Nov. 4 general election. A loss for Deal would be a major upset for Republicans who have been solidly in control at the Capitol for about a decade. But what about the governor’s claim? A search of the Georgia General Assembly’s records shows Deal is correct. In four years in the state Senate, Carter was primary sponsor of 11 bills, more than half dealing with the popular HOPE scholarship or other education issues. None of the bills became law and only one cleared the state Senate. But is it a sign that he was an ineffective lawmaker? There’s no proof of that. Democrats are in the minority in the General Assembly and so are rarely able to pass legislation. (The same was true for Republicans until, starting with Perdue, the state took a 180-degree turn politically.) Steve Anthony, a lecturer in the political science department at Georgia State University, said it’s ""common"" that the party with an absolute majority banishes the minority to near irrelevance. He should know. He was the longtime chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was the nation’s longest-serving state House speaker. ""Many Republicans would say they are doing just what Tom Murphy used to do to them,"" Anthony said. ""It’s a game. It’s what’s done in politics, at least on the state level."" There’s one more point to consider: getting a bill passed and signed is not all that easy, regardless of party. In the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, members of the House and Senate introduced 2,514 bills. Of those, only 774 passed, and 757 became law. Most of the successful bills emerge from the leadership, Anthony said. That leaves the bulk of rank-and-file lawmakers, including Carter, to end up as co-sponsors to legislation. Co-sponsoring is the act of a lawmaker attaching his or her name to a pending proposal to show support or backing. And in that capacity, Carter found some success. The Atlanta Democrat co-sponsored 21 bills that became law, records show. In some cases, members of the minority party co-sponsor bills that are their idea but require a member from the party in charge to be the official sponsor to get the measure passed. Whether a lawmaker has been a bill’s co-sponsor can be a serious question for voters. But, to Deal’s point, snagging co-sponsors often has little to no impact on whether a bill gets passed. Case in point: State Rep. Mark Hatfield got 93 of the 180 members in the House to co-sponsor his 2011 proposal that would force presidential and vice presidential candidates to prove their citizenship before landing on the Georgia ballot. The bill, inspired by the ""birther"" movement, which believes President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, ultimately lost more than 25 of those backers and failed to move to a floor vote. There have recently been high-profile exceptions to the significance of co-sponsors, such as Deal’s effort to revamp the HOPE scholarship program with House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat. Few Democrats are able to earn that sort of recognition. More common, Anthony said, would be a tactic long used when a good idea surfaces. If the proposal is from the opposition, the majority hijacks the idea and makes some changes to qualify it as a new bill – and takes the credit. Carter, a staunch critic of changes Deal made to the HOPE scholarship program, says that happened to him in 2013. He was concerned that tech school students were being hurt by a decision to raise the GPA requirement for HOPE recipients from a 2.0 to a 3.0. He and a House Democrat introduced separate bills to return to the lower GPA requirement. Their bills went nowhere. But their idea caught on and emerged in an almost identical and successful bill with a Republican as chief sponsor. ""It's definitely harder to pass a bill in the minority. It takes time and it takes working with the opposition -- something that younger legislators probably haven't accomplished yet,"" said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Deal, he said, is trying to say something about Carter’s relative youth and inexperience.""You just got here, and already you want to be governor?"" Our conclusion: Deal is right. Jason Carter hasn’t been the chief author of a bill that’s made it through the General Assembly. But that’s a fate most out-of-power Democrats face, as did Republicans in the decades they were in the same boat. That’s context the reader needs. We rate the statement as Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2014/oct/24/nathan-deal/deal-correct-carter-hasnt-passed-bill/

Cruz: Obama's surgeon general pick is not a 'health professional'
","The lack of a surgeon general -- the federal government’s top public health spokesperson -- has become a point of contention as the public panics about Ebola. Sen. Ted Cruz said President Barack Obama is to blame for the fact that the position hasn’t been filled. ""Look, of course we should have a surgeon general in place,"" Cruz, R-Texas, said on CNN’s State of the Union Oct. 19. ""And we don’t have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist."" Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy in November 2013, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation the following spring because of alleged anti-gun leanings. The National Rifle Association, which scores policymakers’ records on gun rights, announced that it would ding senators who voted for Murthy. CNN’s Candy Crowley pushed back on Cruz’s assertion, noting that Murthy is a doctor. Cruz acknowledged that, but repeated his original point: ""He is a doctor, but where he’s made his name is as a crusader against Second Amendment rights."" It’s up for debate how much of an impact the surgeon general would have in the current Ebola situation. But it’s bogus for Cruz to imply that Murthy -- a graduate of Yale School of Medicine -- is not primarily a health professional. It’s also a bit of a stretch to call Murthy an ""anti-gun activist."" A career in public health Here are some of Murthy’s credentials as a health professional: Received his doctor of medicine degree in 2003 from the Yale School of Medicine; Is a physician and Harvard Medical School instructor at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, one of the best hospitals in the country; Has contributed to vaccine development and cancer research published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute; Co-founded TrialNetworks, which provides medical researchers with information technology systems for managing clinical trials; Member of the U.S. Presidential Advisory Council on Prevention, Health Promotion and Integrative and Public Health. Also of note: As a student, Murthy co-founded two India-based public health projects, one while as an undergraduate at Harvard University and the other while at Yale. The first focused on AIDS prevention, and the latter trained women in rural areas to address community health issues. Political leanings Where Murthy starts to get in hot water with Republicans is with Doctors for America, which he founded and currently heads. Doctors for America is a pro-Affordable Care Act health care reform advocacy group. They started out in 2008 as Doctors for Obama, an arm of the Obama presidential campaign. Doctors for America’s primary cause is health care reform and expanding access to medical services. However, the group also considers gun violence a public health problem, and they have pushed gun control legislation. At a 2013 conference, they held a reducing gun violence workshop. Of particular concern for the NRA is a letter Doctors for America sent to Congress Jan. 14, 2013, following the Sandy Hook school shooting. Murthy’s signature is on the letter. The letter lays out several policy suggestions, including a ban on assault weapon sales, instituting universal background checks and removing laws that prohibit doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- similar to other Doctors for America proposals. These policy proposals are relatively mainstream and expected from someone who is a political ally to the president. They are also similar to policies supported by other medical associations, such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But the NRA has painted the Doctors for America policy proposals as radical. The NRA and Senate Republicans also made hay with Murthy’s Twitter. In 2012 and 2013, he tweeted occasionally about gun violence -- expressing plainly that he believes in more gun control and that he considers it a health care issue.   But does this mean he’d be an advocate for gun control as surgeon general? When we asked Cruz's office for comment, spokesperson Catherine Frazier told us this: ""It is wrong to cherry-pick one line out of context from the argument that Sen. Cruz was making, which is that the president’s nominee is no mere health professional, he is a liberal activist that has indicated he would use his position to further a gun control agenda. Both Republicans and Democrats have voiced concern over the nomination."" In Murthy’s opening statement at his surgeon general confirmation hearing, though, he listed other public health issues as priorities -- including obesity (his stated primary cause), vaccine-preventable diseases and tobacco use. He did not mention gun control. Later in the hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., read aloud one of Murthy’s tweets. In response, Murthy said he would not use the surgeon general role as a ""bully pulpit for gun control."" He added: ""The role is not to be a legislator or a judge. The role is to be a public health educator and to bring the country together around our most pressing health care challenges, and I believe at this point that obesity is the defining public health challenge of our time. That is where I intend to put my primary focus."" Our ruling Cruz said, ""President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist."" Murthy has a long list of credentials showing he is a health professional, including his position as an attending physician at a leading hospital. Murthy runs a health care reform organization that has pushed for gun control measures, and he has expressed personal support for gun control. But enacting gun control is not Murthy’s main cause and not part of his public surgeon general platform. It’s no secret that Murthy is a political ally for Obama and backs his positions on gun control. But it's inaccurate to say he's an anti-gun activist but not a health care professional. We rate Cruz’s claim False. Update, Oct. 24, 2014: After we published this item, Frazier, Cruz’s spokeswoman, wrote us to say that we didn’t note in our original report that Cruz acknowledged Murthy was a medical doctor. We have added to the story additional context from the interview with Crowley to make that clear. Still, we continue to believe that Cruz was inaccurate to minimize Murthy’s substantial record as a medical professional -- in ways unrelated to gun policy -- and caricature him as primarily an advocate.

Greg Abbott says Houston city attorney subpoenaed sermons of local ministers
","Greg Abbott, the Republican nominee for governor, accused lawyers representing the City of Houston of infringing on First Amendment protections of religious speech by demanding Houston church sermons. In his capacity as the state’s attorney general, Abbott said in an Oct. 15, 2014, letter to David Feldman, Houston’s city attorney, that Feldman’s ""office has demanded several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons."" Abbott, who posted his letter on his office’s website, was speaking to the city’s legal defense efforts against a lawsuit brought by local voters striving to repeal a city ordinance. Houston’s City Council, led by Mayor Annise Parker, approved the Houston Equal RIghts Ordinance (HERO) in 2014 in a move described by proponents as protecting the rights of transgendered people by permitting Houstonians to use bathrooms in businesses and public facilities of the gender with which they personally identify. Sermons were reportedly sought after a push to put a repeal proposal before voters in November 2014 didn’t succeed. On Aug. 4, 2014, according to a Houston Chronicle news story, Parker and Feldman announced that over half of 50,000 signatures on a petition to put HERO’s repeal on the ballot were invalid. According to the Chronicle, Houston attorneys threw out more than 2,000 pages with about 11,300 signatures because the people who collected the signatures were either not registered voters in Houston or did not sign the petition themselves. In reaction the next day, several residents filed a lawsuit charging the city with wrongfully invalidating the repeal petition. The city issued the subpoenas, as allowed by Texas law, as part of its defense in the lawsuit, in which it had said it will argue against the validity of many signatures on the repeal petition. Feldman told the Chronicle the city included its request for sermons in the subpoenas because pastors who led the petition effort gave instructions on gathering signatures during church service. We sought elaboration from the city -- does Houston’s government suspect preachers of coaxing congregants to fake signatures? -- without success. The city also didn’t respond to our inquiries about the described subpoenas, copies of which came from Abbott’s state office. Legal Documents To our inquiry, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, emailed copies of five subpoenas, issued Sept. 10, 2014 via a city attorney, Kristen Schlemmer, addressed to Houston pastors Steve Riggle, Hernan Castano, Khan Huynh and Dave Welch and church leader Magda Hermida. Each subpoena lists 17 categories of documents and communications which the church leaders were told they had to submit by Oct. 10, 2014, including: --""All speeches, presentations or sermons related to HERO, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by or approved by you or in your possession."" --""All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the petition."" According to the subpoena, documents and communications include writings, notes, diaries, electronic or videotape recordings, emails, instant messages, text messages, emails or relevant ""electronically-stored matter."" Meanwhile, two days after Abbott wrote his letter, the city revised the subpoenas to remove mention of ""sermons."" Parker said opponents deliberately misinterpreted the subpoenas’ original language, which sought speech about the signature-gathering process; then again, she also maintained the changes didn’t preclude sermons from being produced, according to a Chronicle news story. Our Ruling Greg Abbott said a city lawyer ""demanded that several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons.""

Do U.S. troops get just 4 hours of Ebola training?
","American personnel have just begun to arrive in West Africa in significant numbers and already, critics of President Barack Obama have raised questions about how the administration is handling the operation. A month ago, Obama announced plans to send up to 4,000 service members to help contain the deadly outbreak of Ebola. So far, about 600 are in the region, most of them in the Liberian capital of Monrovia and the rest at a staging area in Senegal. Former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., decried the poor preparation these people received before they left. ""Un-frigging-believable,"" West tweeted. ""U.S. troops are getting only 4 hours of Ebola training before deployment to Liberia."" West expanded on his disbelief in a blog post and cited as his source a Daily Beast article that had a similar headline (sans ""frigging""). In West’s blog post, he dismissed assurances from military officials that soldiers would not be in contact with anyone who is ill with the disease. ""We are taking incredible chances with the lives of our men and women,"" West wrote. ""You cannot mitigate all the risks of Ebola — certainly not with just four hours of training preparation."" We contacted the Defense Department to learn more about the training. What the Pentagon said tells us West might have wanted to read more than one article. The training for everyone is more extensive than he said. In addition, servicemen with greater risk of exposure get more training than those posted to locations where no Ebola exists. Army spokesman Matthew Bourke told PunditFact that on top of the standard pre-deployment training, the Army took these soldiers through a total of three other sessions. One focused specifically on Ebola, a second dealt with medical threats in general, and the third made sure they knew how to use and take off any protective clothing they might use. ""The briefing on just Ebola itself, that small piece, may have in fact been roughly four hours,"" Bourke said. ""But it was just a small piece of the greater training."" The press office for U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), the central coordinating body for the military’s Ebola deployment, pointed us to a memo that lays out four levels of training. Service members who move among the general population train with protective suits. There is a higher level of training for those who work in any center that treats patients with Ebola, and another level of training for those who work in Ebola testing labs. Charles Prichard, AFRICOM spokesman, said there is no prescribed time for each level of training. However, Bourke said depending on the size of the group, it can take four hours to explain and take time to practice the right way to put on, decontaminate and remove a gown, boot covers and mask. So let’s add this up. We have four hours of Ebola training. Then about four hours practicing with protective clothing. Then another unspecified amount of time to learn about medical threats in general. Every service member gets this amount of training, or more if their posting requires it. West undercounts the training time by more than half. In an interview on Fox News, West seemed to acknowledge his mistake. The interviewer suggested that the total training took three days. West took this to mean that a public outcry had forced the military to boost its training program. The timeline doesn’t back that up. West posted his blog Oct. 20. The article he relied on was written Oct. 16. The Defense Department memo on training is dated Oct. 10. The policy was in place well before the public read about it. The mission In that Fox News interview, West cast the entire operation in a military light. He spoke of sending troops ""into the hot zone of a deadly disease."" This might suggest they will come face to face with Ebola. Bourke said that for the soldiers who got the training West had in mind, that is not accurate. ""Soldiers are not deploying to treat Ebola patients,"" Bourke said. ""They will be training Liberian health care providers. They will be building Ebola Treatment Units. And they will be providing logistics support."" A team from the 101st Airborne Division recently deployed to Senegal and Liberia to manage the arrival of all the materials and manpower needed to build a 25-bed hospital and 17 100-bed ""treatment"" units. The military is deploying engineers, comptrollers and quartermasters. Some military medical staff will train local health care workers. Very few medical staff will come into close proximity with the virus. They are lab workers who will test samples of bodily fluids for the Ebola virus. The Pentagon discussed this with reporters and estimated it would involve about 25 people over the coming months. Each of them are specialists in this kind of work. Our ruling West said the United States is sending military personnel to confront Ebola after just four hours of training. While the average service member sent to West Africa will receive that amount of training specific to Ebola, the Army said that is a small part of the total training to attune them to medical hazards and to practice the measures to minimize the risk of exposure. That training applies to those who are unlikely to be exposed to the virus at all. Those who have a higher risk of exposure receive additional training. The claim has an element of truth but leaves out significant information. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/23/allen-west/do-us-troops-get-just-4-hours-ebola-training/

Mary Burke ad leaves impression Scott Walker at center of conspiracy that led to six convictions
","A new Mary Burke TV ad strikes a weary tone, with a narrator describing Gov. Scott Walker’s term as ""four years of political fistfights, criminal convictions … and secret donations. Tax cuts for the wealthy 10 times the size of yours, and a jobs promise -- broken."" In the middle of the narrator intoning the list of ills, there is an audio snippet from a TV newscast -- ""The criminal convictions of six Walker aides or supporters..."" -- and mugshots of the six appear on the screen. But the ad’s real gut punch is a silent blow. Above the mugshots, the ad spotlights a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel headline: ""Prosecutors allege Scott Walker at center of criminal scheme."" The ad is referring to two separate criminal investigations: a now-closed one that snared three top Walker aides and three others from his days as Milwaukee County executive; and a currently stalled probe into whether his campaign coordinated with nonprofit groups during the 2012 recall election. But the ad mashes together the two investigations -- neither of which have led to actual charges of wrongdoing by Walker -- to leave a false impression for viewers. Let’s untangle the ad. About the investigations Both investigations were sought by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm. And both used what is referred to in Wisconsin as a ""John Doe"" investigation, which allows prosecutors to compel people to testify and produce documents and bar them from talking publicly about the probe. As such, they have become known as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. The first began in May 2010 and actually grew out of a request by Walker’s county office to Chisholm to probe whether money was stolen from Operation Freedom, a Walker-run event for military veterans. From there, the investigation went in several directions. By the time it closed in February 2013, there had been five convictions for charges ranging from theft tied to the veterans event to campaigning on public time and illegal donations to Walker’s campaign. A sixth person, the domestic partner of a Walker aide, was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a child for exchanging sexually explicit text messages with what turned out to be a 17-year-old boy. Walker set up a criminal defense fund during the investigation. He was not charged. Three of those convicted worked in key jobs in Walker’s county office, and the conduct under investigation dated to 2010 and earlier. Back to the ad. The headline concerning prosecutors alleging that Walker was at the center of a criminal scheme was from a June 19, 2014 Journal Sentinel story. That’s well over a year after John Doe 1 shut down. The story referred to a subsequent investigation, the so-called John Doe 2, which concerned Walker’s time as governor, not Milwaukee County executive. Prosecutors launched the second John Doe probe in August 2012 in Milwaukee County and in 2013 expanded it to four other counties. There is some overlap in the subjects of the two investigations, and sources have told the Journal Sentinel the second probe grew out of evidence prosecutors found in the first one. But the probes are legally separate and cover different territory and time frames. In the second probe, prosecutors are looking at whether Walker illegally coordinated fundraising among conservative groups to help his campaign and those of Republican state senators facing recall elections during 2011 and 2012. One of the groups has sued prosecutors, and the probe was halted by two court rulings. In January 2014, John Doe Judge Gregory Peterson quashed subpoenas that had been issued in the investigation, ruling he did not believe anything illegal had transpired. The decision effectively shut down the investigation. Later U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa in Milwaukee blocked the probe, only to be overturned by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Various appeals are pending. In court documents unsealed in one of the lawsuits, the prosecutors laid out what they consider an extensive ""criminal scheme"" to bypass state election laws by Walker, his campaign and two top Republican political operatives. But it’s important to note this was, in effect, their theory of the case. The word ""allege"" in the headline is not tied to charges, as viewers may assume. None have been filed. Walker has denied any wrongdoing and has charged that Chisholm, a Democrat, has acted in partisan fashion. When asked to back up the ad’s linkage, the Burke campaign told us its intent was not to conflate the two investigations. Rather, spokeswoman Stephanie Wilson said, the campaign believed tackling multiple topics from Walker’s four years in one 30-second ad required condensing the references to the criminal investigations. But the screen’s imagery speaks for itself. Our rating Burke’s TV spot leaves the impression that six convictions are connected to an allegation by prosecutors ""that Gov. Scott Walker is at the center of a criminal scheme."" Investigations have marked Walker’s four years in office. And the prosecution theory in one case has Walker at the center of campaign violations, as the ad notes. But no charges have been filed in that case, with a state judge throwing out subpoenas prosecutors requested. The probe has been stalled by various lawsuits. Burke’s ad compresses time and two separate investigations to suggest prosecutors have charged six people in a case in which they allege the governor is at the center of the misconduct. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/23/mary-burke/mary-burke-ad-leaves-impression-scott-walker-cente/

Greenlight Pinellas opponents argue Denver light rail is a failure
","No Tax For Tracks, the grassroots group opposing the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative, says it has plenty of evidence light rail isn’t worth the cost. Just look at Denver, they say. Spokesperson Barb Haselden presented a series of photos during a debate with Greenlight’s Kyle Parks at the Stetson University College of Law on Sept. 29 (starting in the video at 27:40). The images showed a nearly deserted transit station, empty rail cars and a parking lot with almost no cars. ""I went to Denver for a transportation conference; they opened their light rail line 16 months ago. … When I got out and walked up to the front door to the brand new transit hub, nobody was there,"" she said, clicking onto an image of glass doors. ""I walked in the door that you just saw, main concourse at 10:30 Friday morning, nobody was there."" Empty staircases. ""Ticket windows: Nobody’s there. A few people waiting on a train."" Ticket windows without buyers. About a half-dozen people waiting on a platform. ""I got on the train, I quickly turned to the right to take a picture, and then I turned to the left."" A couple of passengers, then no passengers. ""But people say, well gee, maybe this is because it’s 10:30 and they had all gone to work,"" she said. ""Here’s the Park-n-Ride lot. Empty.""   No Tax For Tracks is using this as proof that Greenlight Pinellas is a boondoggle, despite the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority and Greenlight boosters crying foul. The whole thing made PolitiFact Florida wonder, was her presentation truly worth a few thousand fares? On the FasTracks Haselden and No Tax For Tracks didn’t return our messages, but we figured out she attended the American Dream Conference from Sept. 19-21, 2014, sponsored by the American Dream Coalition, a vocal opponent of mass transit. Speakers conducted presentations with titles like ""Sustainable Suburban Development Can Defeat Social Engineering,"" ""Stopping Wasteful Projects Through Citizen Advocacy"" and ""Fighting Southern Florida’s Seven-50 Plan,"" referring to a public-private urban planning initiative in southeast Florida. The conference started with a tour on Sept. 19, including taking a train from downtown Denver’s Union Station to Golden on the region’s newest light rail line, the West line on the project called FasTracks. The public began using it in April 2013. It’s the first light rail line in the transit expansion approved by voters in 2004. The plan instituted a new 4/10 of a percent sales tax to add six new rail lines and bus rapid transit to the four lines in service since October 1994. The project was originally projected to cost $4.7 billion, but grew to more than $6 billion. These points are highlighted in a No Tax For Tracks video from the conference in which Natalie Menten, an elected board member for the Denver area’s Regional Transportation District and outspoken opponent of government spending, calls the entire project ""a failure, from start to finish."" Menten says the RTD public relations department would say the project came in under budget and ahead of schedule, and that wasn’t true. So we asked the district’s PR department. That’s not quite what they told us. Fare vs. fair It should be noted that yes, the FasTracks project’s budget did increase significantly. Several things occurred to (ahem) derail initial estimates. Pauletta Tonilas, senior public relations manager for the RTD, said some engineering and environmental solutions ended up being more complex than planned. There also was a spike in construction costs, as the prices for concrete, steel, diesel fuel, copper and the like went up.    The Great Recession also disrupted the project, cutting into sales tax revenue after 2008. Another snag was a recent change by the Federal Railroad Administration requiring the use of bigger, stronger light rail cars on lines that moved along freight corridors, Tonilas said. With some creative financing and planning, the RTD finished the first phase, the 12-mile West line, eight months ahead of the working schedule. The West line averages about 14,000 trips per day -- that is, one person buying a ticket -- and should grow when other FasTracks lines open in 2016, Tonilas said. That accounts for about 17 percent of the 84,000 or so trips she said the entire light rail system gets per day, although that varies from month to month. The whole RTD system, including bus, rail and shuttle service, averages about 350,000 trips per day. To put that in perspective, Denver’s light rail consistently ranks in the top 10 light rail systems in the country, in terms of ridership. San Francisco’s streetcars get some 220,000 trips per day and Charlotte gets about 16,000, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Tampa’s streetcar line nets somewhere around 700 trips per day. Current projections for the 24-mile Greenlight Pinellas light rail line from St. Petersburg to Clearwater scheduled to open in 2024 estimate it will cost $1.87 billion to build, with about 17,000 riders per day by 2035. Back to the negatives Now, let’s get back to Haselden’s presentation, because there are some holes in it. First, the empty concourse. Scott Reed, assistant general manager for RTD communications, told us that was not a light rail station. It’s the renovated Union Station bus concourse, an underground station with light rail platforms above it. It’s still pretty empty, but that’s because ridership generally follows normal commuting times, Reed said. It’s no surprise the bus concourse and rail platforms were relatively empty at 10:30 on a Friday morning. Also, this was a westbound train headed to the suburbs in the morning, the opposite of normal commuting patterns. Haselden said no one was at the Park-n-Ride lot, but there’s a good reason for that, too: That was a parking lot for the Pepsi Center, the arena where the city’s professional hockey and basketball teams play, Reed said. It wouldn’t normally be filled on a Friday morning. Union Station doesn’t have a Park-n-Ride lot, Reed said, because it’s downtown. On at least one occasion, during an interview with Fox 13, Haselden was told the parking lot belonged to the arena, and the station said she had apologized. Our ruling No Tax For Tracks gave a presentation with photos they said prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership. After examining the presentation and Denver’s light rail system, we found the opposite. Not only are the photos misrepresenting the city’s mass transit, but statistics show the Mile High city has one of the more successful systems in the country. No Tax For Tracks may not approve of how rail is funded or operated, but using photos of one thing and saying it’s another nullifies the argument. We rate the statement False. Correction, Oct. 24, 2014: The story has been changed to reflect the Tampa streetcar line averages about 700 trips per day. The story previously had a different number.",/factchecks/2014/oct/23/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponents-argue-denver-light-r/

Scott Walker says budget shortfall prediction based on zero growth, which ‘just doesn’t happen’
","Three summers ago, Gov. Scott Walker boasted to a national cable TV audience that his 2011-’13 state budget ended the practice of pushing fiscal problems into the future. In an June 2011 appearance on CNBC, Walker said his first budget ""wiped out"" a big shortfall and put in changes to avoid them in the future. Now, weeks before the Nov. 4, 2014 election, the governor is facing questions about his own shortfall projected for the 2015-’17 budget, caused in part by tax cuts he championed. And Walker is arguing the method behind a projected $1.8 billion shortfall is suspect. ""That $1.8 billion number you’ve heard out there actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth,"" Walker said during the Oct. 17, 2014 debate, when challenged on the number by Democratic rival Mary Burke. ""That just doesn’t happen."" We touched on this exchange when we rated False Walker’s claim that there’s actually a surplus, not a deficit, heading into 2015. We said that flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor’s budget office. Now let’s examine Walker’s underlying critique -- that the $1.8 billion figure is based on zero growth, a scenario ""that just doesn’t happen."" It’s his basis for turning to a different, much rosier, set of numbers. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau is the source of the estimated $1.8 billion shortfall. As we have explained, this is an estimate of the challenge budget-makers will face based on past decisions that they will have to pay for in the two years ahead. That number is informally referred to as the ""structural deficit."" But the figure does not reflect an actual ""deficit"" at the end of a budget year -- it’s just a benchmark or starting point of what officials will have to account for as they make spending and tax decisions. Walker and lawmakers from both parties long have used the Fiscal Bureau methodology. Let’s start where Walker did in his claim, saying the analysis is based on an assumption of ""zero growth"" in revenue. In Madison circles, it is well known that the Fiscal Bureau’s method in this exercise is to assume no loss or gain in revenue -- and no changes in spending. In the real world, of course, state tax revenue rises and falls, and lawmakers adjust spending according to those revenues. By sticking to this method, the bureau’s estimate is consistent, allowing budget makers to readily gauge how their actions will affect future budgets. Lawmakers often ask during budget debates how spending increases or tax cuts will affect the ""structural deficit"" in the next budget. Growth history Now to Walker’s stated problem with the zero-growth approach -- that such a scenario ""just doesn’t happen."" When we asked for backup, the Walker campaign referred us to the history of state revenue growth. To check that, we went back to the 2001-’03 budget period and examined state revenue growth annually and for each two-year budget since then. We found that zero growth happens. And it’s even been worse than zero at times, owing usually to recessions and their effect on state tax revenue. In the last 13 years, three individual fiscal years have dipped into negative territory. 2002: - 0.4 percent 2009:  - 7.1 percent 2014:   - 1 percent In addition, the year 2010 saw essentially no growth -- a scant 0.15 percent bump up. (All years reflect state fiscal years ending in July.) The two year budget (2007-’09) slammed by the Great Recession saw revenue plummet $505 million, mostly due to big fall-offs in income tax and sales tax payments. Total revenue didn’t return to 2007 levels until four years later In Walker’s time as governor, revenue growth topped 4 percent in each of his first two years. But in 2013-’14, revenue fell by 1 percent, in part due to tax cuts he and Republican lawmakers enacted. The economic forecasts have not held up as planned either. We won’t know until mid-2015 whether the two-year budget will end with a decline in revenue as did the 2007-’09 budget. Forecasts are for growth in 2014-’15. But no matter what, the next governor and lawmakers by law must ensure it is balanced, through spending cuts or other means as necessary. Our rating Walker said the projected $1.8 billion state budget shortfall for 2015-’17 ""actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth. That just doesn’t happen."" The calculation is based on zero growth, so there’s an element of truth in Walker’s claim. But his main point was to make the zero-growth assumption seem unrealistic, and on that he misfired. Recent history, including one year under Walker, shows that negative or flat growth is not uncommon. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-budget-shortfall-prediction-base/

Anti-rail group incorrect that city proposition envisions no money for lanes on congested roads
","Perhaps you’ve heard: The City of Austin promises that if voters sign off on a rail proposition, $400 million in city-issued debt will separately flow to road projects in the traffic-glutted capital. The city says on a web page describing its proposition on the November 2014 ballot the ""roadway improvement projects are designed to relieve congestion, enhance mobility and manage traffic in nine ""corridors"" including Interstate 35. Hold your applause, one group says. In a radio ad, a narrator for Citizens Against Rail Taxes says the rail part of the plan won’t relieve congestion. ""And the $400 million the city is promising us for road projects?"" the narrator says. ""Guess how much of that money will be used to add new lanes to our congested roadways. None. Zero."" Nothing? By phone, Jim Skaggs, the group’s treasurer, pointed out the ad specifies no new lanes on the city’s ""congested"" roads. That was a wave, he said, at the routinely clogged MoPac Boulevard, I-35 and U.S. 183. ""There’s some frontage road stuff"" in the proposal, Skaggs said. ""But they’re not adding any lane-miles to our really crowded highways,"" he said. Government officials and lane-miles When we inquired, officials for the city and Texas Department of Transportation each said that contrary to the claim, the described $400 million would result in about 15 miles of new or extended lanes or what engineers call lane-miles, which is a calculation of area based on how much pavement is added, perhaps not always what a motorist thinks of when he or she imagines fresh pavement. Specifically, city spokeswoman Samantha Alexander said, some of the promised spending would go to projects related to easing access to and from I-35 just south of Lady Bird Lake and there also would be projects related to Texas 71 -- plus a single new lane on part of FM 1826 in Southwest Austin, among examples. The 2014 Austin Strategic Mobility Plan, adopted by the Austin City Council in June 2014, has a chart summarizing how $400 million might be spent:              Source: City of Austin, 2014 Strategic Mobility Plan (downloaded Oct. 10, 2014) We asked TxDOT to illuminate details. By email, spokeswoman Kelli Reyna provided a breakdown indicating 10.5 miles of the lane-miles would be adjacent to I-35 near Riverside Drive, Oltorf Street or William Cannon Drive. At first, we got the impression most of these projects, costing around $200 million, would simply expand frontage roads or lanes designed to ease traffic more quickly from the highway to city streets. By phone, Steve Miller, a consultant to TxDOT on the I-35 projects, counseled otherwise. About seven of the additional lane-miles Miller spelled out include: --Two added lanes, one northbound and one southbound, making it possible for drivers to enter and leave I-35 without facing the traffic signal on Riverside; --A lane added, on southbound and northbound I-35, between the exit and entry ramps under Oltorf, easing traffic off and on the highway in both directions plus a lane added in each direction making it easier to get to and from Ben White Boulevard from Oltorf; --Lanes added easing the flow of traffic from the Ben White southbound direct connectors -- or flyover -- south past William Cannon and an additional lane going north from south of Stassney Lane to the flyover that reaches Ben White. Also in both directions, lanes would be added to ease traffic from exit and entry ramps to and from East Stassney Lane and William Cannon. The TxDOT breakdown also indicates about 3.9 lane-miles would be added off of U.S. 183 and Texas 71 to improve the flow of traffic heading east toward the Austin airport. Finally, the  breakdown says, a mile-long lane would be added to FM 1826 in Southwest Austin. According to an Oct. 4, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news story,  this lane would be added between Slaughter Lane and U.S. 290. Terry McCoy, TxDOT’s deputy district engineer for the Austin office, said the ultimate plan is to build four lanes, with a median or left-turn lane in the middle, but the city money might be enough for only an interim three-lane version. We shared the TxDOT breakdown with Skaggs, who said the intended projects don’t attack major congested roadways. ""They are frontage-road connections, intersection overpasses and connectors to 71 and 183 at the airport which,"" Skaggs said by email, ""are not congestion priorities."" Another perspective For another perspective, we turned to the Transportation Policy Research Center, part of the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University. By email, the center’s director, Ginger Goodin, called lane-miles a legitimate measure of cumulative improvements before saying she sees the projects that would be funded by the $400 million as adding lanes and relieving congestion. Goodin noted the portion of I-35 between U.S. 290 and Texas 71 ranks No. 2 on the state’s list of 100 most-congested roadways. Goodin said, too, the described projects -- including so-called collector-distributor roads, auxiliary lanes and intersection improvements -- are accepted congestion-reducing strategies recognized by the institute. Overall, Goodin called the statement by Citizens Against Rail Taxes ""misleading. A portion of the funding will go toward adding lanes to IH-35, the most congested roadway in the region,"" Goodin said. Our ruling Citizens Against Rail Taxes said none of $400 million the City of Austin proposes to spend on road projects ""will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways."" There are other ways to say that six-lane I-35 won’t become a 10-lane highway under the $400 million plan. But Citizens Against Rail Taxes’ radio ad relies on all-or-nothing wording that ignores the miles of new roadway to be built with the money, much of it intended to relieve congestion in notorious trouble spots.

Citing Scott Walker budget cuts, Mary Burke says Wisconsin 2nd in Midwest in violent crime increase
","Compared to jobs, crime has earned scant attention in the weeks leading up to Wisconsin’s Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election. That is, until challenger Mary Burke made a striking statistical claim on Oct. 17, 2014, during her second and final debate with Gov. Scott Walker. ""He cut shared revenue to municipalities, which really strained their budgets in terms of providing police and fire and local services,"" Burke said. ""And in fact, according to the latest FBI reports, we have seen an increase in violent crimes that's second in the Midwest. So, out of 10 Midwestern states, the second largest increase in violent crime. So, we are not doing enough."" Is Burke right that funding cuts to local units of government contributed to such an increase? Similar claim Earlier this month, we rated Mostly False a similar but broader claim by the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The union, which has endorsed Burke, said Wisconsin ""has become less safe than it was when"" Walker took office. As Burke did, the union cited Walker’s reduction of shared revenue -- which is general state aid to local governments not tied to a specific purpose -- by $76 million, or 9 percent. That move, made in Walker’s first state budget, was the largest such cut in at least a decade. Walker also put strict limits on how much local governments could raise property taxes. At the same time, Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb at least some of the shared revenue cuts by forcing most public employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits. And Walker’s campaign argued that the state has taken other anti-crime measures, such as increased funding to fight domestic violence. And ultimately, local governments, using local as well as state funds, decide how much to spend on law enforcement. So, Burke is correct that Walker cut shared revenue to local governments. But she doesn’t provide evidence that led to significant cuts in law enforcement agencies. The size of Milwaukee’s police force, in fact, has remained steady, as we found in an August 2014 factcheck. There were 1,362 officers in 2010, the year before Walker took office; a dip to 1,348 in 2011, then an increase to 1,384 in 2012. Crime data As for the statistical part of Burke’s claim, the FBI includes four offenses in its count of violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The latest available figures are for 2012. We checked FBI figures for Wisconsin and the nine other states Burke has cited when she has made comparisons on how the state ranks in the Midwest. We found that Wisconsin’s violent crime rate in 2012 was higher than in 2010, the year before Walker took office, and higher than in 2011, his first year in office. State 2010 violent crimes per 100,000 residents 2011 violent crimes per 100,000 residents 2012 violent crimes per 100,000 residents Percentage change 2010 to 2012 Percentage change 2011 to 2012 Illinois 435.2 429.3 414.8 -5% -3% Indiana 314.5 331.8 345.7 10% 4% Iowa 273.5 255.6 263.9 -4% 3% Michigan 490.3 445.3 454.5 -7% 2% Minnesota 236 221.2 230.9 -2% 4% Nebraska 279.5 253.2 259.4 -7% 2% North Dakota 225 247 244.7 9% -1% Ohio 315.2 307.4 299.7 -5% -3% South Dakota 268.5 254.1 321.8 20% 27% Wisconsin 248.7 236.9 280.5 13% 18% So, whether comparing 2012 to 2010, or 2012 to 2011, the increase in Wisconsin’s violent crime rate was the second-highest among 10 Midwestern states, behind South Dakota. Although it isn’t part of Burke’s claim, we also found a slight increase in property crimes -- such as burglaries -- in Wisconsin in that period. The rate was 2,453.8 per 100,000 residents in 2012, the year Walker’s budget moves affecting local government took effect, up from 2,432.7 in 2011. As we noted in rating the police union claim, many factors -- demographics, rates of incarceration, even police misreporting offenses -- can contribute to fluctuations in the incidence of crime, which is typically viewed more as a local issue than a statewide one. At the same time, there is evidence that more police can be correlated with a reduction in violent crime. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, studied police departments and crime in medium and large cities from 1960 through 2010. The data suggested cities ""employ too few police"" and ""confirm a controversial finding from the previous literature that police reduce violent crime more so than property crime."" Our rating Burke said Walker cut funding to local governments in Wisconsin, contributing to the ""second-largest increase in violent crime"" in the Midwest. Walker did significantly reduce general-purpose shared revenue, which local governments use to help pay for a variety of functions, including law enforcement. And the increase in Wisconsin’s 2012 violent crime compared to the previous two years was higher than all but one other Midwestern state. But Burke doesn’t provide evidence that the shared revenue cuts significantly reduced funding for local law enforcement, nor evidence that funding reductions necessarily lead to an increase in violent crime.

Rick Scott says Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid as governor but didn't
","To hear Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist tell it, the 2014 gubernatorial campaign isn’t about policy positions, but more about which candidate did less as governor.   Take the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. No, really, someone should take it, because neither governor did. Now each is berating the other for it. ""He will not lift a finger to get Medicaid expansion done,"" Crist said during Tuesday’s CNN debate in Jacksonville. He said Floridians are suffering from the resultant lack of medical care, plus the loss of jobs the expansion has been predicted to bring. Scott answered by first accusing Crist of running up the state’s debt. ""And then you want to talk about Medicaid,"" he said. ""You were governor when it passed. Why didn't you get it passed right then? Why didn't you expand it right then?"" Say, why didn’t he expand it right then? Could Crist have even done anything about the Medicaid expansion while he was in office? We decided to look into the assertion and find out. How a bill contains a flaw One of the original provisions in President Barack Obama’s signature health care law was to expand Medicaid, the joint federal and state program to cover the poorest of the uninsured. The new Medicaid guidelines covered everyone up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. In Florida, this would have amounted to between 800,000 and 1 million residents getting coverage. The federal government would have paid 100 percent of the costs for the first three years starting in 2014, gradually decreasing to 90 percent by 2020. To get the funds for this expansion, the Affordable Care Act presented states an all-or-nothing proposition: Change state law to cover every eligible resident and get the expansion money, or refuse to comply and lose all federal money for Medicaid. That isn't just the expansion money, that's every dollar for a state's Medicaid program -- billions of dollars every year -- a move critics immediately decried as overwhelmingly punitive. Crist was in the final year of his term in office, prepping for an ill-fated Senate run, when Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010. Florida joined Virginia and a dozen other states in suing the federal government the same day, insisting Washington couldn’t force citizens to buy insurance and protesting the terms of the Medicaid expansion. Elements of the law were slated to take effect in stages (the Medicaid expansion wouldn't take effect for more than three and a half years, until 2014), so many states waited to see what happened with the lawsuit.  What’s a governor to do? The Republican-controlled Legislature had already started its 60-day law-making session, so it’s possible Crist could have pushed for compliance with the law then. But considering legislators begin work on bills in the September prior to a session, and given how unpopular the new law was to begin with, this was a pretty unlikely scenario.  Also, the state of Florida only creates budgets one year at a time, and too much of the law's specifics were up in the air to be fully addressed in 2010.  ""I think it would have been difficult, but perhaps not impossible, for Charlie to have moved on the Medicaid expansion, because components of the law were very uncertain with the ACA at that point in his term,"" Kevin Walsh, assistant political science professor at Broward College, told PolitiFact Florida. The Scott campaign told us Crist could have addressed expansion in a special session. But that's impractical. There was no rush to implement an expansion of Medicaid -- remember, it wouldn't start until 2014 -- and there was little to no chance Republican lawmakers would agree to the expansion even if Crist called them back (at a cost of around $45,000 a day).   The idea of creating compliant legislation so quickly wasn’t practical either, experts told us. (A special session Crist called that year to debate offshore oil drilling was ended on a GOP party line vote after 49 minutes.) ""Technically, Scott is correct,"" said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow for the Center for Health Affairs at Project HOPE. ""However, since the benefit wasn't going into effect for a couple of years, there wasn't an obvious need to pass legislation immediately."" The U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled on June 28, 2012, that while the federal government could compel people to buy health insurance, it couldn’t threaten to withhold Medicaid money for refusing to comply. That made the expansion a choice for each state. By then, Scott was in office. Most states -- even those that overwhelmingly supported expanding Medicaid -- waited until the Supreme Court decision was final to formally expand their Medicaid programs through legislation. Before this year’s campaign, Crist said little on the Medicaid expansion. In March 2010, he said he was against the Affordable Care Act and favored repeal. In July 2010, he waffled back and forth on repeal but still wanted it modified. And within two hours on Aug. 27, he said both he would have voted for the bill and against it. For the record, Crist now says he is for it. Scott, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, initially was against the Medicaid provisions, largely because of concerns about added costs for state taxpayers (that 10 percent we mentioned). In 2013 he had a change of heart, but still did not push the Legislature to enact a law for more Medicaid coverage. To this day, Florida has refused the expansion. Crist has floated the idea that he could issue an executive order if elected, in the same vein as Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich. Kasich signed an executive order last year expanding the program, using an obscure government entity called the controlling board. Florida doesn’t have one of those, so it’s unclear if Crist could take similar action. Scott certainly doesn’t think so. ""An expansion of Medicaid could not be accomplished on a whim from the executive office,"" Scott said in October. ""It requires legislative action."" Our ruling Scott said Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid after the health care law passed but didn't. Experts we talked to said that was possible, with an assist from the Legislature, but not at all likely. The law was too new for legislation to be passed during the 2010 legislative session. Even if Crist had wanted lawmakers to discuss it, they would have been hostile to the idea. The state was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the government, and there was no urgency to enact such sweeping change. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-charlie-crist-could-have-expanded-/

Cotton: Pryor votes with Obama 93 percent of the time
","Tom Cotton says Mark Pryor votes in lockstep with President Barack Obama, but Pryor says he’s one of the most independent senators. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton of Arkansas is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor, in a tight race that could decide which party controls the Senate. Like many other Republicans facing against incumbent Democrats, Cotton often attacks Pryor for voting in line with Obama’s policies more often than not. In the candidates’ first debate Oct. 13, Cotton said, ""Sen. Pryor has said that President Obama doesn’t have a lot to offer rural America and states like Arkansas. I agree. I just don’t understand why he votes with him 93 percent of the time."" Cotton has made this claim and ones like it a lot throughout the campaign, while Pryor has touted a supposedly independent record. National Journal’s 2013 congressional vote rankings landed Pryor right in the middle of the Senate, at 53rd most-liberal and 47th most-conservative. We decided to check out how often Pryor votes in line with Obama. We reached out to Cotton’s campaign, and they didn’t get back to us. But these statistics typically come from CQ Roll Call, which tracks congressional data. Since 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, CQ has calculated presidential support in congressional votes. In its vote studies, CQ editors select ""presidential support votes,"" based on clear statements the president or his spokespersons make on particular votes. Members’ presidential support scores reflect how often they vote in agreement with the president’s position. Here’s Pryor’s presidential support rate since 2009, when Obama took office. Year Presidential support rate 2009 95 percent 2010 92 percent 2011 95 percent 2012 91 percent 2013 90 percent Pryor's votes have lined up with Obama's stated position on that vote between 90 and 95 percent of the time for the past five years. Cotton’s figure -- 93 percent -- is right smack in the middle. (The average is 92.6 percent.) So it’s pretty accurate. In 2013, Pryor supported the president the least among Senate Democrats, according to CQ. That year, Senate Democrats overall voted with Obama 96 percent of the time in 2013, which was the ""highest level of support given to the commander in chief from either party in at least six decades,"" according to CQ. It’s reasonable to assume that this measurement would also indicate how a member of Congress votes with their party -- given the partisan environment. But this is not strictly the case. Here’s Pryor’s voting record in terms of how often he voted with the Democratic Party since 2009. Year Party support rate 2009 91 percent 2010 85 percent 2011 85 percent 2012 85 percent 2013 80 percent Although he has voted with Obama at least 90 percent of the time, Pryor has voted with the Democratic Party less often, particularly in the past year. For contrast, Cotton -- who has only been in office as a representative for one year -- voted with Obama just 12 percent of the time in 2013. He voted with the Republican Party 97 percent of the time. The CQ number is straight roll call votes, so it doesn’t count other ways a member of Congress might have acted against the president’s agenda, such as sponsoring legislation that never makes it to a vote. Pryor’s campaign pointed to his 2013 co-sponsorship of legislation that would have preserved future Social Security benefits -- Obama called for changes in his budget request. Obama’s proposal was seen as an olive branch to Republicans hoping for austerity measures. The campaign also noted that because CQ doesn’t weigh the votes, it might not reflect that Pryor voted against Obama on key legislation. They noted the Senate’s rejection of a gun control bill involving universal background checks, which Obama supported. Pryor was one of five Democrats to oppose the bill. Our ruling Cotton said Pryor ""votes with Obama 93 percent of the time."" Since Obama became president, Pryor has voted in line with the president’s positions between 90 and 95 percent of the time, with 92.6 percent -- basically 93 percent -- as the average, according to the best rating system at our disposal. Pryor doesn’t vote with the Democratic Party quite as often, though, and in 2013 his presidential support votes were lower than every other Senate Democrat. Cotton’s number is on target based on the data, but Pryor has also opposed Obama on a few key issues. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/22/tom-cotton/cotton-pryor-votes-obama-93-percent-time/

Counting the number of Ebola outbreaks since 1976
","The latest news on Ebola finally seems to be headed in the right direction. The World Health Organization declared Nigeria and Senegal to be Ebola-free. None of the people who lived in the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died in Dallas, have contracted the disease. Beyond the two nurses now in treatment, there are no reports that hospital staff who helped care for Duncan have the virus. While the situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea remains dire, more equipment and medical professionals are arriving on the scene. Based on all this, MSNBC host Chris Hayes took an optimistic stance during his show on Oct. 20. ""It is a disease that can be wrestled to the ground and essentially snuffed out the way you might fight a forest fire,"" Hayes said. ""If there's sufficient resources in those three West African countries."" Hayes’ guest, pediatrician and health care television personality Corey Hebert, backed up that view. ""We've had 27 outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected,"" Hebert said. ""So, it's not something that we have to worry about like in the movie Outbreak. It's not like that."" The 1995 film Outbreak did pretty well at the box office, but our fact-check focuses on Hebert’s numbers, not his taste in movies. We emailed him to learn where he got his figures and did not hear back. We found two lists of Ebola outbreaks, and while it's pretty clear that Hebert overshot the number of outbreaks, his general point is accurate. In the past, thanks to public health efforts, the virus has not spread beyond the borders of the countries that were first affected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a total of 34 incidents involving one strain or another of the Ebola virus since it was first identified in 1976 in Zaire. However, not every incident meets the definition of an outbreak. In places such as England, Italy and Russia, some people caught it in their labs. A strain of the virus infected some pigs in the Philippines and some workers there developed antibodies but never showed any symptoms. There were instances where just a single person died. If you discount exposures in the laboratory, infections of animals, you are left with 19 outbreaks before the current one. Add in the three lone deaths unrelated to a lab exposure, and the total is 22. The World Health Organization has its own list that doesn’t include lab or animal infections. Its list has 20 episodes and includes four incidents in which there was a single death or no deaths at all. Adjusting for those individual cases, the WHO’s outbreak count is 16. Here’s the WHO list: Year Country Cases Deaths 2012 Democratic Republic of Congo 57 29 2012 Uganda 7 4 2012 Uganda 24 17 2011 Uganda 1 1 2008 Democratic Republic of Congo 32 14 2007 Uganda 149 37 2007 Democratic Republic of Congo 264 187 2005 Congo 12 10 2004 Sudan 17 7 2001-02 Congo 59 44 2001-02 Gabon 65 53 2000 Uganda 425 224 1996 South Africa (ex-Gabon) 1 1 1995 Democratic Republic of Congo 315 254 1994 Cote d'Ivoire 1 0 1994 Gabon 52 31 1979 Sudan 34 22 1977 Democratic Republic of Congo 1 1 1976 Sudan 284 151 1976 Democratic Republic of Congo 318 280 Source: World Health Organization In both tallies, each outbreak happened in just one country. The current crisis is the first where Ebola has hit several nations simultaneously. (Through Oct. 17, Ebola has affected seven countries and 9,216 people have been diagnosed with the virus. There are 4,555 reported deaths so far.) A likely explanation for the difference this time has to do with where the virus struck, and not the nature of the disease itself. According to a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the latest outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013. That was a very unfortunate location with many residents and decent transportation.There are plenty of roads that allow the people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to move easily among the three countries and between rural areas and dense urban centers. But the research team that wrote the article said that the biological characteristics of the virus are largely the same. Quick and robust public health measures could have stopped the Ebola outbreak early, but the steps that were taken fell short. ""The critical determinant of epidemic size appears to be the speed of implementation of rigorous control measures,"" the article authors wrote. Our ruling Hebert said there have been 27 outbreaks of of Ebola and in no case did the disease spread to a second country. His number is high. A more accurate figure would be between 16 and 22. However, he is correct in his main point, that past efforts have successfully contained the disease. The combination of an exaggerated number and an accurate assessment of the importance of the public health response leads us to rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/22/corey-hebert/counting-number-ebola-outbreaks/

Scott Walker says next state budget will begin with $535 million surplus
","Gov. Scott Walker put a happy face on the state’s long-term budget outlook in his second debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke. ""The most recent fiscal year just ended with a cash balance of some $517 million,"" Walker said. ""And the next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact. That means we can invest in our priorities."" That first figure is undisputed and widely reported: The state ended the year from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 in the black by $517 million. But Burke challenged Walker’s second figure. There’s a $1.8 billion shortfall heading into the 2015-’17 budget, she said, not a ""surplus of over half a billion dollars."" That’s a huge difference. To determine if Walker is right about the projected $535 million surplus, we turned to reports issued by the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. But first, we want to be crystal clear about what is being debated here. It’s not a prediction of how the second year of the 2013-’15 budget will end up. Rather, Walker is talking about projections on where the state’s finances will be as the next governor and Legislature put the 2015-’17 budget together in early 2015. This is what is often referred to as the ""structural deficit."" The name is unfortunate. The figure does not reflect a ""deficit"" or -- if Walker is right -- a ""surplus"" at the end of a budget year. Rather, it is a tally of past decisions -- both in spending and in tax collections -- that officials will have to account for in the next two-year budget. As such, it’s a benchmark for the size of the budget challenge. The Fiscal Bureau does this exercise periodically, mostly during budget season. The bureau’s longstanding method is to assume no loss or gain in revenue and no changes in spending. Applying the same approach allows for a consistent picture over time. The bureau’s latest estimate came out Sept. 8, 2014. The bottom line: a $1.76 billion deficit heading into the 2015-’17 budget. Among the chief reasons for the gap: Tax cuts approved by Walker and the Republican-led Legislature, which contributed to a slowing of revenue. The numbers cited by Walker So what is Walker referring to with his $535 million surplus figure? That figure is contained in a Sept. 18, 2014 Fiscal Bureau memo to a Republican state representative, John Nygren of Marinette. In the wake of the $1.8 billion estimate, Nygren asked the bureau to look at it a different way. He asked for an estimate of the budget challenge assuming that lawmakers would hold most spending at 2014-’15 levels for the two following years, and tax revenue would rise at the five-year average of 2.9 percent. That yielded an estimate of a $535 million surplus. The Fiscal Bureau also got a request from a Democrat, state Sen. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse. It asked the Fiscal Bureau to run an estimate based on increases in school spending, granting state agencies their $1 billion spending requests and other changes. Budget requests came in Sept. 15, 2014. That estimate was a $2.7 billion shortfall.  Another scenario run for Shilling was a deficit of $4 billion. You get the idea. Just weeks from the Nov. 4, 2014 election, both parties have come up with ways to manipulate the Fiscal Bureau’s $1.8 billion estimate using some scenarios that range from spending freezes to giving agencies everything on their wish lists. We’re not buying it. Walker’s own budgets report the ""structural deficit"" number using the method the Fiscal Bureau used to come up with $1.8 billion. And lawmakers of both parties have done the same for years. Indeed, Walker has used the ""structural deficit"" estimates to his advantage in the past and even has made it the centerpiece of his re-election campaign. Every time you hear the governor say he inherited a $3.6 billion ""deficit"" from Gov. Jim Doyle, it’s a reflection in part of the $2.5 billion ""structural deficit"" the Fiscal Bureau estimated in 2011 as Walker prepared his first budget. And Walker, again using the Fiscal Bureau’s traditional methodology, has touted the fact that his tight budgeting actually eliminated -- however temporarily -- the structural deficit heading into his second budget. Walker’s campaign argues that the Fiscal Bureau memo is based on some outdated figures and that it’s zero-growth assumption is unrealistic. But the governor is seeking to have it both ways, trumpeting the bureau’s method when it suits him and rejecting it when it does not. The numbers will change again when the Fiscal Bureau updates its report in early 2015. Our rating Walker told debate viewers: ""The next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact."" That rosy number flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor’s budget office.
