Mitt Romney pledged to protect oil companies' tax breaks, ad says
","
An ad from a pro-Obama super PAC portrays Mitt Romney and the oil industry as cozy pals pledging big bucks to help each other out. 
It's a response to a different super PAC ad that attacked President Obama's energy policies.

""Who’s behind this ad smearing President Obama?,"" the pro-Obama ad says. ""Big Oil, that’s who. The money they make from high gas prices is going right into Mitt Romney’s campaign. Big oil executives have pledged two hundred million to help him.

""And Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect their record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too. These guys all profit. You pay the price."" 
We wanted to know if the ad was right that Romney ""pledged"" to protect oil company profits, so we decided to check it out.

We could not find any explicit pledges by Romney to continue tax breaks for the oil companies. Instead, Priorities USA and others making similar claims rely on Romney’s criticism of Obama’s proposals and Romney’s ties to the oil industry.

Eliminating oil and gas tax loopholes is one of Obama’s campaign promises that we are tracking on our Obameter. The Senate hasn’t been able to get enough votes to eliminate those subsidies, which the oil industry has vigorously defended. The industry and its supporters argue that the industry still pays hefty taxes and is a major job producer.

Taxpayers for Common Sense concluded in a 2011 report that the oil and gas industry are poised to get $80 billion in subsidies during the next five years, and that the industry has doled out $140 million over the past decade to influence federal policy.

The Romney campaign has criticized Obama’s energy policy as calling for ""higher taxes"" and for proposing ""a $4 billion tax increase for oil and gas companies."" Romney’s policies, meanwhile, call for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent, but they don’t specifically address tax breaks for oil companies.

Romney himself didn’t provide much clarity when asked directly about his position in a Fox News interview on April 2 with host Greta Van Susteren.

Romney began his answer by saying ""I'm not sure precisely what big tax breaks we're talking about"" and then called for reducing corporate taxes:

""And then there are various breaks and deductions and exemptions that certain industries have been able to win through lobbying over the years,"" Romney said. ""What I'd like to do is to get the tax rate down so we're competitive with places like Europe, for pete's sake -- get tax rates down and eliminate a lot of the deductions and the breaks and the special deals that a lot of definitely industries get. And I'll look at them one by one."" 
Romney’s silence on the issue has been duly noted.

The Sierra Club complained recently that ""Romney still has not been forthright about his position on the issue."" The group pointed to Romney’s statement about oil subsidies in April 2011, when he declined to take a position on current tax breaks and again talked about lowering overall corporate taxes.

The Sierra Club also points to the hefty campaign contributions Romney has received from oil and gas -- more than $750,000 according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- and the pro-Romney Restore Our Future PAC has received almost $1 million.  
The Sierra Club also notes that Romney’s chief energy adviser, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, has urged Congress to maintain the tax breaks for industry members. ""Thousands of American jobs they create will be lost if 30 to 40 percent of the capital for drilling is eliminated through the loss of tax provisions,"" Hamm wrote in 2011. The next year, Hamm wrote that eliminating deductions for the industry ""would give us no option but to reduce our drilling programs, resulting in fewer jobs and higher prices.""

We asked representatives within the oil industry if they view Romney as pledging to maintain oil tax breaks.

""From my perspective, having been in the industry for nearly three decades, and having watched various politicians court or ‘diss’ the industry, I wouldn’t necessarily assume anything,"" wrote Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, in an email. ""We have had politicians in the past, who promised to ‘help’ the industry, who did absolutely nothing, once they got into office. By the same token, I’ve seen politicians that weren’t necessarily thought of as ‘friends’ of the industry, who turned out to be more proactive toward oil and gas than anyone would have imagined. I think that it’s too early to say that Romney will protect the industry’s tax breaks -- I certainly don’t think of him as ‘pledging’ to at this point.""

Finally, if you’ve read this far, you probably won’t be surprised to know the Romney campaign didn’t respond to our questions about Romney’s position on tax exemptions for the oil industry. The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker also couldn’t get the Romney campaign to clarify his position.

Our ruling

The Priorities USA Action ad says ""Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect their (oil companies) record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too."" We couldn’t find any pledge from Romney to protect the oil industries’ tax breaks -- if anything, Romney appears to be trying to avoid making any clear statement on how he would handle those subsidies.

But there are signs that he is favorable toward maintaining those tax breaks. The most notable evidence is his campaign memo’s criticism of Obama for wanting to increase taxes on the industry and the fact that his energy adviser is an oil executive who opposes ""punitive tax increases."" Romney hasn’t made a ""pledge"" but there are signs he supports the existing tax breaks. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097547380>],/factchecks/2012/apr/06/priorities-usa-action/mitt-romney-pledged-protect-oil-companies-tax-b/

State employees union says Barrett supported law greatly limiting collective bargaining
","
With Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett jumping into the Democratic primary in the recall election against Republican Gov. Scott Walker, his opponents are digging in against him.

One of the first salvos came from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, the largest state employees union. The union is supporting former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk in the race.

The recall, of course, was prompted by the 2011 passage of Act 10, Walker’s contentious changes that eliminated many collective bargaining provisions for most public employee unions and required workers to pay more for health insurance and pensions.

In an April 3, 2012 message to members, AFSCME described its qualms with Barrett under this headline: ""Barrett enters race for governor with some baggage.""

The message -- posted by an AFSCME arm that serves unions representing state and local government and school district employees all over the state -- said, in part:

""While hundreds of thousands rallied outside the Capitol in the cold of winter, and 14 brave senators stood their ground to block the law, Barrett — two days before the vote, and on right-wing radio — actually advocated for the strategy Walker eventually used to ram through the bill.""

It added: ""Simply put, when Scott Walker came for our rights and 14 Democratic heroes made huge personal sacrifice at huge political risk, Tom Barrett wasn’t standing in solidarity, he was on right-wing talk radio pontificating about how to undermine their efforts.""

The claim traces back to a video that was posted on YouTube on March 30, 2012, the same day Barrett announced his candidacy. The video heading: ""Barrett: How to ram through Act. 10... ‘The bill should pass.’ ""

The video is based on audio segments of a March 7, 2011 radio interview Barrett did as part of WTMJ-AM (620) host Charlie Sykes’ annual issues show, ""Insight 2011,"" which features various newsmakers.

In the video, Barrett is presented as offering his solution to the standoff between Walker and the 14 Senate Democrats who had left the state to block action on the measure.

""I honestly think there is a pretty clear path as to how we work our way out of this,"" Barrett says. ""Collective bargaining changes are not fiscal ... the Fiscal Bureau and others have said they are not fiscal. You could vote on those without those missing senators. You could vote on those tomorrow morning.""

Then the video adds this Barrett statement: ""And the bill would pass. And the bill should pass.""

We asked AFSCME for its back-up about its claim.

""We did not create the video,"" said AFSCME spokesman Robert Allen, ""but it does comport with our criticism of Barrett's behavior during the standoff over Act 10, which is why we passed it along to members.""

Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak countered: ""The assertion in this video is pure fantasy. This is a hack and stitch job that would make Frankenstein proud.""

So which is it?

Was Barrett really in cahoots with Walker in supporting the collective bargaining changes of Act 10?

Let’s rewind the tape. The whole tape.

And let’s add the context.

On Feb. 11, 2011 Walker introduced his budget repair bill. In addition to calling for public employees to pay more for their pensions and health care, the bill contained the provision to end most collective bargaining provisions. That aspect surprised even top Republicans and left Democrats and unions howling in protest. (We rated as False a claim from Walker that he campaigned on the changes.)

The 14 Senate Democrats left the state to block consideration of the bill.

And labor leaders soon stated they could agree to the higher payments for pensions and health care -- so long as the other collective bargaining changes were not part of it.

Barrett took a similar view at the time. Indeed, we previously rated his position as a No Flip, since from the start he advocated workers paying more for pensions and health care.
 
In fact, Barrett -- a former state legislator -- had suggested a way to end the stalemate even before appearing on the Sykes show: Break the bill in two.

That is, separate the collective bargaining changes from the changes to pension and health insurance, and vote on the second piece -- the part the unions said they would support.

The collective bargaining piece, he said, should be set aside for future debate.

In the same Feb. 24, 2011 news conference Barrett said Walker was focused on busting unions.

""It's now clear to us that this is an ideological war, and it's a national ideological war, and the purpose of it is to take away the rights of people who work for the government"" to bargain collectively, Barrett said.

""It is time we return to our Wisconsin, the Wisconsin where we can sit down at the table and work out our differences,"" he said. ""Let's end the circus. Let's solve the problem.""

Barrett made the same point on the Sykes show.

Only the video creatively edits out a critical part of the statement.

On the radio, Barrett went on to say: ""I would vote for the changes in the health care and the pension. I would vote no on the changes in collective bargaining.""

So his position against the collective bargaining changes was clear.

Also on the radio show, it was clear that when Barrett said ""this bill should pass"" he had switched the topic to voting on a bill that would include the pension and health insurance givebacks, not the limits on collective bargaining.

Here it is in context.

""Again, I think the vast majority of people in the state agree that public employees should pay more towards their health care and their pensions. The bill will do that, and the bill will pass. And the bill should pass.""

AFSCME spokesman Allen said he did not know why the video did not include the full  quote from Barrett. But he also said it does not matter in relation to the union’s position and statement.

Allen said the union felt Barrett undercut its leverage at a key moment. It was still trying to get Walker to sit down and negotiate a bill that would have locked in the employee health and pension contributions without limiting bargaining rights.

Allen added: ""And Barrett offered that non-existent hypothetical on voting against half the bill only after he said ‘the bill should pass.’ ""

But that misstates Barrett’s position and what was said.

Our conclusion

The largest state employee union says Barrett supported Walker’s bill to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees. The group cites a video that includes a snippet of a radio interview in which Barrett suggests a way to break the stalemate.

Barrett did say it was important to separate the higher pension and health care payments from the collective bargaining changes. But he made it clear this was so the piece with broad support -- even from the unions -- could move forward.

In the part cut from the video, Barrett clearly states: ""I would vote no on the changes in collective bargaining.""

We rate the union’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2F98C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/06/afscme/state-employees-union-says-barrett-supported-law-g/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Republicans in Congress won't name one tax exemption they want to repeal
","
President Barack Obama said a budget proposed by House Republicans lacked ""a shred of credibility,"" especially when it came to tax cuts.

Obama said their budget includes $4.6 trillion in lower taxes over the next 10 years, with no way to pay for them.

""We’re told that these tax cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating wasteful deductions,"" Obama said. ""But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close. Not one.""

We wanted to check Obama’s claim that Republicans in Congress ""refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close.""

But first, a little explanation about the House Republicans’ budget. Its top advocate is Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and chairman of the House Budget Committee.

When it comes to taxes, the idea behind the House Republican budget is to keep overall tax revenues about where they would be under current policies. (We use the word ""policies"" on purpose -- keep in mind that under current law, today’s rates will expire at the end of the year and climb higher in 2013.)

The House Republicans envision dramatically different income tax rates, though. Instead of today’s six income tax brackets -- 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent -- they would use just two brackets, 10 percent and 25 percent.

Clearly, this would represent a big rate reduction for people in the top brackets. To keep tax revenues from taking a nosedive, House Republicans say they will end current exemptions and deductions, which both they and Obama refer to as ""loopholes.""

In principle, it’s certainly possible to eliminate exemptions and lower tax rates while keeping tax revenues the same. It’s usually called ""broadening the base"", and it was part of the 2010 Simpson Bowles budget commission that Obama has praised, though he’s stopped short of endorsing the bipartisan commission’s recommendations.

The point Obama made, though, was that the House Republicans haven’t said which exemptions they would end. Some of the largest exemptions are the most popular, such as tax exemptions on employer-provided health insurance, home mortgage interest and charitable donations, as well as special lower tax rates for income from investments, such as capital gains and dividends.

We found Obama’s charge is largely correct -- the House budget doesn’t specify which exemptions it would end. The website of the House Budget Committee defers the matter to the House Ways and Means Committee, which is traditionally charged with tax legislation.

Committee staff pointed us to this statement on the House Budget Committee website:

""This budget calls for lowering tax rates and broadening the tax base. All corners of the tax code should be on the table. The House Ways and Means Committee, led by Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan, has held dozens of hearings over the past year examining how best to simplify the tax code while maximizing economic growth.""

That doesn't entirely let House Republicans off the hook, though.

The Tax Policy Center, a respected independent think tank that specializes in analyzing the tax plans of politicians, found that without curtailing exemptions, the overall tax policies in the House Republicans’ budget would add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""Ryan argues that eliminating or scaling back deductions, credits, and exclusions ought to be part of the GOP fiscal plan. But he won’t say how,"" said Howard Gleckman, writing for the center’s blog TaxVox. ""Cuts in those tax preferences could make a big difference in determining who wins and who loses from the tax portion of his budget. But until House Republicans describe which they’d cut, there is no way to estimate what those base-broadeners would mean.""

Ryan himself was put on the spot recently by Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace. After some back and forth, Ryan suggested that he would favor targeting elimination of exemptions for higher income taxpayers. Here’s the exchange:

Wallace: ""All right. I understand, this is not your committee, it's the Ways and Means Committee. Can you tell me any (tax exemptions) that you're willing to say, do away with it?""

Ryan: ""What I would say on doing away with it, is who would we do away with it for. And what we're saying is the people who disproportionately use those, it's the top two tax rate payers use almost of those tax expenditures. We would limit these things to those higher income earners.""

Wallace: ""Even things like the deduction for health insurance and pensions and home mortgage?""

Ryan: ""Yes, right. Instead of giving these write-offs to the people in the top tax bracket, take those tax shelters away. For every dollar that's parked in the tax shelter is taxed at zero. Take away the tax shelter, subject all of their income to taxation, you get more revenue, and we can lower everybody's tax rate in return. So, we're saying let's limit these kinds of deductions to the higher-income earners so that everybody can enjoy lower, flatter tax rates in return.""

Our ruling

Obama said, ""Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close."" House Republicans have said they want to handle tax changes through the Ways and Means Committee, and the plan’s top proponent, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, said he would limit deductions and exemptions for people who report higher incomes.

But without more details on eliminating exemptions, it’s impossible to know if the tax plan will substantially reduce tax revenues or not. It’s also not possible to know what all the implications are for taxpayers. We rate Obama’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280977B2700>],/factchecks/2012/apr/05/barack-obama/obama-says-republicans-congress-wont-name-one-tax/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich says Ohio led all states for job creation in February
","
John Kasich ran for governor using job creation as a stick to beat incumbent Ted Strickland.
Since taking office, Kasich has used the issue as a yardstick measuring Ohio's progress -- often on Fox News, where he once hosted his own show and remains a regular presence.

In his most recent interview, on April 2 with anchor Neil Cavuto, the governor proclaimed his best news yet: ""We were the No. 1 job creator in America in February, and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year.""

That followed a loss of 400,000 jobs over the previous four years, he said.

When the governor speaks, PolitiFact Ohio listens -- and checks.

In previous ratings, going back to the 2010 campaign, we found that the 400,000 number was correct -- but that it was inaccurate to put all the blame for Ohio's economic woes on Strickland.

Last August, Kasich took credit for his administration creating an increase of 45,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. The number was accurate, but we rated that claim as Mostly False for the part of the statement where the governor said ""we’ve created"" the jobs.

But the governor earned a rating of Mostly True in January when he said Ohio ranked 8th in the nation in job creation.

Now we asked Kasich's spokesman, Rob Nichols, his basis for saying Ohio was number one in job creation in February and number four over the previous year.

He pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the bureau when it posted new numbers on March 30 .

""In February,"" says the BLS release, ""nonfarm payroll employment increased in 42 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 8 states. The largest over-the-month increase in employment occurred in Ohio (up 28,300), followed by Texas and New York.""

The Ohio figure  was the nation's ""largest statistically significant"" job gain, BLS said.

(In terms of percentage increase in employment, the second category used by BLS, North Dakota ranked first, up 1.3 percent. But raw numbers have been the metric used consistently by the Kasich administration and the Kasich campaign before that.)

The BLS release also lists the states that had ""statistically significant employment changes from February 2011 to February 2012.""

The biggest gainer was Texas, which added 273,900 jobs, followed by New York and California. No. 4, adding 73,500 jobs, was Ohio.

So Kasich’s figures are accurate. And, putting them in context, he did not overreach when Cavuto asked if credit due to governor might be taken by President Obama.

""When economies get better, executives get credit for it,"" Kasich said. ""The fact is, does he benefit to some degree in Ohio from that? There`s no question that he does. Do I? Yes. Are we responsible for it? From our perspective out here, we have just taken on a lot of tough problems and created a better environment.""

That part could be classified as political rhetoric, and we’re not rating it.

But Kasich’s statement  about job creation rates is True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F07C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/05/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-ohio-led-all-states-job-creation-/
"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Lenny Curry']","
Voter registration groups could sit on registrations before a new law, says RPOF chair Lenny Curry
","
The Republican-led Florida Legislature approved a controversial election law in 2011 that said third-party groups that collect voter registrations must submit them within 48 hours or face fines.

Republicans said that the new rules were necessary to prevent fraud, while Democrats said it would suppress the minority vote. Civic groups including the Florida League of Women Voters are challenging the law.

A March 2012 New York Times story stated that the law had curtailed voter registration drives in Florida by groups such as the League of Women Voters, Rock the Vote and on college campuses. Since the law took effect, 81,471 fewer Floridians registered than during the same period in 2008, according to the New York Times.

It’s difficult to determine how much of the drop in registrations is due to the new law or to other factors, such as less excitement compared to the 2008 race. The new voter registration rule is not in effect in five counties, including Hillsborough County, because those counties require pre-clearance from the federal government under the Voting Rights Act.

The day after the article, Florida Republican Party chair Lenny Curry discussed the new rules in an interview on MSNBC on March 28.

Host Chris Matthews explained that ""the new law dramatically narrows the window that third-party groups are given to submit completed voter registration forms -- without facing a fine, that is. Before the law, they had 10 days. Now we have 48 hours to bring those forms back in.""

Matthews asked Curry, ""Is it reasonable to expect a person to show up within 48 hours with registration forms that they just had filled out say over a weekend?""

Curry: ""Absolutely. Again, it’s good governance. Before this law, any group could go out anywhere, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time. The
individual that registered to vote would have no idea whether or not their voter registration was submitted, and if the right party was submitted.""

Was Curry correct that before the law, third-party groups could sit on those completed forms for an unlimited amount of time?

The 10-day rule

The answer depends on whether we rely on a strict reading of the former law or the reality of its enforcement.

The old law stated that third-party groups had to submit the registrations within 10 days. (That deadline could potentially be even shorter if election deadlines were approaching in less than 10 days.)

But the law didn’t provide a method to track whether the third-party groups complied with that time restriction, said Chris Cate, a spokesman with the Florida Secretary of State. When third-party groups dropped off voter registration applications, the forms did not identify the groups.

""They could turn them in a month late, but we wouldn’t know who turned in the forms,"" Cate said. ""Though the law said 10 days, there was no way to know for sure that the groups had met that deadline. People ask how big a problem it was before the (new) law. We really don’t have a way to measure that. There was no way to track how many of these forms were coming in late.""

Although the old law stated that late registrations could result in fines for third-party groups, no group was fined, Cate said.

Under the new law, third-party groups receive an identifying number, which they must place on the voter registration applications they submit. Applications collected by these organizations must be turned into the state Division of Elections or a county supervisor of elections within 48 hours or the next business day if the office is closed for that 48-hour period. Groups can meet the requirement by mailing in the forms.

The new law includes fines starting at $50 for each application received after 48 hours and a maximum of $1,000 per calendar year per group. The amounts of the fines are the same as the old law but kick in after 48 hours rather than 10 days. (During the MSNBC interview, host Matthews and Judith Browne-Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a group that fights for voting rights, said it was up to $10,000, which is inaccurate.)

Since the new law went into effect in May 2011, the Division of Elections has sent 16 informational letters to third-party groups that didn’t follow the 48-hour rule and recommended that the attorney general fine three groups. There have been no fines as of early April 2012, according to attorney general spokeswoman Jenn Meale.

Lee Rowland, an attorney representing the Florida League of Women Voters in its quest to halt implementation of the law, said that even under the old law, there was a mechanism for complaints. Any citizen who believed a community based group didn’t fill out a form in a timely manner could have filled out a complaint form.

When the Legislature pursued the 48-hour window, supporters cited anecdotes about third-party groups submitting ""dumps"" of registrations, Rowland said. But they cited the same anecdotes in 2011 as they did when the Legislature approved the 10-day rule in 2005.

After its original passage, the 10-day deadline faced a court challenge. In 2007, it was amended to impose a $1,000 cap on fines and was upheld by the courts.

""It seems pretty clear to me the 10-day rule likely took care of any problems the Legislature was concerned about,"" Rowland said.

Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Kristen McDonald said that during the MSNBC interview, Curry was often interrupted and not given the opportunity to fully explain the context of his statement.

""Despite what the law may have said as far as number of days, there was no mechanism or ability of the state to enforce that number of days,"" she wrote in an email.

Our ruling

Before the 48-hour registration law was imposed, Curry explained that ""any group could go out, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time."" Actually, the prior law had a 10-day rule for turning in voter registrations. Curry has a point that the state didn’t enforce the law -- an explanation he originally omitted. The state could have instituted measures to enforce the 10-day rule, instead of moving to the stricter 48-hour rule. Curry's comment gives the impression there was no rule at all. If third-party voter registration groups were sitting on registrations for unlimited amounts of time, even before the new measure, they were breaking the law. We rate Curry's statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097676F40>],/factchecks/2012/apr/05/lenny-curry/voter-registration-groups-registrations-lenny-curr/
"['City Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Republican Governors Association']","
Republican Governors Association says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett raises taxes and fees every year
","
The Republican Governors Association is back on Tom Barrett’s case.

The pro-Scott Walker group is reprising its 2010 attacks on the Milwaukee mayor, who lost to Walker in the governor’s race and is seeking the Democratic Party nod in the impending 2012 recall election.

Topic A (again): Taxes.

In 2010, we rated Mostly False an RGA claim that Barrett, as a Milwaukee congressman, ""voted for the largest tax increase in history.""

Now on a sharply worded website dubbed ""Higher Taxes, Fewer Jobs,"" a political arm of the RGA (the Right Direction Wisconsin PAC) alleges:

""Instead of making government live within its means, Mayor Barrett paid for all his spending by raising taxes, even in these challenging economic times. In his very first budget, Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since. In fact, property taxes are up more than 20 percent and fees have doubled.""

The website is a detailed complement to an RGA TV ad on Barrett -- the ad featuring an elevator going down. (We’re working on several claims from that ad, which also goes after Democrat Kathleen Falk, also running in the all-but-certain recall election against Walker).

Barrett, in addition to running in the Walker recall race, was re-elected as Milwaukee mayor on April 3, 2012 against underfunded candidate Edward McDonald.

No one disputes that total tax levy collections rose during Barrett’s two terms, and the RGA gets the numbers roughly right.

But we were interested in whether Barrett broke an old campaign promise on taxes, and has raised taxes and fees every year.

On the campaign promise, an RGA spokesman pointed us to an Aug. 7, 2003 Journal Sentinel article on a candidate forum from Barrett’s first bid for mayor.

""As mayor, I will not raise property taxes,"" Barrett said at the forum.

We found a similarly forceful pledge in the paper’s coverage of another forum on August 23, 2003.

""I'm not going to raise property taxes,"" Barrett said at that one.

The tax levy has grown 25 percent under Barrett, from 2005 to 2012, according to official city figures on tax changes under Barrett.

Case closed?

No. There’s more to this story.

After both Barrett quotes, the stories immediately noted Barrett had made clear his pledge was to freeze the tax rate, not the overall tax levy -- the total amount collected from all city taxpayers.

So what happened to the rate? The rate actually went down 5.5% in Barrett’s first budget -- the ""very first budget"" the RGA website refers to.

To be sure, its not an especially impressive feat -- rising property assessments meant the rate could go down even if more money was collected in taxes. What’s more, those same rising property values meant many homeowners faced a higher out-of-pocket bill despite the lower rate.

But that was the pledge Barrett made.

The RGA website also says Barrett broke his pledge to ""keep a lid on"" property taxes in his first budget.

That’s another line right out of the 2003-’04 campaign. It came later in the race, when Barrett, under pressure to toughen up his tax pledge, said he would impose a virtual freeze in the overall tax levy in his first budget.

""Pledges to keep lid on amount collected from property tax,"" the Journal Sentinel said of Barrett in a Nov. 12, 2003 issues story. ""Would allow increase in first budget, for 2005, to account for increased tax base from new construction. Would review this pledge on ‘a year-by-year basis.’ Not considering any fee increases.""

So Barrett made the same ""freeze"" proposal that state legislative Republicans championed at the time -- allowing only for tax increases to cover the new growth in a community.

How did Barrett do on that second pledge, which was only for one year?

He proposed a 1.99 percent levy increase for 2005, compared with new construction growth of 2.175 percent. He did not renew his tax pledge for his next budget.

For the record, in subsequent years, Barrett signed budgets that raised the levy by 5.0 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 4.3 percent, 4.1 percent, 0 percent and 0.5 percent.

The rest of the RGA claim is that Barrett has continued increasing taxes and fees ""ever since"" that first budget in 2005.

What does that mean? One way to hear the statement is an allegation that both fees and taxes went up every year.

Another is that taxes or fees -- one or the other, not both -- went up every year.

Either way, there are problems with that part of the RGA claim.

It’s clear that both taxes and fees have not both gone up every year.

Barrett’s 2011 budget -- presented as he ran against Walker -- actually cut the tax levy a tiny amount. It was the only time he had done so in his eight years. Indeed, the RGA’s own TV ad says: ""Taxes went up every year but one.""

Collections from major fees usually went up, year to year under Barrett from 2005 to 2012, but they went down twice compared with the previous year, city records show.

In 2011 fees didn’t go up, so that year neither taxes nor fees went up. This is based on the collective take from the city’s major property-related fees, including fees for solid waste, snow and ice removal, stormwater and sewer.

But it’s worth noting that if you define fees much more broadly -- as every service charge city departments collect -- fees in fact have gone up every year on Barrett’s watch, as his budget documents note.

And even in 2011, when fees against residential property owners fell overall, one fee, for stormwater, went up. An owner of a one-to-four unit residential property saw an increase per quarter in that fee.

For the city, fees are a stand-in for property taxes, we noted in a September 2010 item. We reported that revenue from major fees had more than doubled under Barrett. A new fee -- the stormwater management charge -- went into effect under Barrett.

Our conclusion

The Republican Governors Association said, ""In his very first budget, (Milwaukee) Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since.""

The group is wrong on Barrett’s first budget, no matter which of Barrett’s promises you consider. But there’s an element of truth in the part of the claim alleging continual fee and tax increases, depending on how you define fees.

Chris Christie claims nonmembers of the NJEA must pay 85 percent of annual dues
","
Leave it to Gov. Chris Christie to reference a classic song from the Eagles to make a point about the cost of not joining the New Jersey Education Association.

Referring to the 1976 hit ""Hotel California,"" the Republican governor told his audience at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California on March 23 that after opting out of the teachers union, individuals must still pay 85 percent of the annual dues every year.

""To get out of the union, you pay 85 percent of $731. Then you're out of the union, but you've got to pay it every year, also required by statute. That’s called a representation fee,"" Christie said. ""The idea is that you’re benefiting from the representation even if you don’t wanna be in the union.

""So, this reminds me, for people of my generation, like the ‘Hotel California,’"" the governor continued, before citing the song’s lyrics. ""‘You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.’""

Christie is right that nonmembers of the NJEA must pay representation fees, but he is slightly off on the charges assessed by the teachers union, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

First, let’s explain the state law permitting such fees.

Under the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, nonmembers of public-sector unions could be required to pay as much as 85 percent ""of the regular membership dues, fees and assessments."" These representation fees are set up through an agreement with the employer or via a petition to the state’s Public Employment Relations Commission.

In New Jersey, most public-sector unions have obtained the right to collect representation fees, said Don Horowitz, counsel to the commission’s appeal board. Unless the union no longer represents the employees, representation fees must be paid every year, Horowitz told us.

The argument behind such fees -- which are implemented throughout the country -- is that nonmembers are still benefiting from the union’s activities, according to Harry Hutchison, a law professor at George Mason University’s School of Law in Virginia.

""The free rider problem is the crux of the argument for requiring nonmembers to pay labor union dues,"" Hutchison said. The fees are common for both public- and private-sector workers, he said.

Now, we’ll turn to the dues and representation fees paid to the NJEA.

At the Hoover Institution, Christie claimed the teachers union charges ""$731 a year per public school employee."" But the annual dues amounts charged by the NJEA vary by membership category.

The highest dues is $791 for full-time professional staff, including teachers and administrators. More than 60 percent of the union’s roughly 195,000 members pay the maximum amount, while other members pay lesser amounts, according to NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer.

Wollmer told us 2,041 employees are paying a representation fee in lieu of joining the union. The union conducts an annual audit to determine the expenses chargeable to nonmembers, and the current fee stands at 81.8 percent of NJEA dues, Wollmer said in an e-mail.

So, a full-time teacher who has decided against joining the teachers union must still pay $647 in the current school year to the NJEA.

""The reasoning is that everyone benefits from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, which includes salaries and benefits among other things,"" Wollmer said. ""The statute spells out what items are ‘chargeable’ – or needed to negotiate, enforce, and adjudicate legal disputes around the contract – and those charges cannot exceed 85% of NJEA dues.""

Our ruling

At the Hoover Institution, Christie claimed that, under state law, individuals must pay a representation fee worth 85 percent of the $731 in annual dues if they opt against joining the NJEA.

Christie’s on target about the state statute, which allows public-sector unions to collect a representation fee of up to 85 percent. But the governor’s slightly off on the charges assessed by the teachers union, which collects a maximum dues amount of $791 and a representation fee of 81.8 percent.

Still, Christie’s overall point is solid: not joining the teachers union still costs money. We rate the statement True.

Josh Mandel's campaign says Sherrod Brown balked at stopping a new EPA rule he knew would hurt Ohio
","
Sometimes in politics, a string of independent facts and impressive words can be thrown together to reach a negative or menacing conclusion. One or more of the facts might even be true in a speculative context, even if they don’t add up when put together. There is an art to this, and it can be a beautiful thing.

Such a claim crossed PolitiFact Ohio’s desk recently, and on its face it seemed plausible.

The claim, from U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel, was in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement on March 27 that it was severely restricting greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. Mandel, a Republican, is Ohio’s treasurer and hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown.

In a news release on March 29, Mandel’s campaign used the EPA announcement to say that ""Senator Sherrod Brown voted against an amendment to block the EPA from implementing this new rule, despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio.""

The harm to Ohio was this, said Mandel’s communications director, Travis Considine, who issued the news release: ""According to the Sierra Club, these cap-and-trade regulations will ultimately put an end to coal fired power plants. This policy change would have a particularly negative effect on Ohio energy rates, because coal accounts for 86 percent of Ohio's energy supply.""

It does sound bad, and being somewhat familiar with the ongoing battle over power plant regulation, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to learn more. We asked Considine for additional information, and asked Brown’s Senate office to respond. We also did some independent reporting.

Mandel’s claim began to fall apart pretty quickly.

Let’s start with some quick background. After years of disputes between the EPA, environmental groups, the utility industry and states, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that Congress gave the EPA the authority to determine whether greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and, if so, the responsibility to regulate it. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas produced when, among other things, power plants burn coal to create electricity.

The ruling prompted all parties to get to work. The EPA started working on proposed regulations, while the coal industry, many in the utility industry, skeptics of global warming and some politicians started working on ways to curtail the EPA’s power. The fight was particularly germane to Ohio because coal is the state’s primary fuel source for power plants.

The prospect of EPA regulation created difficult choices for Midwest Democrats, who generally were allied with environmentalists but also knew of potential negative economic effects on their states. Brown on Feb. 28, 2011, wrote to President Barack Obama to warn of ""potential unintended consequences"" of greenhouse gas regulations. He said that ""industries, workers, and farmers are extremely concerned that burdensome permitting requirements have been triggered for greenhouse gas emissions.""

Five weeks later, as the EPA was still working on potential coal rules, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Republican in the Senate, sponsored an amendment to strip the EPA of its power to regulate greenhouse gases. Although the amendment got 50 votes, that was insufficient for passage under Senate rules. Brown voted against the amendment while Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman voted for it.

But another vote came up that day, this one on an amendment sponsored by Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow, with Brown as a cosponsor. It would have required the EPA to wait two years before implementing greenhouse gas limits. Stabenow and Brown also wanted the White House to provide more financial and technical assistance to power plants and factories to cushion any blow from new coal rules.

This amendment failed too, getting only seven votes. Brown took criticism from the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which supported McConnell’s amendment and said that several competing amendments to delay, including the one by Stabenow and Brown, were merely ""phony"" alternatives to give a few Democrats political cover. Yet Brown was also criticized by a group of environmentalists, saying that by voting to delay greenhouse gas regulations, he was weakening the Clean Air Act.

And so the EPA began regulating, issuing its first ever national standard on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants on March 27. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that new plants could release no more than 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. This is a tough new standard, one that no commercially viable technology can currently handle, critics said. Power plants that use natural gas, however, can comply easily.

The EPA maintained that coal still provides for half of this country’s electricity needs, that new technology could be available soon to allow future coal plants to comply, and that no existing plants, or those under construction, will be affected by the new rule.  But Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air regulator, told Environment & Energy Publishing (E&E) in an interview, ""I think everyone who's being honest agrees that it effectively bans new coal-fired power plants.""

Or, as Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune told Bloomberg, the EPA rule ""captures the end of an era.""

Yet Brune also noted what others have said as well: The domestic market was moving away from coal already.

In fact, no new coal-fired power plants are being planned in the United States, a decision that predated the EPA’s announcement. The price and efficiency of natural gas, and its apparent abundance in recent shale finds, has made new coal-power plants a foolish investment.

""We are not planning to build any coal-fired plants at the time,"" FirstEnergy spokesman Mark Durbin confirmed to PolitiFact Ohio.

American Electric Power, a large Columbus-based company, has a coal-fired plant under construction in Arkansas, but the new EPA rule only affects plants that are more than a year away from getting their construction permits. Power usage is down in general because of the economy, but industry officials say that any new needs should be handled far more cost-effectively with natural gas.

""We have nothing else planned in the way of coal-fire generation,"" AEP spkesman Pat Hemlepp told us.

The EPA has no plans to issue carbon rules for existing plants, the agency’s director told reporters on a conference call after announcing the rule for new plants. If that changes, she said, it would be after extensive consultation with all parties, including utilities.

So the new rule that Mandel complained about -- the one for which he criticized Brown and predicted economic harm for Ohioans -- will have no known effect in Ohio.

Skeptics suggest that President Barack Obama’s administration could ramp up more regulations after the election. The coal industry and some Republicans point to other recent regulations that are not specifically related to greenhouse gases, such as an EPA rule in late 2011 limiting emissions of mercury and other poisonous metals. This rule prompted some utilities to announce they will shut down some of their older, less-efficient coal-burning units rather than spend money scrubbing mercury and arsenic. It took the EPA 20 years to issue the mercury rule, and the agency is giving companies at least three years to comply.

With all of these coal restrictions, regardless of what’s being emitted and which rule it falls under, what will happen if natural gas proves to be less abundant than expected, or if its price rises dramatically? This is being asked by the coal industry and its supporters.

""Volatile natural gas prices will, once again, expose millions of households to higher utility bills, threaten hundreds of thousands of workers with unemployment and weaken both the competitiveness of basic industries and the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid,"" warned Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association.
.
Portman, the Ohio Republican, emailed a statement to Bloomberg after the EPA released its new coal rule, saying, ""The uncertainty caused by these regulations could result in the loss of thousands of Ohio jobs and will increase electricity rates for families during tough economic times, in return for less reliable power.""

That is possible. But no one is projecting that. The skepticism is speculative, and multi-billion-dollar corporations that have the most at stake are investing in natural gas. They were moving away from coal, regardless of its abundance, before the EPA’s newest announcement.

We were curious as to why Mandel’s campaigned use the words ""cap and trade."" Cap and trade refers to a proposed system of emission limits and credits; if a company wanted to emit more carbon, it would have to buy excess credits from another company that had already reduced its emissions. This would set up a system that merges free-market ideas with government regulation. But Congress could never agree on those caps, so there is no cap-and-trade system. Considine, Mandel’s spokesman, acknowledged as much.

That’s a minor point, but it is helpful to know since Mandel used the term.

The bottom line here is that Mandel said: ""Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) voted against an amendment to block the EPA from implementing this new rule, despite acknowledging that the EPA's cap-and-trade regulations are ‘burdensome’ and could harm economic growth in Ohio.""

It is true that Brown voted against an amendment to strip the EPA of its power to regulate greenhouse gases. But the rest of the claim is inaccurate and invokes issues that don’t exist in reality. In fact, were it not for this shred of truth, we might have considered the claim for a ruling of Pants on Fire.

First, Mandel invokes the fear of cap-and-trade, a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and does not exist.

Second, ""this new rule"" means a new rule that will not affect Ohio. Mandel blasted Brown for something that has no known effect. Existing coal-fired power plants and those under construction aren’t covered by the rule, and no new plants are planned. Because it has no effect on anything occurring or planned, it cannot be burdensome.

It’s fine to speculate; you can invest in coal stocks if you like. But speculate is what Mandel is doing.

"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Education', 'States', 'Doreen Costa']","
Rhode Island state Rep. Doreen Costa says that Rhode Island is the only state that approved in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants without passing a law.
","
In a far-reaching decision last September, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education voted to make undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state tuition at public colleges. The move was backed by Governor Chafee, but it came only after years of failed attempts to make the change through the General Assembly.

After the vote, opponents complained that the Chafee administration had forced through a sweeping change in state policy through the back door. And almost immediately, some legislators started working to have the decision overturned.

State Rep. Doreen Costa is among those leading the charge in the General Assembly. During a recent appearance on WHJJ’s ""Helen Glover Show,"" the North Kingstown Republican talked about legislation she introduced in January that would repeal the Board of Governors’ decision.

""This is the only state in the country that bypassed the General Assembly to authorize this,"" Costa said during the March 26 show. ""There was a process that should have been done and the governor chose not to do it.""

Much has been written in The Journal and other publications about Rhode Island’s decision to offer reduced tuition to undocumented immigrants. Many of those stories have said that Rhode Island is the only state that did so without first passing a law enacting the policy.

But in light of the controversy that continues to swirl around the issue, and Costa’s claim, we thought it would be helpful to revisit that specific question. 

First, some background. State Rep. Grace Diaz, D-Providence, has introduced bills in the General Assembly every year since 2004 to extend in-state tuition to undocumented students in good academic standing. But those bills never got far.

During the Carcieri administration, Diaz and other supporters of the policy had also tried unsuccessfully to get the Board of Governors to consider the change. 

Only after Chafee took office last year did the board -- with new members appointed by Chafee -- take up the issue. And on Sept. 26, its members voted unanimously to adopt the change.

In the days afterward, Costa and other lawmakers made no secret of their displeasure with the vote, saying the decision was for the General Assembly to make, not the board. In response to a Journal poll, 19 of the 38 state senators and 26 of the 75 state representatives said they opposed the board’s decision.

Under the new policy, which is set to go into effect this September, undocumented students are eligible for reduced, in-state tuition if they meet certain guidelines. Those include that they have attended an approved Rhode Island high school for three or more years or received a GED, and continue to live in Rhode Island; and that they file an affidavit with their chosen college saying they have taken separate action to legalize their citizenship status, or will do so as soon as they become eligible.

The vote by the Board of Governors made Rhode Island the 13th state to adopt such a policy. (Wisconsin, which had passed a law on reduced tuition in 2009, repealed it last year and is not included in the list.)

And, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, every other state that has the policy did in fact pass a law first, starting with Texas in 2001 and followed by California (2001), Utah (2002), New York (2002), Washington (2003), Oklahoma (2003), Illinois (2003), Kansas (2004), New Mexico (2005), Nebraska (2006), Maryland (2011) and, most recently, Connecticut (2011).

We double-checked the legislation in each state. The NCSL’s information is correct.

Our ruling

State Rep. Doreen Costa said that Rhode Island is the only state that decided to allow in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants without enacting a law first.

The Rhode Island Board of Governors made the move as a matter of policy. In the dozen other states that offer reduced tuition to undocumented students it is a matter of law.

State Rep. Grace Diaz has once again submitted a bill to write the policy into law. But until her legislation passes, the Ocean State will stand alone on this issue.

We rule Costa’s statement True.

"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Donna Campbell']","
Donna Campbell says Jeff Wentworth was sole Republican to oppose 2011 sonogram mandate
","
In an email blast, a Republican challenger to state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, whose San Antonio-rooted district takes in some Travis County residents, says: ""We can’t afford to have a liberal pro-choice Republican representing us any longer.""

The email from Donna Campbell continues: ""My opponent, Sen. Wentworth, was the only Republican to vote against the sonogram law requiring women to have a sonogram or listen to the fetal heartbeat 24 hours before receiving an abortion."" The email also mentions Wentworth’s
past votes against requiring parental consent for abortions for underage girls and points out a 2001 award given to Wentworth by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

For this fact check, we’re isolating the claim closest to Wentworth’s recent record, that he was the only Republican to vote against the state’s 2011 measure requiring women to have a sonogram before an abortion.

We confirmed from news accounts that Wentworth was the only one of 19 Republican senators to oppose the proposal requiring a woman seeking an abortion to have a sonogram at least 24 hours before the procedure with the results made available to her.

As reported by the Austin American-Statesman in a Feb. 18, 2011, news article, the Senate’s 21-10 vote for a Senate version of the sonogram measure that was then sent to the House ""was largely along partisan lines, with Democratic Sens. Eddie Lucio Jr. of Brownsville, Carlos Uresti of San Antonio and Judith Zaffirini of Laredo voting for the bill and Republican Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio opposing.""

That story closes: ""Wentworth, who represents parts of southern Travis County and all of Hays County, was the lone Republican opposing the bill. He said his office had received 356 calls against the bill and only 28 in support. ‘I am a hairy-legged male who will never be pregnant myself,’  he said. ‘I am voting for my district.’""

According to Senate records, the senators who voted against preliminary and final approval of the proposal in February 2011 consisted of nine Democrats and Wentworth.

Ultimately, a House version of the proposal, carried by Rep. Sid Miller, R-Stephenville, was signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry. 

We wondered if any House Republicans voted against that.

According to record votes placed in the House Journal, Rep. Sarah Davis, R-Houston, consistently voted against it, as the House gave preliminary and final approval and later concurred with Senate amendments resulting in the version sent to Perry. 

According to a March 4, 2011, Houston Chronicle/San Antonio Express-News blog post, Davis said she could not support the sonogram bill in light of her commitment to working against the expanding role of government and to protecting the doctor-patient relationship from government interference.

Also, according to votes recorded in the House journal, two other Republicans, Reps. Lanham Lyne of Wichita Falls and Rick Harcastle of Vernon, opposed the House’s May 5, 2011, move to concur with Senate amendments to the earlier House-approved legislation. That concurrence succeeded by 94-41.

In a telephone interview, Lyne told us he couldn’t recall precisely why he voted ""no"" in that instance. Jessica Lynch, a legislative aide to Hardcastle, told us by email that Hardcastle could not recall why he voted no on concurrence. ""However,"" her email says, ""he wanted to point out that he is a co-author of HB 15 (the sonogram proposal) and asks that you not construe his (later) vote to indicate he did not support the measure."" Hardcastle became a sponsor of the legislation in February 2011.

Upshot: Wentworth was the only Republican senator to oppose the sonogram mandate and was among very few Republican legislators to do so.

Wentworth, elaborating on his position, mentioned constituent calls in an op-ed article posted online by the San Antonio Express-News on Feb. 24, 2011, further writing that he viewed the measure as an unwarranted intrusion into a woman's private life.

Wentworth also wrote that he personally prefers adoption to abortion. ""But I cannot, nor should the government, attempt to impose my moral or religious convictions on the entire female population of Texas as a matter of state law,"" he wrote. ""Once a woman, in concert with her family, her physician, and her clergyman has decided to terminate her pregnancy, I believe it is inappropriate and exceedingly intrusive in her private life to tell her by law what she must do in connection with that medical procedure. And I don't believe her state legislator should be on that decision-making committee.""

Contacted about Campbell’s claim, Wentworth pointed out Davis’s opposition in the House. He called Campbell’s statement about his being alone among Republicans ""nearly right.""

Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver told us by email that Campbell was referring to the Senate, not the House. ""It is only logical to infer that those who voluntarily sign up for Dr. Campbell's email on her website for state Senate do so with interest in that particular race. Dr. Campbell is running for the Texas Senate, and assumes her subscribers know that she is only talking about that legislative body. We wouldn't be speaking to any votes that took place in the House in any of our emails to supporters.""

Our ruling

Wentworth was the sole Republican senator to vote against the sonogram measure. But a House Republican consistently opposed it and two others voted against going along with the final Senate-amended plan that passed into law.

We rate Campbell’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A2AC0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/05/donna-campbell/donna-campbell-says-jeff-wentworth-was-sole-republ/
"['Economy', 'Poverty', 'Recreation', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
David Dewhurst says Barack Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf
","
David Dewhurst, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, looks past other hopefuls from his party in an online video contrasting the state of the U.S. economy and -- fore! -- Barack Obama’s enjoyment of golf.

The video from the Texas lieutenant governor shows Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation’s economic troubles. The advertisement’s money moment, though, lies in these claims that appear in red letters next to video of Obama, in shorts, golfing: ""6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama"" and ""over 90 rounds of golf.""

We’re separately analyzing Dewhurst’s charge about American poverty. But is he right that Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf, meaning as many as 1,620 holes?

Many presidents have played golf, including 15 of the 18 presidents before Obama, according to a January 2009 Golf Digest article,The magazine ranked John F. Kennedy as the best previous presidential golfer, and his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, as second-best; Eisenhower, the article says, had a putting green outside the Oval Office.

As Dewhurst’s backup for the Obama claim, his campaign pointed us to a January 2012 Washington Post blog post noting that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had bemoaned Obama’s ""90 rounds"" at the Jan. 23, 2012, GOP presidential debate in Tampa. According to the debate transcript, Romney said: ""We have to have a president who understands how to get an economy going again. He does not. He plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million people out of work."" He later brought up the 90 rounds again at a Michigan campaign event, according to a Feb. 14, 2012, article in the Detroit News.

Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch also offered as backup a Dec. 27, 2011, blog post by Tina Korbe on the Hot Air website, which describes itself as ""the leading conservative blog for breaking news and commentary covering the Republican primary, the 2012 election, politics, media, and culture."" Korbe’s post states, in part: ""Not only did Barack Obama golf on Christmas day, but he hit the links yesterday, too — and that round marked the 90th of his presidency.""

Korbe’s post linked to a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post by White House correspondent Keith Koffler, whose website is WhiteHouseDossier.com. Koffler’s post said: ""After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president."" His summary also says that this was ""the 32nd time he’s been on the links this year, a record for the president. His 32 outings eclipses the 2010 mark of 30 and is far ahead of his 2009 tally of 28 rounds as president.""

By email, we asked Koffler about those figures. He replied that as of April 4, 2012, the president had taken in 93 golf outings, counting one in 2012 and 34 in 2011.

We wondered how the frequency of Obama’s golf outings compared to such expeditions by other presidents. Koffler replied: ""I don't have a comparison to other presidents, though (George W.) Bush stopped in 2003.""

Bush said in a May 2008 interview with Politico and Yahoo News that he decided to forgo golf after the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello, the top U.N. official in Iraq and the organization’s high commissioner for human rights. ""I remember when de Mello, who was at the U.N., got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man's life,"" Bush said, according to Politico. ""I was playing golf — I think I was in Central Texas — and they pulled me off the golf course and I said, ‘It's just not worth it any more to do.’""

We didn’t immediately hear back from the White House about how often Obama has gone golfing.

Separately, CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who tracks each president’s activities, responded to our inquiry by pointing out that he said on Twitter April 2, 2012, that Obama had just played his first round of golf of the year, spending five hours on a course the day before. Knoller told us by email that the round was Obama’s 93rd as president.

We rate Dewhurst’s claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708A480>],/factchecks/2012/apr/04/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-barack-obama-has-played-over-9/
"['National', 'History', 'Taxes', 'Barack Obama']","
Ronald Reagan understood ""to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases,"" said Obama
","
It used to be only Republicans who enjoyed repeating over and over again, ""Ronald Reagan! Ronald Reagan! Ronald Reagan!""

Now Democrats are getting in on the Reagan name game, too.

In answering questions before a meeting of the Newspaper Association of America, President Barack Obama invoked Reagan’s name as a model of fiscal prudence. 

He started off bashing Republicans, both those in Congress and those running for president, for refusing to consider increased tax revenues as a way to reduce debt and deficits.

""The challenge we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook no compromise. And this is not just my assertion,"" Obama said. Specifically, he noted a moment during the Republican presidential debates when every candidate raised a hand to indicate an unwillingness to accept budget deals with tax increases.

Then Obama invoked the Gipper.

""Ronald Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal, he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases. Did it multiple times. He could not get through a Republican primary today,"" Obama said.

So did Reagan propose tax increases as part of his budget deals? We decided to dive into history to fact-check the statement. (We asked the White House for evidence, but we didn’t hear back.)

We should start by noting that if you remember Reagan as a tax cutter, your memory is good. Reagan supported cutting taxes and talked about it frequently. Under his watch, marginal tax rates decreased from top rates of 70 percent in 1981 to 28 percent  in 1988.

But Reagan also signed off on numerous tax increases, especially when it looked as if the previous tax cuts were driving overall tax revenues below expectations.

The largest increase was the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, or TEFRA. It didn’t increase the top income tax rate, but it did increase tax revenues by tightening various rules. In 1983, he signed off on legislation to keep the Social Security program funded by raising payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits for some higher earners.

Reagan also signed laws that modestly increased taxes or tax revenues in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.

To measure the overall impact of tax changes, economists prefer to look at tax revenues as a percentage of the overall economy, which is Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. Under Reagan, overall tax revenues were 19.6 percent of GDP in 1981. That number dropped during Reagan’s first term but increased slightly during his second. In 1988, his last year in office, tax revenues were 18.2 percent of GDP, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Economist Bruce Bartlett reviewed Reagan’s tax record, both as president and as governor of California, for a 2011 article in Tax Notes, a respected tax publication. Bartlett noted that Reagan wasn’t exactly enthusiastic about tax increases.

""As with his California tax increases, Reagan had little to say about them afterwards. In his diary, he wrote only that the TEFRA bill was ‘the price we ha(d) to pay to get the budget cuts.’ He later tried to repudiate his consistent support for tax increases after 1981. But it’s clear that getting control of the deficit in the 1980s required both spending cuts and higher revenues.""

Bartlett concluded, ""Although he cut taxes when he could, he raised them when he had to. That’s something today’s self-styled Reaganites should remember.""

One thing troubled us about the wording of Obama’s statement. He said Reagan  ""repeatedly"" would ""propose both spending cuts and tax increases."" Most of the analysis we reviewed indicated that while Reagan signed off on tax increases proposed by Congress, he did not often propose those tax increases himself.

Still, Reagan definitely advocated in public for closing tax ""loopholes"" as part of pending deals, and he could wax eloquent on tax fairness.

One example: Back in 1985, Reagan delivered extended remarks on tax policy to an audience of high school students in Atlanta.

""Now, someone might say it's odd to talk about tax policy with young people in their teens. But I don't think so,"" Reagan said. ""You not only understand what taxes are, what effect they have in the average person's life, but if you don't understand, you will pretty soon, when you get your first job.""

Reagan then described the tax breaks he was proposing for families before moving on to tax ""loopholes.""

""We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share,"" he said. ""In theory, some of those loopholes were understandable, but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary, and that's crazy. It's time we stopped it.

""And the way I see it, if our current tax structure were a TV show, it would either be Foul-ups, Bleeps and Blunders, or Gimme a Break. If it were a record album, it would be Gimme Shelter. If it were a movie, it would be Revenge of the Nerds or maybe Take the Money and Run. And if the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, ever wants a theme song, maybe they'll get Sting to do, ‘Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.’""

And with that 1980s pop culture flashback over, we’ll now move on to our ruling.

Our ruling

Obama said Reagan ""understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases."" Reagan typically did not make tax increases part of his own proposals. But he did approve and even advocate for budget deals that included increases to tax revenues, and he spoke of tax fairness in ways that contrast sharply with today’s Republicans in Congress. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708A6C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/04/barack-obama/ronald-reagan-understood-make-deal-he-would-have-p/

Romney: Obama 'only president' to cut Medicare
","
As Mitt Romney begins to pivot from the long Republican primary fight to a likely November duel with President Barack Obama, he is re-launching some of his most repeated -- and inaccurate -- attacks of the incumbent president.

During an April 4, 2012, speech to the Newspaper Association of America -- a group Obama addressed the day prior -- Romney repeated several variants of claims that have gotten him in trouble with the Truth-O-Meter. 
We’re not focusing on those falsehoods in this item. Rather we’ll explore a variation of something else Romney has said on the campaign trail and repeated in his speech to the newspaper editors’ group.

Romney said that Obama is ""the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare.""

This, in many ways, is a mash-up of two claims Romney has made before.

Any PolitiFact regular has heard the $500 billion Medicare line before. We’ve fact-checked claims about the basic point several times from several officials. We’ve rated claims anywhere from Half True to False depending on how the attack was specifically worded.

We checked Romney on a similar $500 billion claim from 2011. That reporting remains germane today.

The reference point is the federal health care law, which makes several changes to Medicare.

In a few cases, the law increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover preventive services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is sometimes called the doughnut hole).

Other provisions are designed to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage the program to operate more efficiently and to improve the delivery and quality of care in ways including reducing hospital re-admissions. The law does not take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.
   
So as we said then, and repeated several times since, the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare. But it doesn't cut Medicare.

The rest of Romney’s statement implies that Obama is doing something no other president has done -- making cuts (which he isn’t).

He made the same point in a December 2011 debate. We rated that particular claim False.

John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, offered some historical perspective for us for that fact-check.
   
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan in his first year in office signed an omnibus budget reconciliation act that raised Medicare deductibles for beneficiaries. Rother said he considers that a cut in benefits.
   
Two years later, Reagan and Congress enacted legislation that changed the way Medicare reimbursed hospitals. The program’s costs had been growing exponentially as hospitals treated patients and then sent the federal government the bills. It was known as ""retrospective cost-based reimbursement."" The new law established a ""prospective payment system,"" which categorized inpatient admission cases into what were called diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). In this system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat rate for each inpatient case.
   
""The system was intended to motivate hospitals to change the way they deliver services. With DRGs, it did not matter what hospitals charged anymore -- Medicare capped their payments,"" according to a 2001 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.
   
The resulting savings to Medicare was $21 billion in the first three years, exceeding even Congressional Budget Office projections. It cut the program, Rother said, but did not affect benefits.
   
In 1987, Reagan signed a law that expanded Medicare benefits, including drug and catastrophic illness coverage. But when George H.W. Bush took office, he repealed it. So Rother puts Bush in the column of presidents who cut Medicare for seniors.
   
The Medicare program saw another major overhaul in 1997. President Bill Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act, which tightened payments to doctors, nursing homes, home health agencies and health insurance plans and expanded the types of private plans that could participate in Medicare (the part of the program now known as Medicare Advantage).
   
Its goal was to trim $393.8 billion in spending over 10 years. But it’s a trickier question to answer whether that law cut benefits.
   
""With Clinton, it’s an indirect effect,"" Rother said. ""It did cut reimbursements to several providers who claimed they would not be able to serve the beneficiary population.""
   
The tally, then: 
Our ruling

Romney said Obama ""is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare."" It wasn’t a cut, rather a reduction in future growth (the size of the Medicare program will increase dollar-wise). And other presidents have cut Medicare in the past, though you can debate whether specific changes to the program constitute a ""cut"" in some of those cases as well.

That’s a historical footnote, however, that doesn’t affect our ruling. We rate Romney’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A60C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/04/mitt-romney/romney-obama-only-president-cut-medicare/
"['Trade', 'Pennsylvania', 'Donald Trump']","
The real impact of NAFTA on Pennsylvania vs. Donald Trump’s claims
","Donald Trump sees his path to the White House winding through Pennsylvania. He’s campaigned in the state many times, largely in the so-called T-section away from Philly and Pittsburgh, and gone so far as to say the only way he’ll lose Pennsylvania is if the election is rigged (not true). On most of his stops, Trump touts his message of getting jobs back for blue-collar workers who have seen their livelihoods taken away because of the decline of American manufacturing. In a recent interview with Johnstown television station WJAC, Trump emphasized a specific cause for the plight of these Pennsylvanians, saying, ""NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has been a disaster for Pennsylvania."" There’s no doubt manufacturing has taken a hit in Pennsylvania, as it has in the rest of the country the last 20 years. But how much of the blame can be attributed to this free-trade agreement? And were the job losses offset by gains for the state’s economy in other ways? First, a quick explanation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was signed into law in December 1993 and took effect in January 1994. NAFTA created an open trade zone among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Critics say it led to trade deficits and job losses because United States factories closed and moved to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. Proponents say despite the trade deficits, it led to improvements for consumers and new jobs and that its job loss effects are overstated. Robert E. Scott, senior economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, has studied the trade agreement’s effects extensively. His 2011 paper found 682,000 jobs had been displaced because of NAFTA. In Pennsylvania, the number was 26,300, about .5 percent of the state’s entire employment. Further, Scott said the pact paved the way for future free trade agreements. ""It played a disproportionate role,"" he said, ""in that every trade agreement after has been based on it."" Scott’s views on this are rare among economists. In 2015, the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ nonpartisan think tank, concluded NAFTA had relatively little effect on American jobs one way or the other and that many of the changes America has experienced since 1994 would’ve happened anyway as trade liberalization continued to occur in other ways.    Mauro Guillen, professor of international management at Wharton, said the loss of manufacturing jobs has more to do with technology and the way the economy has changed in the United States and Pennsylvania with a greater emphasis on education and health care.      ""Studies look at particular factories and decisions to open somewhere else like in Mexico,"" Guillen said. ""Well that is certainly the case. What they don’t do in those studies is take into account how many jobs are being created because American firms have access to foreign markets. ""What [Trump is] doing is oversimplifying a very complex question."" Even before Trump, NAFTA’s effects on Pennsylvania were a 2008 election topic. As Trump is doing now, Barack Obama attacked Hillary Clinton over her support for NAFTA in spring 2008. Back then, Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute argued Pennsylvania had gained because of NAFTA. He wrote Pennsylvania’s exports to Canada and Mexico since NAFTA had increased by 61 percent and 81 percent, respectively. Pennsylvania sends more exports to Canada than any other country. In a phone interview, Reynolds said the main industries affected by NAFTA were not major industries for Pennsylvania, such as glassware, furniture, brooms, footwear and some farming.   Yet there’s no doubt Pennsylvania’s manufacturing sector has been gutted since 1994. Reynolds attributed the problems to technology and pointed out even China and Mexico had seen declines in their number of manufacturing jobs. There’s another culprit, too, one Trump also loves to talk about: China. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, Pennsylvania’s manufacturing sector saw a loss of 20,000 jobs between 1994 and 2001, the first few years after NAFTA. The annual losses weren’t much higher than the national average of manufacturing job loss America had been experiencing since the early 1980s.    Job losses accelerated greatly starting in 2001, after China was accepted into the World Trade Organization. Manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania went from 856,000 in 2001 to 655,000 at the end of 2007, before the recession. After bottoming out at 557,000 in January 2010, Pennsylvania has about 568,000 manufacturing jobs now. ""The use of disaster,"" Scott said, ""that’s a pejorative that’s up to the viewer. I would say China and NAFTA if I were telling the story. That’s the difference."" Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. What most everyone who has studied the effects of trade can agree upon is there has been a lack of action taken to better equip displaced workers to fit into the current economy. ""We can’t just let them go jobless and suffer,"" Guillen said. ""We do need public policy to help."" Our Ruling  While talking about the plight of Pennsylvania’s blue-collar workers with Johnstown station WJAC, Donald Trump said, ""NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has been a disaster for Pennsylvania."" Consensus among economists is job losses because of NAFTA were minimal, though Robert E. Scott’s study showed Pennsylvania losing 26,300 jobs because of it.   Either way, ""disaster"" is a particularly explosive word that doesn’t take into context the winners and losers from the policy. The thousands of job losses that may be attributable to NAFTA were offset statewide by increased exports from Pennsylvania and new jobs in other parts of the economy. Besides, most economists agree China has had a much more negative effect on American labor than NAFTA.   We rule the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C18A280>],/factchecks/2016/aug/18/donald-trump/real-impact-nafta-pennsylvania-vs-donald-trumps-cl/

Top California Democrat seizes on 9/11 omission by Donald Trump backer Rudy Giuliani
","California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton seized on a major gaffe this week by former New York City mayor and Donald Trump backer Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani, as he introduced Trump during an August 15 speech in Ohio, claimed radical Islamic terror attacks started in the United States under President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and not under President George W. Bush. ""By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States,"" Giuliani said. ""They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.""  Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks at a rally for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.​ He makes his omission at the 1:00 minute mark. PolitiFact, citing the huge omission of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, rated Giuliani’s claim False. Burton jumped on Giuliani’s statement a day later, saying: ""Yesterday while introducing Donald Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani omitted the September 11, 2001, strikes as a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election. Mayor Giuliani must be spending so much time with Trump that he’s unable to tell truth from fiction."" We are relying on the national PolitiFact team’s reporting below to examine the accuracy of the portion of Burton’s statement about Giuliani’s major omission, which appears unassailable. Giuliani’s omission Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Trump’s counter-terrorism speech, appeared to forget one of the defining moments of modern U.S. history and his own political career: the Sept. 11 attacks. The Republican former mayor of New York City during 9/11 was widely lampooned (following the omission) for suggesting that terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were unique to Barack Obama’s presidency. But many media reports left out the beginning of his speech, when he talked at length about 9/11. He recounted how it was the ""worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812"" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited ""Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help."" Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: ""By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office."" Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, ""We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush."" He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, ""since Sept. 11."" Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using ""abbreviated language."" But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to ""radical Islamic extremism"" is murkier in others. The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of ""violent jihadist attacks"" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification. That’s because strict definitions like ""hate crime"" or ""terrorist attack"" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — ""questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation,"" said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America. That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role. 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting   On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. 2002 Beltway snipers In October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24. The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over ""the continued oppression of black people."" A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself ""a Muslim American, angry at Israel"" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but ""acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization."" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits ""into the terrorist mold"" while the New America Foundation lists it as a ""violent jihadist attack,"" because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions. 2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attack In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. ""I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree,"" he wrote in one letter. UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006. PolitiFact’s ruling on Giuliani’s claim Moments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, ""Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States."" Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments. Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them. We rate his claim False. PolitiFact California’s ruling on Burton’s claim California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton said Giuliani omitted the 9/11 attacks as ""a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election."" Giuliani’s remarks were captured on video and clearly show he left out the 9/11 attacks. Based on this video and PolitiFact’s reporting about terror attacks that took place under President Bush, including 9/11, we rate Burton’s claim True.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Illinois', 'Michael  Madigan']","
Madigan says his primary opponent's campaign funded with more than $1 million from Rauner allies
","Is Jason Gonzales a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gov. Bruce Rauner and his associates as Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan claims? Madigan, who has served as speaker for all but two years since 1983, was challenged in the 2016 Democratic primary election for the 22nd District by Jason Gonzales, an entrepreneur and high school dropout who went on to receive degrees from Duke, MIT and Harvard. Despite labeling himself as a progressive, Gonzales had the backing of Republicans and supporters of Gov. Bruce Rauner. Nearly six months after being defeated in the primary by more than 38 percentage points, Gonzales filed a lawsuit on Aug. 8 accusing Madigan -- who also is chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party -- of dozens of illegal and fraudulent acts during the election season.  The 39-count suit accuses Madigan and others of defaming Gonzales by calling him a convicted felon in campaign ads and committing fraud by putting up two ""fake"" candidates on the ballot to ""dilute"" the Latino vote, among other allegations. In response to the lawsuit, Madigan issued a statement calling Gonzales’ claims without merit, but one sentence in particular stood out: ""Gonzales’ losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner."" While it’s no secret Gonzales was backed by Republicans and supporters of Rauner -- Madigan’s biggest political foe -- is it true his campaign was funded with more than $1 million from them? Following the money Madigan spokesman Steve Brown told PolitiFact Illinois the $1 million figure came from the Illinois State Board of Elections. Campaign finance records from the State Board of Elections show Gonzales received $278,771 in individual contributions during the primary race. We found some of the top contributors to Gonzales’ campaign fund also have donated to Rauner and some top contributors to Gonzales also have donated to other Democrats.   In a phone interview, Gonzales acknowledged he received financial support from the governor’s supporters, but said there never was a quid pro quo between him and Rauner or his allies. Gonzales pointed out many of his donors have contributed to both parties. And not all of his top contributors have donated to Rauner. Robert Hirsch, CEO of Gold Eagle, a company that manufactures automotive chemicals, donated $27,500 to Gonzales -- the largest individual contribution to the campaign -- but there is no record of Hirsch contributing to Rauner’s political committees. However, Hirsch did support redistricting reform efforts backed by Rauner and opposed by Madigan in 2014 and 2016, though that is an issue that has bipartisan support. ""I had to dial for money every day, and a lot of donors I dialed on Democratic lists happened to be supporters of Bruce Rauner and there was nothing I could do about that,"" Gonzales said. Among Gonzales’ top donors was Blair Hull, a wealthy Chicago businessman who unsuccessfully ran in the 2004 Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate, which eventually was won by then-state Sen. Barack Obama. Records show Hull donated $7,250 to Gonzales’ campaign on March 3. He also contributed $5,000 to Rauner during the 2014 gubernatorial race. But Hull’s company, Hull Investments LLC, donated $450,000 to the Illinois United for Change super PAC, which spent $506,000 in support of Gonzales and $367,000 against Madigan. Calls to Hull Investments LLC were not returned, but Hull told the Capitol Fax blog in February that Madigan ""is not a team player"" and ""does not cooperate well with others."" Hull added that he believed ""the state of Illinois and the Legislature would be improved significantly without Michael Madigan."" If you combine the total amount spent in the race by Illinois United for Change and individual contributions to Gonzales’ campaign fund, it comes out to about $1.15 million. While Brown noted spending by the super PAC was included in Madigan’s claim, it’s illegal for an independent expenditure committee to contribute directly to a candidate’s campaign. Kent Redfield, an Illinois campaign finance expert and professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said Madigan’s statement is a ""reasonable assumption,"" but there’s no evidence to suggest the super PAC coordinated with Rauner’s office, his political committees or supporters. ""The statement makes it sound like it was a coordinated campaign that involved different entities,"" Redfield said. ""While it may be the case, you don’t have anything on public record."" Redfield characterized Madigan’s claim as an ""overstatement."" He added that while it ""assumes a connection that very well may be there,"" there’s no definitive link. However, the issue of dark money makes it extremely difficult to determine where exactly the money is coming from, notes Sarah Brune, executive director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. For example, Illinois United for Change received $20,000 in donations from the Illinois Opportunity Project, a 501(c)4 organization that is highly critical of Madigan and supportive of Rauner. The group is led by Dan Proft, Matthew Besler and Pat Hughes, all of whom are Republicans. Non-profit 501(c)4 groups can spend unlimited amounts of money on politics without disclosing their donors, making it impossible to identify direct ties to certain politicians or their supporters. Our ruling Madigan said, ""Gonzales’ losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner."" Indeed, Gonzales’ campaign received big donations from people who also gave to Rauner’s campaign fund, but the speaker implies that every donation came from individuals and groups aligned with the governor. In fact, a few of Gonzales’ top donors have also contributed to Democrats and one of his top five donors contributed to Gonzales and no one else. Further, Madigan’s ""more than $1 million"" includes spending by the Illinois United for Change super PAC, despite the fact that super PAC money cannot be given directly to a candidate’s campaign nor can it be coordinated with a candidate’s campaign. We rate Madigan’s claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a1d2957-50ad-4415-a9b1-895f7e25d265",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A6D00>],/factchecks/2016/aug/18/michael-madigan/madigan-claim-gonzales-campaign-fund-mostly-false/
"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Military', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden rips Donald Trump over commanders' fears about illegal orders
","During a joint speech with Hillary Clinton in his ancestral home of Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden riffed on the ways he sees Donald Trump as being unfit for the presidency. One of the things that Biden said troubled him among Trump’s past comments is his suggestion that the United States may need to utilize ""torture."" Biden said that Trump has floated the use of torture ""when he knows it's illegal, and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders?"" Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding. Just one example: Trump said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the United States needs to ""strengthen the laws so that we can better compete"" with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS' level. ""We have to play the game the way they're playing the game,"" Trump said. ""You're not going to win if we're soft."" In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, as we have written before, would violate the Geneva Conventions. However, Biden’s remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump. That’s an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Let’s take a closer look. Who has said what about Trump so far? We could find no evidence -- and Biden’s staff couldn’t point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of Defense Department Directive 1344.10. Senior national security retirees, though, are another story. Biden’s staff pointed to comments made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. When Maher brought up Trump's idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, ""If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act."" Maher responded, ""What? Well, that’s quite a statement, sir."" In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials signed a letter on Aug. 8, 2016, arguing that Trump ""lacks the character, values and experience"" to be president and ""would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being."" The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trump’s fitness for office by members of his party’s national security establishment. We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn, decorated Army Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark Bircher, retired four star Air Force Gen. Robert Oaks, and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said ""they would not follow"" illegal orders from Trump. There’s no evidence of that. What does the law say? That said, Biden’s overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, there’s solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way. ""Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order,"" said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. ""It doesn’t matter who gave it."" According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, if ""an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga­tion to disobey it,"" said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University's Center for Military Law & Policy. The so-called ""Nuremberg Defense"" to criminal activity — ""I was only following orders"" — excuses a service ­member’s crimi­nal actions ""only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal,"" Rosen said. This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said. ""I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order,"" Rosen said. He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calley’s defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calley’s defense, Rosen said. How unusual is the backlash against Trump? Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidate’s potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House. ""There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders,"" such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. ""But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign."" Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed. ""I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign,"" Arend said. ""This truly seems unprecedented."" Our ruling Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, ""they would not follow his orders."" Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggerated when he described them as ""military commanders.""  The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump. We rate his statement Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C177240>],/factchecks/2016/aug/17/joe-biden/joe-biden-rips-donald-trump-over-commanders-fears-/

Clinton repeats wrong claim that no other 2016 candidate pledged not to raise middle-class taxes
","One of Hillary Clinton’s key campaign promises is that she won’t raise taxes on the middle class. In an Aug. 17 speech in Cleveland, the Democratic presidential nominee said, ""I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class."" Clinton began making that promise last fall, saying she would not raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000 a year. Analysts have said her proposed tax plan would have minimal impact on middle-income Americans. However, Clinton is not the only candidate to make such a promise. In fact, we rated a similar claim by Clinton Pants on Fire in July. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its lowest rating. We found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton’s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone — including the middle class. Donald Trump was not one of these; more on this in a bit. Twelve of the GOP candidates signed no-tax pledges with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses"" and ""any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."" The 12 signers were Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore,George Pataki and Rick Perry. A 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a personal oath to oppose all tax increases. Two other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform’s no-tax pledge before last year: Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker. So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges — not just on the middle class but everyone. Who resisted? • Trump, the GOP nominee, who said last year he didn’t want to sign the Americans for Tax Reform pledge because he ""may want to switch taxes around."" • Jeb Bush, who said he objects to written pledges. We searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty. Trump did, though, say in an Aug. 9 speech that he wants tax reductions for the middle class. We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class. For our July fact-check, we asked Clinton’s campaign for an explanation of her and got a generic response. ""Hillary Clinton’s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,"" Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email. For this fact-check, Schwerin did not expand on his previous statement except to point out that some analysts have said Trump’s tax plan would most benefit the wealthiest Americans. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class."" Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other two inked such a pledge earlier in their careers. Trump wasn’t one of them, but Clinton specifically mentioned the primary field. And that makes the claim both inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate this claim, again, Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976D4040>],/factchecks/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton/clinton-repeats-wrong-claim-no-other-2016-candidat/

Joaquin Castro says conservative activist believes HIV can be spread through sewer system
","After word surfaced that a conservative nonprofit won a $1.6 million state grant to deliver women’s health services, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro questioned the decision while making a ""sewer"" claim about the group’s director. Castro, D-San Antonio, said in an August 2016 tweet: ""The group's director believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system. Is it really most qualified for the grant?"" Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, is mainly spread through sexual contact or from sharing needles, syringes, rinse water or other equipment with someone who has the virus, according to a federal website focused on AIDS. Less commonly, per the site, the virus may be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, by being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle and, in rare cases, via blood transfusions and eating food pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. We spotted no mention of the virus getting conveyed from anything in a sewer pipe. ""HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces) and it cannot reproduce outside a human host,"" the site says. The virus also isn’t spread by air or water, the site says. Seeking Castro’s factual backup, we heard from his House spokeswoman, Erin Hatch, who emailed us web links to summer 2016 news stories--including an Austin American-Statesman story posted earlier the day of Castro’s tweet about Carol Everett, chief executive of the Round Rock-based Heidi Group, which once ran no-charge crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth. Everett, the story said, ""recently came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system."" Everett told the paper, though, that her highlighted comments had been misunderstood. Everett also told reporter Julie Chang that her remarks about HIV amounted to ""a stupid mistake."" Chang shared with us her notes from her interview with Everett, who said: ""I very much regret what I said. I shouldn’t have even tried… because they misunderstood it. I didn’t talk about transmitting STDs that way. I was trying to talk about the fact that babies are ground up and put into these garbage disposals which goes into our sewers. I didn’t make that point very clearly."" Existing regulations allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or ""an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill."" Two instances For our part, we confirmed from a TV news report noted by Hatch and Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments before a state agency that she indeed made mention of HIV and sewers while advocating for state officials to adopt a rule requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated rather than disposed other ways. The rule was proposed in June 2016 by the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on behalf of the Department of State Health Services; it wasn’t finalized as of Aug. 17, 2016. Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments at an Aug. 4, 2016 state hearing on the proposed rule show Everett expressed criticism of current disposal methods, further saying: ""What does this really do to the public? There are other people to consider. ""What if one of those sewer treatment programs breaks down one day? You know, the abortion industry doesn’t have time; they only see a woman one time; they do not do an AIDS test, they don’t do, they don’t know if she’s HIV-positive. They don’t know if she has a sexually transmitted disease. And what if one day, just one day, something horrible escaped into the sewer system?"" (Laughter.) ""It may sound funny but it’s something we could think about because I can tell you today, the public is thinking about it. ""So I appreciate very much addressing this. I encourage you to uphold it. Let’s take care of those who cannot take care of themselves -- and I am talking about the women."" Earlier, as pointed out by Hatch, Everett said in an interview with Austin’s Fox 7 aired July 7, 2016, that existing protocols for disposing fetal remains pose ""several health concerns. What if the woman had HIV? What if she had a sexually transmitted disease? What if those germs went through and got into our water supply?"" Everett said. When we reached Everett about Castro's claim, she said by phone she hadn’t explicitly said HIV is spread through sewer pipes--and doesn’t believe as much. ""People with HIV and AIDS go to the bathroom every day,"" Everett said. At the state hearing, she said, she was trying to stress that fetal material gets into the sewer system. Everett called her comment to Austin’s Fox 7 about HIV/STD ""germs"" getting into ""our"" water supply ""really far out. I shouldn’t have said that."" Our ruling Castro said Everett ""believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system."" Everett didn’t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn’t believe it. However, on two occasions, she raised the ""what-if"" spectre of a woman somehow passing along the virus or an STD through fetal material flushed down a drain. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Julián Castro says California besting Texas in creating jobs, economic growth
","Ever-proud Texas has lately been bested in job gains and economic oomph by California, a Texas Democrat pokes. Julián Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, brought up California during the Texas Democratic Party’s state convention after noting that as governor, Republican Rick Perry taunted the west coast state for its economy not matching his home state’s pace. ""Today,"" the former San Antonio mayor told reporters June 17, 2016, ""California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas. Maybe what we need to do is trade in Gov. Jerry Brown,"" of California, ""for Gov. Greg Abbott and get better results."" Castro made a similar declaration in his evening keynote speech, telling delegates: ""This is what happens when a party doesn’t believe in government in the first place but has absolute power over its people for decades. You know, they used to brag that Texas was doing so much better than big bad liberal California. But Texas Republicans managed to bungle that too. Because today California is kicking our butt in job development and economic growth."" Castro’s backup Wondering how Castro reached his conclusion, we heard back from Manny Garcia, a state party official, who said by email that Castro drew on news stories and government data to find Texas trailing. Garcia also provided what he described as Castro’s personally prepared backup document. Over the 12 months starting in June 2015, Castro’s footnoted document notes, Texas added an estimated 171,800 seasonally adjusted jobs, per the Texas Workforce Commission. California from April 2015 through April 2016 reportedly added 450,200 jobs, the document says. Castro’s document also declares that California has lately seen greater percentage increases in Gross Domestic Product. Between the first quarter of 2014 and the last quarter of 2015, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced June 14, 2016, California saw a 4.1 percent increase in GDP, based on national prices for the goods and services produced within each state. Texas’ GDP had gone up 3.8 percent, per the bureau. Also noted by Castro, California’s real GDP grew 2.7 percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2015; Texas’s GDP ""only grew"" 1.4 percent. Castro’s document further notes that from 2014 to 2015, per capita personal income in California grew by 5.3 percent, according to a March 2016 Bureau of Economic Analysis document. In the same year, per capita personal income in Texas grew 2.4 percent, according to the bureau fact sheet about Texas. Economists comment For our part, we noticed that Castro compared raw changes in jobs over slightly different time periods. Economists we queried agreed the population difference between the states makes raw counts less useful than rate-of-change comparisons. At the time Castro spoke, the latest available U.S. Census Bureau population estimates indicated that as of July 2015, the Golden State was home to 38.8 million people and Texas had 27 million residents--or 30 percent fewer. To compare job gains for each state over a similar period, we turned to Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist in the Dallas office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By email, Abbot advised that from May 2015 through April 2016, 32 states had statistically  significant year-over-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment. The largest job gains, she said, were in California, Florida and Texas, with 440,300, 253,900 and 171,800 jobs gained, respectively. In percentage growth, Abbot said, the annual rate of jobs growth for California was 2.8 percent, compared with Texas’ 1.5 percent. So, booyah for California? We asked Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the Royal Holloway University of London formerly employed by the University of Texas, to assess the jobs figures with Castro’s claim in mind. By email, Hamermesh replied that Castro was right for the short term though Texas continues to look better in the long view; from May 2006 to May 2016, the state saw job gains of 18.6 percent as California experienced 8 percent growth, Hamermesh said. After we downloaded the government’s monthly counts of jobs in each state, we found that as of May 2016, California had experienced greater percentage gains in employment than Texas for every 12-month period going back to 2011. It’s only if you go back further that Texas’s jobs growth exceeds the growth for California. This doesn’t entirely mean Texas loses out. Separately to our inquiry, Tara Sinclair, chief economist for Indeed, a job-posting service, pointed out by email that Texas has long enjoyed a lower unemployment rate--a facet Castro didn’t mention. Sinclair drew on data posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to show that Texas’ unemployment rate has trailed California’s rate since before 2010. Sinclair also prepared a graph showing that since about 1990, Texas has had a better nonfarm employment-to-population ratio than California, though both states have shown improvement since 2010:  All in all, Sinclair said by email, ""focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading due to the different population sizes of the two states. By both the unemployment rate (a standard measure of labor market health) as well as the employment to population ratio, Texas's labor market actually looks healthier than California's."" GDP and personal income Castro’s other suggested indicators--GDP and personal income growth--check out in California’s favor. We confirmed his provided GDP figures, also spotting two sets of inflation-adjusted Bureau of Economic Analysis figures of note: --California’s $2.2 trillion GDP in the first quarter of 2016 was up 4.7 percent from its $2.17 trillion GDP in the first quarter of 2015 while Texas’ first quarter 2016 GDP of $1.48 trillion was up 0.2 percent from $1.478 trillion 12 months before (figures in chained 2009 dollars). --California’s 2015 per capita real GDP of $56,395 was up 3.2 percent from $54,606 in 2014; Texas’s per capita GDP of $53,707 was up 1.8 percent from $52,742 in 2014. Meantime, the bureau’s state-by-state breakout shows California with the bigger improvement in personal income between the last quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. Personal income means net earnings from property income and other sources including government programs.  California saw 0.9 percent growth in per capita personal income between the last quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, according to another bureau chart, while Texas saw 0.8 percent growth. California also saw greater growth by this metric each of the previous four quarters, per the chart, with Texas last having a growth edge in the fourth quarter of 2014:  Our ruling Castro said that ""today,"" California is ""creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas."" These fightin’ words hold up based on recent jobs growth and relative changes in GDP and personal income. Still (just a tad whiney here) would it hurt to acknowledge that Texas continues to enjoy a lower unemployment rate? We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Rubio says he wrote, passed veteran affairs bill
","Marco Rubio is touting his support for veterans in his latest campaign ad ahead of the Aug. 30 primary in the Florida Senate race. The ad opens with snippets from veterans in the Army, Marines and Navy who are backing Rubio for his efforts to help veterans. After a few testimonials, the screen cuts to text that reads, ""Marco Rubio wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers."" We wondered if this was correct, so we looked into it. The bill in question Rubio’s campaign cited the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014, which included stipulations that give the VA secretary the ability to fire Senior Executive Service workers if their performance warrants it. The bill (S.2013) was sponsored by Rubio. A related bill passed in the House, but Rubio's bill didn’t go anywhere in the Senate. So we wondered why Rubio said it ""passed."" Turns out, Rubio’s legislation was included word-for-word in a larger bill known as the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, which was signed into law in August 2014. This law addressed the Veteran’s Health Administration scandal in 2014, in which Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned following outcry that the VA had falsified data in regards to the long wait times veterans were met with when using VA hospitals. This bill passed the Senate 93-3, with four members not voting. It passed in the House 265-160, with six members not voting. One highlight from the law provides for more accountability for negligent senior managers of the law, which includes the ability to remove or demote senior executive officers for misconduct. Rubio had a role in the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014. News reports provided by his spokeswoman backed this up. A McClatchy DC report in March gave Rubio credit for playing a ""vital role"" in the final legislation, although the specific overhaul he sponsored did not pass. Another report from CBS Miami mentions that Rubio was asked to be a part of the committee that oversees problems with veteran’s health care: ""While he is not a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Rubio was asked to be part of the conference committee due to his work in sponsoring the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014."" And finally, Capitol newspaper The Hill said Rubio’s section about firing negligent VA workers was included in the overall bill-turned-law. Our ruling Marco Rubio’s latest ad said he ""wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers."" This is fairly accurate, with the one caveat being that his legislation was included in a larger bill, and passed as law with other reforms to the VA system. We rate this Mostly True.

Hillary Clinton's claim that she would make the biggest jobs investment since World War II
","In nearly every campaign speech, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says her jobs platform is historic in magnitude. ""My top priority is create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, which is why I've set five ambitious goals to get us there,"" she said in Scranton, Pa., Aug. 15.  ""First, we are going to make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II."" We’ve heard this phrase many times, so we decided it’s time we fact-checked it. A sizeable investment Remember, Clinton is comparing her proposed spending to actual spending since World War II. No one can say at this point how much Congress might approve if she is elected president. With that in mind, let's dig into the nitty-gritty. Clinton has proposed total federal spending in several areas: $275 billion on infrastructure, $500 billion on higher education, $100 billion in energy and research, and $25 billion on housing, plus less expensive investments in a few other areas. So that’s a total of at least $900 billion in new spending over a 10-year period (or two terms plus two years after she leaves office). How does that compare to the past? According to the Clinton campaign, the largest total federal investment in three job-making categories — infrastructure, education and research and development — since World War II was about $766 billion over a 10-year period starting in 1998, when her husband Bill Clinton was president. How Clinton’s policy team came up with this figure gets a little wonky. In a nutshell, her campaign collected historical data going back to 1947 to estimate how much the federal government spent on public investments each year — including spending on non-defense infrastructure, education, and research and development. Then, for each year, they calculated how much investment increased or decreased over the following 10 years compared to that first year. (All figures were adjusted for inflation.) Here’s a taste of what that means: The Clinton campaign estimated that the total ""public investment"" in 1998 was $174 billion. Over the next 10 years, the total increase in public investment was $766 billion. This is much smaller than Clinton’s proposed $900 billion (or more) in increased investments over the next 10 years. It’s a rough estimation, one that doesn’t necessarily capture all aspects of public investments, let alone how the spending leads to new jobs. But experts told us this is a plausible representation of the size of Clinton’s proposals compared to historic spending increases in these areas. They added, however, that we should look at the size of the investment as a share of gross domestic product, which helps scale the spending as a share of the economy’s size at the time. We ran the calculations (thanks, Excel!) and found Clinton’s statement isn’t quite as airtight once you factor in GDP. Clinton’s investment would be larger than most years, at about a 5 percent share of current GDP. But the share was higher every year from 1954-64 (ranging from 6 to 12 percent) and in 1998 at 6 percent. Still, Clinton’s proposals amount to a lot of spending, much of which she plans to finance through changes to the tax code. Her spending proposal ""does seem historically large,"" said Jesse Rothstein, director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at University of California, Berkeley. Rothstein noted for comparison that total federal spending on job training is under $5 billion per year, and the entire budget of the Education Department is less than $100 billion. For a more historical comparison, consider the biggest investment in infrastructure since World War II — the interstate highway system, launched in the 1950s under President Dwight Eisenhower. The project cost about $500 billion in today’s dollars over its decades of construction, according to industry analysts. Clinton + historic spending = jobs? Clinton’s argument evokes a classic economic debate: Does government spending create jobs, or are jobs lost as a result of increased spending and borrowing? Federal investment doesn’t necessarily equal ""new, good-paying jobs,"" though it can, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group concerned by rising deficits. But if the spending isn’t appropriately allocated, it can go to waste or get in the way of the private sector. Parts of Clinton’s platform are clearly geared toward creating new jobs, such as the $275 billion investment in infrastructure, which would involve construction jobs, and parts of a $10 billion package for the manufacturing sector that the campaign says would ""reward"" manufacturers for creating new, well-paid, local jobs. Other proposals are more nuanced or require making some assumptions, such as the notion that an investment in energy research and development would lead to higher productivity, as well as more private investment and eventually more jobs. The Clinton campaign argues her college and workforce training plans would result in higher-skilled workers being available for higher-skill jobs. However, much of that money will go toward reducing debt for many students. That might help some kids get through college who wouldn’t have, but for many, their job prospects would be the same — they would just have less debt. ""Obviously, not every dollar of that will go directly toward paying the salary of a new job,"" Rothstein said. ""But I think it is reasonable to count, say, relief of student debt as an investment in good-paying jobs, since a grad who gets an otherwise good job but needs to pay much of her salary in loan payments doesn’t actually have a good-paying job."" Our ruling Clinton says her campaign platform includes the ""biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II."" Using rough estimates of public investment in several sectors, the size of Clinton’s proposals — at least $900 billion over 10 years — appears larger than any other 10-year investment since World War II. It’s worth keeping in mind, though, that when we look at the size of the historical public investments as a share of GDP, there have been 12 years since World War II with larger public investments. In terms of whether these investments will result in ""new, good-paying jobs,"" that’s all a matter of prediction. In many cases, the new spending Clinton proposes for education, research and development, and infrastructure isn’t going to literally create new employment positions. Rather, much of the money will go to programs that the Clinton campaign argues will spur job creation. Her claim is partially accurate but requires additional information. We rate Clinton’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC6FC0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-claim-she-would-make-biggest-jobs/

Advocate: 70 percent of Texans overweight or obese
","Something to weigh in advance of your next pile of nachos: ""Seventy percent of all Texans are overweight or obese,"" the leader of a pro-health nonprofit said. Baker Harrell, chief executive officer of Austin-based It’s Time Texas, which says it focuses on preventing chronic disease, made the claim in an interview posted Aug. 15, 2016. A day later, after we inquired, the Texas Tribune amended its article to reflect what Harrell said he’d meant to say--that nearly 70 percent of Texas adults are overweight or obese. ""I misspoke,"" Harrell told us by email. In the Tribune interview, Harrell otherwise elaborated: ""Obesity is often discussed as the crisis. Obesity is actually a symptom of the crisis. It’s an important symptom, but it’s a symptom of the crisis. The crisis is that we have engineered health out of our daily lives, we’ve engineered it out of our communities, over the last 40 years."" We wondered if someone engineered the 70 percent figure. By phone, Harrell told us he drew his percentage of hefty adults (and again, not children) from the results of a 2009 telephone survey of 10,971 Texas adults. The survey of health risk factors, annually commissioned by the Texas Department of State Health Services, found that 66.8 percent of Texas adults were overweight or obese that year, compared with 63.8 percent of adults nationwide:          Source: 2009 Texas Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, Center for Health Statistics, Department of State Health Services (accessed Aug. 16, 2016) The survey classified anyone with a body mass index of 25 or greater as overweight. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a BMI of 25 and above to be overweight and a BMI of 30 and above to be obese. BMI can be calculated by plugging a person’s height and weight into a chart like this one or you can run this equation: Weight in Pounds / ( Height in inches x Height in inches ) x 703. Generally, the index serves as an easy-to-measure gauge of someone’s risks of chronic disease and early death, the Harvard School of Public Health says on a web page about preventing obesity. Then again, the school says, the calculation doesn’t distinguish between body fat and lean body mass meaning some healthy people might have indexes in overweight territory--a point PolitiFact made in a 2007 fact check. For our part, we also examined up-to-date survey results. To our inquiry, Chris Van Deusen of State Health Services emailed the latest available results, for 2014; they indicate that among 14,058 Texas respondents self-reporting heights and weights, nearly 36 percent would be considered overweight with another nearly 32 percent having BMIs consistent with obesity. The 2014 total of 68 percent adults overweight or obese, Van Deusen said, was up from 66.2 percent of adults in the 2013 survey. Also in 2014, according to that year’s results, 61 percent of adult Texas women fell into the overweight-or-obese category--and a whopping 74 percent of men. According to a 2010 CDC presentation, the share of obese adults in Texas and numerous states has escalated dramatically: From 1989 through 1993, 10 percent to 14 percent of Texas adults had BMIs indicating obesity; from 2004 through 2009, in contrast, 25 percent to 29 percent of adults fit the category. The 32 percent adult obesity rate for Texas in 2014 placed the state 11th nationally among the states, according to an analysis pointed out by Harrell. The Trust for American Health, which says it’s dedicated to making disease prevention a national priority, lists Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi as nearly tied for worst in the nation with about 36 percent of adults having BMIs suggesting they were overweight or obese. And how about overweight and obese kids in Texas? Van Deusen noted that paper surveys taken by Texas high school students indicate that in the latest year of available results, 2013, less than a third of such students had BMIs indicating they were overweight or obese. We checked the agency’s posted results, which indicate 16 percent of students were obese, 16 percent were overweight. The state spokesman also pointed us to research involving younger children. According to results from the 2009-11 version of the School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) Survey, undertaken by the University of Texas School of Public Health, some 43 percent of the state’s fourth graders had BMIs indicating they were overweight or obese; so did 37 percent of 8th graders. Our ruling Harrell said 70 percent of all Texans are overweight or obese. Clarification’s needed here because 2014 survey results indicate that 68 percent of Texas adults (not all Texans) had BMIs suggesting they were overweight or obese. Adding in children drives down the percentage. We rate this since-amended statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Gary Johnson correct that most Americans support legalizing marijuana
","In a Medium post touting his Libertarian presidential candidacy, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson addressed a variety of policies in his platform, including fiscally conservative policies, criminal justice reform and caution before committing troops overseas. He also returned to what has become one of his signature issues: the legalization of marijuana. ""In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana,"" he wrote. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran for president in 2016, ""came to that viewpoint — a position that most Americans support — 16 years later."" We wondered: Is Johnson correct that ""most Americans support"" the ""legalization of marijuana""? We took a look at the recent polling and found that Johnson is basically on target. It wasn’t always the case: As recently as 2005, public opinion was roughly 2-to-1 against marijuana legalization. But we found 14 polls since the beginning of 2014 that show consistent support for legalization. (The poll questions used the broad term ""legalization"" without providing specifics about how the drug would be sold or whether there would be restrictions on how it could be used.) Here’s a full list of those 14 polls since the start of 2014, drawn from the public opinion archive PollingReport.com: In 12 of these 14 polls, an outright majority of respondents -- 50 percent or more -- supported legalization. As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. Overall, if you average the 14 polls, legalization led by a 53 percent-44 percent margin. Joe Hunter, the communications director for Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, said the ""most reliable data, when available, is derived from asking the same question over time, with the same methodology. Of the major polling organizations, Gallup is the one who has done that."" During the time frame we looked at, Gallup asked the question twice, once finding an 18-point edge for legalization and the other time finding a four-point margin. The most recent Gallup poll before that, taken in 2013, found a 19-point lead for legalization. Our ruling Johnson said that ""most Americans support"" the ""legalization of marijuana."" All the polling since the start of 2014 -- 14 polls in all -- shows that legalization leads the status quo. Twelve of those 14 polls showed an absolute majority level of support.

Did Debbie Wasserman Schultz's opponent Tim Canova flip on how he would have voted on Iran deal?
","The Iran nuclear deal has been a hot topic in the Democratic primary battle between U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and challenger Tim Canova. The South Florida district is heavily Jewish, and Israel has been skeptical of the deal. In a mailer, Canova sided with three Jewish members of Congress who voted against the deal. ""In challenging times Israel needs true friends in Congress. When called on to protect Israel, some legislators step up,"" states the mailer, showing photos of U.S. Reps. Ted Deutch and Lois Frankel of Palm Beach County and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. ""Others don’t. Debbie Wasserman Schultz waffled back and forth before voting for the Iran nuclear deal, choosing party and personal political ambition over principle."" But how would Canova have voted on the deal? His answers haven’t been clear. In a debate on CBS4, host Jim DeFede asked Canova to clarify his position. We decided to look at Canova’s statements about the Iran deal and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate’s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. We found that Canova hasn’t really changed position, but he hasn’t always provided full answers, either. (Canova isn’t Jewish, but his stepfather is Jewish, and Canova said he has spent time in Israel including living on a kibbutz, a communal living area. Wasserman Schultz was the first Jewish woman from Florida elected to Congress.) Canova’s statements about Iran nuclear deal In 2015, Iran and five other world powers reached a deal. The agreement aims to extend the time it would take for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, subjects some of Iran’s major nuclear facilities to constant monitoring and creates conditions for lifting economic sanctions against Iran. Wasserman Schultz announced she would support the deal, saying that it wasn’t perfect but that it ""promotes the national security interests of the United States and our allies and merits."" On his website, Canova doesn’t say how he would have voted; however, he says that he would not support scrapping it. ""While I have criticized several deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal (no international agreement is ever perfect), now that it has been entered into, I support its full implementation,"" he wrote. Canova has repeatedly outlined his criticisms of the deal, including that Iran ""can simply mothball rather than destroy the centrifuges, thereby allowing them to restart a nuclear program for military use in the future."" He also criticizes the inspection protocols and the relief of sanctions. Canova’s most complete statements about his position on the Iran deal stem came in an interview with the Sun Sentinel editorial board in August 2016. ""I expressed reservations and criticism about the Iran agreement,"" Canova said. ""Now that it has been adopted, I am for strict implementation."" When interviewed by Sentinel reporter Anthony Man, Canova acknowledged that he had made some conflicting statements. Man: ""You earlier this year said that you would have voted for it."" Canova: ""Oh, I’ve been quoted both ways."" Man: ""You told me you would have voted for it. Is that accurate?"" Canova: ""I’m not so sure that’s accurate. Look, I’m not going to sort of play that game. I don’t know exactly how I would have voted because I wasn’t sitting in the seat, but I do know I criticized some aspects of it."" Man: ""In January, you said the deal wasn’t perfect, but you would have voted for it under the circumstances. You don’t believe that anymore?"" Canova: ""I don’t know if I would have voted for it. ... In a conversation when you called me at home you caught me off guard, I was a candidate for about a week. Did I say that? Maybe. I honestly don’t know how I would have voted for it."" Editorial page editor Rosemary O’Hara asked Canova, if the deal was on the table today, how he would have voted. Canova: ""I don’t know. ... I’m not a member of Congress, I didn’t have any kind of briefings the way Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, so I don’t think it's fair for me to say I would have voted for it, (or) I would have voted against it. I don’t know."" In a debate on CBS4’s Facing South Florida on Aug. 14, host Jim DeFede asked Canova if he would have voted for or against the agreement. ""When the question is asked as a hypothetical -- would I have seen classified information -- that’s when I have said who knows,"" Canova said. ""But quite frankly I can say right here that was not a good agreement for a couple reasons. First of all, Iran is the biggest funder of Hezbollah and Hamas, (and) to release $100 billion in assets (to Iran) right away without doing it incrementally is what I found to be dangerous and unsettling. And quite frankly, my position is the same as dozens of other Democrats who voted against the agreement."" We looked for other statements Canova made about his own position on the Iran deal. ""She voted for the Iran deal, and I’m against the agreement,"" he told The Forward in July. Richard Bell, Canova’s campaign manager, told PolitiFact Florida that The Forward doesn’t fully explain his position. On Aug. 1, according to the Times of Israel, Canova told the Sunny Isles Beach Democratic Club: ""I was critical of the Iran agreement. How would I have voted? I can’t tell you, I wasn’t a member of Congress."" Bell told PolitiFact Florida that Canova’s position on the Iran nuclear agreement has been consistent. ""He is critical of specific aspects of the Iran deal,"" Bell said. ""Now that it’s been adopted, he is for its full and strict implementation."" We agree that Canova has been consistent in his criticisms and in bashing Wasserman Schultz for supporting the deal. Our ruling Canova has acknowledged that he has ""been quoted both ways"" on how he would have voted the Iran deal. He said in January that he would have voted for it, but later in the campaign said multiple times that he didn’t know how he would have voted. He sent a mailer that didn’t say how he would have voted but sided with opponents. He has been consistent in criticizing the specifics of the deal and in criticizing Wasserman Schultz for her support for it. Because Canova’s position on the Iran deal has been unclear at different times, we give him a Half Flip.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C403300>],/factchecks/2016/aug/17/tim-canova/did-debbie-wasserman-schultzs-opponent-tim-canova-/

Does Donald Trump have a long record of exporting jobs?
","On his first campaign trip to Wisconsin as Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine was introduced at a Milwaukee brewery by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who drew contrasts between the Democratic ticket and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. ""I know with Tim Kaine as vice president and Hillary Clinton in the White House, we will have partners bringing the focus back on good-paying jobs for all Americans,"" Baldwin said on Aug. 5, 2016, the same day Trump visited Green Bay. ""Now, while Donald trump has a long history of exporting jobs overseas, I know that Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton will bring back good-paying jobs right here to Milwaukee. They will crack down on countries that cheat, like China. We need a vice president and a president who will go to bat for Wisconsin businesses, not look to send more jobs overseas."" Does Trump have a long record of exporting jobs overseas? Creating jobs overseas rather than in the United States -- yes. Moving existing U.S. jobs overseas -- no. Made over there Let’s begin by noting Trump has employed many people in the United States. (CNNMoney put the figure at 34,000.) He serves as an executive for more than 500 companies; his Trump Organization owns a portfolio of buildings, hotels and golf courses in the United States (and around the world). But he also sells many Trump-label products that are made overseas, as shown by three previous fact checks by our partners, and by our own online browsing. Trump cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps, mirrors and neckties are made in China. Some of the ties are also made in Indonesia and Vietnam and some of the shirts in Bangladesh. Trump suits are made in Mexico, India and China. Trump vodka, distilled in the Netherlands. Furniture, made in Turkey. And his crystal barware, made in Slovenia (the home country of his wife, Melania). But when Clinton said Trump ""doesn't make a thing in America,"" PolitiFact Pennsylvania’s rating was False. His campaign gear, some of his and other Trump-brand products, including bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are made in the United States. And PunditFact in October 2015 rated as Pants on Fire a claim that Trump’s iconic campaign hats are made in China (they’re made in America). The rest of the claim As for the rest of Baldwin’s claim, Trump did decide to have some of his products manufactured overseas, rather than in America. As the Washington Post reported, Trump in 2004 signed a deal with Phillips-Van Heusen, a manufacturer of affordable shirts. It was one of the first of many merchandise-licensing arrangements in which he attached his name to products made by foreign workers and sold in the United States. (PVH said in 2015 it was dropping the Trump line.) But it’s misleading to say he exported jobs, in that it’s not as though he created those jobs in the United States and then moved them overseas. Trump has complained that China manipulates its currency, making it more expensive to make products outside of China. Our rating Baldwin said Trump ""has a long history of exporting jobs overseas."" For more than a decade, Trump-brand products such as his clothing have been made overseas, although those were jobs that were created overseas, not U.S. jobs that were moved.

Myers raised taxes but Dick's moved for the airport
","Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in July that it will spend $100 million to build a distribution facility in Broome County. Still, Republican congressional candidate Claudia Tenney uses the company’s history in the area to attack her Democratic opponent, Kim Myers, whose father founded the retailer. The company grew for more than four decades in the area before relocating its headquarters to the Pittsburgh area in 1994. ""After all, Myers is an Albany-style liberal politician who voted repeatedly to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania for a more favorable tax climate."" This is Tenney’s second run for the 22nd Congressional District seat. Current U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna will leave office at the end of this term. It is Myers' first campaign for Congress. Did Myers vote to raise taxes in Broome County, but make millions off of tax savings when her family’s company relocated? Who’s Kim Myers? Kim Myers is the daughter of Richard ""Dick"" Stack, who founded Dick’s Sporting Goods in Binghamton in 1948. He was 18 years old at the time. Myers worked in the family business after college, but she left in 1987 - seven years before Dick's left Binghamton - to start a children’s clothing store. That small business no longer exists. She served 18 years on the Vestal Central School District board, eight years as president. In 2014, she won election to the Broome County Legislature. Voting on taxes She has voted on one county budget since her election to the legislature. In November 2015, Myers voted for a budget with a 1.88 percent tax levy increase. That was lower than the 2.21 percent increase Broome County Executive Debbie Preston proposed. She also voted to raise property taxes when she served on the Vestal School Board. That only affected residents in the school district, not Broome County overall. In New York State, it’s not unusual for school districts to increase taxes. The Vestal Central School District’s board one year approved an increase of less than 1 percent. Another year it approved a 3.9 percent increase. The tax levy decreased by 1 percent for the 2009 - 2010 school year. Moving to Pennsylvania Seven years before Dick’s Sporting Goods moved its headquarters to Pennsylvania, Myers had left her direct role in the company to start her own business. Tenney claims that Dick’s saved enough money on taxes from the move for Myers to make millions. Tenney’s campaign could not provide us with any evidence to support that claim. Dick’s Sporting Goods did not reply to our questions about its move from Binghamton to the Pittsburgh area. Broome County Historian Gerald Smith found a print article in Binghamton’s newspaper, The Press & Sun Bulletin from 1994. No mention was made of tax savings in the article. Instead, the article cited the new location's proximity to Pittsburgh International Airport. An article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also cited the airport. A copy of the International Directory of Company Histories says Dick’s chose Pittsburgh ""because of its access to airports and its national sports teams and as an area of extensive growth for the company, with a local population of outdoor enthusiasts."" Tax incentives were not mentioned. The state would not give us a list of financial incentives given to the company. In our search, the first mention of incentives comes four years later, when Dick’s had considered moving out of the Pittsburgh area. Dick's was given a $1 million loan from Allegheny County, a $350,000 grant from the state and local school tax abatements for five years on a sliding scale. Our analysis of historical data from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue reveals the corporate tax rate in the early 1990s was  higher in Pennsylvania than New York. The personal income tax rate in Pennsylvania was less than half of New York State’s rate, but at that point Myers was not directly involved in Dick’s Sporting Goods. Family company stock Myers did not own shares in Dick's Sporting Goods until the company went public in 2002, almost a decade after it relocated to Pennsylvania. A financial disclosure form Myers filed on May 29 with the House of Representatives shows she received between $100,000 and $1 million in dividends in 2016 from her share in the company, the same as in 2015. The form allows candidates to report their assets and income in ranges, not exact amounts. Our ruling Claudia Tenney said in July that Kim Myers voted ""to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania."" In her only budget vote since joining the Broome County Legislature, she supported a spending plan that raised the tax levy by under 2 percent. She also voted to increase property taxes while president of the Vestal School Board. Dick’s Sporting Goods relocated its headquarters to Pennsylvania 20 years before Myers’ election to the Broome County Legislature. We could not find any information to support Tenney’s claim that the company saved millions in taxes by moving to Pennsylvania.

Trump campaign chair misquotes Russian media in bogus claim about NATO base terrorist attack
","Donald Trump’s comments about ""Second Amendment people"" doing something to stop Hillary Clinton continued to dog his campaign in interviews on the Sunday news shows. But when CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper brought up Trump’s seeming inability to stay on message, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort insisted it’s the press who can’t lay off of Trump. ""I mean, there's plenty of news to cover this week that I haven't seen covered,"" Manafort said Aug. 14. ""You had the NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists. You had a number of things that were appropriate to this campaign, were part of what Mr. Trump has been talking about. ... Instead, you took an aside that the Clinton narrative told you was something, Mr. Trump told you he didn't mean, and you played it out for two days."" We hadn’t seen the terrorist attack covered either and wondered if the media had neglected a major story in order to wax on about Trump’s comments. Indeed, reputable news outlets didn’t cover this story — because it didn’t happen as Manafort said. Manafort seems to be fumbling an errant story from Russian state media. The weekend of July 30, RT.com and Sputnik reported 7,000 armed police with heavy vehicles had surrounded Incirlik air base in Adana, Turkey, where 2,500 U.S. troops are stationed and some 50 U.S. nuclear weapons are stored. The two Kremlin-funded outlets suggested that the lockdown was in response to another coup attempt after a faction of the Turkish military failed to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. So already Manafort is wrong about two key points: The incident occurred two weeks before Trump’s Second Amendment remarks and did not involve terrorists. What’s more, the Russian outlets’ reports were not exactly reliable. There were anti-U.S. demonstrations outside of Incirlik the night before the maneuver, but Turkish authorities said these were small and largely peaceful. They also dismissed speculation of a second coup and explained that police were conducting safety inspections in preparation for a top U.S. military official’s visit, according to Stars and Stripes and Bloomberg. ""It does appear that RT and Sputnik exaggerated their stories. Perhaps Putin was attempting to inflame emotions between Turkey and America. Which is certainly believable,"" said the conservative blog Right Scoop. Granted, Incirlik’s stockpile of nuclear weapons has been a cause for concern, especially after the July 15 coup. Media reports have also documented how the internal Turkish struggle caused some logistical headaches for U.S. troops stationed at Incirlik (including, for example, power outages). But that’s a far cry from a terrorist attack that flew under the news radar. Officials at the Pentagon and NATO told us there have been no terrorist attacks at Incirlik or NATO’s Allied Central Command (LANDCOM) in Izmir, Turkey. The NATO official also pointed out that Incirlik is actually not a NATO base, though U.S. and Spanish troops are stationed there. Our ruling Manafort said there was a ""NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists"" the week Trump made his comments about ""Second Amendment people."" Russian media speculated that there was a second attempted coup at Incirlik air base in Turkey. That incident was exaggerated and occurred two weeks before Trump’s comments. Furthermore, though it houses NATO troops, Incirlik is not a NATO base. Neither Incirlik or NATO’s central headquarters in Izmir, Turkey, have been attacked by terrorists. The event Manafort described did not happen. We rate Manafort’s claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3F6FC0>],/factchecks/2016/aug/16/paul-manafort/trump-campaign-chair-misquotes-russian-media-makes/

Aside from 9/11, Rudy Giuliani is wrong about no terrorist attacks before Obama
","Rudy Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Donald Trump’s counter-terrorism speech, appeared to forget one of the defining moments of modern U.S. history and his own political career: the Sept. 11 attacks. The former mayor of New York City during 9/11 was widely lampooned for suggesting that terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were unique to Barack Obama’s presidency. But many media reports left out the beginning of his speech, when he talked at length about 9/11. He recounted how it was the ""worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812"" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited ""Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help."" Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: ""By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office."" Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, ""We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush."" He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, ""since Sept. 11."" Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using ""abbreviated language."" But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to ""radical Islamic extremism"" is murkier in others. The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of ""violent jihadist attacks"" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification. That’s because strict definitions like ""hate crime"" or ""terrorist attack"" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — ""questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation,"" said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America. That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role. 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting   On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. 2002 Beltway snipers In October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24. The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over ""the continued oppression of black people."" A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself ""a Muslim American, angry at Israel"" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but ""acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization."" The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits ""into the terrorist mold"" while the New America Foundation lists it as a ""violent jihadist attack,"" because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions. 2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attack In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. ""I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree,"" he wrote in one letter. UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006. Terrorist attacks that were unsuccessful or with unknown motives Two other infamous attacks don’t exactly fit Giuliani’s criteria, but are worth noting. The 2001 anthrax scare, which occurred shortly after 9/11, is the worst biological attack in U.S. history and a major terrorism case, according to the FBI. Five Americans were killed and another 17 were injured during the attacks. In 2008, the FBI was about to bring charges against Dr. Bruce Ivins, but the microbiologist committed suicide before they were filed. The 2001 shoe bomber, admitted al-Qaida member Richard Reid, attempted to light explosives on an American Airlines flight before he was subdued. In addition to these attacks, the New America Foundation has documented a handful of thwarted terrorist plots before Obama’s presidency. Our ruling Moments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, ""Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States."" Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments. Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them.

Is NC Attorney General Roy Cooper really 'costing taxpayers money' on the state's voter ID case?
","Attorney General Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger in the North Carolina governor’s race this fall, has been repeatedly accused by Republicans of politicizing the office by not defending laws unpopular with his Democratic base. The latest flap is over North Carolina’s voter ID law, which was overturned July 29 by a federal appeals court. Cooper represented the state through the trial and appellate court levels. But after the unanimous and strongly worded ruling against the state from the federal 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Cooper said he wouldn’t pursue another appeal. ""I think this is what we’re going to have,"" he said, according to The News & Observer. Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent whose seat Cooper is trying to take this November, blasted him for that. McCrory later announced the state would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the ruling, even without Cooper. ""If any North Carolina citizen decided not to do their job, they would no longer have a paycheck,"" McCrory said in a press release. ""Roy Cooper should not be held to a different standard. Roy Cooper’s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money, so his office must reimburse taxpayers immediately."" Cooper makes $127,561 a year, and we’ll let others decide if he should work for free instead. We wanted to look into McCrory’s claim that ""Roy Cooper’s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money."" That’s a two-part issue: Is he refusing to do his job? And by not having his office represent the state on further appeal, is he costing the state money? Concerns with Cooper Republican leaders said they didn’t trust Cooper, since he has said he didn’t personally agree with the voter ID law. So they hired outside lawyers to work alongside Cooper’s employees. Cooper’s team won the voter ID case at trial – hardly the outcome of someone trying to sabotage it – before losing on appeal. But McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said it was more than just Cooper’s comments that led to the hiring of the private attorneys – it was the fact that Cooper’s political campaign has received contributions from billionaire George Soros. Soros is a Democratic donor who has funded challenges to voting laws in several states, including North Carolina. Diaz said that’s a conflict of interest that should have led Cooper to step down from office. ""There is precedent for attorneys general in North Carolina to resign while running for higher office when it conflicts with their duties,"" he said, citing former AG Robert Morgan, who resigned in 1974 to campaign full-time for the U.S. Senate. Cooper’s campaign disagrees. ""Attorney General Cooper is doing his job by advising the state when they have passed clearly unconstitutional laws that will not be upheld by the courts,"" said campaign spokeswoman Megan Jacobs. The job of the attorney general We’ve already looked into an earlier claim, from N.C. Senate leader Phil Berger, that Cooper was not doing his job by refusing to defend the LGBT law known as House Bill 2, which is being challenged by individuals as well as the federal government. We rated Berger’s claim Half True. State law says the attorney general shall represent the state in court, and it doesn’t give any exceptions. But legal experts say the attorney general does have valid reasons not to represent the state sometimes. For instance, they argue, the AG takes an oath to uphold the constitution and thus shouldn’t defend a law he truly believes is unconstitutional. The voter ID situation isn’t totally similar to the HB2 situation, though. While Cooper argued from the outset that HB2 was unconstitutional, his office did defend the state’s voter ID law for years. So can an attorney general start representing his state in court but stop before the matter is finished? Legal experts are split. Michael Gerhardt, a UNC-Chapel Hill law professor, said he thinks Cooper’s actions on voter ID were acceptable. The question, he said, comes down to whether or not the AG is allowed to change his mind. ""My take is that he can,"" Gerhardt said. But Campbell University law professor Gregory Wallace said he believes the AG’s discretion is more limited, and stopping representation partway through a case deserves strong scrutiny. ""Refusing to defend should be rare and exceptional,"" he said. ""When it happens in several cases over a short period of time which all involve highly politicized issues relevant to the AG's campaign for governor, voters reasonably may infer that the AG’s reasons are political, not constitutional."" Cooper has done this before. He defended North Carolina’s 2012 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, for two years, until the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a similar ban in Virginia. Cooper then said he would not continue North Carolina’s case, dubbing it a lost cause. The Supreme Court later proved him right, ruling in favor of gay marriage in 2015. Losing the state money? Whether or not Cooper’s actions are within the scope of his power, it’s a separate question whether he’s costing the state more money by not defending the law. That could be the case if the state suddenly had to hire private attorneys to take up its cause. But the state has been paying private attorneys from the start, even when Cooper was on the case. And it wasn’t just one set of attorneys. McCrory’s office hired one law firm, and the General Assembly hired a different law firm. In total, according to a recent report by WRAL-TV in Raleigh, the legislature has spent more than $4.8 million in state funds on its outside lawyers. And we don’t know how much extra McCrory has spent for the same case; WRAL said the governor’s office did not respond to its records request. Noelle Talley, a spokeswoman for the N.C. Department of Justice, said the private lawyers didn’t split up tasks with the state’s lawyers. ""The work was duplicative,"" she said. So really, Cooper is saving the state money. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from his office will not be traveling on the taxpayer dime to Washington, D.C., and the private attorneys who will argue it were already on the public payroll. Talley couldn’t say exactly how much taxpayers might save, but the scenario she described includes savings in the hundreds of dollars – small savings, to be sure, but savings nonetheless. ""Travel expenses would likely have included airfare, a hotel room for a couple of nights, and meals for one attorney,"" she said. Our ruling Gov. Pat McCrory said that in the voter ID lawsuit, Attorney General Roy Cooper’s ""refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money."" There is a question whether Cooper has the power to decide not to appeal further. But the issue of money is more clear – his decision is actually saving the state money. Since McCrory hit on a valid topic of debate with his claim about Cooper’s job duties but missed the mark on his claim about money, we rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DFB800>],/factchecks/2016/aug/16/pat-mccrory/text/
