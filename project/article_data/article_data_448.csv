Ted Cruz says he's engaged civilly with protesters at his campaign events
","In light of protests in Chicago that led to the cancellation of Donald Trump’s rally in the city, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz suggested that Trump should take a cue from Cruz himself. Cruz chided protesters for ""behaving abusively"" and Trump for telling his supporters to punch protesters in the face on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""I think it is important that any political candidate demonstrate respect for the voters. You know, listen, I get protesters at my events. But it's very different,"" Cruz said March 13. ""When I have protesters at my events, I endeavor to engage in them with civility and respect. More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance."" HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Is it true that Ted Cruz, famed for his debating prowess, actually engages protesters? When we asked the Cruz campaign for examples, they pointed us to a recent event at the University of Maine and Cruz’s interaction with actress Ellen Page at the Iowa State Fair. In fact, ""more than once"" is an understatement, Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips argued.   ""Admittedly, the press rarely writes about it, because it is common and generally a respectful exchange,"" Phillips said. ""It happens all the time."" Campaign reporters we spoke with agreed with Cruz’s statement, and we came across several examples of Cruz interacting politely with people with dissenting views or at least addressing their policy concerns. Let’s discuss Cruz made headlines in July 2015 when he debated anti-war activists for 24 minutes at the Stop the Iran Deal Rally in Washington. ""We want diplomacy, not war,"" a Code Pink protester yelled a few seconds into Cruz’s speech. ""You know it’s very interesting thing to see those who profess to believe in free speech who are afraid of speech,"" he said, before inviting the protester and his colleagues to come forward and discuss their opposing views. A month later, Cruz famously sparred with Ellen Page over the intersection of religious freedom and gay rights. Cruz disagreed with Page on most (if not all) points, but kept the exchange going for about six minutes. Even beyond flashy rallies and famous actresses, Cruz does genuinely engage voters, not necessarily protesters, who disagree with him, reporters covering the Cruz campaign told us.   For example, Politico reported on Cruz discussing Obamacare with a voter in Hubbard, Iowa, on Jan. 30. The voter pressed Cruz on his vow to repeal the health care law, and told Cruz that his brother-in-law finally gained health insurance under Obamacare but died because tumors were discovered too late. ""What are you going to replace (Obamacare) with?"" the voter asked. ""Well, sir, I’m sorry for your family’s loss, I’m sorry for your wife’s loss,"" Cruz said and launched into a critique of Obamacare. ""My question is, what are you going to replace it what?"" the voter continued to ask. Cruz responded that he would allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines and expand health savings accounts. A day later, an angry farmer in Iowa grilled Cruz on his position against the ethanol mandate (as many cameras and microphones lurked). Here’s a snippet of their exchange: Voter:  ""Why are trying to put salt on our injuries and wanting to take away our subsidies for biofuels?"" Cruz: ""Well sir, I’m not."" Voter: ""Yes, you are, you made that statement. Don’t tell me you’re not. You’re gonna keep it for the big oil people in Texas."" Cruz: ""Sir, I’m happy to have a conversation with you but not to yell."" Voter: ""I’ll quit yelling."" Cruz: ""Okay, I’m happy to have a conversation, but I’ll treat you respectfully."" Voter: ""I don’t understand it (Cruz’s ethanol position)."" Cruz: ""Okay, I’m happy to answer."" Cruz then explained his policy views to the voter for six minutes and answered additional questions. One-sided discussions When it comes to actual protesters, Cruz’s engagement is sometimes a bit one-sided and is geared toward riling up his supporters, said Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune. ""(Cruz) doesn’t create a real dialogue. It’s more for show than anything,"" he said. ""He doesn’t exactly talk with the protesters, but he does provide some kind of rebuttal. He is different from a lot of candidates in that he at least addresses what they’re trying to bring up."" Take, for example, how he handled protesters at the University of Maine on March 4. Cruz didn’t debate them, but did use their appearance to double down on his immigration policy. ""You wrote a sign that says, ‘There’s no human being that’s illegal.’ Now that’s true. Every human being is God’s creation, a precious gift from God. But if you really believe that no human being can break the law, you will discover the falsity of that if you resist the police officer right now."" When protesters interrupted him later, Cruz quipped, ""They hear there’s a Mexican border and they start chanting ‘Bernie’? ‘Build bridges, not walls’ — you know that is a very interesting statement. But I’m curious, what do you say to all those people who lose their jobs, what do you say to all those people whose wages are going down, what do you say to single moms who can’t afford to provide for their families? Sir, sir, I appreciate you exercising your First Amendment right, but the First Amendment does not give you the right to silence others."" Cruz reacted similarly, reaffirming his opposition to eminent domain when protesters chanted ""hands off our public lands"" at a February rally in Las Vegas. ""Thank you very much, sir, for expressing your views. One of the great things about the First Amendment is that it even allows Bernie Sanders supporters to come to our events,"" Cruz joked. ""And let me say sir, you have a First Amendment right to express your views, but at the same time, 85 percent of the state of Nevada is owned by the federal government. That will end when I become president of the United States."" Heckling hecklers Of course, Cruz’s reaction isn’t to talk issues every time he’s interrupted. Often, he brushes it off with jokes. When a heckler yelled, ""Ted Cruz looks so weird"" at a Jan. 31 Cruz rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Cruz responded with wisecracks: ""Apparently, the bars let out early tonight"" and ""Is that Donald Trump yelling in the back?"" A few weeks earlier, a man interrupted Cruz’s Jan. 12 Second Amendment rally in Hudson, N.H. ""Why is everyone so excited about guns? They kill people,"" the heckler said. ""Sir, you are welcome to be a part of the crowd, but you are not a part of this group. I understand that you’re very confused,"" Cruz responded, chuckling, as the man was escorted off stage. As Cruz began to transition into a stump speech about freedom, a second protester got up on stage, prompting Cruz to take a harsher tone: ""Oh, we’ve got another young man who’s very confused. Son, thank you — hey, hey, this is not your stage. … Boy, it’s almost like the Bernie Sanders people are scared. The Bernistas are out in force!"" A month later, two men  — who appear to be the same guys at the gun rally and identified as a ""guerilla comedy"" duo by the Huffington Post — tried to perform an exorcism on Cruz in Raymond, N.H., on Feb. 8.   ""Ted Cruz, look in the mirror and let the evil spirit leave, leave your power-hungry, demonic soul,"" one called out. ""They’re very nice young men, a very confused fellow. Apparently, they’re Bernie Sanders campaign,"" Cruz laughed. ""Look at yourself in the mirror,"" the heckler yelled back. ""You know, the very odd things, usually lefties don’t believe in God,"" he said as the two were escorted out of the event. Cruz cracked a Bernie Sanders joke when protesters interrupted his rally in Houston, Texas. ""I understand you seem confused about the First Amendment,"" he said, addressing the protesters. ""You have a right to speak, but you don’t have the right to disrupt others. I’m curious, does that coordinated effort suggest the lefties are getting scared?"" Our ruling Cruz said, ""More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance."" There are numerous examples of Cruz engaging with people with dissenting views. He’s had policy discussions with opposing voters and activists. When it comes to protesters, it’s debatable whether Cruz and the protesters are actually participating in conversations. Nonetheless, Cruz does usually address their issues. And he repeatedly affirms their First Amendment rights to protest. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8A0A40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/13/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-hes-engaged-civilly-protesters-his-c/

Hillary Clinton ad points out it's been 15 years since Americans had a raise
","As Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to ""root out"" several barriers to progress in a TV ad that aired ahead of the South Carolina primary in February, she offered one specific statistic to underscore the challenges facing average Americans. ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years,"" she says in the 30-second ad, which aired more than 150 times on four networks in the Columbia, S.C., TV market beginning on Feb. 20 and lasting through the Feb. 27 Democratic primary. The spot was captured by the Political Ad Archive, a database maintained by the nonprofit Internet Archive. Incomes are obviously highly variable among individuals, and many people have seen their wages increase since 2001. But economists and federal agencies keep data on aggregate income growth that can tell us, on average, whether Americans’ incomes are rising. To evaluate Clinton’s claim, we’ll start by looking at inflation-adjusted median household income, which takes into account rising prices when comparing average income levels across time. According to an analysis of U.S. Census Data performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, median household income dropped from $57,843 in January, 1999, to $53,657 in January, 2014, the most recent period for which statistics are available. That’s a 7 percent drop, and supports Clinton’s assertion that Americans haven’t seen their incomes rise over the last decade and a half. (These figures account for inflation by expressing income from both years in 2014 dollars.) Another way to measure whether Americans have ""had a raise"" would be to look at a narrower slice of the population: full-time workers over the age of 16. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis draws on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to show median usual weekly earnings for these workers. In January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341 – a 2 percent increase. ($334 a week equates to $17,368 a year, while $341 per week is $17,732. These inflation-adjusted figures are expressed in 2015 dollars.) As we’ve explained before, we could judge Clinton’s claim on this second figure, since it captures people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis and who could receive a ""raise"" as that term is commonly understood. That said, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth, and arguably the more appropriate one to use in this context. Many households receive at least a portion of their income from government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments – income that isn’t reflected in wages or salary data alone. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it’s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign ad claims, ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years."" Inflation-adjusted median household income has indeed dropped 7 percent over that period, while earnings for wage and salary workers have increased a modest 2 percent. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7B2200>],/factchecks/2016/mar/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-ad-points-out-its-been-15-years-am/
"['Abortion', 'Colorado', 'James Dobson']","
Ted Cruz ad says his wife will be 'very first pro-life first lady'
","There was a time when no presidential candidate's TV ad would trumpet his wife's views on abortion. But Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign does so proudly with an ad featuring James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family in Colorado, praising the Texas senator's spouse. ""His wife, Heidi, will be the very first pro-life first lady,"" Dobson says in the TV ad, in which he also endorses Ted Cruz for president. The ad has aired about 30 times -- mostly in Iowa before the caucuses -- between November 2015 and late February 2016, according to PoliticalAdArchive.org It is an intriguing claim, so PolitiFact decided to examine its accuracy. For this analysis, we're defining ""pro-life"" as how the first ladies felt about access to abortion from a policy perspective, not their personal view. We asked the Cruz campaign for information supporting Dobson's claim. (Dobson's spokesman said Dobson was out of the country and unreachable for comment.) The Cruz campaign provided a 2012 Townhall.com report, headlined: ""Surprising: Ann Romney would be first Pro-Life First Lady since Roe vs. Wade."" The story says that every first lady from Pat Nixon to Michelle Obama has supported a woman’s freedom of choice on abortion -- even if some first ladies’ personally opposed abortion. Ann Romney, wife of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, in 2012 told ABC’s The View, ""I am pro-life. I'm happy to say that."" Clearly, Mrs. Cruz isn't the first candidate's wife to be held up as possibly the first pro-life first lady. And in this election year, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio’s wife, Jeanette, is also described -- along with Heidi Cruz -- as ""Unapologetically Pro-Life."" The New York Times reports that friends and colleagues ""detect Mrs. Rubio’s influence on her husband’s outspoken opposition to abortion in almost all cases."" Remember, in the Cruz campaign ad, Dobson says Heidi Cruz ""will be the very first pro-life first lady,"" while the campaign’s supporting documentation is a story stating that all first ladies since the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion in 1973, have supported a woman’s choice on abortion. Experts say it is very difficult to find a first lady commenting on abortion before the court ruling, because few Americans publicly discussed the controversial issue, let alone presidents’ wives. ""The reason people didn't discuss (abortion) back then was because it was illegal,"" said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, who is considered the foremost historian on the political and social power of first ladies. His books include the two-volume First Ladies: The Saga of the Presidents' Wives and Their Power, 1789-1990. Anthony said it is known that two pre-Roe vs. Wade first ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson were ""pro-choice."" Yet this is why it’s hard to confirm or refute Dobson’s claim that Heidi Cruz’s anti-abortion stand would be a ""first"" for first ladies. In the past, if a first lady had opinions on abortion, ""they weren’t made public,"" said Edith Mayo, a curator emerita at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, who oversaw a first ladies exhibit. ""So you'd have a very difficult time tracing it,"" added Mayo, whose books include, First Ladies: Political Role and Public Image and The Smithsonian's Book of First Ladies. Anthony said first ladies’ reticence about discussing controversial issues changed during the national upheaval over the Vietnam War. Suddenly presidents’ wives, whose duties had historically tended toward ribbon cuttings and non-controversial projects, were facing tougher questions from reporters. ""The Vietnam War is the turning point,"" said Anthony, who wrote speeches for Nancy Reagan. ""So questions are asked to Pat Nixon that would never have been previously asked of her immediate successors. ... Mrs. Nixon really got to be the first one to be asked about the Equal Rights Amendment, about abortion, about amnesty for guys who didn't go to Vietnam."" ""From that point, every single (first lady) has had to address and respond to questions on important issues,"" he said. Yet it is true that every first lady since since Roe vs. Wade has publicly expressed their support for a woman’s choice on abortion. Here’s a list:  Pat Nixon: In response to questions after the Roe vs. Wade decision, Pat Nixon said, ""I believe abortion is a personal choice."" A year before the ruling, she offered a more nuanced opinion: ""I'm really not for abortion. I think it's a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand — wholesale."" Betty Ford: When Barbara Walters asked her views on Roe vs. Wade, Ford called it ""a great, great decision."" As she later recalled the interview, ""I just said, 'Well, I'm delighted because I'm glad they have taken abortion out of the backwoods and put it into the hospitals.' "" Rosalynn Carter: At a 1980 press conference, Carter said she and her husband are ""personally very opposed to abortion"" and always have been. However, she supported the Roe vs. Wade decision while being against federal funding for abortion. ""I oppose it for myself, but I have a hard time with deciding for other women what is right or wrong or best for them,"" Mrs. Carter once wrote. Nancy Reagan: After President Ronald Reagan had left office, Mrs. Reagan told a George Washington University class in 1994 that while she personally opposed abortion, she supported a woman’s right to choose. ""I'm against abortion. On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice,"" she said in response to a question from Anthony, her former speech writer who was teaching a class titled ""The President's Spouse."" Her comments were not a total surprise. According to a book by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, Mrs. Reagan once said, ""I don't give a damn about the pro-lifers,"" and demanded that all mention of abortion be removed from the president's 1987 State of the Union address. Barbara Bush: When her husband ran for president in 1980, Mrs. Bush drew attention by expressing her pro-choice views on abortion. Then, during President George H.W. Bush's 1992 re-election campaign against Bill Clinton, Mrs. Bush opposed Republicans placing an uncompromising anti-abortion policy in the GOP platform. She said it was a ""personal thing"" and added, ""The personal things should be left out of, in my opinion, out of platforms and conventions,"" she told reporters. She later wrote in her memoirs, ""She supports abortion rights. But, her opinion didn’t matter because she’s not elected by the American people."" Hillary Clinton: In January 1999, Hillary Clinton ventured into new territory for a first lady by addressing NARAL -- then known as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. She declared her goal of ""keeping abortion safe, legal and rare into the next century"" -- a phrase that's become her pro-choice mantra.   ""I have never met anyone who is pro-abortion,"" she told the crowd. ""Being pro-choice is not being pro-abortion. Being pro-choice is trusting the individual to make the right decision for herself and her family, and not entrusting that decision to anyone wearing the authority of government in any regard."" Laura Bush: While less of an activist than some first ladies, Laura Bush didn’t shy away from expressing her views -- even when they differed from her husband’s. Katie Couric asked her on the day of George W. Bush’s inauguration if Roe vs. Wade should be overturned, and Mrs. Bush replied ""No."" In her 2010 memoir, ""Spoken from the Heart,"" Laura Bush writes, ""While cherishing life, I have always believed that abortion is a private decision, and there, no one can walk in anyone else’s shoes."" Michelle Obama: Mrs. Obama often speaks about her husband's support for a woman's choice on abortion. ""And he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care ... that's what my husband stands for,"" Mrs. Obama said at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Our ruling In the Ted Cruz campaign ad, James Dobson says, ""His wife, Heidi, will be the very first pro-life first lady."" In support of the claim, the campaign provided an article stating that all first ladies since the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision have supported a woman’s choice on abortion. That is accurate. Yet, Dobson’s claim went further, stating that Mrs. Cruz would be the ""very first pro-life first lady"" -- the first in American history. Experts say it’s difficult to confirm or refute the claim because, while abortion has always been a controversial subject, before Roe vs. Wade it was also illegal. None of the experts we spoke with could cite a first lady publicly commenting on the issue before Roe vs. Wade, except for Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson. This raises the possibility that other first ladies may have opposed abortion earlier in the country’s history, but never expressed it publicly. With that caveat, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB110C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/11/james-dobson/ted-cruz-ad-says-his-wife-will-be-very-first-pro-l/

How much authority does Barack Obama have in allowing refugees to come to the U.S.?
","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who is bracing for an election rematch with Democratic challenger Russ Feingold, was asked at a public forum how concerned he is about the government’s plans to accept 10,000 refugees from Syria -- a move that stoked fears about terrorism in the U.S. In his response, the Wisconsin Republican made a claim that suggests President Barack Obama has unilateral powers when it comes to resettlement. ""President Obama has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country,"" Johnson said Feb. 5, 2016 at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee. ""That’s his legal authority."" The statement by Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, overstates the president’s authority. By law, the president sets the framework for accepting refugees -- setting an annual ceiling on the number and setting priorities on which countries are included. But the ceiling figure can’t come out of thin air -- it must be chosen in consultation with Congress. Moreover, the president and Congress set budgets for the agencies involved in resettlement. Trouble in Syria A refugee is defined as a person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion In Syria, unrest began in 2011 with protests against President Bashar al-Assad, in the wake of the pro-democracy Arab Spring. Assad’s regime responded with violence, and the country spiraled into a civil war. Civilians have been fleeing unrest in Syria — where more than 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Almost 130,000 Syrian migrants have reached Europe by sea just during the first two months of 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration. The crisis in Europe led Obama in September 2015 to tell his administration to take in at least 10,000 displaced Syrians over the next year. That was up from fewer than 2,000 over the previous 12 months. The law The federal Immigration and Nationality Act, specifically Section 207, spells out the process for setting parameters on the number of refugees to be admitted. Prior to the start of each federal fiscal year (which begins Oct. 1), the president must determine the number of refugees --""as justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest."" The president must arrive at the number, as well as the allocation of refugee slots, after consultation with the House and Senate judiciary committees. As Johnson indicated, speaking strictly about legal authority, the president sets the framework and Congress has no specific power to change the framework. The president does take the lead, but in consultation with Congress, on setting what becomes a ceiling on the number of refugees expected to be accepted each year and the priorities in terms of which countries the refugees come from. As a practical matter, the president wouldn’t be able to pick a number out of thin air. Moreover, Congress holds the power of the purse in funding the agencies involved in resettlement. The figures for the annual ceiling, and for the number of total refugees actually admitted, have been relatively stable during Obama’s time in office, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The ceiling was 80,000 in fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011. It dropped to 76,000 in fiscal 2012, then to 70,000 the next three years, before rising to 85,000 in fiscal 2016. Actual admissions didn’t reach the ceiling until fiscal 2013. The process Refugees are processed and admitted to the United States from abroad. The State Department handles overseas processing of refugees and the Department of Homeland Security makes final determinations about eligibility for admission. Which brings up an important point: Those agencies rely on both the president and Congress to for funding. That joint authority was underscored in January 2016 when Obama designated up to $70 million from a special fund set up by Congress to handle the 2016 increase in refugee settlement. It’s also important to remember that, regardless of the refugee numbers set by the president, refugees actually admitted into the U.S. must pass a variety of reviews -- a process that typically takes 18 to 24 months. Security, of course, is a major concern. Terrorism-related grounds for refusing applicants ""have been amended to lower the threshold for how substantial, apparent, and immediate an alien’s support for a terrorist activity or organization may be,"" according to the Congressional Research Service report. An alien, according to the report, ""is generally inadmissible for engaging in terrorist activity if he or she gives any material support, such as a safe house, transportation, communications, or funds, to a terrorist organization or any of its members or to a person engaged in terrorist activity."" At the same time, there are so many refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. that even if many applicants are rejected, there are more than enough others to take their place before the ceiling is reached. Our rating Johnson said Obama ""has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country."" Federal law requires the president each year to set a ceiling on the number of refugees to be admitted to the United States in the next 12 months and to set priorities on which countries they come from. But the president does not have unilateral authority. The president must set the framework in consultation with Congress. And both the president and Congress determine funding for the federal agencies involved in the resettlement process.

In Democratic Milwaukee, Mayor Tom Barrett says challenger Bob Donovan was, and is, a Republican
","Polarized though they be, if Wisconsin Democrats and Republicans agree on anything, it’s that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is a nice guy. Yet more than a month ahead of the April 5, 2016 mayoral election, it was Barrett who leveled a double-barreled personal attack on his challenger, Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan. After being targeted himself by radio advertisements from an outside group, Barrett responded by airing two radio ads hitting Donovan. In one of the ads, the former Democratic state lawmaker and congressman ties Donovan to GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. In a city that is heavily Democratic, Barrett essentially uses Republican as a dirty word. ""Donovan’s run as a Republican time and again,"" a female narrator says partway into the ad. ""And Donovan sided with Scott Walker and the Republicans in the state Legislature when they’ve tried to hurt Milwaukee."" The ad closes with: ""Republican Donovan -- Donald Trump erratic behavior, Scott Walker ideas. He’d be a disaster for Milwaukee."" Mayor and aldermen are nonpartisan offices in Milwaukee. And though Donovan is generally considered conservative, he hasn't readily been identified with a political party. So let’s check both parts of Barrett’s claim: Has Donovan run ""time and again"" as a Republican and is he a Republican now? Early 1980s Even many people familiar with Milwaukee politics don't know that in 1982 and 1983, Donovan ran as a Republican for a Milwaukee seat in the state Assembly. Both times, he was unopposed in the GOP primary and lost to the Democratic candidate in the general election. Donovan was a 26-year-old shift foreman for Milwaukee Solvay Coke in 1982 when he made his first run for public office. He was chairman of the South Side Republican Club. The Milwaukee Sentinel editorial board recommended Donovan, saying he ""has a zest for public office that seems missing"" in first-term incumbent Joe Czarnezki, but Czarnezki won. Czarnezki then went on to win a state Senate seat, causing the need for a special election in 1983 to fill the Assembly slot. Donovan lost that race Peggy Krusick. At that time, Donovan was still chairman of the local GOP club and worked as a security guard at Southridge mall. As alderman, Donovan has reached out to Walker and state Republican lawmakers, particularly when it comes to clashing with Barrett over issues such as crime in Milwaukee. And he announced his mayoral run on conservative talk radio. On the other hand, we could not find that Donovan has made any contributions to any state candidates -- of either party. And Barrett’s campaign couldn’t cite any evidence that Donovan currently is a Republican -- instead pointing to a November 2013 profile and arguing Donovan simply wants to avoid the label to maintain his ability to win in Milwaukee. ""I ran as a Republican in Milwaukee County,"" Donovan told Milwaukee Magazine. ""That will give you an indication of how incredibly naive politically I was at the time."" The article also said Donovan ""eventually conceded that being labeled a Republican could count against him in some voters’ eyes, even in a nonpartisan race."" But it also quotes Donovan as saying he was no longer a Republican, and instead calling himself ""a proud nonpartisan."" And it quotes a Milwaukee County GOP spokesman as saying he had never seen the alderman at any Republican event in the past 20 years. Schumacher said Donovan ""wouldn’t shy away from ‘conservative,’"" as a label, but he is independent and not beholden to either party. Our rating Barrett says ""Republican Bob Donovan"" has ""run as a Republican time and again."" Donovan identifies as a conservative, but there’s no evidence he is currently a Republican, or a member of any party. The ""time and again"" is accurate if perhaps misleading, in that Donovan twice ran as a Republican for the state Assembly in the 1980s.

Marco Rubio says foreign aid is less than 1 percent of federal budget
","Florida has the highest percentage of senior citizens in the United States, so Social Security was one of the big topics during the March 10 Republican debate in Miami. Most candidates spoke of how they would modify the program when discussing the balance sheet for Social Security. Donald Trump, though, suggested the United States cut back on foreign aid and other military spending in order to keep Social Security solvent.  Marco Rubio said he often hears people argue that a lot of taxpayer money can be saved by cutting back on foreign aid. That’s not reality, though.  ""I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget,"" Rubio said. ""We can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.""  We wanted to fact-check whether foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the federal budget. The amount the United States spends on foreign aid depends on who is doing the tally, as a 2011 Congressional Research Service report explained. Different agencies include different elements when they calculate what the United States spends on foreign aid. We'll use 2013 as an example, the most recent year for all four sources. • The federal budget only includes programs that fall under the International Affairs section of the budget, specifically sections 151 and 152. It says $32.5 billion was spent in 2013. • The U.S. Overseas Loans & Grants database, also known as the ""Greenbook,"" developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) uses a broader definition. The latest Greenbook lists the United States as giving $31.9 billion in total economic assistance and $8 billion in total military assistance that year, for a total of $39.9 billion.   • The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of  34 developed countries, measures foreign aid by calendar year and excludes all military assistance. It says the United States spent $31.3 billion in ""official developmental assistance."" • And the CRS has its own total that includes ""foreign operations"" plus food aid, usually found in the agriculture section of the budget. It pegged the amount at $35.74 billion.  So the range goes from $31.3 billion to $39.9 billion. On a total federal budget of just under $3.5 trillion, that's 0.9 percent to less than 1.2 percent.  In addition, we found multiple reports that put the figure in the ballpark of what Rubio mentioned. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in 2015 that ""foreign aid represents a total of 0.7 percent of the budget, or 1 percent if military aid is included. That means fully eliminating foreign aid would save only $35 billion or $40 billion per year – a very small fraction of projected annual deficits."" That’s not much different than historical figures. A Congressional Research Service report in 2011 stated that foreign assistance spending represents about 3 percent of the discretionary budget authority and just over 1 percent of total budget authority each year since 1977. For the 2010 fiscal year, foreign assistance totaled $39.4 billion, or 1.1 percent of the budget, To further complicate things, these tallies usually don't include non-traditional foreign aid, where other United States agencies engage in activities that most people would put under the category of foreign aid, such a joint research on pollution in other countries conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency.  ""It is estimated that these non-traditional sources of assistance equaled about $12.6 billion"" during the 2009 fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That would have raised the total actually spent on foreign aid to $47.5 billion. Our ruling Rubio said foreign aid ""is less than 1 percent of our federal budget."" Several reports put the amount of foreign aid in the ballpark of what Rubio said at the GOP debate -- and it has been consistently in the single digits or less. We rate this claim True. Editor’s note: We updated this story on March 14, 2016, with additional information from the U.S. Overseas Loans & Grants database. The rating remains the same.

No, GDP growth was not zero, as Donald Trump said in Miami GOP debate
","Donald Trump held up lifeless economic growth as evidence that America isn’t great anymore during the Republican primary debate in Miami. ""GDP (gross domestic product) was zero essentially for the last two quarters,"" he said. ""If that ever happened in China, you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a national tragedy. We're at zero, we're not doing anything."" Assuming that Trump was talking about growth in GDP and not the real gross domestic product (which was more than $18 trillion in the last quarter of 2015), his statement that it’s zero is an exaggeration. In reality, GDP grew at an annual rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, and 2 percent in the third quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Percent change GDP in dollars 2015, Q4 1.0 $18.15 trillion 2015, Q3 2.0 $18.06 trillion 2015, Q2 3.9 $17.91 trillion 2015, Q1 0.6 $17.65 trillion 2014, Q4 2.1 $17.62 trillion 2014, Q3 4.3 $17.52 trillion 2014, Q2 4.6 $17.27 trillion 2014, Q1 -0.9 $16.98 trillion Compared to China’s 6.9 percent in 2015, that may seem like scant growth. But it’s not zero, nor is it historically low — a point Trump tried to make and flubbed in his June 2015 presidential announcement speech. ""The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product … was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero,"" he said back then. We rated that claim Pants on Fire, noting that economic growth dipped below zero no less than 42 times since 1947. Trump doesn’t have the new talking point down, either.

Ted Cruz: 'I always opposed the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership)'
","Trade has become a dividing line in the Republican Party. While traditionally the GOP has been a vocal supporter of reducing trade barriers between the United States and its trading partners, the cost of trade deals on American jobs has led to outright opposition to the largest treaty now on the table, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to explain why he shifted from supporting the TPP to opposing it in the March 10 debate in Miami. Cruz was quick to say that the question contained an error. ""There are two different agreements,"" Cruz said. ""There’s TPA (Trade Promotion Authority), and TPP. I opposed TPP, and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about."" Cruz was talking about two separate pieces of legislation that are linked, but indeed are separate. Before we untangle them, we will assess Cruz’s statement that he has always opposed the TPP. In a June 2015 post on his campaign website, Cruz’s staff said that he was taking a wait-and-see approach to the TPP. ""Sen. Cruz has not taken a position either in favor or against TPP,"" the statement said. ""He will wait until the agreement is finalized and he has a chance to study it carefully to ensure that the agreement will open more markets to American-made products, create jobs, and grow our economy."" When the treaty language was released in early November 2015, Cruz’s stance hardened. At an event in Iowa on Nov. 20, 2015, Cruz said he would not support it. ""There are a number of Republicans on that (debate) stage who support TPP, who support (the Trade Promotion Authority),"" Cruz said. ""I voted against TPA, and I intend to vote against TPP."" That statement again blends Trade Promotion Authority with the TPP, but the key point is that Cruz said he opposed the trade deal. A shifting stance on Trade Promotion Authority Trade Promotion Authority is legislation that allows the president to negotiate a trade treaty with only an up-or-down vote on the final package in the Senate. The TPA was a key precursor to passage of the TPP. Cruz initially voted in favor of the TPA bill in the Senate. In fact, in anticipation of that vote, Cruz joined with current House Speaker Paul Ryan to publicly urge Congress to vote in favor of fast-track authority. Of particular importance to this fact-check, the opening lines of the op-ed the two published in the Wall Street Journal spoke of the promise of trade and described the TPP, while not actually using the name of the treaty itself. ""The United States is making headway on two historic trade agreements, one with 11 countries on the Pacific Rim and another with America’s friends in Europe,"" Cruz and Ryan wrote. ""These two agreements alone would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers."" The op-ed urged passage of Trade Promotion Authority, but the linkage to the TPP was the starting point. Trade promotion passed in the Senate. Following the Senate vote, the bill went to the House where it was split into two separate votes: one on TPA and the other on Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA (a program that provides training support, career counseling, allowances and wage supplements to workers affected by globalization and trade). On June 12, fast-track passed, but Trade Adjustment Assistance was voted down. In a procedural vote on June 23, the Senate passed the fast-track legislation once again, 60-38. But this time Cruz cast a ""nay"" vote. Cruz explained that he had learned new details of the TPA that smacked of a backroom deal and he would have no part of it. Our ruling Cruz said he has always opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The record shows that he took no position on the treaty itself until the full text became public. Then he said he opposed it. However, when Cruz first supported granting the president the key authority to finalize the TPP, he spoke positively about the concept of the trade deal. He described how it could bring millions of customers to American business owners. When the treaty moved from being a concept to actual text, Cruz opposed it. His statement glosses over his initial backing of the idea of the trade treaty.

Ted Cruz says Donald Trump said he will be 'neutral' between Israel and Palestinians
","The Republican candidates have competed to portray themselves as the top fan of Israel. During the GOP debate in Miami, Sen. Ted Cruz attacked Donald Trump for his stance on Israeli-Palestinian relations. ""On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians,"" said Cruz. ""As president, I will not be neutral."" Trump defended his record on Israel, arguing that there is ""nobody on this stage that is more pro-Israel than I am."" Cruz has a point: Trump did say he wanted to be ""neutral"" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. However, that doesn’t capture the full spirit of Trump’s comments about Israel. Trump the negotiator Cruz was using an attack line we’ve seen before in an ad by Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Sen. Marco Rubio for president. Trump made the statement about being ""neutral"" at an MSNBC town hall in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A Cruz spokeswoman on debate night sent us an article about Trump’s town hall comments.) MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other’s right to exist. Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator. ""Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it,"" Trump said. ""I don't think it helps."" Trump made similar comments a couple of weeks later at a February debate in Houston. He said that when negotiating a deal, it wouldn’t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy: ""It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' "" Trump said, adding that he can’t negotiate as well if he takes sides. ""With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel."" During the debate at the University of Miami, Trump reeled off his pro-Israel credentials, including that he was a grand marshal for the Israeli Day Parade in New York. He stood by his words about his goal to remain neutral as a negotiation strategy. Trump said although he is ""pro-Israel"", in order to negotiate a peace settlement, ""I would like to at least have the other side think I am at least somewhat neutral to them."" Trump’s previous comments about Israel In December, Trump suggested to the Associated Press that to negotiate a deal, the big lift may have to come from Israel. ""A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things,"" Trump said. ""They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal."" Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a ""huge sticking point"" in talks. The same week, Trump praised Israel by saying it had already ""given a lot"" in a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. But he said if elected, as a deal maker he wouldn’t want to give away his position ahead of time. ""I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room,"" he said. Trump also told the coalition that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013. ""I am a big fan of Israel,"" Trump said in the video endorsement. ""And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel."" During the 2016 campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump’s comments about Muslims. When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, ""I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders."" Spokespersons for Trump did not respond on debate night. Our ruling Cruz said Trump ""has said he wants to be neutral on Israel and the Palestinians"" Trump did make that statement during an MSNBC town hall in February. He has repeatedly said that in order to be an effective negotiator he believes he must approach the two sides with neutrality.

Common Core is 'education through Washington, D.C.,' Trump says
","Billionaire Donald Trump repeated an often-used conservative attack that Common Core is a federal program, but it looks like he needs a refresher course on the origins of the education standards. The subject came up during a March 10, 2016, primary debate in Miami when CNN moderator Jake Tapper noted Trump had called the standards a disaster. ""What are your specific objections to Common Core?"" Tapper asked. ""Education through Washington, D.C., I don’t want that,"" Trump replied. ""I want local education, I want the parents and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great."" When Tapper pointed out to Trump that states developed and adopted the standards willingly, Trump countered that Common Core used to be that way, but has ""been taken over by the bureaucrats in Washington."" Other candidates have said similar things, pledging to end Common Core when they take office. But Tapper was right, adopting and implementing Common Core is a state choice, not a federal one. Let’s review, shall we? (There won’t be a quiz, we promise.) History lesson The Common Core State Standards are a set of benchmarks for English and math developed after years of discussion between state education departments and private, nonprofit groups. The aim was simple: Prepare pupils for college-level work and careers, and to make sure children in different states across the country were all learning the same things in school. This goes back to 2007, when the state education officials in the Council of Chief State School Officers discussed creating standards everyone could use. The idea was that kids in, say, California schools would have the same academic goals as children in Alabama. Two years later, in 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core with input from teachers, parents and education experts. The final guidelines were released in 2010, and states were free to implement them or not. So far, 42 states have agreed to use them, with varying degrees of actual support. Minnesota only chose to use the English standards. South Carolina, Indiana and Oklahoma initially agreed to use Common Core, but have since withdrawn. In the 2016 presidential race, several GOP candidates have vilified the standards as Trump has, accusing the federal government of overreach in trying to unify school boards under the U.S. Education Department. Washington has done a bit to encourage states to adopt the standards. President Barack Obama’s signature education program, Race to the Top, gave states that have adopted a set of standards extra points (40 of a possible 500) when competing for grants. But the federal government didn’t help create the standards, and has no control over how they’re implemented. Even states that have adopted the standards are still free to set their own curricula. In short, it doesn’t matter who the president is, because there’s not much the federal government can do about Common Core. Our ruling Trump said Common Core is ""education through Washington D.C."" The education standards for English and math were unveiled in 2010 after state school officials, nonprofits, teachers, parents and experts settled on broad education goals. Washington was not a player in that game, although Obama has given states that have education standards a leg up when applying for grant money.

Trump attack inaccurately implies Rubio traded auto insurance vote for house sale
","Billionaire Donald Trump likes to talk about his money-making prowess, but lately he’s taken to the airwaves to imply GOP presidential primary rival Marco Rubio has cut deals of his own as a Florida lawmaker. In an ad we first saw on March 7, 2016, Trump’s campaign said Rubio had a history of shady shenanigans as Florida’s speaker of the House. The commercial included a dig about Rubio suspiciously changing his stance on an issue after money changed hands. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER ""As a legislator he flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling the house to the mother of the bill's lobbyist,"" the ad said. The ad hints that Rubio was caught in some kind of pay-to-play scandal without outright accusing him of wrongdoing. Trump’s campaign didn’t elaborate for us, but it appears Rubio wasn’t guilty of much more than a somewhat odd coincidence in the middle of some protracted legislating. The PIP battle Let’s start by going back to 2007 and introducing Rubio’s former West Miami neighbor, a chiropractor named Mark Cereceda. Cereceda was the lobbyist in question here, although calling him that is technically incorrect. We could find no record of him being registered as a lobbyist with the state in 2007 or any other year. He did, however, have a vested interest in the renewal of a type of auto insurance called personal injury protection, or PIP. And he let Rubio know about it. In 2007, when Rubio was House speaker, the state’s mandated PIP coverage was going to expire. The law required $10,000 in coverage that paid for accident injuries to drivers and passengers, no matter who was at fault. It cost about $100 or $200 per year. Then-Gov. Charlie Crist and the state Senate wanted to extend coverage when they met for the 2007 legislative session. The coverage was popular among health insurers and hospitals, which wanted to control costs. But Rubio and some House members weren’t fans, saying the PIP system encouraged too much fraud. Rubio demanded extensive fraud reforms and balked at a Senate proposal that he felt didn’t go far enough. ""We have to wipe out fraud. The current PIP system has so much fraud built into it,"" Rubio said during the 2007 session. ""An entire fraud industry has been created and unless that's addressed, there's no need to do anything."" Clearly, Rubio wasn’t going to budge on PIP without what he considered substantial fraud protections. Cereceda, who had many patients who paid for treatment with insurance, made it a personal mission to change Rubio’s mind. He joined other doctors and chiropractors in a campaign to pressure Rubio to keep the PIP mandate alive. He went to Tallahassee to meet with Rubio. He organized demonstrations at Rubio’s West Miami office. He hired planes to fly banners over Rubio’s home and office. And, curiously, he was tied to Rubio another way at the same time: His mother, Nora Cereceda, was buying Rubio’s house. The house sale Back in February 2003, Rubio paid $175,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in West Miami that was 1,340 square feet. He sold it to Nora Cereceda in April 2007 for $380,000 in a cash sale. That accounts for the $200,000 to which Trump’s ad is referring. Interesting, right? Well, the amount itself wasn’t so bizarre. Keep in mind this is after the housing bubble made home prices go haywire. Paying $380,000 wasn’t unheard of for a house that size within a square half-mile that year. According to property records, a 1,413-square-foot house with three bedrooms and two baths sold for $332,500 in June 2007. Three blocks away, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home that was 1,960 square feet sold for $373,000 in May 2007. The Miami-Dade Property Appraiser considered it a qualified sale at fair market value. Qualified simply means neither the buyer nor the seller were under any constraints or incentives, like selling a house to a family member. (The price is not such a great deal now, of course; the house had a fair market value of about $213,000 in 2015.) Both Rubio and Mark Cereceda have insisted the transaction was completely unrelated to the PIP issue. It just so happened that Cereceda and Rubio were neighbors, and Rubio’s house was for sale. Nora Cereceda’s husband had died and she wanted to live near her son. She was a retiree with money from a life insurance policy, so the cash sale isn’t so unusual. That’s especially true in Florida, which routinely is among the leading states in cash real estate transactions. The house sale closed April 13. Three weeks later, on May 4, the Legislature adjourned with no deal on PIP. Rubio didn’t budge on his demands for more fraud protections, and state mandates for coverage were scheduled to sunset on Oct. 1. But about that flipped vote …  Rubio wrote a letter to Crist on Sept. 28, months after the sale, asking the governor to include ""property tax reform and mandatory auto insurance"" to the list of issues to address at a previously called Oct. 3 special session, the third special session of that year. Rubio said in the letter that both the House and the Senate had worked on reforms that would foster an agreement on PIP. He credited then-House majority whip Ellyn Bogdanoff for creating ""sensible and comprehensive anti-fraud legislation."" Crist agreed, and legislators reached a compromise on Oct. 5, adding three measures to defray fraud. The final bill limited the prices that some medical facilities and doctors could charge for nonemergency care. It also required PIP clinics be owned or supervised by licensed doctors, and added $2 million to the state budget to hire more anti-fraud investigators. The House passed the bill 105-4, with Rubio voting yes. The Senate voted 37-0. He later noted that he considered the fraud protections sufficient, although we now know they didn’t do much to curb the problem. Fraud claims actually increased in the years immediately after lawmakers passed the 2007 PIP bill. They have since dropped after new legislation in 2012. Rubio’s campaign didn’t comment on the ad to PolitiFact Florida, other than to point out the accusation had been proved incorrect years ago when Crist tried to use it against him during the 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. Technically, it’s impossible to say Cereceda had no influence on Rubio. But Rubio didn’t say he would never approve a PIP extension, just that he wanted more protections. The near-unanimous vote in the House shows lawmakers overwhelmingly approved of the changes. Before we issue our rating, a brief afterword on Cereceda: In 2013, he pleaded guilty to charges he made his employees give illegal donations to political campaigns statewide. He and his brother Kemel Cereceda were given 60 days house arrest, three years of probation and fined more than $100,000. A Hialeah judge also lost her seat after taking a bribe from Cereceda. Our ruling Trump said of Rubio, ""As a legislator he flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling the house to the mother of the bill's lobbyist."" There’s no evidence Cereceda met the state’s strict definition of lobbying, and he was not registered as a lobbyist. He did, however, pressure Rubio to extend a PIP insurance mandate the then-speaker of the House opposed. His mother also bought Rubio’s house in the middle of a legislative session that could have dealt with the issue, at more than $200,000 what Rubio paid for it. Both men deny the sale influenced debate in Tallahassee, and no one can prove otherwise. Rubio didn’t really have a change of heart on any insurance vote. Months after the 2007 session ended, the House and Senate overwhelmingly agreed on new PIP terms that included fraud protections meeting Rubio’s expectations. Trump’s claim has a basis in real events, but there are several problems with the ethical implication he’s making about Rubio’s time in the Legislature.

Hillary Clinton says Bernie Sanders supported Minutemen, indefinite detention for the undocumented
","Immigration policy was a big topic at the Univision-Washington Post Democratic presidential debate in Miami. On several occasions, Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to attack Bernie Sanders’ record on immigration. At one point, she said, ""In 2006, when Sen. Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants."" She later repeated both parts of this charge. Sanders took issue with Clinton’s statements during the debate. Responding to a question from moderator Jorge Ramos about whether he supported the Minutemen, Sanders said, ""Of course not. There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation. What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it."" Many readers asked us to take a closer look, so we did. We’ll take the two parts of Clinton’s statement in order. Sanders voted for 'indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants' The legislation in question is the Community Protection Act of 2006, which passed the House on Sept. 21, 2006, but died in the Senate. Sanders did vote for the bill, along with almost all Republicans and a majority of the House Democratic caucus. (Then, as now, Sanders in Congress identifies himself as an independent.) By backing it, Sanders went against the urgings of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Council of La Raza, a prominent Hispanic group. So what did the bill do? According to the Congressional Research Service’s official summary of the bill, it would, among other things, ""permit indefinite detention of specified dangerous aliens under orders of removal who cannot be removed, subject to review every six months."" The bill itself says, ""With regard to length of detention, an alien may be detained under this section, without limitation, until the alien is subject to an administratively final order of removal."" The ACLU, in arguing against passage, said the bill ""would broaden the constitutionally dubious practice of indefinite detention. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that indefinite detention raises constitutional concerns, yet the bill unwisely expands that power."" The ACLU went on to call the indefinite detention ""inhumane, an enormous waste of scarce detention resources and a power expected of repressive regimes, not of our own."" Even though the bill itself does not use the precise words ""indefinite detention,"" the fact that the Congressional Research Service uses it gives Clinton solid support for using that descriptor. That said, Clinton’s phrasing leaves out a few nuances. Hearing this statement, one might assume the power was a direct threat to a broad swath of the undocumented immigrant population. In reality, the types of undocumented immigrants who would be affected by this provision are a specific, smaller subset -- those who are deportable, often due to having a criminal record, but who are awaiting a final legal decision. For a sense of scale, the ACLU in 2009 cited an Associated Press report that on Jan. 25, 2009, there were at least 4,170 individuals in detention for six months or longer, with 1,334 of those subjected to detention for one year or more. These are not small numbers, but it’s worth remembering that the best estimate for the total number of undocumented immigrants in the United States is around 11 million. (Clinton did, later in the debate, refer to Sanders voting for ""indefinite detention for people facing deportation,"" which is a more limited universe of people.) Clinton also didn’t mention that the bill would have required reviews of the detention status every six months. This isn’t a foolproof system -- many such immigrants, for instance, don’t have attorneys -- but it does indicate that the bill included requirements for due process. Finally, it’s misleading to say, as Clinton did, that supporters were primarily ""hard-line Republicans."" A number of liberal Democrats also supported the bill, including such prominent lawmakers as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and future Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. In a response released by the Sanders campaign during the debate, the campaign said that his support stemmed from a different part of the bill that dealt with gang members. ""Bernie Sanders believes that gang members who committed serious crimes should be deported and voted for legislation that, while overly broad, would do just that,"" the statement said. In general, though, Clinton has a point that Sanders supported a bill that includes indefinite detention. Sanders voted 'to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen' Both campaigns acknowledge that this refers to a 2006 amendment -- which Sanders voted for -- to a large Homeland Security appropriations bill. It was designed to bar the Department of Homeland Security from providing ""a foreign government information relating to the activities of an organized volunteer civilian action group, operating in the State of California, Texas, New Mexico, or Arizona."" What’s that all about? The Minutemen were a group of civilians who patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to stop people from crossing into the United States illegally. (We won’t take a position on whether they were ""vigilantes,"" as Clinton called them, since that’s a matter of opinion.) In December, the website BuzzFeed took a look at this largely forgotten episode and found a lot of fuzzy memories -- even by the lawmaker who sponsored the amendment and other Republicans sympathetic to the Minutemen. According to BuzzFeed, this dates back to a period before the 2006 midterm elections when ""an outcry raged in the fringier corners of the immigration debate"" that the U.S. government was quietly providing the Mexican government with intelligence about Minutemen patrols. When these concerns reached the halls of Congress, then-Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., introduced an amendment to ease the Minutemen’s concerns."" The article quoted Harel Shapira, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin and author of a 2013 book on the Minutemen, saying the debate was steeped in conspiracy theories. A statement on a Mexican government website ""was interpreted by Minutemen and supporters as the U.S. government collaborating with an enemy state, and putting the lives of patriotic Americans at risk,"" Shapira said. (We did not hear back from Shapira ourselves.) Responding during the debate, Sanders assailed Clinton’s effort to link him to the Minutemen, a group unpopular among many Democrats. ""No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make,"" Sanders said. Still, the Sanders campaign hasn’t given a good explanation about why he affirmatively supported the amendment. Instead, they have focused on making the argument that the amendment was moot, and thus harmless. ""People put forward nuisance amendments all the time,"" Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman told BuzzFeed last December. ""In this case, the Customs and Border Patrol said it was a meaningless thing."" The campaign cites comments by then-Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., who was the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee. ""I claim the time in opposition; but, Mr. Chairman, I don’t rise in opposition,"" he said on the floor, citing comments by customs officials that they already followed the policy outlined in the amendment. ""If people want to put it in the bill, I guess that is okay because it apparently does nothing,"" he said. Still, as with Clinton’s charge about indefinite detention, her statement about Sanders supporting an amendment favorable to the Minutemen is largely accurate. The one problem with Clinton’s statement is that she exaggerated the extent to which the measure was backed mainly by hard-line Republicans. The amendment did pass the House with almost universal Republican support, but it did attract a significant minority of the Democratic caucus -- 76 voted for it, while 106 voted against. Our ruling Clinton said that in 2006, Bernie Sanders ""voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants."" Clinton may have boiled down the substance of the measures a bit too much, but her accounting is largely accurate -- importantly, in her claim that Sanders voted for both measures. That said, Clinton glosses over the degree to which Democrats -- and not just Republicans -- supported both measures. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA5B0C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-supported-minu/

Is ISIS crossing the U.S.-Mexico border?
","Arizona State Treasurer and Donald Trump’s state campaign chairman, Jeff DeWit, claimed ISIS was crossing the border while lobbying for Trump on immigration in a Feb. 22 interview with CNN’s Carol Costello. ""Myself being in Arizona, we know firsthand that tens of thousands of people that come over illegally every month there's a big problem on the border. There's drugs pouring over,"" DeWit said. ""Now we have ISIS coming over the border. You have problems. There's only one candidate that's going to do anything to fix it, and that's Donald Trump."" He isn’t the first Arizona official to tie ISIS to the U.S-Mexico border. But there’s no evidence to support the claim. PolitiFact researched similar statements before: Arizona Congressman Trent Franks claimed that ISIS was present in Mexico back in September 2014. That claim was unfounded -- not a single law enforcement official could confirm it. We rated it Mostly False. Citing a report from right-leaning Judicial Watch, California Rep. Duncan Hunter said that U.S. Border Patrol agents caught at least 10 ISIS fighters on the border in Texas back in October 2014. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron rebuked the claim, noting that individuals with ties to ISIS apprehended at the border is ""categorically false."" We rated Hunter’s statement Pants on Fire. We decided to delve into DeWit’s ISIS claim. Is this terrorist group crossing the border? Officials say it’s not happening DeWit spokesman Sean Dollman provided us with links to several news stories, including the Judicial Watch report cited by Hunter. Dollman said it is well-documented enough ""to be mentioned by the Treasurer as a valid concern."" But he could not provide us with actual evidence that ISIS is crossing the border. Multiple officials disputed DeWit’s claim. While a small number of people from Middle Eastern countries have been detained near the border, none have been tied to ISIS (also called Islamic State or ISIL). Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Damon Cecil could not confirm the presence of ISIS at the border. ""We do know that people from Middle Eastern countries have crossed the U.S./Mexican border in Arizona. We are not able to confirm that anyone caught trying to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico has ties to ISIS or any other terrorist organization,"" Cecil said. The influx of immigrants from the Middle East using the U.S.-Mexico border, however, goes back several years. A report released in 2006 from the House Committee on Homeland Security states that ""each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism"" are routinely encountered when they attempt to cross the border. The report also notes that several items have been found at the Rio Grande River, which runs from Colorado through Mexico, including a ""jacket with patches from countries where al-Qaida is known to operate."" Moreover, the report definitively states that members of terrorist group Hezbollah ""have already entered the United States"" using the border sometime before 2005. An August 2009 Government Accountability Office report also notes that Border Patrol encountered three people with ""links to terrorism"" at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008. The House Committee on Homeland Security released an updated report in 2012. According to this report, from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, 1,918 ""special interest"" aliens, or aliens with ties to countries that ""could bring harm"" via terrorism, were apprehended at the border. But, as far as ISIS, the connection isn’t there. Recently, Border Patrol agents detained five Pakistani immigrants and one Afghan immigrant near the Arizona border in November 2015. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that records checks on the immigrants ""revealed no derogatory information.""   Eight Syrians were also stopped at the Texas border in November, but DHS said they were regular migrants. Colin Clarke, an international security expert at the Rand Corporation, said he hasn’t seen any evidence of ISIS coming in over the border, but it’s possible. ""The border is vulnerable, why wouldn’t they try that?"" Clarke said. ""It’s certainly feasible that these guys could, through multiple attempts, smuggle someone across."" Tim Nichols, an intelligence expert and associate professor at Duke University, said he is not aware of any information supporting DeWit’s statement. And neither are the feds. ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson. We also reached out to Mexico’s embassy in Washington D.C. Their spokesman, Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, refuted DeWit’s claim. ""The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies any statement on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region. Mexican authorities have no record of the presence of Islamist extremist groups or individuals in Mexico. Officials from Mexico and the United States maintain permanent contact with each other and continuously exchange information on security threats,"" Morales said. A June 2015 State Department terrorism report makes this clear too: ""There were no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, despite several erroneous press reports to the contrary during 2014. There was no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory."" Our ruling DeWit said, ""now we have ISIS coming over the border."" There is no definitive evidence of that. Yes, people with ties to the Middle East have been encountered at the border. Members of terrorist group Hezbollah entered the United States via the border sometime before 2005. But there’s no evidence that terrorists linked to ISIS have crossed the border, and many public safety officials have said flatly that it hasn’t happened. For that, we rate DeWit’s claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9F6300>],/factchecks/2016/mar/10/jeff-dewit/isis-crossing-us-mexico-border/

Ilhan Omar's claim about the tax burden of the 1% needs context
","U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., explained her support for a ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care proposal with criticism of the U.S. tax system, saying it is too generous to the richest Americans.  ""Let these facts sink in: The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else,"" Omar tweeted Oct. 12. ""27 million Americans don’t have health insurance. We can address both issues by taxing the wealthy to fund #MedicareForAll. Let’s get it done when we get back to Washington."" Let these facts sink in:-The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else.-27 million Americans don’t have health insurance.We can address both issues by taxing the wealthy to fund #MedicareForAll. Let’s get it done when we get back to Washington. https://t.co/T7PZ2SFAhR Omar is right about the number of uninsured Americans: The most recent annual report by the U.S. Census Bureau found that almost 27.5 million Americans lacked health insurance for all of 2018. Here, we’ll take a closer look at her first assertion that ""the 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else."" We found that the reality is more complicated than Omar portrayed it. Several days earlier, Omar shared a New York Times article about ""The Triumph of Injustice,"" a new book by University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The book by Saez and Zucman offered a similar statistic — one that received significant media attention.  The book argues that in 2018, the richest 400 households in the United States paid a lower effective tax rate than households in any other income range. Effective tax rates refer to taxes paid as a percentage of income earned. Due to tax breaks and other factors, effective tax rates are usually lower than the statutory tax rates for a given income level.  Some critics have questioned the Saez-Zucman methodology, saying it exaggerates the amount of taxes paid by lower-income Americans. That’s because their analysis excluded refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, even though both are administered through the tax code.  Failing to account for these tax refunds artificially shows higher tax payments for the lower-income households that take advantage of these credits, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. That’s important context, but there’s something else to know for this fact-check: The statement Omar tweeted is not identical to the widely publicized finding of the Saez-Zucman book.  First, their finding didn’t address the top 1% of households — it addressed the top 400 households in the country. That’s not a minor switch: The most recent IRS figures show that 1.4 million households belonged to the top 1%. That’s a universe more than 3,500 times larger than the top 400 households. Second, Omar’s tweet said the top 1% paid ""less in taxes"" than everyone else, which can be read to mean a dollar amount. However, the Saez-Zucman research addressed effective tax rates, which is the percentage of income paid in taxes, not the overall amount paid. By other measures, however, Omar has a stronger point that the richest 1% of Americans pay less in taxes than the rest of the country. Tax Policy Center estimates for 2019 show the top 1% paid 27% of all federal taxes, compared with 73% of taxes paid by the bottom 99%.  Meanwhile, the total amount of tax dollars paid by the top 1% ($828 billion) was exceeded by the amount paid by the bottom 99% ($2.27 trillion). (Note: The center’s baseline data account for all types of federal taxes, including individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, the estate tax, and excise taxes, but it excludes state and local taxes.) ""The congresswoman's statement was accurate —– the richest 1% of Americans pay less in overall taxes than everyone else, no matter how you slice the data,"" said Jeremy Slevin, a spokesman for Omar. ""And while the federal tax system is more progressive, when you factor in state and local taxes, it paints a much more regressive picture of the taxes Americans pay.""  Still, it’s not too surprising that a group 99 times as large would collectively pay more in taxes. Omar’s decision to focus on this point obscures some key context: The 1% still pays a disproportionate share of the federal tax bill. How do we know this? This data shows that 1% of the U.S. tax-paying population earns 16.1% of the nation’s pre-tax income. But it pays 27% of the tax burden. You can argue that the richest Americans should pay even more than 27% of the nation’s taxes; either way, it’s clear that the current tax system requires that a small but wealthy fraction of Americans shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden. Omar tweeted, ""The 1% is paying less in taxes than everyone else."" The bottom 99% pay more in tax dollars and shoulder a larger percentage of the tax burden than the top 1%. However, focusing on this calculation ignores a contrary piece of the picture: the top 1% continues to pay a larger share of all federal taxes than it collects in income.

Julian Castro wrong about job losses in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania
","During the Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, Julian Castro took a shot at President Donald Trump’s stewardship of the economy — especially in three key Midwestern states Trump won in 2016. ""All of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises,"" Castro said, ""because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them."" Castro’s campaign got back to us with an explanation, but it relies on an atypical reading of the numbers to achieve its effect. Here’s what we found when we looked at the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers in the simplest, most traditional fashion. The latest official release state-by-state employment trends is current through August 2019. Here’s what you get if you compare the August 2019 figures to the July 2019 figures: Ohio: A gain of 3,700 jobs. Michigan: A gain of 6,100 jobs Pennsylvania: A gain of 16,500 jobs. So how does Castro support his claim of job losses in those states? His campaign told PolitiFact that he compared March figures with July figures, showing that employment dropped in Ohio by 7,300, in Michigan by 11,500, and in Pennsylvania by 4,500. Note that Castro used July, rather than August, even though August numbers are available. He argued that July is a better measurement because the August numbers will be revised before being made official. The August numbers will indeed be revised — here’s a primer on employment data revisions we put together recently — but it’s not a common practice to simply wave away the most recent figures because they will eventually be revised. All employment numbers are eventually revised, yet economists regularly study the most recent ones, politicians talk about them, and the media covers them. More to the point, Castro didn’t provide any indication in his statement that he was using a non-standard comparison. What his figures amount to are a cherry-picked month-to-month quirk that paints a misleading picture of the job trends in each of these states. For instance, here’s the change for the full-year period between August 2018 and August 2019: Ohio: A gain of 24,800 jobs. Michigan: A gain of 16,000 jobs Pennsylvania: A gain of 38,400 jobs. And here are the employment trends since Trump took office in 2016, using BLS data collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Each state has seen its employment levels rise. Here’s Ohio:  Here’s Michigan:  And here’s Pennsylvania:  Castro said, ""Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs."" Official government figures show that each state gained jobs between July 2019 and August 2019, the latest month-over-month period available. To arrive at his job-loss figure, Castro cherry-picked a time period that he didn’t mention in his remarks — a time period that ignores the existence of the most current data. His assertion that employment levels have been crumbling in these states is belied by data showing that each state has seen job gains both in the past year and since Trump took office.

Joe Biden’s claim on Medicare For All tax hikes rests on flaky analysis
","Sparring over ""Medicare for All"" and universal health care, Vice President Joe Biden leaned on a new variation of attack line, highlighting potential costs to middle-class Americans. ""For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes,"" Biden said at the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate. We’ve heard many debates over what Medicare for All could ultimately cost, but these specific figures were new to us. And the health plan — pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and backed as well by Sen. Elizabeth Warren — leaves many details yet to be colored in. We were curious where these figures came from, and how they could be derived. So we decided to dig in. We contacted the Biden campaign, which told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax — financing mechanisms they said have been proposed by Sanders. When you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised. But this math is problematic on many levels. For one thing, Sanders’ bill doesn’t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn’t include any financing mechanism at all. In a separate document, Sanders talks about different ways to pay for the system — and those are listed as two examples of pay-fors. But they aren’t the only ones, and Sanders frames this list as ""a number of options to begin [the] discussion."" So suggesting that Medicare for All would increase taxes as specifically as Biden suggests is an inaccurate reflection of the bill. Another issue is that there isn’t a good sense of what this health plan would cost, so any estimate of its tax burden is really just a guess. ""There are so many unknowns that you cannot say anything definitive,"" said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University. Biden’s statement ""could be true,"" he added — but ""there’s no evidence either way."" And there’s another issue, said Ellen Meara, a health economist at Dartmouth College. That is, highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading, she argued. Meara pointed to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that the average employer-sponsored plan for a family of four costs $20,000 per in premiums. That, economists say, results in lower wages for employees. Many argue that if employers were relieved of this cost, that would translate into people earning significantly more in take-home pay. ""A $5,000 or $6,000 tax is really quite small compared with what middle-class families forego in cash wages to get employer-sponsored coverage,"" Meara said. Biden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how Medicare for all would affect families making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year. Those numbers don’t come out of thin air, but they are based on too many assumptions to be reliable. And they don’t accurately reflect what we know about what this plan would cost, or the extent to which it proposes specific new taxes. This claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and assumes more than the evidence warrants.

Elizabeth Warren wades into debate on health care costs and bankruptcy
","In a back-and-forth about Medicare for All and the cost of health care, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., directed the discussion back to medical debt and bankruptcy — citing her own work from Harvard Law School. ""Back when I was studying it, two out of three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance,"" Warren said. This is a new emphasis in the ongoing debate over health care costs, and the debate over what role health care plays in American finances. Instead of focusing on uninsurance, Warren stepped into whether the insurance people currently have is sufficient. But much of the research around medical debt and bankruptcy is controversial — especially Warren’s own work.  We decided to take a deeper look. Warren’s campaign directed us to research published in 2009 in the American Journal of Medicine. Co-authored by Warren, it looks at a random sample of 2,314 bankruptcy filers from 2007.  The paper examined what debtors reported as their cause of bankruptcy. Warren is referring here to people who either cited significant direct medical debt, remortgaging a home to pay medical debt, or lost income due to illness. In that category, more than two-thirds of families had health insurance — in fact, three-quarters did.  So from that simple standpoint, the number checks out. But it isn’t necessarily that simple. This specific paper has long been the subject of controversy. In part, it’s because it focuses on people who have declared bankruptcy, rather than looking at the financial impact of medical debt at large. Scholars are also quick to note that, in the majority of so-called ""medical bankruptcies"" identified in the paper, the issue wasn’t debts incurred to pay off health care bills. Rather, the bigger problem was foregone income because people couldn’t work. That’s fueled a lengthy back-and-forth, in particular over whether this paper is actually useful in determining what role medical debt plays in fueling bankruptcies. But its impact on this specific claim isn’t so clear. That’s because Warren narrowed her statement, and focused on something less disputable.  For one thing, the paper is clear in finding that two-thirds of families — in fact, more than that — experienced bankruptcy after a medical problem despite having health insurance.  That finding was ""the headline of the study,"" said Paul Ginsburg, a health economist and professor at the University of Southern California. (Ginsburg also noted the importance of foregone income in driving bankruptcies, rather than medical costs.) And Warren qualified it further during the debate, by limiting this statistic to what was found ""back when [she] was studying it"" — making it a less sweeping claim. What’s more suspect is whether this finding — even if accurate — supports her next point: that the cost of health care is what’s driving people’s financial problems, and that a generous single-payer plan would ameliorate this issue.  For instance, ""You cannot go from that result to a conclusion that we need Medicare For All,"" Ginsburg said.  Health insurance is more generous today than it was when Warren studied it, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And insuring everyone — even as generously as Medicare For All suggests — wouldn’t necessarily address the issue of foregone income when people are sick, which the research suggests is a bigger financial concern. Warren’s claim comes from a paper that is controversial, and whose methods and interpretation have been called into question. That said, this statistic is fairly specific, and her wording in the claim precise. In itself, it’s a fair reflection of what the paper says. Where caution is more important: Warren says this finding suggests the cost of health care is what’s causing Americans financial harm. That isn’t necessarily borne out, and requires more scrutiny. This statement is accurate but would benefit from more information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA23940>],/factchecks/2019/oct/16/elizabeth-warren/warren-wades-debate-health-care-costs-and-bankrupt/

Refereeing Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren on public support for Medicare for All
","Pete Buttigieg sparred with Elizabeth Warren at the most recent Democratic debate over how to expand health insurance coverage for all Americans. Buttigieg said he favors allowing Americans younger than 65 to enroll in Medicare if they wish. Warren, by contrast, prefers to transition all Americans from their current insurance plan to government coverage. ""Elizabeth supports Medicare for All, which would provide all Americans with a public health care program,"" her website says. Here’s what Buttigieg said at the Oct. 15 debate in Westerville, Ohio: ""I don’t think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. The choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It’s just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not. And I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans."" Is Buttigieg correct to say that Americans prefer giving people under 65 an option to join Medicare as opposed to requiring them to give up their current coverage? As we seek to answer this question, we’ll begin by noting that terminology and question wording matters a lot when pollsters ask Americans for their preferences.  Looking at the recent polls on health policy reveals a wide variation in how questions are worded making many of them not useful for refereeing the Buttigieg-Warren exchange. However, we did find two polls from 2019 that are on point — and both of them support Buttigieg’s position. An NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll conducted in mid July asked, ""Do you think Medicare for All – that is, a national health insurance program for all Americans that replaces private health insurance – is a good idea or a bad idea?"" This is essentially the Warren approach. On that question, 41% of respondents thought that was a good idea, but a larger percentage – 54% – said it was a bad idea.  A second question by NPR/PBS/Marist asked respondents about an approach more in line with Buttigieg’s idea. The survey asked, ""Do you think Medicare for all that want it – that is, allow all Americans to choose between a national health insurance program or their own private health insurance – is a good idea or a bad idea?"" That proposal earned a strong thumbs-up from respondents: 70% said it was a good idea, with only 25% saying it was a bad idea. A second poll – conducted by Kaiser in January 2019 – found stronger support for the Buttigieg approach than for the Warren approach. The survey asked, ""Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-All, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan"" – essentially the Warren approach. For this question, a majority did favor it – 56% support compared to 42% opposition. But support was even stronger for the Buttigieg approach. The survey asked, ""Do you favor or oppose creating a national government administered health plan similar to Medicare that would be open to anyone, but would allow people to keep the coverage they have if they prefer?"" This drew support from 74% of respondents and opposition from only 24%. A third option with a slightly different wording fared even better in Kaiser’s polling. ""Do you favor or oppose allowing people between the ages of 50 and 64 to buy insurance through the Medicare program?"" This won the support of 77% of respondents, compared to only 18% opposition. Support was strong across all parties: It won 85% support from Democrats, 75% support from Independents, and 69% from Republicans. Kaiser’s most recent polling, released the same day as the debate, shows a steady rise in support for the Buttigieg approach – from 65% in July to 73% in October – and a steady decline for Warren’s approach – from 56% in January to 51% in October. Buttigieg said that Americans ""say that what they want is a choice"" to join a single-payer system like Medicare rather than ending private insurance. Polling on this question shows higher levels of support for an opt-in approach to expanding Medicare than for a required switch away from private insurance.

In phony Facebook ad, Warren said most TV networks will refuse ads with a 'lie' but that’s wrong
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren escalated her battle to break up Facebook by posting an ad that intentionally included a false account about Mark Zuckerberg backing President Donald Trump. Warren’s goal was to show that the social media giant allows misinformation by Trump. ""Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,"" the Oct. 10 ad began. ""You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, ""how could this possibly be true?"" The ad then pivoted to a disclaimer — no, the Facebook CEO did not endorse Trump — before attacking Facebook: ""What Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform –-- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters. If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks."" Warren’s post followed an unsuccessful push by the Joe Biden campaign to get Facebook to reject a Trump campaign ad about Biden’s role in the firing of a prosecutor in Ukraine. PolitiFact rated a statement in a similar Trump ad False. Facebook denied Biden’s request. We decided to fact-check Warren’s claim that unlike Facebook, most TV networks will refuse to air a political campaign ad that contains falsehoods.  While the Warren campaign cited a half dozen examples in recent years of TV networks or stations rejecting ads, we found that broadcast networks are generally required to run candidate ads under federal law. The same law doesn’t apply to cable networks or to PAC ads.  Facebook does have a partnership with third-party fact-checkers -- including PolitiFact -- to debunk viral hoaxes and demote that content. But Facebook exempts politicians from the fact-checking program, stating that it won’t ""referee political debates"" or block a politician’s speech from an audience. While Facebook drew attention for an announcement in September about exempting political candidates, that had already been Facebook’s policy since 2017. Christopher Terry, a University of Minnesota professor of communications and expert on political advertising, said that because Facebook is a private unregulated platform, it can do what it wants. ""Because Facebook is its own playground, it gets to make its own rules,"" he said. Facebook has set rules about transparency to show who paid for ads. But it doesn’t restrict political content.  There are rules, however, for television. Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 states: ""If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provision of this section."" It also specifically says licensees can’t censor ""material broadcast by any such candidate.""  Broadcasters are bound by that act and therefore can’t reject a presidential candidate’s ad, even if contains false information. (The candidates do have to abide by disclosure rules to make it clear who paid for the ad.) Every election season, some candidates argue that they have been unfairly attacked and that broadcasters should take down ads, wrote David Oxenford, a lawyer who has represented broadcasters for decades and is a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP. However, ""broadcasters can’t censor a candidate ad, so they can’t reject it (or remove it from the air) no matter what its content is,"" Oxenford wrote. There are caveats.The law does not apply to PACs or independent expenditure ads. And, importantly, the rules for political ads have been interpreted not to apply to cable networks such as CNN. The rules do apply to local cable operators.  Cable networks somewhat subscribe to the idea in the act that they won’t censor content, but they aren’t bound by it, Terry said.  CNN rejected an ad about Biden and the Ukraine prosecutor. The ad mentioned ""media lapdogs"" for the Democrats as it showed footage of CNN stars.  The ad disparages CNN and ""makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets,"" a CNN spokesperson told PolitiFact. That ad was one of a handful of ads the Warren campaign cited as examples of political ads TV or radio rejected in recent years. Multiple stations and Facebook ultimately rejected a Trump ad about a migrant caravan in 2018 that critics said was racist.  We sent Warren’s examples to Terry, the University of Minnesota professor. He said that Warren’s examples included issue ads, which aren’t covered by the rule. ""It’s only the campaign ads that are protected from the no-censorship provision,"" he said. The Warren campaign also cited an FCC website page that states broadcasters should ""act with reasonable care to ensure that advertisements aired on their stations are not false or misleading."" However, it’s the FCC law that bans censorship that truly carries weight. We also found that in May 2017, multiple networks refused to air a Trump ad about his first 100 days that had a ""fake news"" graphic superimposed over the photos of news anchors. It appeared networks rejected the ad by making a case that Trump didn’t yet meet the legal qualifications of a candidate more than three years before the election. Warren said, ""If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks."" This is a misreading of both federal and actual practice. Federal law requires broadcast networks to run political candidate ads without vetting them for lies or falsehoods. The same law does not apply to cable networks, but those networks also generally aim to run such ads, experts told us.  Warren does have a point that federal law does not apply to online social networks such as Facebook, so Facebook can take candidate ads regardless of whether they include falsehoods. But overall, it’s inaccurate to say that ""most networks"" will refuse to air an ad by Trump with a lie in it. We could find no evidence that most networks reject false candidate ads. We rate this statement Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE1FFC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/15/elizabeth-warren/phony-facebook-ad-warren-said-most-tv-networks-wil/

Ghazala Hashmi U-turns on call for Gov. Northam's resignation
","Three times during a recent forum, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant accused Democratic challenger Ghazala Hashmi of caving in to Gov. Ralph Northam for a political donation. ""When Gov. Northam’s blackface-KKK scandal broke in February, I called on him to resign and Professor Hashmi called on him to resign,"" Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, said at the Oct. 9 event. ""But right after Professor Hashmi won her primary in June - a few weeks later - she accepted $25,000 from Gov. Northam and now is silent on the prior call for him to resign."" ""That is not the kind of leadership we need in the Virginia Senate,"" Sturtevant said, questioning Hashmi’s backbone be an ""independent voice and stand up to power and special interests."" Hashmi’s reply: ""Gov. Northam is not on the ballot in November 2019. Glen is on the ballot and I’m on the ballot. And if we’re going to make decisions about who is right for this district...we need to be focusing on issues that concern this district."" We checked Hashmi’s position on Northam’s resignation on the Flip-O-Meter, which rates a politician's consistency on an issue. On Feb. 1, 2019, a photo emerged from Northam’s 1984 medical school yearbook page showing one person in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe and hood. Northam initially apologized for being in the photo. The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus called for Northam’s resignation that night and Hashmi followed suit. She tweeted, ""I share in @VaBlackCaucus feelings of betrayal and support this statement and their work representing people of color across the Commonwealth."" Notham recanted the next day during a chaotic news conference, saying he wasn’t in the photo, recalling another incident decades ago when he did wear blackface to compete in a Michael Jackson dance contest, and vowing to remain in office. The Black Caucus amplified its call for resignation, joined by a cascade of other Democratic office holders, including U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Northam has ""irrevocably lost the faith and trust of the people he was elected to serve,"" the caucus said in a written statement. ""Changing his public story today now casts further doubt on his ability to regain that trust."" Hashmi tweeted that day, ""I stand in solidarity with the @VaBlackCaucus and call for @GovernorVA to resign."" Hashmi won the June 11 Democratic primary for the 10th District senate seat. On June 18, she accepted a $25,000 donation from Northam’s PAC, The Way Ahead. We asked Hashmi’s campaign if she has changed her mind on Northam and got a written statement from the candidate. ""I'm not calling upon the Governor to resign,"" she said. ""The governor has clearly stated his intention not to resign, and we know that we have critical legislative priorities in front of us. When I'm in the Senate, I look forward to working with the Governor on progressive legislation that we both want to see signed into law, such as ensuring that there are background checks on all gun sales, making sure our schools are better funded, and providing greater access to affordable health care for all Virginians."" Hashmi is not the only person to change views of Northam. In February, after the blackface scandal, a Washington Post-Schar School poll found voters were split on Northam, with 43% approving of his job performance and 44% disapproving. Another Post poll at the end of September showed Northam’s standing had improved, with 47% approving of his performance, 29% disapproving. Only 28% regarded Northam as a ""very important"" issue this fall. The Black Caucus quelled its call for Northam’s resignation after the governor made it clear he would stay on. Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico and caucus chairman, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in April that focusing on the scandal, ""is not the work that my constituents, or I don't think most citizens of the commonwealth, expect us to be spending our time on."" At least three other Democrats who called for Northam’s resignation joined Hashmi in accepting money from the governor’s PAC, according to records from the Virginia Public Access Project.  Sen. Rosalyn Dance of Petersburg, a black caucus member, received $10,000 on April 5 during her unsuccessful primary campaign.  Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, called for Northam’s resignation on Feb. 2 and accepted a total $15,000 in donations from the PAC on May 21 and July 24. His opponent, Republican GayDonna Vandergriff, calls VanValkenburg's  actions ""two-faced."" Larry Barnett, the Democratic challenger in the 27th House district in Chesterfield County, called for Northam’s departure on Feb. 2 and received a total $15,000 from the PAC on May 29 and July 16. His Republican opponent, Del. Roxann Robinson, calls him a ""hypocrite"" for doing so. Our ruling Hashmi called for Northam’s resignation twice in February, accepted $25,000 from his PAC in June, and now says ""I’m not calling on the governor to resign."" Many have struggled with the blackface scandal. Hashmi is among lots of Democrats who called on Northam to quit and became accepting of his decision to stay. At least four of them, including Hashmi, took the governor’s campaign donations. Hashmi has completely changed her position and we rate it a ""Full Flop.""  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADF0340>],/factchecks/2019/oct/15/ghazala-hashmi/ghazela-hashmi-u-turns-call-gov-northams-resignati/

""Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr had a closed door meeting with Rupert Murdoch and the very next day Shepard Smith, one of the only voices on Fox News that is critical of Trump steps down after 23 years,"" said an Oct. 11 Facebook meme posted by The Other 98%, a progressive activist group focused on combating corporate greed.

An old Roger Stone video about Cory Booker has gone viral on Twitter. It’s false
","An old video from a Republican political operative alleging that Cory Booker laundered money as mayor of Newark, N.J., has resurfaced on Twitter. The video, which was originally published on Facebook in September 2018, shows Roger Stone talking to the camera about Booker, a Democratic U.S. senator from New Jersey and a candidate for president. Stone is a veteran political consultant for Republicans and worked on Donald Trump’s campaign in 2015. Stone was charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice and lying to Congress during former special prosecutor Rober Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He is banned from social media pending a federal trial. ""As the mayor of Newark, Sen. Cory Booker took $600,000 from a city water authority and put it in his pocket. He told four different stories about it,"" Stone said in the video. ""If Cory were a white Republican, he’d be in prison right now."" (Screenshot from Facebook) A tweet from Red Nation Rising copied the video and its caption and published it Oct. 6. It’s been retweeted more than 7,000 times, so we wanted to check it out. We reached out to Stone for the evidence he used to make his claim against Booker. We’ll update this story if we hear back. The source of Stone’s claim about Booker can be traced back to a corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp. But there is no evidence that Booker, who was Newark mayor from 2006 until 2013, contributed to the bribery scheme. In 2014, a year after Booker left his post as mayor, a state controller report found ""an egregious and yet preventable abuse of public funds"" at the watershed. The city of Newark delegated water management to the agency through service contracts valued at roughly $10 million annually, but the report said the agency operated ""free from any meaningful oversight."" The controller found that watershed Executive Director Linda Watkins-Brashear had authorized ""risky investment activity in an account that lost more than $500,000 in public funds."" The agency dissolved in 2013 shortly after the controller first discovered the abuse of funds. Watkins-Brashear was later sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison for handing out $1 million worth of contracts to her friends and ex-husband. At least eight other individuals connected to the scheme were also indicted — but not before the watershed’s board of trustees sued Booker, Rep. Donald Payne Jr., D-N.J., and two dozen others for their alleged roles in the waste of taxpayer money. RELATED: Recent statements by and about Cory Booker The lawsuit claimed the actions of the defendants, including alleged misappropriation and waste of corporate assets, had led to the agency’s dissolution. Booker’s attorneys said at the time that the suit mischaracterized his role with the watershed. NJ.com reported that Booker served as an ex-officio chairman of the watershed’s Board of Trustees (a position he held by virtue of being mayor), but he never attended a meeting. The lawsuit alleged that Booker’s lack of oversight led to the agency’s mismanagement. A federal judge disagreed and, in June 2016, Booker’s name was dropped from the lawsuit. The judge ruled that Booker was immune from liability since his chairmanship was a function of his mayorship. ""Because there is no dispute that Booker was acting as a public employee in serving on the Board, and no argument that his actions (or inactions) as a member of the Board were other than discretionary and/or legislative in nature and required the exercise of his judgment, the Court finds that Booker is immune under N.J.S.A. § 59:3-2(a) and (b),"" Vincent Papala, a U.S. bankruptcy judge, wrote in the opinion. It appears that Stone took two stories about Booker’s old law firm and used them to spin a conspiracy about his involvement in the water scandal. The first story was published by the New York Post in 2013. It reported that Booker’s federal tax returns showed he collected $689,500 in payments from Trenk DiPasquale, the senator’s former law firm, between 2007 and 2012 — while he was mayor of Newark.  Booker had previously said he stopped working for the firm in 2006, soon after he became mayor. Booker’s spokespeople told the New York Post at the time that the money wasn’t a salary, but part of a ""separation agreement"" with the firm. The Daily Beast reported the agreement was paid out for work Booker did for the firm before he became mayor. From 2010 to 2012, Booker reported on his tax returns that he ""materially participate[d] in the operation of this business."" A Booker spokesman told the New York Post it was an error made by a tax preparer. The second story, published by Politico in January 2017, reported that Elnardo Webster, one of Booker’s longtime advisers, was the general counsel for the watershed while he worked at Trenk (and while Booker was mayor). However, neither he nor Booker have been charged with wrongdoing related to the bribery scandal. The Post reported that, as of 2013, Trenk had made $212,318 from the watershed. That’s one-third of the $600,000 Stone alleged. According to a review of existing media reports and court records, there is no evidence of a money laundering scheme involving the two entities. Booker’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a 2018 video, Roger Stone claimed Cory Booker ""stole $600,000 from a city water authority and laundered it through his law firm."" The video has recently resurfaced on Twitter. That claim is related to a decade-long corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp., which Booker oversaw as mayor and ex-officio chairman. At least nine people have been indicted or sentenced in connection with the bribery scheme. But there is no evidence, based on court records and other existing reporting, that the former mayor contributed to the scheme. As to Stone’s specific claim, there is no public paper trail connecting Booker being paid by a former law firm, and that firm being paid from the watershed. Stone is using two independent facts to create a conspiracy. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDB9240>],/factchecks/2019/oct/14/roger-stone/old-roger-stone-video-about-cory-booker-has-gone-v/

Is income inequality growing or shrinking in the United States?
","U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, tried his hand at fact-checking in a tweet that suggested a news report from The Associated Press inaccurately characterized the state of income inequality in the United States. His post — which caught our attention due to his unauthorized use of a PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter image — started by summarizing the findings of the news article: ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years."" ""FACT: Just the opposite,"" Brady wrote. ""In new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades."" We had to ask: Who is right? Is the United States experiencing the highest levels of income inequality in the past 50 years, or do the latest figures show a decline in inequality? News reports describe growing inequality Let’s start with The Associated Press article, which was published upon the release of new income information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey at the end of September. ""The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality,"" the story reads, attributing the information to the Census Bureau. The article goes on to discuss a change to the Gini Index — a common summary measure of income inequality. The value ranges from 0 (perfect equality, when everyone receives an equal share) to 1 (perfect inequality, when one group or recipient receives all the income). In 2018, the American Community Survey put the Gini Index at 0.485, a statistically significant increase from 2017, when the Gini Index was estimated to be 0.482. Multiple news outlets wrote articles about the new data released by the Census Bureau, including The Washington Post. ""Income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it more than five decades ago, according to data released Thursday, even as the nation’s poverty and unemployment rates are at historic lows,"" the Post article reads. National Public Radio reported that the ""gap between the richest and the poorest U.S. households is now the largest it’s been in the past 50 years."" In the Census Bureau’s press release announcing the latest survey, the agency said income inequality in 2018 was ""significantly higher"" than in 2017. So, how is it possible that Brady came to a different conclusion about the status of income inequality in the U.S. after reviewing Census Bureau data? ""The most obvious thing going on is that they are talking about two different data sources,"" said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center who studies trends in income and wealth. Two surveys have different results Isabelle Gwozdz, a spokeswoman for Brady, said his claim was based on the latest report of the Current Population Survey released by the Census Bureau in September. The Current Population Survey is a joint effort between the Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to track statistics on employment, earnings and education across the country. It is a different project than the American Community Survey, which has a significantly larger sample size and collects information on population, housing and other topics — including income. Kochhar said the Current Population Survey should be ""understood as a national survey,"" while the American Community Survey ""is designed for measurement across states, metro areas and counties."" ""The two surveys are different in methodology, sample size, and reporting period, so it’s not unusual for them to report slightly different findings,"" said David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute. A key difference between the surveys is that the Current Population Survey asks more detailed questions about income than the American Community Survey. Plus, the Current Population Survey uses a smaller sample size. For analyzing national income estimates, the Census Bureau generally recommends using the Current Population Survey over the American Community Survey, according to a statement from the agency. While the Current Population Survey can show changes in income inequality over longer periods of time, ""it is relatively rare for year-to-year changes in the Gini to be statistically significant,"" due to the small sample size of the survey, according to the statement. The Current Population Survey also uses the Gini Index, as well as three other summary measures of inequality — Theil, Atkinson and Mean Logarithmic Deviation — while the American Community Survey only includes Gini. ""However, they are also difficult to interpret, whereas the Gini has a more straightforward interpretation,"" reads the statement from the Census Bureau. ""The Gini coefficient is the most commonly used measure of inequality."" The value for Gini can vary, depending on the survey and other factors. Gwozdz said when Brady referenced ""four measures of income inequality,"" he was looking at values for Gini, Theil, Atkinson and the Mean Logarithmic Deviation from the Current Population Survey report on 2018 Income and Poverty. The Current Population Survey report uses two different ""income concepts"" to measure inequality: money income and equivalence-adjusted income. Money income is household income, while equivalence-adjusted income considers the number of people in a household and how they might share resources. Looking just at money income, all four summary measures appeared to show declining inequality from 2017 to 2018. But none of the decreases is considered statistically significant. ""If I go to the CPS estimate for 2018, it is no different than the estimate for 2017, statistically speaking,"" Kochhar said. ""It did decrease, but it was not enough to be statistically significant. All you can say from CPS is that there was no change between 2017 and 2018."" The Census Bureau analyzed changes to the Gini Index in the Current Population Survey report and said that, from that data, ""we cannot say with confidence whether the Gini increased slightly, decreased slightly, or was relatively unchanged."" Looking at equivalence-adjusted income, all four measures decreased from 2017 to 2018. Three of the measures, not including the Mean logarithmic deviation, saw a statistically significant decrease. The Census Bureau and economics experts we consulted for this fact-check said it is normal to see variations in these measurements, depending on the source of the data and the income concept used for the estimate. Ken-Hou Lin, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that both The Associated Press and Brady should be more cautious with their interpretations of the Census Bureau data. ""In general, there’s never a large year-to-year change in inequality,"" he said. ""Thus, it is difficult to separate the real trend from statistical noise."" Kochhar agreed, and said looking at incremental changes to income inequality does not tell the whole story. ""I would conclude that, in the times we currently are, income inequality is higher than it has been in five decades,"" Kochhar said. ""Whether this year is different than last year, that is one slice out of the five decades."" Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute offered a similar assessment. ""Bottom line: The AP story is accurate,"" Cooper said. "" None of the statistics that Mr. Brady cites disprove anything that the AP story reports."" Our ruling Brady said that the Associated Press was wrong to report that ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years"" because in a ""new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades."" Brady used a different Census Bureau survey than the Associated Press to make his claim. Both surveys had slightly different findings about income inequality — a normal occurrence, according to multiple experts. The survey the Associated Press used showed a statistically significant increase in income inequality from 2017 to 2018, using the only measurement of inequality included in the survey. In the survey Brady cited, estimates for four measures of income inequality were generated using two different categories of income. In one category, three of the four measures saw a statistically significant decrease from 2017 to 2018. In the other category, none of the measurements experienced a statistically significant change. Plus, experts said year-to-year changes in income inequality are not indicative of larger trends, so it is a stretch to suggest that the 2018 figures signal a reverse in the rise over the past five decades. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE — The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC879580>],/factchecks/2019/oct/12/kevin-brady/income-inequality-growing-or-shrinking-united-stat/

Official data from the state education department shows that Manchin is correct -- and that the problem is getting worse. The number of homeless students has risen since the 2014-15 school year from 8,959 to 10,522 in the 2018-19 school year -- a 17% increase. Making the increase even more striking, the state’s overall population has actually fallen by almost 2% during that period.   It’s worth noting that the statistic uses a federal definition known as McKinney-Vento, which counts students as homeless if they live in shelters, hotels or motels, cars, RVs, or with another family member away from their primary residence. Students who are in foster care are not included in these numbers.  Rebecca Derenge, the state official responsible for tracking homeless students, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the opioid epidemic and floods three years ago may have disrupted family situations for some West Virginia residents. As it happens, this statistic had already caused some controversy in West Virginia by the time Manchin wrote his post.  Initially, the statistic for homeless students was left unmentioned during a major battle over education legislation, and it only came to light after reporting published July 20 by Amelia Ferrell Knisely of the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The Gazette-Mail reported that ""several lawmakers admitted the thousands of homeless students weren’t mentioned in months of debate leading up to the final vote"" on a major education bill.  Republican state Sen. Patricia Rucker, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, told the newspaper that the homeless-student statistic was never mentioned by school officials or the state education department. Then, after the statistic came to light, state schools superintendent Steven Paine told West Virginia Board of Education members that, while the number is ""staggering,"" its rise over the years ""was not a significant increase,"" the Gazette-Mail reported Aug. 16. Paine later apologized for the comment, the Associated Press reported, issuing a statement that he ""in no way intended to convey that the data was not significant."" Manchin wrote that the ""West Virginia Department of Education reported over 10,000 children and youth have been identified as homeless for the 2018-2019 school year.""  The state education department reported that the number of homeless K-12 students in West Virginia for 2018-2019 was 10,522. We rate Manchin’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC76FE40>],/factchecks/2019/oct/11/joe-manchin/how-many-west-virginia-students-are-homeless/

Viral posts about a Facebook ‘witch checker’ are just a bunch of hocus pocus
","Who doesn’t love a good Facebook challenge? And during the Halloween season, what is better than having an algorithm determine who among us are secretly witches? That’s what many users claim is currently going down on the social media platform.  Facebook posts, like this one, allege that after typing ""#HocusPocus"" in a comment, one of two things will happen: The words will stay the same, revealing you are a muggle (sad) or Facebook will transfigure it into a green bar with the word ""witch."" Some posts even show comments that have purple bars that say ""head witch"" or the fancy ""grand high witch."" Talk about a major coven promotion. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) If you tried it out and nothing happened, don’t worry, because it’s not real. You may still yet receive your Hogwarts letter. You’ll notice the majority of the comments on these posts still say #HocusPocus, because users are genuinely typing it in to see if it changes. The few that appear as ""witch"" or other titles were copied and pasted into the comments.    These kinds of posts are initially created to amass comments and shares and therefore increase the Facebook page’s engagement.  Fact-checking website TruthorFiction.com found the ""witch checker"" claim resembled another challenge – #911snitch. Those posts alleged that typing #911snitch revealed whether commenters were ""snitches"" if the words stayed the same or not by whether a green bar with a blunt-style cigar displaying ""not a snitch"" appeared. The website found, like #HocusPocus, typing #911snitch, ""did not at any point produce a green bar to prove that you or your friends are not snitches…"" A Facebook spokesperson also confirmed to PolitiFact that there is no ""witch checker"" feature.  The internet has, once again, put a spell on us.

No, Nancy Pelosi didn’t divert Social Security money for the impeachment inquiry
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently drew the ire of some Facebook users as they reacted to a headline claiming she was tapping Social Security funds for the impeachment inquiry.  ""Pelosi diverts $2.4 billion from Social Security to cover impeachment costs,"" reads the headline in a screenshot published on Facebook on Oct. 9. A banner below the headline and above Pelosi’s photo says, ""This can’t be allowed!"" and it features this web address: potatriotsunite.com.  ""Leave our money alone,"" someone wrote in comments, calling Pelosi a derogatory name.  ""Stop right there you old thief,"" another user said.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Fact-checking claims about the whistleblower’s legal team
","President Donald Trump and his allies are trying to discredit the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump and Ukraine prompted House Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry by attacking the whistleblower’s lawyers. Trump once asserted that former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was headed by ""hardened Democrats"" and ""big Crooked Hillary supporters."" Now he’s claiming the whistleblower’s attorneys are ""big Democrat(s)"" driven by politics and out to get him. On Oct. 3, Trump tweeted a clip of conservative commentator Mark Levin on Fox News host Sean Hannity’s primetime TV show. Levin claimed, without evidence, that the whistleblower hired ""left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding one of them.""  pic.twitter.com/WaLS3cL5ng ""He happens to get a Schumer-Clinton lawyer, who happens to work with a group called Whistleblower Aid,"" Levin said in the video. ""And Breitbart has a great piece on this. They were founded in 2017 for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration.""  We reviewed voter registration information, campaign finance filings and LinkedIn profiles for each of the whistleblower’s three lawyers, who did not respond to requests for comment. We found little evidence that they are ""left-wing lawyers"" working for ""left-wing firms,"" and no evidence whatsoever that their work is being funded by George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor. The whistleblower is represented by Compass Rose Legal Group, a Washington law firm focused on security clearance, federal employment and national security issues. The firm’s three attorneys — Andrew P. Bakaj, Mark S. Zaid and I. Charles McCullough III — have represented the whistleblower ""from the outset,"" according to a statement. (McCullough has not signed on to more recent statements.) Bakaj, the lead attorney, is a former intelligence officer and criminal investigator who was himself a whistleblower while working for the CIA inspector general, according to the Washingtonian.  Meanwhile, Zaid runs his own national security law firm. McCullough is a longtime government official who most recently served as the first ever intelligence community inspector general, working under the director of national intelligence from 2011 to 2017. We checked public records from Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. Currently, Bakaj is registered to vote in D.C. with no political affiliation, Zaid is registered in Maryland with no political affiliation, and McCullough is registered in Maryland as a Republican. So where did Levin, Trump and others get the idea that they are ""left-wing"" lawyers? Levin did not respond to our requests for comment, but his claims that the whistleblower’s lawyers lean to the left can be largely traced to reports from conservative news outlets such as Breitbart and the Washington Free Beacon. On Sept. 24, Breitbart reported that Bakaj’s ""resume includes work for"" former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and current Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.  The following day, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Bakaj donated this year to former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.  The same outlets have also drawn attention to tweets Bakaj and Zaid have posted about Trump, in which they have poked fun at Trump, questioned his fitness for office, urged officials to blow the whistle on government misconduct and offered lower rates for would-be whistleblowers. It’s true that Bakaj donated to Biden. According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, he gave $100 to the Biden campaign on April 26.  The Breitbart story leaves out that Bakaj worked as an intern, not as a staffer, for Clinton, Schumer and the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, according to his LinkedIn profile. Bakaj was not on their full-time staffs, nor did he represent them as a lawyer. In response to a related critique from Fox New host Laura Ingraham, Zaid dismissed Bakaj’s internships on Twitter. ""Andrew — when he was 19/20 & in college — interned w/ Senators Schumer & Clinton,"" Zaid wrote. ""Almost 20 years ago."" Zaid donated to the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee between 2005 and 2014. In an interview with The Hill, Zaid said the donations were silent auction biddings that he made as a guest at the committee’s spring ball. We could not find record of any individual donations from McCullough. On Twitter, Zaid listed a number of times when he has represented conservatives. He twice represented GOP members of Congress on cases related to the Freedom of Information Act, and he has represented the Republican National Committee as well. He also represented five CIA whistleblowers in the Benghazi case, and he represented the Daily Caller, a conservative publication.  ""The partisans are trying to smear the legal team as some liberal opposition,"" Zaid wrote. ""We are anything but that."" The Hill quoted two colleagues of Zaid saying he’s hardly political. As far as we could tell, Bakaj has not made any similar public statements.  Levin also claimed that Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal group that supports whistleblowers, was created ""for the purpose of taking down the Trump administration."" Zaid and Bakaj are affiliated with the group, which set up a GoFundMe to help pay for the whistleblower’s services. Support for Levin’s claim seems to come from Breitbart, which noted that an old version of the group’s website said ""our Republic is under threat."" But aside from that now-deleted language and the fact that the group was founded in 2017, during Trump’s presidency, there’s no evidence that the group is targeting Trump. When it was created, founder John Tye explicitly said it was ""not a partisan effort."" The claim that Soros is involved is more far-fetched. A Breitbart article mentions Soros numerous times, but each alleged link shows the billionaire several degrees of separation away from the whistleblower’s lawyers. We could not find any credible evidence connecting Soros to the whistleblower’s efforts. Levin said the whistleblower hired ""left-wing lawyers, left-wing firms, Soros involved in funding one of them."" One of the lawyers, Bakaj, donated $100 to Joe Biden and worked as an intern for Schumer and Clinton almost 20 years ago. None of the lawyers are registered Democrats. Furthermore, there’s no evidence that their firm leans to the left or receives funding from Soros. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction, Nov. 6: We have corrected a minor word in Levin's quote; it now reads ""one"" on all references. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC08E80>],/factchecks/2019/oct/11/mark-levin/fact-checking-claims-about-whistleblowers-legal-te/
