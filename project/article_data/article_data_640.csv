Trump: Obamacare health care premiums 'going up 35, 45, 55 percent'
","Donald Trump won’t apologize to Ben Carson for questioning the neurosurgeon's religion, but he agrees with Carson’s thoughts on health care. Trump, who is trailing Carson in new polls in Iowa, suggested on the campaign trail that Carson’s Seventh-day Adventist faith wasn’t ""down the middle of the road."" Appearing on ABC’s This Week, Trump said he ""didn’t say anything bad"" about Carson, called Carson’s proposal for personal health savings accounts a ""very good idea,"" and took the opportunity to knock down a different opponent.   ""People’s — I don’t know if you have been watching lately over the last couple of weeks — people’s premiums, George, are going up 35, 45, 55 percent,"" Trump said on Oct. 25. ""Their deductibles are so high nobody’s ever going to get to use it. So ... Obamacare is turning out to be a bigger disaster than anybody thought."" On average, premiums have risen by about 5.8 percent a year since Obama took office, compared to 13.2 percent in the nine years before Obama. Is it true that we’ll see insurance plans jacked up 35 to 55 percent in 2016? We reached out to the Trump campaign but didn’t hear back. Experts we talked to and the data show that while there are examples of premium increases that large, they’re not the norm. Double digits for some plans Let’s begin with a brief primer on premium hikes. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers planning to increase their rates by more than 10 percent have to submit their proposals for federal review. In many states, the companies also have to negotiate their prices with a state insurance commissioner. Generally, the finalized premiums will be equal to or lower than the proposed rates, according to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonpartisan health policy research center. With five days left before open enrollment begins on Nov. 1, rates are likely already approved or amended, but not all them have been publicized. Trump has a point that some insurers have requested increases that hit high double digits. ""Yes, some people in some plans through some carriers in some states are, indeed, looking at rate hikes of ‘35 to 50 percent’ if they stick with those plans in 2016,"" said Charles Gaba, who runs the popular blog ACAsignups.net, which tracks Obamacare enrollment. ""This is not completely off the wall. Many of the popular plans requested high increases,"" said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush. ""Those hikes will affect more people than some may think."" She pointed out that Blue Cross Blue Shield, a prominent insurer with a significant amount of enrollees, proposed rate hikes of 14 to 38 percent in Illinois and 50 to 65 percent in New Mexico. But that’s not telling the entire story either, according to the data. Much lower average Just 7 percent of all plans in the federal exchange had a proposed rate hike of 30 percent or higher, estimates Agile Health Insurance, which bills itself as ""an affordable alternative to Obamacare."" That translates to average increases at far lower levels than what Trump said. Looking at finalized rates for the lowest and second-lowest cost marketplace plans in the silver category — which are the basis for federal premium subsidies and chosen by 68 percent of enrollees — the average increase is nowhere near 35 to 55 percent. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that the cost of a benchmark silver plan will be 4.4 percent more expensive on average across major cities in 13 states and Washington, D.C. (Again, that is a smaller annual increase than what had been occurring before Obamacare became law.) According to Kaiser, enrollees in Minneapolis will see the biggest premium increase at 28.7 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, plans will actually decrease by 10.4 percent in Seattle.  If we look at both finalized and requested rates across the board, Trump’s figure is still too high. ACASignups.net projects a national weighted average 12 to 13 percent increase across 49 states and Washington, D.C. (there’s no data for Wisconsin). That’s consistent with the Associated Press’ estimates, which project increases in the high single-digits to the low teens. By Gaba’s estimates, just three states are hiking near the level Trump is claiming: Alaska, Hawaii and Minnesota.  ""I don’t see any plausible way of the average rate hike being anywhere close to 35 percent, and certainly not any higher than that,"" Gaba said. No such thing as typical All the experts we spoke to warned us that there’s significant variation from plan to plan, from region to region, and from insuree to insuree. That’s why neither Trump’s claim nor averages tell the whole story. The disparity in rate increases are more likely adjustments insurers are making, rather than evidence that Obamacare is a ""disaster,"" as Trump says. After all, 2016 is the first year that insurers are looking at actual claims data instead of ""essentially guessing at what their costs were,"" said Levitt of the Kaiser Foundation. ""Some insurers guessed better than others, which leads to variations in premium changes."" Enrollment figures are different from state to state, which affects the risk pool and the premium changes. Premium rate increases can also be unique to an individual’s circumstances, not necessarily reflective of a national average. ""A number of factors can result in a consumer’s premium differing from the average rate change, including changes in: age, tobacco status, geography, benefit design, family status, and subsidy eligibility,"" according to a brief by the American Academy of Actuaries. To really get a sense of what the typical rate increase is, we not only have to wait for the final rates to come out but the enrollment figures as well. ""You need to have a weighted average so we’ll only know after the fact,"" Wilensky said. In the meantime, experts recommend everyone check their own rates.  Our ruling Trump said, ""People’s premiums … are going up 35, 45, 55 percent."" Some insurance plans in the federal exchange will see price hikes at the levels that Trump is suggesting. But he’s cherry-picking the high end of premium changes to come. Estimates for the national average are far below Trump’s figures, ranging from 4.4 percent to 13 percent. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/25/donald-trump/trump-obamacare-health-care-premiums-going-35-45-5/

Whitehouse has mixed up the facts on regulated chemicals
","U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently joined Hasbro executives at their downtown headquarters to push a bill to regulate thousands of chemicals, including hazardous substances that pose a risk to children. From behind a blue podium that was as brightly colored and as plastic as a child’s toy, Whitehouse made this claim: ""In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated."" This certainly sounded like the Wild West of unregulated chemicals to us: 22,996 chemicals on the market and only four run-ins with regulators? It was clear early on that our fact-checking of the statement would pivot on the definition of ""regulated."" Our dictionary tells us that to ""regulate"" is ""to control or direct by a rule."" Whitehouse’s go-to expert on chemicals, Richard A. Denison, a lead senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, was at the event and provided some immediate clarification after the senator spoke. The EPA blocked four chemicals from the marketplace after the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976. That, Denison said, was the regulation Whitehouse was talking about. So almost 23,000 other chemicals went unregulated? That didn’t line up with a 2010 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Inspector General. Through September 2008, according to the report, EPA ""regulated 1,432 chemicals by means of Consent Orders."" The consent-order process, which involves negotiations with manufacturers, is quite different from the process that EPA used to block those four chemicals. But it’s a form of government regulation nevertheless — the outcome of a process in which manufacturers of a new chemical must, by rule, file a notice with the government and receive the EPA’s approval. We contacted Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson for clarification. Larson told us that Whitehouse had been ""speaking off the cuff.""  Larson asked us to consider a somewhat similar statement made in two news releases issued to publicize the Hasbro event. ""In almost 40 years,"" says the news release. ""TSCA has restricted just five chemicals of the more than 80,000 that are in commerce — and even failed to ban asbestos."" The five chemicals referenced in the release are different from the four substances that Whitehouse referred to at the Hasbro podium. The five chemicals were among 62,000 chemicals already in existence in 1976, while the four substances were among chemicals created after the law was passed, according to Denison. Our research into the restriction of ""just five"" substances took us right back to the more than 1,400 chemicals that OIG says EPA regulated through the consent-order process set forth in the 1976 law. The agency, according to its website, can establish conditions for safe use via a ""consent order,"" with the manufacturer agreeing to: toxicity testing, warnings, worker protections, ""restrictions"" on use and releases to ""water, air and land."" But Denison says the orders are negotiated case by case, behind closed doors, and the terms can remain secret or are heavily redacted in the few instances they become public. Still, the 1,400 chemicals have been regulated or restricted in some way. And the EPA even refers to certain negotiated requirements as ""restrictions."" Denison, in a later email, referred us to a collection of comments that high-level EPA officials have made regarding the five particular chemicals Whitehouse cited in the news releases. We noticed that in each case, the EPA officials had qualified their remarks in ways that Whitehouse didn’t. However, from a broader perspective, none of this analysis undercuts Whitehouse’s basic argument that the 1976 law isn’t protecting the public and it needs an overhaul. While many companies have agreed to restrictions under EPA pressure, the overall regulatory environment is extremely lax. Regulators don’t know the toxicity of many chemicals in the marketplace. ""It is important to note that almost 90 percent of pre-manufacture notices submitted to EPA complete the review process without being restricted or regulated in any way,"" the agency says on its website. More than 60 senators have signed on as supporters of the legislation backed by Whitehouse. Hasbro’s chief executive, Brian Goldner, says Hasbro is on a mission ""to make the world a better place for children and their families, and this reform will be a victory."" Our Ruling Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator used the wrong verb at Hasbro. He asked us to test a different statement that uses a different verb and refers to different facts. We did. In both cases, we found evidence that the number of regulated or restricted chemicals was far greater than the tiny number that Whitehouse and his office referred to in their various statements. Cheryl Hogue, an assistant managing editor at Chemical & Engineering News, agrees that EPA’s regulatory authority is greatly limited by the 1976 law. But she also told us,""Every new chemical that comes on the market has to give a notice to EPA…Is that regulation?,"" she asked. ""A lot of chemical companies would call that regulation."" The 1976 law is weak, and it looks like Congress might make it tougher. But Whitehouse used the wrong verb and he mixed up the facts to make his case for change when he claimed that ""only four"" of 23,000 chemicals ""were regulated."" For these reasons, we rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/25/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-has-mixed-facts-regulated-chemicals/

Clinton says John Kerry was the first secretary of state to rely on a government email account
","Members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi peppered Hillary Clinton with questions for about 11 hours on Oct. 22, 2015. As expected, Clinton’s use of a private email account and server was a topic of discussion. At one point, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., pressed Clinton on whether she had told State Department officials about emails on her private server. Westmoreland: If they were gathering emails, you had to tell them that you had a private server when you were there. Clinton: Well, the -- the server is not the point, it's the account. And I made it a practice to send emails that were work-related to people on their government accounts. In fact, you know, Secretary Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a government account. This is not the first time that Clinton, her staff or her supporters have talked about how other secretaries of state have used email. Of course, the historical comparison can’t go back very far because the country hasn’t had many secretaries since the advent of email. In fact, beyond Clinton herself -- and Kerry, who has to abide by a requirement to use departmental email -- we only have three secretaries of state to consider. They are Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. Of those, Powell is the only one who used email very much at all. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she ""did not use email while she was in office"" from 1997 to 2001. Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing, ""Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email,"" and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC, ""She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary."" Powell, on the other hand, took it as his personal mission to get the entire department on email. ""I arrived at the State Department as secretary with a disastrous information system there,"" Powell said on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sept. 6, 2015. ""And I had to fix it. And so what I had to do is bring the State Department to the 21st century."" In his book It Worked for Me, Powell tells how he got Congress to pay for 44,000 new computers and put an Internet-connected machine on every desk in every embassy and every office in the department. ""To complement the official State Department computer in my office, I installed a laptop computer on a private line,"" Powell wrote. ""My personal email account on the laptop allowed me direct access to anyone online. I started shooting emails to my principal assistants, to individual ambassadors, and increasingly to my foreign-minister colleagues who like me were trying to bring their ministries in the 186,000 miles per second world."" An aide to Powell confirmed his use of this personal email account in a statement to Politico. ""He sent emails to his staff generally via their State Department email addresses,"" the statement said. ""These emails should be on the State Department computers."" So, Powell was on email, but it was through a private, not government email account. Our ruling Clinton said Kerry was the first secretary to rely mainly on a government email account. This statement is accurate, but it glosses over a bit of context -- that only one secretary before Clinton herself, Colin Powell, used email much at all while secretary of state. This undercuts the implication of Clinton’s claim, that there was a tradition of sorts of secretaries of state using private email accounts. It was a tradition of one.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Missouri', 'Chris Koster']","
Koster mostly right about erosion of higher education funding
","As Attorney General Chris Koster eyes the 2016 race for Missouri governor, he’s pushing to share the ballot with a political twofer: a ballot proposal that would increase Missouri’s lowest-in-the-nation tobacco tax, which would pay for a boost in the state’s higher education spending. Speaking Aug. 20 at the Missouri State Fair, Koster, a Democrat, reiterated his support for the increasing the cigarette tax, telling the Columbia Daily Tribune: ""Since 2001, higher education in the state has been cut or allowed to erode … by 35 or 40 percent."" Do those numbers add up? It takes a bit of college-boy math. The top line About three-quarters of the state’s higher education budget comes from the general revenue fund. The rest of the money mostly comes from the 1 cent education sales tax and other state funds. (The federal government also chips in some money — this year it was a little under $3.7 million, or 0.2 percent, of the total higher education budget.) The average annual inflation rate between 2001 and 2015, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, was 1.918 percent for Missouri and Illinois. Inflation rates vary across the country, and the Federal Reserve calculates the inflation rate by region rather than by state.  In fiscal year 2002, higher education was allotted $1,153,954,522. After adjusting for inflation — which compounds year over year — that’s equivalent to $1,505,546,464 today. In the most recent budget, for fiscal year 2016, $1,266,819,566 is set for higher education in Missouri. That’s a 15.9 percent decrease, short of what Koster said. The bottom line If you only look at dollars, though, you miss the effect of Missouri’s surging college enrollment, Koster spokesman Andrew Whalen told PolitiFact Missouri. In fall of 2001, Missouri’s public colleges and universities enrolled 143,656 full-time equivalent students. By 2014, enrollment had risen to 184,305 students. That’s a 28.3 percent increase in students. (This year’s totals aren’t in yet, but enrollment peaked in 2013, when Missouri counted 185,514 full-time equivalent students in its public institutions of higher education.) It’s hard to say exactly how much money is spent on each student across the state because each school receives money directly from the General Assembly. That money is counted in the appropriations for the Department of Higher Education — but since the department doesn’t dictate how that money is used, the department doesn’t track how much of it each institution spends, spokeswoman Liz Coleman said. But we can still get a rough per-student funding estimate by dividing the department’s budget by the number of full-time-equivalent students. Here’s the math: In 2001, Missouri spent $10,480.21 per student, adjusting for inflation. Assuming this year’s enrollment totals track near 2014’s (and there’s anecdotal evidence suggesting it’s not too far off), that would mean the state now spends closer to $6,873 per student. That’s a 34.4 percent decrease in higher education funding per student. There are a few caveats here: Students aren’t directly impacted by every dollar spent by the Department of Higher Education. For instance, the department also operates the Missouri State Historical Society, and some money also goes towards operating expenses for the department itself. The department funds scholarships, some of which go to students at private schools. And schools also draw funding from outside the appropriations process, from sources such as tuition, donations and endowments. So, the exact amount of money spent on each college student is a squishy number. But we can still confidently track how much the state contributes — which, in the context of raising the tobacco tax, is the essence of Koster’s statement. Our ruling Koster said that since 2001, higher education funding has been cut or eroded by 35 percent to 40 percent. The legislature hasn’t technically cut higher education funding over this time; nominally, the state has actually spent $100 million more on it. But that’s not enough to keep pace with inflation. And when you factor in skyrocketing enrollment numbers, the amount of money the General Assembly has budgeted to spend on a per student basis has indeed ""eroded"" by about as much as Koster says it has. Even though Koster’s statement is pretty close, it needs additional information and clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/23/chris-koster/koster-mostly-right-about-erosion-higher-education/

Internet graphic says suicide rate is much higher in Denmark than United States
","Recently, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been pointing to Denmark as an example of an economically just country, including a mention in the first Democratic presidential debate. Since then, an Internet graphic has been circulating that compares the United States to Denmark, purportedly in the form of a first-hand account by a Danish teacher. The description is unflattering to Denmark, and a number of readers have asked us to take a look at it. The graphic talks about excessive taxes and crushing personal debt for residents of Denmark, but one element that caught our eye is a claim about suicide rates. ""Denmark’s suicide rate has averaged 20.8 per 100,000 (people) during the last five decades, with its highest level of 32,"" the graphic states. ""The American suicide rate averaged only 11.1 (per 100,000 people) during the last five decades and has never exceeded 12.7."" We decided to take a closer look. We should first note that Snopes.com recently broke down each of the meme’s statistical claims. It found a mixed bag -- some claims were largely accurate, but many statements were unsupported or false. According to Scopes, the meme was originally posted on a blog called The Federalist Papers on Oct. 20, and seemed to be a cheeky response to an earlier meme that was favorable toward Denmark, reproduced below:  Since the meme references ""the last five decades,"" we looked at the trends over that period from this chart by the World Health Organization. Denmark’s suicide rate (per 100,000 people) 1960: 20 1970: 22 1980: 32 1990: 24 2000: 14 2012: 8.8 Source: The World Health Organization   United States’ suicide rate (per 100,000 people) 1960: 10.6 1970: 11.5 1980: 11.8 1990: 12.4 2000: 10.4 2012: 12.1 Source: The World Health Organization Using those numbers, Denmark’s average suicide rate over the last five decades is indeed about 20 people per 100,000. The average U.S. suicide rate in that timeframe is 11.5 people per 100,000. So the graphic has offered fairly accurate numbers. But a closer look at the data shows that they are presented in a misleading way. Reading the meme, one would think that Denmark has a much bigger suicide problem than the United States does. In reality, the latest statistics show exactly the opposite. Danish suicide rates peaked in the 1980s and have fallen significantly since then -- by almost three-quarters. By contrast, the U.S. rate has been largely static since the 1960s, rising modestly between 2000 and 2012. So by 2012, Denmark’s suicide rate was lower than the United States, not higher -- 8.8 people per 100,000 in Denmark, compared to 12.1 per 100,000 in the United States. When we reached Mikkel Clair Nissen, whose website was cited on the graphic, he said this line of query has interested him since Oprah Winfrey visited Denmark in 2009 and called Danes the happiest people in the world. To him, this clashed with Denmark’s historically high suicide rate. Nissen attributes more recent declines to the widespread use of antidepressants. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show Denmark with the highest rate of antidepressant use -- something that he expresses reservations about in his writings. It may be true that Denmark has reduced its suicide rate in part due to antidepressant use, but this seems tangential to the claim we’re checking -- that Denmark has a bigger suicide problem than the United States does. Our ruling An Internet graphic critical of Denmark claimed that Denmark’s suicide rate has been about twice as high as the United States’ over the past five decades. The numbers are accurate, but in the course of making a broader case against Denmark, the data is cherry-picked to make it seem as if Denmark has a much higher suicide rate than the United States. In reality, the rate today is about 50 percent higher in the United States, and in the United States the rate has been increasing somewhat in recent years. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/23/viral-image/internet-graphic-says-suicide-rate-much-higher-den/

Marco Rubio says Hillary Clinton called Syria's Bashar al-Assad a 'reformer'
","The day Hillary Clinton testified before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., took aim at her foreign policy record. In an op-ed for the conservative website Breitbart, Rubio criticized Clinton’s statements about Syria: ""Clinton touts her early support for arming Syria’s moderate opposition and more recently, a no-fly zone, to contrast her record with President Obama’s,"" wrote Rubio, a presidential candidate. ""But even after Syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in 2011, Clinton labeled Bashar al-Assad a ‘reformer.’ The death toll in the Syrian civil war now stands at more than 200,000. ..."" Is Rubio right that Clinton labeled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a reformer? What Clinton said in 2011 PunditFact looked at a similar claim in 2014 when Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace said Clinton had ""defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war."" We rated that claim Half True. Clinton’s 2011 comments stemmed from when Syria broke into violent clashes between Assad’s government forces and protesters. A civil war erupted after 15 schoolchildren were arrested in February 2011 for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school in Daraa. The military responded to protesters with force. Clinton faced questions about Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with airstrikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the United States and is an enemy of Israel and an ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had ""killed 25,000 people, at a lick"" in 1982. Clinton said: ""Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. ""There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. ""What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see."" So Clinton’s line about Assad as ""a reformer"" was stated as the opinion of ""members of Congress of both parties"" rather than as her personal opinion. To be sure, even this formulation was questionable. While Clinton mentioned ""both parties,"" the Washington Post’s Fact Checker was unable to find such comments coming from Republicans. Democratic politicians who had expressed such hope included Nancy Pelosi who visited Syria in 2007 when she was House speaker. She said, ""We came in friendship, hope, and determined that the road to Damascus is a road to peace."" And then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry at one point had a hopeful view of Assad, though he later changed his tune. A spokesman for Rubio, Alex Conant, pointed to the Fact Checker’s piece to argue that ""the claim that she made that others of both parties put forth the view that he was a reformer is false, which undermines the notion that she was not stating her own opinion."" Two days after her Face the Nation appearance, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked Clinton if it was still her position that Assad was a reformer. ""I referenced opinions of others,"" Clinton said. ""That was not speaking either for myself or for the administration."" Clinton added, ""We’re troubled by what we hear, but we’re also going to continue to urge that the promise of reform, which has been made over and over again and which you reported on just a few months ago – ‘I’m a reformer, I’m going to reform, and I’ve talked to members of Congress and others about that,’ that we hear from the highest levels of leadership in Syria – will actually be turned into reality."" As the military crackdown on Syrians worsened, Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 for ABC News by Jake Tapper, who noted she ""at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer."" Clinton said, ""Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently."" She added, ""But he’s not going to be able to sustain what is unfortunately growing armed opposition apparently fueled and maybe led by defectors from his army. It’s probably too late for him to change course, but there needs to be a change at the top of that government, and there needs to be an effort to engage in genuine dialogue and start on the path of reform."" Our ruling Rubio said ""even after Syrian troops began to shoot protesters in the streets with live ammunition in 2011, Clinton labeled Bashar al-Assad a ‘reformer.’ "" Rubio has a point that in a March 2011 interview, Clinton did use the word ""reformer"" to describe al-Assad. However, Rubio glosses over the fact that she didn’t say that was her personal opinion of him, but rather the view of some members of Congress. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.  ",/factchecks/2015/oct/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-hillary-clinton-called-syrias-bas/

Two-thirds of the people 'in this country illegally are working,' GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson says
","Like many conservatives, U.S. Ron Johnson has repeatedly called for the United States to secure its borders. But in making that call again Oct. 7, 2015, the Wisconsin Republican also seemed to defend most of the estimated 11 million residents who are living in the country illegally. Johnson was interviewed on a conservative talk show on KTLK-AM in Minnesota's Twin Cities. The topic was a hearing he would lead the next day as chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Asked by a listener if it's possible to secure the border and ""negotiate"" undocumented immigrants, Johnson replied: ""Of course, that is the first step. We have to secure the border, we have to give the American public confidence that we're going to actually secure the border. ""And then, we're a compassionate nation. We're going to deal with that reality of 11 to 12 million people. By the way, in our hearings, (we were told) 8.1 million of those people in this country illegally are working, and most of them are working hard, contributing to their communities. This is an untenable situation, we need to bring those people out of the shadows, but first we need to secure the border."" If Johnson’s statistical claim is accurate, two-thirds or more of undocumented immigrants are employed. But his description of the 8 million as workers overstates the situation a bit. The figures The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not attempt to count the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working. But we found estimates, based on census data, that were made by the the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. They are from a July 2015 report and a November 2014 report. As of 2014, there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, Pew said, in an estimate roughly the same as one by the Department of Homeland Security. According to Pew: Most of them live in six states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Half are Mexican. Regarding work, Pew estimated that in 2012 there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants who were either working or looking for work -- that is, they were in the labor force -- people ages 16 and older who are employed or looking for work. Pew told us it does not have a breakdown on how many were working and how many were looking for work. When we asked Johnson’s office for information to back his statement, the office cited verbal testimony from Pew senior demographer Jeffrey Passel, the author of the research we've cited. He appeared before Johnson's committee in March 2015. Passel told the committee: ""Although unauthorized immigrants represent about three and a half percent of the nation’s population, the 8.1 million unauthorized immigrant workers account for about 5 percent of the labor force."" So, Passel referred to the 8.1 million as workers, but also to the labor force, which counts workers and people looking for work. Our rating Johnson said 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people ""in this country illegally are working."" His statement goes a bit too far. The latest estimates from a nonpartisan research group show that as of 2012, there were 8.1 million undocumented immigrants in the labor force -- some working, others looking for work.

Brewpub growling about state of craft beer
","At least one Georgia beer maker is frothing mad about the new legislation regulating local suds’ sales and is using his menu to make the point. At the Slice & Pint brewpub in Emory Village, brewmaster Crawford Moran has launched a ""government rant"" series of beers designed to highlight his gripes. The menu’s fall offering: ""Why does the state legislature not want to create jobs by allowing us to do growlers of this IPA?"" Alas, growler shops - that sell the glass jugs that hold a half gallon of beer - dot the landscape from Decatur to Alpharetta. So your PolitiFact Georgia scribe ordered a pint – even Beerack, er, Barack Obama knows the value of a good beer summit – and settled in to research whether the state’s brewpubs can’t sell their products to go. Bitter brew Georgia’s history of direct beer sales to consumers is a bitter one. Craft brewers have sought for at least a decade to change the state law that keeps them from making money from those who want to quaff their wares. In this year’s legislative session, Senate Bill 63 originally would have given breweries and brewpubs their wish. But the final version instead gave craft brewers the ability only to sell tours and give away their product – a backdoor way to sell limited amounts of beer to go - and stripped out brewpubs’ ability to do the same. Controversy is brewing over that change, now that the state Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin forbidding brewers from charging different prices for the tours based on the value of the beers offered. And brewpubs? The law makes it clear they must sell only on site or to wholesale dealers – the middleman that direct sales would avoid. ""We have had so many people come in, locals, students, parents and they love our beer and want to take some home with them,"" said Moran, who co-owns the Slice and Pint and two locations of the 5 Seasons brewpub. ""But the state legislature said those people can’t buy beer where they want to. It’s hard to take."" It’s also hard to pin down. Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, agreed the hard line in SB 63 says brewpubs cannot sell their product to go. But hypothetically, she said, brewpubs could sell a growler of beer that they did not produce on site. That’s because the state license for alcohol sales applies to bars, package stores and brewpubs alike and allows for sales both on and off premise. ""As far as the state is concerned, you could walk around Kroger drinking beer,"" Palmer said. ""Of course, Kroger doesn’t allow that. And local governments are the ones who decide if they will allow on- or off-site sales."" Decatur, for instance, allows people to buy growlers to go from growler shops – and also sample in the store. But Slice & Pint sits outside the city limits and wouldn’t qualify for that perk because it is both a retail operation, like a growler shop, and a manufacturer, by making beer. Moran’s operation is also unique in that he rejects selling to a wholesaler. The state has just 12 other brewpubs, Palmer said, and all sell to that middleman, who can then make it available to go at package stores and the like. Rules on the Department of Revenue website confirm use of wholesalers, as does the new legislation. A spokesman for the department declined to comment. Our ruling A brewpub owner in DeKalb County has created a series of beers designed to call attention to what his says is the state’s interference between his business and consumers. The IPA in question effectively claims that brewpubs can’t sell their products to go. A new state law is clear that neither brewpubs nor breweries can make those sales. The brewpub does have the option to sell to wholesalers, who can then make the suds available to consumers. But that is not the same thing as getting a growler to go with your pizza.

Actor Jon Voight says progressive is just another word for communist
","Cigar smokers of the world unite. Actor and conservative advocate Jon Voight engaged in a wide-ranging interview for Cigar Afcionado in which he got into the smoke-filled rooms of politics. The magazine released excerpts in advance of publication, and a Fox News website Fox411 wrote about Voight bemoaning how liberals have rebranded themselves. ""I think the word ‘progressive’ is a very devious term. It was created as a substitute for ‘communist,’ "" he said. ""What they propose is the reverse of progress. It’s some that that (sic) does taste of communism and Karl Marx’s pernicious philosophy."" We looked into the origins of the word progressive to see if it was created as a ruse to mask communistic thinking. What we found is quite the opposite. The progressive platform emerged as way to thwart the growth of nascent American socialist or communist movements. The birth of the progressive movement The progressive label showed up in the first decade of the 20th century. The Library of Congress describes the progressives as those who ""tried to make big business more responsible through regulations of various kinds. They worked to clean up corrupt city governments, to improve working conditions in factories, and to better living conditions for those who lived in slum areas, a large number of whom were recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Many progressives were also concerned with the environment and conservation of resources."" Around the turn of the 20th century, children worked in factories, city bosses rigged elections, and corporate mergers had allowed single entities to enjoy monopoly or near-monopoly power. In nearly 80 industries, there was one firm that controlled over half the total output. The movement had many strands and at times drew support from both Republican and Democratic politicians. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt, having failed to win the Republican nomination, ran for president under the banner of the Progressive Party (in the popular press it was called the Bull Moose Party.) Some planks in the party platform resonate today. They called for limits and disclosure of campaign contributions, an eight-hour workday, a national health service, social insurance for the elderly, the unemployed and the disabled, and oversight of Wall Street. They also sought direct election of senators and creation of a national income tax. William Link, a progressive-era historian at the University of Florida, told us that while some activists focused on cleaning up slums and others on fighting political corruption, there was a unifying theme. ""It was mostly an attempt to regulate and restrain the negative forces of industrial capitalism,"" Link said. ""This meant public interventions -- often, of government, but not always -- designed to create a better society in the industrializing age."" During the progressive era, the nation gave women the right to vote and regulated the meat and drug industries, as well as the railroads. The progressive agenda showed strong regional differences. In the South, it was part of the white supremacist movement. In the North, some factions were strongly anti-immigrant. Many progressives also supported Prohibition. A break from the socialists and Marxists Rutgers University’s website on this period said many of the leaders of the movement were members of ""the middle and upper-class establishment"" who believed that the excesses of industry were breeding conditions that amplified calls for more radical change. ""Fear of the expansion of Socialism and Marxism provoked many in the upper class to support more moderate reform efforts as a means to ease the growing tensions between rich and poor and head off more extreme threats to their privileged role in society,"" the authors wrote. Charles Postel is an historian at San Francisco State University currently writing a book on the progressive era. Postel told us leading progressives such as President Teddy Roosevelt were quite clear on the relationship between their reform agenda and socialism. ""Roosevelt lectured business leaders that they needed to get on board with the graduated income tax and similar reforms if they were to successfully defeat the socialists,"" Postel said. Historian Shelton Stromquist at the University of Iowa wrote that the progressive agenda split from Marxist thinking on the issue of class. While Marxist thought emphasized class consciousness as the key to change, the mainstream progressives looked to reforms such as better housing, work conditions and education to raise people out of misery. ""They convinced themselves that class conflict and the 'parochial' class loyalties that bred it could be transcended,"" Stromquist wrote in Reinventing ""the People"": The Progressive Movement, the Class Problem and the Origins of Modern Liberalism. Stromquist wrote that modern-day liberals inherited this framework, saying, ""Liberals have largely continued to deny the relevance of class to reform."" Later progressives Most historians mark the years immediately after World War I as the end of the progressive era. Link told us the term fell out of favor for nearly three decades. It returned briefly in 1948 when former Vice President Henry Wallace (he served in Franklin Roosevelt’s last full term) ran a third-party bid for president under the Progressive Party. Wallace had virtually no chance to begin with, but after the Communist Party USA endorsed him, his campaign was doomed. Wallace himself praised aspects of the Soviet Union for promoting ""economic democracy."" That incarnation of the Progressive Party dissolved in 1955. The Wallace link aside, Link told us that Voight’s assertion is ""absurd."" ""To say that it ‘substituted’ for communism is historically inaccurate,"" Link said. Our ruling Voight said that the word progressive was created as a substitute for communist. The historic record shows that the progressive movement emerged around the turn of the last century in response to the conditions created by runaway capitalism. Its policies aimed to regulate private industry, not eliminate it. That agenda enjoyed broad support from people who identified with both parties and led to many of the basic features of government today. Many of the movement’s mainstream supporters backed reforms as a way to head off more radical movements based on class identity rooted in Marxist thought. There was a brief period when the progressive label attracted support from avowed Communists, but that ended about 60 years ago and played no role in the creation of the term.

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver uses wrong figure in statement about Ferguson
","U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat who recently appeared on National Public Radio's ""Up To Date"" to speak about current events in Ferguson, Missouri, referred to a Department of Justice report that pointedly criticized the practices of the Ferguson Police Department as unjust and profiteering. The report, released March 4, gave the public insight into the practices of the city of Ferguson, whose police department has made raising revenue a key priority. ""It's taxation by citation. Two years ago a city of 20,000 people received 31,000 citations,"" said Cleaver, who represents Kansas City and a portion of western Missouri. ""That's at least one citation per person plus 10,000 for visitors. The city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there."" We wondered about Cleaver's claim regarding both the number of citations issued and whether ""the city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there."" Ferguson citations John Jones, a spokesman for Cleaver, pointed us to the Department of Justice report to support his claim about the number of citations issued in the small city. This report is blunt in its criticism of the Ferguson Police Department and provides evidence that city officials ""routinely urge Chief Jackson to generate more revenue through enforcement."" ""Ferguson police officers from all ranks told us that revenue generation is stressed heavily within the police department, and that the message comes from city leadership,"" the report states. The report also discusses how the city is prolific at issuing citations and arrest warrants. ""Between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2014, the City of Ferguson issued approximately 90,000 citations and summonses for municipal violations,"" the report says. Further research shows that 32,975 warrants were issued in 2013 by the Ferguson courts. That last figure, the number of warrants issued by Ferguson courts, was the number Cleaver was trying to cite, Jones told us. However, Cleaver said citations, not warrants — and that makes a difference. Ferguson city clerk Megan Asikainen told PolitiFact Missouri that Ferguson issued 12,940 traffic and criminal citations in 2013. That means Cleaver was off by nearly 60 percent. 'Virtually no industry' Cleaver also said Ferguson lived off citations and had ""virtually no industry."" Kathryn Jamboretz of the Saint Louis Economic Development Partnership called this claim ""wildly inaccurate."" In 2013, fines and public safety accounted for $2.5 million in city revenue. Although that revenue is significant, it's certainly not the only source of income for the city. A variety of taxes provide the lion's share of revenue; that $2.5 million only represents about 13 percent of Ferguson's $19 million budget. What about the claim that the city has virtually no industry? Ferguson is home to a Fortune 500 company. Emerson Electric ranked 121st on the most recent Fortune 500 list with revenues of more than $24 billion in 2013. Its headquarters is less than a mile from the infamous Quiktrip of West Florissant Avenue that was looted and burned during the protests. Even after the prolonged unrest following the death of Michael Brown, there has been industrial growth in Ferguson and surrounding north St. Louis County. According to the Ferguson Recovery Report, $480 million has been invested into North County, including a $300 million Boeing expansion — which is expected to bring 700 jobs, a $100 million Schnucks distribution warehouse for 400 jobs and a $15 million Centene facility, which is expected to bring 200 new jobs to North County. When asked about his statement that there was ""virtually no industry,"" Cleaver's chief of staff, Jones, told PolitiFact that the congressman was simply stating that the city could not survive in its current state without the extreme revenue generated by traffic and criminal citations. Our ruling Cleaver said Ferguson issued ""31,000 citations. That's at least one citation per person plus 10,000 for visitors. The city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there."" Cleaver was certainly correct in saying that the municipality of Ferguson issued an abnormally high number of citations and depended on that revenue to help fund city government. That's supported by the Department of Justice report, but his number was more than double the correct figure. His comment about the city surviving only off of tickets is largely hyperbole. Ferguson has been receiving about 13 percent of its revenue from fines and public safety, which provides the city with $2.5 million in revenue. That's a lot, but certainly not the only source of income for the city. Cleaver's point that the Ferguson Police Department was raising revenue for the city is correct, but he cites the wrong numbers and makes a vast generalization about industry in Ferguson. We rate his claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2015/oct/22/emanuel-cleaver/rep-emanuel-cleaver-uses-wrong-figure-statement-ab/

Dan Patrick says Planned Parenthood does nothing but profit from killing babies, selling body parts
","Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a nationally broadcast interview that Planned Parenthood does little more than profit from killing babies. Patrick, a Republican, appeared Oct. 19, 2015, on ""Your World with Neil Cavuto,"" a Fox News program. That was the day a Texas state official moved to cut off $3.1 million in annual Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, 90 percent of it federal aid, for contraception and health services. That came as a result, the official said, of videos showing doctors for the group altered abortion procedures to procure intact fetal tissue for researchers in violation of federal law. Planned Parenthood, denying misconduct, commented that it was considering its options, including a lawsuit. Patrick, talking to Cavuto, said: ""We’re not going to tolerate Planned Parenthood pretending, Neil, to be something they’re not..."" Cavuto: ""Do you think that Planned Parenthood does anything good?"" Patrick: ""No. I don’t think they do anything good. Look, they’re nothing more than a referral service. They pretend to care about women’s health. But they don’t have professionals even giving any information to women except referring them to another clinic. They don’t  have equipment. They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies."" Cavuto: ""Well, I understand your passions, sir. But they do a little bit more than that."" Patrick: ""Very little."" There’s been debate about what the videos taken with hidden cameras by the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, show about sales of fetal tissue. But on Oct. 7, 2015, PolitiFact Florida rated False a claim that Planned Parenthood has ""now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts."" Federal law permits fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating such donations. We focused our sights on whether Patrick is right that Planned Parenthood solely provides abortions. To our request for backup information, Patrick’s spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by phone: ""We don’t have anything further to add."" Past fact checks In August 2015, PolitiFact rated Pants on Fire a claim by Jeb Bush that Planned Parenthood ""is not actually doing women’s health issues."" That story said Planned Parenthood ""offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams,"" though not mammograms. In September 2012, PolitiFact Georgia rated True a claim that Planned Parenthood ""does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers."" Earlier, in April 2011, PolitiFact rated False a claim that abortion services are ""well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does."" That story, citing a Planned Parenthood ""fact sheet,"" concluded that abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, then the most recent year for which the group was reporting statistics. There is lately more up-to-date information. On Planned Parenthood’s website, we spotted a ""By the Numbers"" document last updated in July 2015 stating that 34 percent of its health services are contraceptive services and 3 percent are abortions. Another document, ""Services,"" states that in 2013, Planned Parenthood provided more than 4.4 million services related to testing men and women for sexually transmitted infections or diseases; more than 3.5 million contraception services; more than 935,000 services related to cancer prevention and detection; some 1.1 million pregnancy and prenatal services; 327,653 abortions; and nearly 132,000 other services. The most prevalent listed contraception service was ""reversible contraception"" for women (2.1 million services). The most common cancer screening was ""breast exams/breast care"" (487,029 services). That story said that a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history; she said Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed. According to the July 2015 list, Planned Parenthood’s most common pregnancy services in 2013 were pregnancy tests (1.1 million services). Other identified services include HIV tests (704,000 services); emergency contraception kits (1.4 million services) and Pap tests (378,692 services). A longer view: Nationally from 2006 through 2013, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009, according to an Oct. 1, 2015, PolitiFact article. That story presented a chart showing how the number of specific services provided by Planned Parenthood went up or down from 2006 to 2013, based on Planned Parenthood’s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (though a report from 2008 didn’t turn up): Another chart, likewise drawing from the annual reports, showed counts for abortion and non-abortion services provided by the group:  Caveats Per all these figures, it’s worth repeating caveats offered by PolitiFact in 2011: --First, many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of ""services"" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared with what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. --Second, Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, though the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. This basically means observers must accept their accuracy more or less on faith. Planned Parenthood In Texas To our inquiry about Patrick’s claim, Yvonne Gutierrez of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, which says it battles to protect women’s health care access, said the same range of services are offered in Texas by the group. Gutierrez emailed us an undated Planned Parenthood document indicating that in 2013, its Texas clinics had 150,710 patients including 108,533 contraception patients. The document showed state-by-state counts in those categories and for Pap tests plus tests for sexually transmitted infections, breast exams and sex education and outreach. Gutierrez also emailed us a chart, attributed to state agencies, distributed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The chart shows $3.1 billion in Medicaid spending on Planned Parenthood-provided services in the fiscal year through Aug. 31, 2015. That spending covered Medicaid reimbursements and payments through health plans for patients who went to Planned Parenthood clinics, Gutierrez said. We also asked Gutierrez about Planned Parenthood in Texas making fetal tissue available for research. ""Planned Parenthood Greater Texas and Planned Parenthood South have never participated in fetal tissue research projects,"" she replied by email, ""and have no plans to do so. While Planned Parenthood Center for Choice (in Houston) does not currently participate in a fetal tissue study, they have taken part in such worthy studies in the past, following all laws and the highest medical and ethical standards. These studies hold the potential to cure disease and save lives. They last partnered with UTMB,"" the University of Texas Medical Branch, ""on a study to prevent miscarriage."" Our ruling Patrick said Planned Parenthood is ""nothing more than a referral service. … They don’t do anything except profit from killing babies and then selling body parts of those aborted babies."" To the contrary, Planned Parenthood provides family planning and other women’s health services, including abortions and there’s been no confirmation it sells body parts.

"['National', 'Financial Regulation', ""Martin O'Malley""]","
O'Malley: Hillary Clinton doesn't want to reinstate Glass-Steagall
","In a recent appearance on Comedy Central’s Daily Show, Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley doubled down on prior attacks on Hillary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street. While O’Malley charged Clinton with flip-flopping on a variety of issues close to progressives’ hearts, he said she hasn’t cut ties to Wall Street, which is based in New York, a state she used to represent in the Senate. O’Malley said Clinton doesn’t have the ""independence"" to protect Main Street from the excesses of big banks. ""There were many things that she changed positions right before the debate… whether it was the Trans-Pacific Partnership or whether it was Keystone,"" O’Malley said on Oct. 19. ""But she couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking from the speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall, because she can’t."" We decided to take a closer look at O’Malley’s claim that Clinton ""couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall."" First, a refresher on the Glass-Steagall Act: It was passed in the wake of the Great Depression to keep commercial banking and investment banking separate, as a way of protecting the broader economy from the downside of speculation. As we noted in a previous fact-check, the law was whittled down over the years, until President Bill Clinton fully repealed it in 1999. Since the most recent financial crisis hit, reining in big banks and other financial institutions has been a rallying cry for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But is it true that Clinton doesn’t echo that cry? For starters, Clinton’s formal Wall Street reform plan doesn’t include reinstating Glass-Steagall or reintroducing its provisions. Based on her recent comments, as cited by both the O’Malley and Clinton camps, that’s because she thinks reinstatement of Glass-Steagall is a red herring. Here are a few examples: • July 23 at a campaign event in South Carolina: When asked why her economic policy doesn’t include reinstating Glass-Steagall, Clinton responded, ""This is a much more complicated issue than to point at any one piece of legislation and say if we just pass that, everything would be fine. Our first goal has to be to implement fully and effectively Dodd-Frank,"" referring to the landmark act signed by President Barack Obama that created a consumer protection agency and imposed regulations on financial institutions.   • Sept. 29 in an interview with actress and writer Lena Dunham: ""Some people say all we have to do is break up the banks. Well, the problem with that is, the banks did their fair share of trouble, but a lot of the problems were not from these traditional banks. They were from what’s called the shadow banking world. ...So I think we’ve got to be more comprehensive."" • Oct. 6 at the first Democratic primary debate: ""Well, my plan is more comprehensive (than reinstating Glass-Steagall). And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail."" • Oct. 8 in a column for Bloomberg: ""One serious approach being advocated is to pass an updated Glass-Steagall Act, separating commercial and investment banking, to reduce the size of the banks and the risk of a taxpayer bailout. I certainly share the goal of never having to bail out the big banks again, but I prefer the path of tackling the most dangerous risks in a different way."" • Oct. 16 at a town hall in Keene, N.H.: ""I fully respect my colleagues who have said let's reinstate Glass-Steagall. And if I thought that alone would prevent the potential next crisis, I'd raise my hand and join, but that's not my assessment. ...Glass-Steagall wouldn't do anything about it, if it were reinstated tomorrow."" In short, Clinton has tip-toed around the issue. She’s expressed skepticism that reimposing Glass-Steagall, or something close to it, would solve the problems stemming from financial regulation. However, she argues that attacking the problem differently — for example, by imposing a ""risk fee"" on the financial institutions with assets over $50 billion, regulations on the ""shadow banking"" sector (i.e. hedge funds) and guidelines for prosecuting financial wrongdoing  — would actually be a more effective response. Our ruling O’Malley said that Clinton ""couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall."" Clinton’s Wall Street reform plan does not say it would reimpose Glass-Steagall, and she’s repeatedly downplayed the idea that it should be revived. However, Clinton argues that her alternative course would be more comprehensive and effective than simply reimposing the old law. O’Malley’s claim is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2015/oct/22/martin-omalley/omalley-hillary-clinton-doesnt-want-reinstate-glas/

Marco Rubio says EPA rule covers 'water barely bigger than a puddle'
","On the presidential campaign trail in Ohio, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called for reversing some of President Barack Obama’s environmental policies and vowed to allow more drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Rubio argued that Environmental Protection Agency rules are too burdensome, pointing to two businesspeople who joined him at his speech, James Mackall, president of Artex Oil, and Tom Mackall, president of East Fairfield Coal. ""The EPA has unilaterally changed how the Clean Water Act is interpreted. Now it not only protects rivers and lakes, but also drainage ditches and private retaining ponds. So when mining or drilling, Jerry and Tom now have to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle."" We wondered: Does the Clean Water Act allow the government to regulate how mining and drilling affects bodies of water ""barely bigger than a puddle?"" A spokesman for Rubio declined to comment. However, Rubio was presumably referring to a recent rule change to the Clean Water Act in which ""puddles"" have emerged as a matter of contention. A Clean Water Act rule change stayed by court First, some background. The Clean Water Act originally passed in 1972, in the wake of a highly publicized incident in which Ohio’s Cuyahoga River caught fire. Another factor that led to the passage of the federal law was a record number of fish kills caused by pollution -- of which the largest was in Florida at Lake Thonotosassa in 1969. Broadly, its goal was to regulate discharges. But which bodies of water should be included has been a hotly contested issue for many years. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the law’s reach. EPA officials said those decisions rolled back federal protections for about 60 percent of streams and for millions of acres of wetlands. In May 2015, the EPA announced a new rule intended to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act. The new rule followed months of public comment and took effect on Aug. 28, except in 13 states where a court held up its enactment. Then, earlier this month, a different court held up enactment nationwide. The first thing to know about the new rule is that size doesn’t matter. What matters is whether a body of water can carry pollution into other larger waters. Under the rule, the federal government intends to regulate bodies of water -- including tributaries, ponds, streams, and wetlands -- so that companies or other entities do not dump waste that could flow into larger ecosystems. This definition of a water of federal jurisdiction actually pre-dates the new rule, stemming instead from the Supreme Court cases. In 2001, the court held that the use of ""isolated"" non-navigable intrastate ponds by migratory birds was not by itself a sufficient basis to apply the Clean Water Act. In the 2006 case, Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded that a critical factor in determining whether the Clean Water Act applies is whether a water has a ‘‘significant nexus’’ to traditional navigable waters. So a narrow stream -- even if it dries up for part of the year -- could still fall under federal jurisdiction if it can flow into more significant waters during the rainy season. But an isolated pond that doesn’t connect to other major waters doesn’t fall under the jurisdiction of the act. ""Even if some very small bodies of water may be covered by the Clean Water Act when they are sufficiently connected with another body of water, his statement evokes the image of a small, isolated body of water that would not be covered,"" said Todd Aagaard, vice dean at Villanova law school and former Justice Department environmental lawyer. Even though jurisdiction under the act is determined by connectedness, rather than size, it was the size of water bodies that became a rallying cry for critics who saw the new rule as federal overreach. During the comment period, the regulation of puddles became a talking point for conservatives and business advocates. Presumably for that reason, the final rule explicitly addressed the question of puddles: ""The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so.""  The rule also specifically excludes certain types of water in addition to puddles, including groundwater, most ditches and small ornamental waters, for example. So would it include puddles or anything similar? So if the rule specifically says puddles do not fall under the rule’s jurisdiction, why have critics continued to argue that it encompasses puddles or something not much bigger? We interviewed seven environmental experts, including one who works for an organization that sued the EPA. All of them were skeptical that the rule would cover anything resembling a puddle. That’s because a small body like a puddle, or something a little larger, that doesn’t connect to other waters should have no ultimate impact on the types of navigable waters the Clean Water Act regulates. ""What type of water body is barely bigger than a puddle? How large is the puddle? If he is referring to a small puddle that a kid splashes in, a fair reading of the rule is that it does not cover such an area,"" said Stetson University law professor Royal Gardner, an expert in wetland law and policy. Meanwhile, Rubio specifically mentioned mining and drilling -- two activities that are already highly regulated. While mining and drilling can adversely affect groundwater, the law explicitly excludes groundwater. We reached out to some of the industry groups that have sued the EPA over the rule, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S Chamber of Commerce. Both argue that the rule language is so broad that it could ultimately include something not much larger than a puddle. Don Parrish, a senior adviser to the federation, pointed to the first footnote in the new rule: ""The agencies use the term ‘water’ and ‘waters’ in categorical reference to rivers, streams, ditches, wetlands, ponds, lakes, oxbows, and other types of natural or man-made aquatic systems, identifiable by the water contained in these aquatic systems or by their chemical, physical, and biological indicators. The agencies use the terms ‘waters’ and ‘water bodies’ interchangeably in this preamble."" To Parrish, this means ""you don’t even need water in them. You just need indicators of chemicals, physical and biological indicators. What in the hell is that? It's very broad."" Asked for real-world examples in which the EPA regulated something roughly the size of a puddle, farm bureau spokesman Will Rodger sent us a photograph of a farm field in Tennessee that appears to show the beginning of a nearly dry stream. He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declared this swath of land as ""waters of the United States"" by virtue of being a tributary. (This occurred in 2014 before the new rule took effect.) Environmental experts we checked with said that water on land that appears even during only part of the year can end up flowing to larger bodies of water. But again, the key is that the water must be poised to flow into other significant waters, which seems distinct from a small, isolated puddle. ""It’s true that headwaters of streams are small, but small rivulets goes into a river,"" said Karl Coplan, of Pace law school. ""The whole point of the Clean Water Act is to cover that river up to the point where it starts."" Environmental experts, for their part, said they could not think of any examples in which the EPA attempted to regulate something barely bigger than a puddle. ""It is an absurd assertion, said William L. Andreen, University of Alabama law professor. ""There are no cases on point because the agencies have never asserted jurisdiction in such fantastical situations."" Our ruling Rubio said that to abide by EPA rules when mining or drilling you have ""to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle."" A new final rule -- currently on hold due to lawsuits -- does seek to clarify what types of bodies of water the EPA can oversee through the Clean Water Act. But the rule explicitly excludes puddles, along with most ditches and ornamental bodies of water. In addition, the key factor for determining Clean Water Act jurisdiction is how connected a body of water is, not how big or small it is. To the extent that a puddle, or something slightly larger, shouldn’t be a ""significant"" contributor to bigger, navigable waters located far away -- a standard set by the 2006 Supreme Court decision -- it should not be subject to regulation under the new rule. This issue remains in litigation, but the best evidence we have collected suggests that Rubio’s claim is at least significantly exaggerated. We rate it Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2015/oct/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-epa-rule-covers-water-barely-bigg/

No, Bob Saget didn’t predict his death
","It’s been about a month since the unexpected death of 65-year-old actor and comedian Bob Saget, who was known for his stand-up comedy and his role as Danny Tanner on ""Full House.""  A statement Saget’s family released Feb. 9 said that authorities determined the comedian’s death was the result of head trauma.

""Listen to what he says…""  In the video, Saget, smiling, says, ""So I don’t have long to live, if these are your favorites? I’m going to be found dead in bed."" ""Better watch out,"" Rizzo says in reply. Using a YouTube time stamp, the video then shows that the clip of Saget and Rizzo was posted months before Saget’s death. ""How come no one has brought this up?"" reads the text accompanying the video in a Feb. 2 Facebook post, followed by a series of hashtags, including ""#prediction.""

The video, titled, ""Kelly Rizzo and Bob Discuss How They Met & Her Brand/Production Company ‘Eat Travel Rock,’ was more than an hour and a half long.    Starting at about 47:25 in the YouTube clip, the couple briefly discussed how binge watching TV shows became a bonding activity during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Rizzo: ""I would rather be home, make a nice cozy dinner, and sit on the couch and build my little fort of pillows and, you know, maybe pour you a scotch and get all cozy on the couch and watch a show.

Requesting a chargeback probably isn’t the best way to 'get back' at GoFundMe
","The crowdfunding site GoFundMe has provoked the ire of those supporting the group of truckers who continue to protest vaccine mandates and other government regulations in Canada.  Citing law enforcement reports of unlawful activity associated with a GoFundMe-supported trucker convoy in Canada, the fundraising platform announced Feb. 4 it would remove the ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" fundraiser page from its website, which had generated millions of dollars in donations. A Facebook post suggests people who are unhappy with GoFundMe’s decision should take steps to make the company pay. ""This is a better way to get back at an organization that has attempted to stifle free speech!"" read the Feb. 6 Facebook post that also shared an image with the words ""GoFundMe Charge Back."" ""If you donated through go fund me do not request a refund,"" the words in the image said. ""Instead call your bank and have it processed as a chargeback for service not rendered. Go fund me will be forced to cover the chargeback fees, which are usually $25-40 per chargeback."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Suggestions of the strategy also circulated on Twitter. PolitiFact found that while there’s a chance GoFundMe could be damaged by such an effort, there’s really no guarantee such a strategy would achieve what was intended. That’s because there are systems in place for companies to defend against what one expert termed ""chargeback abuse."" When GoFundMe took down the page, the fundraising campaign had already generated donations of more than $8 million. The company said it has a policy of supporting peaceful protests, but law enforcement reports indicated that the convoy was no longer lawful and free of violence, meaning the page was in violation. GoFundMe initially announced it would distribute $1 million from the fund to peaceful protest participants and told donors they could apply for a refund. Otherwise, the company said it planned to ""send all remaining funds to credible and established charities chosen by the Freedom Convoy 2022 organizers and verified by GoFundMe."" Faced with backlash from notable figures, GoFundMe by about 3 a.m. on Feb. 5 changed its plans: ""Due to donor feedback, we are simplifying the process. We will automatically refund all contributions directly — donors do not need to submit a request."" The protest’s organizers, meanwhile, set up a new fundraiser page on the Christian site GiveSendGo. But many of the convoy’s supporters used Facebook and Twitter to share posts encouraging GoFundMe donors to dispute their credit card charges anyway, hoping to make GoFundMe incur a wave of chargeback fees. GoFundMe did not respond to PolitiFact’s requests for comment about this strategy, and experts say there’s no guarantee such a campaign would play out the way convoy supporters intended.  Generally speaking, businesses incur chargeback fees for a credit card transaction when a customer ""requests reimbursement for a purchase or when a bank identifies possible fraud,"" according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The fees could range from about $15 to $100 or more per transaction. With refunds already promised, what does that mean for the effort to hit GoFundMe with fees? A Mastercard spokesperson said the purpose of a chargeback is to return a consumer’s money when services were not rendered or products were not delivered as promised. ""If the merchant gives the money back to the consumer, there is no right for a chargeback,"" she said.  Monica Eaton-Cardone, chief operating officer of Chargebacks911, a company that works to limit chargebacks for businesses, said that, without knowing how many charges would be disputed, it is difficult to say how a coordinated effort to request chargebacks would impact GoFundMe.  While it’s possible a sudden surge in chargeback activity could be damaging to a company, the donors’ mass effort to protest credit card charges could also backfire, she said.  ""If there’s a known, coordinated effort underway to try and ‘punish’ a company with chargebacks, that could actually work in the company’s favor,"" Eaton-Cardone said. ""Participating in a coordinated chargeback campaign like this would probably be seen as chargeback abuse, so a bank may choose to deny the request.""  She emphasized that banks have discretion over whether to issue a chargeback to cardholders, who she said are expected to ""act honestly and in good faith.""  In a situation where a company already said it would issue a refund, Eaton-Cardone said ""it’s likely that the bank will instruct cardholders to pursue the refund option, rather than indulge them with a chargeback."" There can also be risks for consumers who dispute credit card charges without first trying to resolve an issue with a business. A NerdWallet article cautioned that filing an illegitimate chargeback could forfeit the right to a refund, get a customer blacklisted by a business or even prompt a credit card issuer to terminate an account. A Facebook post claimed that disputing credit card charges for GoFundMe ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" donations and trying to hit GoFundMe with chargeback fees was ""a better way to get back at"" the company. An expert said it is unlikely banks would allow customers to pursue chargebacks after GoFundMe said it would issue refunds. An increase in chargeback requests could hurt a company, but a coordinated chargeback campaign might also prompt banks to deny chargeback requests, she said. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Heemeyer had been in a property dispute with neighbors and city officials and lost a related lawsuit. Using the so-called Killdozer, he ""destroyed 13 buildings, methodically crawling through the town in his homemade tank and striking down structures owned by those he thought were out to get him,"" Colorado Public Radio reported. Heemeyer fired shots at law enforcement, but no one except him died in the attack. He died by suicide. It’s estimated that Heemeyer caused $7 million worth of damage.

Girl Scouts not linked to Planned Parenthood or politicians
","Girl Scout cookies mean different things to different people — from entrepreneurial skills for the girls who sell them to tasty treats for those who buy them. But one social media post makes the false claim that the popular pastries represent controversy. A Feb. 4 post on Facebook says Girl Scouts support ""Planned Parenthood and pro-abortion politicians."" It shows the Planned Parenthood logo superimposed on a Trefoil cookie, which normally has the Girl Scouts’ logo. ""Our family will not be buying Girl Scout cookies this year,"" the post reads. ""Until the Girl Scouts stop supporting Planned Parenthood and pro-abortion politicians, this pro-life family won’t be buying their cookies."" It ends with the hashtag #cookiecott, and has the name ""Pro-Life Action League"" at the bottom. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claims are unfounded. Girl Scouts of the USA does not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood, according to its website. The national organization also has not endorsed any person or organization, according to the website for Girl Scouts of Southwest Texas. Most of the misinformation about the organization originated in Texas, some of it nearly two decades ago. One part of the claim dates to 2004 and is centered on one Girl Scout council — the organization's term for groups that develop and manage scouting in a geographic region — in Texas. The Waco-area council had put its name and logo on Planned Parenthood brochures that advertised sex-education programs, and also had given a ""woman of distinction"" award to a Planned Parenthood executive. The council did not contribute money or send children to the sex-ed program, which never mentioned abortion, the Associated Press reported at the time. A Waco anti-abortion group ran advertisements alleging a ""cozy relationship"" between the Girl Scouts and Planned Parenthood and urging a Girl Scout cookie boycott, according to the AP. After the ad campaign began, the Girl Scout council said it would no longer be affiliated with the sex-ed program. During a ""Today"" show segment about the issue, comments from Kathy Cloninger, who was chief executive of the national Girl Scouts at the time, seemed to muddy the waters. She said the Girl Scouts ""tackle the issues of human sexuality and body image and all of the things that girls are facing. And we partner with many organizations. We have relationships with our church communities, with YWCAs and with Planned Parenthood organizations across the country, to bring information-based sex education programs to girls."" The Girls Scouts’ official stance, then and now, is that the organization does not take a position on or develop materials about human sexuality, birth control and abortion. The issue roared back to life a decade later in 2014, when the national Girl Scouts organization shared stories on its social media accounts from the Huffington Post and the Washington Post about women who made a difference in 2013. One of the stories featured Wendy Davis, who delayed an abortion bill through filibuster,  and the other included then-Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius, who supports abortion rights. ""And that was all it took,"" the Daily Beast reported at the time. ""The Girl Scouts made no formal endorsement of either Davis or Sebelius, let alone their politics. But sharing lists that feature those two women set off CookieCott 2014."" The Girl Scouts of Southwest Texas website says the sharing of the article ""was not to endorse any of the women featured, but to highlight the source's acknowledgement of women who made a mark in 2013."" That’s also when Pro-Life Action League, a Chicago-based group whose name is on the image in this Facebook post, got involved in the cookie boycott. A Facebook post says Girl Scouts support ""Planned Parenthood and pro-abortion politicians."" Girl Scouts of the USA has no relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood, and has not endorsed any person or organization. Nearly two decades ago, a single Girl Scout council in Texas put its name and logo on a Planned Parenthood brochure for a sex-ed program that did not have anything to do with clinical services such as abortion. The council later terminated its affiliation with the sex-ed program. Then, in 2014, the national Girl Scouts organization shared news stories on its social media accounts about women who made a difference in 2013. Those stories — written by news organizations, not by the Girl Scouts — included some politicians who support abortion rights.

JD Vance wrongly says ATF is illegally tracking gun sales
","The Ohio U.S. Senate race is wide open, with both Republicans and Democrats vying for the seat currently held by retiring Republican Rob Portman. In a Facebook ad, GOP candidate J.D. Vance took aim at Rep. Tim Ryan, a contender on the Democratic side. ""Tim Ryan pretends to care about the working class, but he's a fraud who does nothing while his friend Joe Biden uses the ATF to illegally track your gun transactions and trample on your 2nd Amendment rights,"" Vance’s ad said Feb. 7. ""Unlike Tim Ryan, I'll fight to end Biden's illegal gun database."" The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is a frequent target of gun rights supporters. ATF operates under a number of legal restrictions, and here, we look into whether it has violated those limits, as Vance claims. The core complaint is that ATF has millions of records, and gun rights advocates view those records as an invitation to abuse. But the Vance campaign was unable to point to a specific act by the agency that broke the law, and we couldn’t find one either.  The Vance ad links to an interview Vance had with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. During the brief Feb. 4 segment, Vance talked about an ATF ""database"" that ""is ultimately a back door to a gun registry in this country.""  ""Once you allow gun registry, you effectively allow the disarming of your citizenry,"" Vance said. A gun registry would be a comprehensive database of every gun owner in America, showing who they were, where they lived and what weapons they owned. Lawmakers have passed laws aimed at preventing the ATF from spending a dime on creating such a database. As recently as 2011, Congress barred the ATF from ""consolidating or centralizing"" records.  Fox News did not say the ATF actually had a gun registry. As Vance mentioned an ATF database, the chyron changed to say ""Biden admin appears to be creating unlawful federal gun database."" Appearing to do something is not the same as doing it.  There’s no particular tie between Biden and gun records. Most of the gun records Vance is talking about predate Biden’s administration by decades, although Biden has drawn the ire of gun rights supporters for proposing that firearm dealers retain their records forever, rather than disposing of them after 20 years. (Screenshot) We asked the Vance campaign what ATF action had been found illegal. The campaign press office gave no example, and cast the ad’s claim of illegal ATF activity as an opinion, rather than an assertion of fact. ""Anytime a government agency infringes on the Second Amendment, any reasonable constitutionalist will deem that illegal,"" the campaign said in a statement. The statement did not clarify how ATF has infringed on the Second Amendment. In his interview, Vance voiced concern about the ATF collecting records. The argument is that it would be a short hop from simply holding the records to converting them into a comprehensive database. What’s missing is evidence that any such hop has been made. ATF has long been caught in the tension between the need to keep records to catch criminals and concerns about how those records could be used. Over the years, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have passed laws aimed at allowing the agency to help law enforcement when a weapon is used in a crime. That requires a lot of record keeping. Congress has paired those laws with others that set detailed limits that often make those records difficult to use. The records of firearm dealers who go out of business is a perfect example. The ATF manages several large collections of forms that track when firearms change hands. This includes when a manufacturer sells weapons to a licensed gun store, when federally licensed firearm dealers sell to other dealers, and when they sell to a retail customer. In a country that has more privately owned guns than people, these exchanges happen often. One particular collection has amassed more than 920 million records over the past five decades. About 867 million are images of the records, and the rest are hard copies waiting to be converted to images. These come from licensed dealers that have gone out of business. Under a 1968 law, they must send their sales records to the ATF. The records contain the make and serial number of the weapon and the company or person who bought it. The Out of Business Records are a critical tool for investigating gun crimes. When law enforcement officers recover a gun connected to a crime, they turn to the FBI and ATF to trace who owns it. The first step is to call the gunmaker, which leads to a wholesaler, which leads to a retailer, and so on. About 40% of the time, this process leads to a company that is no longer in business. That’s when the Out of Business Records come into play. It’s this bank of records that Vance and some other gun-rights advocates warn will become the seed of an illegal national database of gun owners. But the Out of Business Records system isn’t set up to work that way. It simply doesn’t fit the modern definition of a database. By law, these forms are stored as digital images that cannot be searched by a computer. There is no way for someone to enter a serial number and have the system spit out the details from the files. It doesn’t have computer readable data fields, it can’t be sorted by field, and it can’t be queried by field. Instead, each search is done by a staffer going through images one by one. The ATF sent us a picture of how a digital image file appears on a screen in their record tracing center. Out of Business Record search screen (ATF) ""Imagine looking at pictures on your phone,"" April Langwell, chief of public affairs at ATF said. ""Our people sit there and literally flip through thousands and thousands of images."" That said, staff typically find a matching record in about 20 minutes, although with about 1,700 requests coming in each day, it can take a day before the search begins. Langwell also noted that the 920 million figure doesn’t represent the number of firearms that were transferred by these dealers. Each transaction could produce three, six or even more images. Some of the recorded transactions involved more than one weapon. A majority of the transactions, Langwell said, don’t involve a person buying for their own use; they were transfers between dealers, or between a gunmaker and a wholesaler. Vance tied this digital image system to Democrats, but it has Republican roots. It was funded as part of an omnibus spending bill in 2004 when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, and George W. Bush was president. Until then, old records were stored on microfiche.  The lawmakers’ agreement on the bill said that members of both parties agreed on ""the need for the ATF to begin converting tens of thousands of existing records of out-of-business federal firearms dealers from film to digital images.""  And it doesn’t run afoul of any law. The Government Accountability Office examined ATF legal compliance in 2016. While it found some issues with other firearms tracking systems, for the Out of Business Records, the GAO found full compliance. And for the issues it did find, it said ATF changed its practices to meet legal requirements. In one case, the ATF had decided on its own in 2009 that one program went too far and canceled it. In another instance, in response to the GAO inquiry, the ATF deleted files that went beyond its legal authorization. Adam Winkler, who specializes in constitutional law and gun policy at the UCLA School of Law, told us he sees no truth in the claim that the ATF has broken the law. Vance said, ""Biden uses the ATF to illegally track your gun transactions.""  His campaign did not identify any actual legal infraction to back the claim. Some gun rights advocates warn that the vast collection of transaction records at the ATF could lay the groundwork for a national gun registry, which would be illegal. But Biden is not involved in any such effort. By law, the ATF’s largest collection of records can’t be searched by a computer. A 2016 GAO review found that the agency followed the law for these records, and had corrected its practices for other data systems it ran.

No, hospitalized COVID-19 patients weren’t killed by remdesivir
","At a panel discussion hosted by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a nurse claimed that remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug used to treat people hospitalized with COVID-19, is actually killing patients.  Nicole Sirotek, founder of American Frontline Nurses — a group that opposes vaccines and promotes unproven remedies for COVID-19 —  told the gathering that when she went to New York in May 2020 to help with the accelerating COVID-19 crisis, she ""didn’t see a single patient die of COVID"" in the hospital. She blamed the deaths on the use of remdesivir, which had just received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for adults and children hospitalized with severe COVID-19. The FDA has since given full approval to remdesivir for hospitalized patients and for outpatients at high risk of getting severely sick.  ""We all saw it was killing the patients,"" Sirotek said at the Jan. 25 panel. ""And now it’s the FDA approved drug that is continuing to kill patients across the United States. Sirotek also said that patients who received two doses of the drug had a less than 25% chance of survival.  Johnson has been a longtime critic of the COVID-19 vaccines. His panel also featured other medical workers who have opposed the COVID-19 vaccines, including Dr. Robert Malone and Dr. Harvey Risch. The video of Sirotek’s speech was posted on YouTube and shared on Facebook. Facebook flagged it as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Published data and medical experts whom we spoke to contradicted Sirotek’s claim.  Remdesivir is given to people in the hospital whose severe COVID-19 cases put them at high risk of dying, the experts explained. So those who get the drug may die. But there’s no evidence that the drug is what’s killing them. They said Sirotek’s conclusions were based on anecdotal observations and assumptions, not scientific evidence. We reached out to Sirotek’s organization for comment and more information to back up her statements, but did not receive a response.  Remdesivir is an intravenous drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc. under the brand name Veklury. Until recently, it was approved only for hospital settings, but on Jan. 21, 2022, the FDA approved it to be used for non-hospitalized patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19, and lowered the age limit below 12. Former President Donald Trump was treated with remdesivir when he was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020.  The drug was first put forward as an investigational COVID-19 treatment in early 2020, at a time when doctors and researchers were still learning about the disease and how to treat it.  Studies have shown varying degrees of effectiveness. In granting the emergency use authorization for the drug on May 1, 2020, the FDA said: ""While there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with COVID-19, the investigational drug was shown in a clinical trial to shorten the time to recovery in some patients."" RELATED VIDEO 
The agency was referring to preliminary results from an April 2020 clinical trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health that found that hospitalized patients who received remdesivir recovered from the illness 31% faster than those who received a placebo. An earlier study by the World Health Organization, conducted across 30 countries with over 11,000 adult patients, had found the drug had little to no effect. The WHO still does not recommend remdesivir for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, citing limited evidence that it works. One of the most recent studies, published in The New England Journal on Jan. 27, involved 562 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A three-day course of remdesivir ""had an acceptable safety profile and resulted in an 87% lower risk of hospitalization or death than placebo,"" the study concluded. None of the studies concluded that the drug was causing deaths. ""We simply did not see an increase in death in the group that received the drug,"" said Dr. Cameron Wolfe, associate professor of medicine and infectious disease expert at Duke University, who has treated patients with remdesivir at the university’s hospital and in the outpatient infusion clinic. Wolfe was also a principal investigator in the NIH clinical study, and the clinical trials run by Gilead Sciences.  ""That has never been seen in multiple rigorous trials,"" Wolfe added. ""In fact, they usually did better, especially if the drug was given early in the illness."" Experts said Sirotek’s conclusion incorrectly assumed a causal relationship to explain the correlation she observed between remdesivir use and patient deaths. Because remdesivir was initially authorized only for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19, ""people who were more likely to receive the antiviral, or more of the antiviral, or more frequent dosing of the antiviral, are more likely to have been sick,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  What Sirotek observed, he said, ""is that essentially the drug selects for the sicker patient."" Sirotek claimed that remdesivir is responsible for killing patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Neither medical data nor experts back this statement up. Studies have differed on how effective it is as a treatment for COVID-19, but none of them suggest that it’s causing deaths.  Experts noted that remdesivir is given to patients who are at the highest risk of death because of the severity of their disease. We rate the claim False. ",/factchecks/2022/feb/10/nicole-sirotek/no-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-werent-killed-re/

No, The White House isn’t spending $30 million on crack pipes. Here’s what’s really going on
","Conservative commentators recently set off a firestorm by accusing the federal government of spending $30 million to provide Americans with pipes to smoke illicit substances, including crack cocaine.  ""The Biden Administration cut funding for monoclonal treatment of COVID but is spending $30 million on crack pipes,"" former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer wrote on Twitter on Feb. 8.  ""Biden crime policy: Crack pipes for all. What could go wrong?"" tweeted Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. ""Biden is sending free meth & crack pipes to minority communities in the name of ‘racial equity,’"" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on the platform. ""There is no end in sight for this lunacy.""  Rubio later introduced a bill called the Cutting off Rampant Access to Crack Kits (or CRACK) Act, to ""prohibit any funds from directly or indirectly purchasing, supplying, or distributing crack pipes or similar drug paraphernalia."" These claims contain elements of truth, but they leave out significant context, due in part to evolving messaging by the Biden administration. The uproar stemmed from a Washington Free Beacon report about a Department of Health and Human Services ""substance harm reduction grant"" that had been announced earlier. ""Harm reduction"" is a policy initiative that seeks to reduce injury and death from drug use while accepting, at least in the short term, that people may continue using drugs. The Feb. 7 story was headlined, ""Biden Admin To Fund Crack Pipe Distribution To Advance ‘Racial Equity.’""  The story quoted an unnamed spokesman for HHS saying that the program would ""provide pipes for users to smoke crack cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and ‘any illicit substance.’"" HHS soon pushed back against the report. Spokesperson Jorge Silva told PolitiFact that the mention of crack pipes went beyond the information the department gave the reporter. The HHS program was designed to provide tools to minimize drug use risk, including money for testing equipment for sexually transmitted diseases, overdose reversal medication, and medication lock boxes. But the grant program would allow the distribution of ""safe smoking kits,"" and that phrase made the grant program go viral. Smoking kits typically contain disinfectant wipes, rubber mouthpieces to prevent burns and cuts, and brass screens to filter out harmful contaminants. Silva said HHS told the Free Beacon that ""unsafe smoking practices can lead to open sores, burns and cuts on the lips, and can increase the risk of infection among people who smoke drugs. Safe smoking kits have been identified to reduce the spread of disease,"" the response said.  HHS’s response continued, ""Harm reduction programs that use federal funding must adhere to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and other requirements related to such programs or services. (The agency) does not specify the kits’ elements — only the parameters."" In introducing his CRACK Act, Rubio cited the Free Beacon’s reporting, saying it ""appeared to confirm that part of the $30 million grant program would go toward ‘smoking kits/supplies’ which frequently includes crack pipes."" PolitiFact reached out to Spicer for evidence that the administration is spending $30 million on crack pipes. We did not hear back. The Free Beacon did not respond to a request for comment. The original 75-page grant proposal document from HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration does not mention crack pipes.  The grant would pay up to $9.7 million per year, or $29.2 million over a three-year period. The purpose of the program, according to the document, is to support community-based overdose prevention programs and other harm reduction services.  ""Safe smoking kits/supplies"" is one of 12 categories of items and services that would be permissible under the grant, along with infectious disease testing kits, medication lock boxes and disposal kits, overdose reversal medication, condoms, fentanyl test strips, syringes, vaccinations, and first aid supplies. Suggestions that the government is ""spending $30 million on crack pipes"" are wrong even beyond the question of whether the grants involve the distribution of crack pipes. That’s because $30 million is roughly the amount of all the possible grants collectively, and smoking kits would account for a small fraction of that. In a Feb. 9 briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki leaned into the distinction between the inclusion of smoking kits in the grant, which she indicated was accurate, and whether those kits contain crack pipes, which she said was not. Psaki said the safe smoking kit ""may contain alcohol swabs, lip balm, other materials to promote hygiene and reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis,"" Psaki said. She added, ""We don't support federal funding, indirect or direct, for pipes."" A joint statement from Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Dr. Rahul Gupta echoed Psaki’s message. ""No federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits,"" the statement said. More than 100,000 people died of drug overdoses between April 2020 and April 2021, according to federal statistics.  ""In many parts of the country, smoked drugs are now involved in the majority of drug overdoses, notably fentanyl and methamphetamine,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, principal research scientist with the Addictions, Drug & Alcohol Institute at the University of Washington School of Medicine. ""Yet we don’t have the robust harm reduction tools like we do for those who inject drugs."" Banta-Green said there is an ""important role for safer smoking supplies in reducing substance-related harms in the short term and in providing services that engage people who use substances so that they can connect to other services when they are ready."" Spicer and other conservative commentators claimed that the Biden administration is spending $30 million on crack pipes.  The assertion stems from a federal ""harm reduction"" grant to prevent injury and death among people addicted to drugs. The grant allows recipients to provide such items as testing equipment for sexually transmitted diseases and overdose reversal medication, along with ""safe smoking kits"" to curb the spread of diseases among users of smokable drugs. However, the kits would not include crack pipes, and the kits as a whole would cost far less than $30 million, which is roughly the amount the government would spend on all elements of the grant-provided supplies and services. The claim contains an element of truth, but it leaves out significant context. We rate it Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2022/feb/10/sean-spicer/no-white-house-isnt-spending-30-million-crack-pipe/

Claim that kids more likely to have access to crack pipes than mask-free education is Pants on Fire!
","U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican running for re-election, was quick with an attack on President Joe Biden with a claim that linked illegal drug use with COVID-19 face coverings. ""In Joe Biden’s America, your children are more likely to have access to a crack pipe than a mask free education,"" the former Houston-area sheriff declared in a Facebook ad posted Feb. 9. The same day, news reports across the country had already begun dousing the idea that a Biden administration initiative would result in the distribution of free crack pipes to illegal drug users — much less targeting children. Meanwhile, there is no federal mandate for mask wearing in schools, and a growing number of states that have such mandates are ending them. Nehls’ claim followed a notice by the Health and Human Services Department that it was accepting applications through Feb. 7 for ""Harm Reduction Program Grants."" The purpose of the program is ""to support community-based overdose prevention programs, syringe services programs and other harm reduction services,"" including providing ""safe smoking kits,"" the notice said. The Washington Free Beacon reported that a Health and Human Services Department spokesman, whom it did not identify, said the kits ""will provide pipes for users to smoke crack cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and ‘any illicit substance.’"" That contention was quickly shot down. On Feb. 9, the same day Nehls’ ad was posted, the department issued a statement saying ""no federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the same day that crack pipes ""were never a part of the kit; it was inaccurate reporting."" She said a safe smoking kit ""may contain alcohol swabs, lip balm, other materials to promote hygiene and reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis."" We found no suggestion that safe smoking kits were aimed at children, as Nehls suggested.  The day Nehls posted his ad, there was also news about school mask mandates being lifted across the country. As of Feb. 5, 14 states required masks to be worn in schools, down from 19 earlier in the school year, Education Week reported.  But by Feb. 9, news reports said six of those states — Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Oregon — planned to end school mask mandates in the coming weeks. There is no federal mandate for masks in schools. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal indoor masking by students age 2 years and older, as well as by staff, teachers, and visitors, regardless of vaccination status.  Nehls is running in Texas’ March 1 primary to win a second term representing District 22, which includes suburbs south and west of Houston. The seat is rated as solid or safe Republican.  Nehls had more than $367,000 in campaign funds on hand as of Dec. 31, according to the latest Federal Election Commission reports. The only other Republican on the ballot, certified public accountant Gregory Thorne, reported raising no funds.  Nehls’ campaign did not reply to our requests for information to back up his claim. Nehls claimed: ""In Joe Biden’s America, your children are more likely to have access to a crack pipe than a mask-free education."" The claim alludes to a Biden administration program that provides grants for efforts to curb injuries and deaths from drug abuse, including providing ""safe-smoking kits"" that are aimed at preventing the sharing of smoking materials. Federal officials said the grants cannot be used to provide pipes. The program is not aimed at children. There is no federal mandate requiring children to wear masks in schools, and in the coming weeks, fewer than a dozen states will have such mandates.

It would have required private employers in the city to provide employees at least six to eight days of paid sick leave per year, depending on the size of the company. The ordinance never took effect because it was challenged in court and struck down.  The legal challenges ended in June 2020 when the Texas Supreme Court let stand an appeals court ruling that the Austin ordinance conflicts with the state’s minimum wage ordinance, which bars cities from regulating wages paid by private businesses. Asked about Casar’s ad, his campaign spokesperson said that the Austin council also approved providing paid sick leave to part-time, temporary and seasonal city employees. That resolution was adopted in March 2018. Full-time city employees already had that benefit. Casar sponsored that resolution. Casar is running for the 35th District congressional seat, which is open because the incumbent, Democrat Lloyd Doggett, decided after redistricting to run for another Austin-area seat in the 37th District.  The new 35th District stretches from Austin to San Antonio. It is considered a safe Democratic seat. Casar had the most campaign cash on hand of any candidates as of Dec. 31, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data.

Republicans opposed Build Back Better as a whole, not necessarily insulin price caps, as post claims
","Insulin prices have risen dramatically in recent years, and some of the estimated 34 million Americans who have diabetes are paying up to $1,000 a month for the life-saving drug. But is it true that all Republicans in the U.S. Senate oppose an effort to cap prices for the drug at $35 per month? That’s what one Facebook post suggests. ""Biden and most Democrats want to cap insulin prices at $35 per month,"" read a Feb. 8 Facebook post that also noted that many Americans pay up to $1,000. ""All 50 Republicans in the Senate are opposed to it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The situation is not as simple as the Facebook post suggests. Legislators on both sides of the aisle have identified the rising cost of insulin as a problem. A 2020 study showed that the U.S. often pays as much as 10 times more than other countries in manufacturer prices for all forms of insulin. A 2018 Yale study showed 1 in 4 Americans rationed their insulin due to high costs. President Joe Biden has spoken of the need to lower the cost of insulin. His Build Back Better plan, which did have wide support from Democrats, would have capped cost sharing for insulin at $35 a month for those on insurance plans, although it didn’t address costs for uninsured Americans. It’s true that Republicans, urged by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were united in opposition to passing the Democrats’ roughly $2 trillion Build Back Better Act. It was a Democrat, however, who sealed the bill’s fate before it came to a vote.  The Democrats, in a 50-50 Senate, could have passed the bill on a simple majority vote via reconciliation and avoided the 60-vote threshold needed to end a filibuster. But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced in late December that he couldn’t support the bill, citing its cost. He reiterated earlier this month in an interview with CNN that the bill, at least as a big package, is ""dead."" Biden and other Democrats have expressed a willingness to pass parts of the Build Back Better Act in separate bills, leaving the door open for the proposed cap on insulin prices to be revived. Before Manchin effectively killed the bill, the Washington Post in December reported that Senate Republicans were considering using a procedural move known as the ""Byrd rule"" to strip the drug-pricing legislation from the Build Back Better bill. The idea was to deny Democrats a talking point in the midterm elections, the Post reported. Meanwhile, the publication STAT reported that two of the largest insulin makers greatly increased their spending on lobbying last year. So, passing caps on insulin prices is no sure thing. But one can’t rule out any Republican support based solely on opposition to the Build Back Better Act. Numerous Republicans, including many of those in the Senate, have indicated support for insulin price caps. Former President Donald Trump announced a deal in 2020 that would let Medicare recipients choose plans that would cap insulin costs at $35, though with slightly higher premiums. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and Louisiana Sens. Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy have all expressed support or made efforts to lower the cost of insulin in the past.  Kennedy in April 2021 proposed a bill that would have capped out-of-pocket insulin costs at $50 per month for people covered by health plans and also reimbursed those without insurance. We asked his office if he would support a standalone bill capping costs at $35 and spokesperson Jess Andrews pointed us to legislation Kennedy proposed in September 2021. The Seniors Saving on Insulin Act would cap monthly insulin costs at $35 for those on Medicare. According to the Washington Post, at least 19 Republican senators have previously signed on to legislation that would lower costs for diabetics.  Grassley teamed with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden to publish a Finance Committee report about the high cost of insulin in January 2021. They found that business practices between drug companies, health plans and pharmacy benefit managers helped keep the cost of the drug high, a claim PolitiFact rated as True in February 2021. Grassley did not respond to a request for comment about the proposed $35 cap for this article. Collins, who is co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus with Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, and Cassidy have also worked with Democrats on legislation to curb the rising price of insulin. Collins did not comment about whether she would support price caps, but the senator has worked with Shaheen to reduce insulin costs and expressed support for a price cap for some Medicare patients.  Cassidy did not respond to requests for comment. At the state level, there’s been bipartisan support to cap monthly insulin costs, including a bill that went into effect this year after passing the Republican-led Kentucky legislature. It is one of 15 states, and the District of Columbia, that have passed monthly price caps, according to the American Diabetes Association. A social media post said that all 50 Senate Republicans are opposed to a proposal by Democrats to cap insulin prices at $35 a month. Republicans did oppose Biden’s much larger Build Back Better plan, of which a $35 per month insulin price cap was one part. But we don’t see that that opposition was specific to the insulin measure. Several Republican senators have proposed or supported legislation meant to lower the cost of insulin in the past.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

In race for open US Senate seat in Missouri, fact-checking a PAC attack on Eric Schmitt over China
","Some Republicans running for open U.S. Senate seats are being hit from the right with attack ads that accuse them of cozying up to China. One of the ads, from a conservative super PAC that is funded by a large Illinois GOP donor, used the Winter Olympics in Beijing as a backdrop to brand Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt as ""good for China, bad for Missouri."" The TV ad from Team PAC, which is supporting former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens in the race, is called ""Mao Money."" It aired Feb. 4 during the broadcast of the opening ceremonies of the Games.  The ad opened with images of fireworks behind the words ""China 2022."" The narrator said, ""How did China get so powerful? Friends like Eric Schmitt."" Then it makes a two-part claim. ""Schmitt sponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars to create a cargo hub here for airlines owned by China's Communist Party to flood Missouri markets with cheap Chinese imports,"" the narrator continued, ""and Schmitt voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland."" Both parts of the claim are rooted in bills Schmitt supported in the legislature, but they omit important context about the effect of the legislation.  The first part of the super PAC’s claim centers on a 2011 bill Schmitt proposed as a state senator, connected to what was known as the China Hub Project.  As reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the initial bill would have offered up to $480 million worth of tax breaks over 15 years to spur foreign trade through Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The bill was proposed as St. Louis leaders entered their fourth year of negotiations with Chinese officials over a freight hub at the airport, and two months after the Chinese directed their largest freight carrier — China Cargo Airlines — to begin direct talks with the airport, the story said. Schmitt argued at the time that the tax credits would be issued only if certain investment and trade occurred. His bill called for $420 million of incentives to build warehouses and distribution centers within a 50-mile radius of Lambert; and $60 million in tax credits for companies shipping exports out of Missouri. Schmitt said facilities built under the bill could be used to store meat that could be sent to China. Without the bill, Schmitt didn’t see the China hub materializing, the St. Louis Beacon reported. The Team PAC ad didn’t mention the hub’s potential to handle exports, but one of the articles it cited, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, said the City of St. Louis was negotiating with China Cargo Airlines ""to bring Chinese-made goods to America through Lambert and to take American goods and agricultural products back overseas."" To back its claim that the airline was ""owned by China's Communist Party,"" the super PAC ad cited a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for 2011 by Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, in connection with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The 2011 filing does not make clear the precise level of Chinese government ownership in China Cargo. Here’s what it does say: Most of the major airline companies in China were majority-owned either by the central government or by provincial or municipal governments in China. The Chinese government controlled a 59.53% equity stake in a holding company that was China Eastern’s biggest shareholder. China Eastern owned 51% of ""subsidiary"" China Cargo. So the filing indicates that the Communist government had at least an indirect stake in China Cargo. Under the version ultimately approved by the Missouri legislature, Schmitt’s bill would have provided $360 million in tax credits. But the bill was not signed into law, and the project was scrapped. The second part of the claim alludes to a 2013 state law, which Schmitt voted for, on the ownership of agricultural land by foreign businesses.  Before the law, foreign businesses generally were prohibited from owning agricultural land in Missouri; the change loosened the prohibition, capping foreign ownership at 1% of Missouri’s total agricultural acreage. The measure was approved over the veto of then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. The law allowed a Chinese company, Shuanghui International of Hong Kong, to buy Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which owned Missouri farmland at the time, the Post-Dispatch reported.  But what Schmitt voted for was not approval of any specific land purchases by China. China is a recurring theme in ads for Senate contests in several states. In a race for an open seat in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz accused fellow Republican David McCormick of giving Chinese companies billions of dollars through the hedge fund he ran. A super PAC supporting Republican Josh Mandel for an open seat in Ohio claimed that Republican Jane Timken’s family business moved jobs to China. Meanwhile, Alex Lasry, one of the Democrats challenging GOP incumbent Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, pledged to ""finally stand up to China."" The Missouri race is to succeed two-term GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, who is not seeking re-election. The primary is Aug. 2 for the seat, which is rated as solid Republican. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 after facing a felony computer tampering charge, which was dropped, and allegations related to an extramarital affair. Schmitt formerly served as Missouri’s secretary of state and as a state senator.  The other GOP candidates include U.S. Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long; Long’s campaign gained attention for running an ad claiming that Democrats ""rigged"" the 2020 presidential election. Also among the GOP candidates are state Senate President Dave Schatz and attorney Mark McCloskey, who is best known for pointing a gun at protesters when they marched past his St. Louis home.  Team PAC raised $2.5 million in 2021, according to the Federal Election Commission — all of it from a suburban Chicago billionaire, Republican donor Richard Uihlein.  Uihlein, who owns a giant shipping supply company, is the second-largest individual donor to outside spending groups for the 2022 campaign cycle, having contributed $10.2 million, according to the nonprofit Open Secrets. As a super PAC, Team PAC may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates. Team PAC said Schmitt ""sponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars to create a cargo hub here for airlines owned by China's Communist Party"" and ""voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland."" Schmitt’s 2011 bill initially called for $480 million in tax credits, not state expenditures, for a proposed air cargo hub to support international trade, including exports, with a Chinese airline as a potential partner; the tax credits would have been contingent on investment and trade occurring. The bill did not become law. Schmitt’s vote for a 2013 bill that became law allowed for foreign businesses to own a limited amount of agricultural land in Missouri. The statement is based on bills that Schmitt supported in the legislature, but it leaves out important context about his vote and the effect of the legislation.

Kayleigh McEnany spins comparison of Trump, Biden on Russian gas pipeline
","Russia’s threat of a Ukraine invasion has brought heightened attention to a big infrastructure project: the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. The roughly 750-mile undersea pipeline would carry Russian natural gas to Germany, which is phasing out its use of coal and nuclear energy. The pipeline was completed in September 2021 but is not yet operational, pending German regulatory approval. Many of Germany’s allies in the West, including the United States and the United Kingdom, expressed concerns about the pipeline’s construction when it was announced in 2015, warning that it could hand Russia geopolitical leverage over Germany and other European nations.  Those concerns have continued amid the current Russian troop buildup on Ukraine’s borders. The United States and members of the European Union have pressured German leaders to say they will block use of the pipeline if Russia invades. The fight over Nord Stream 2 has spilled over into U.S. partisan politics. In a Feb. 8 Facebook post, Kayleigh McEnany, a former press secretary for then-President Donald Trump, applauded Trump’s efforts to block the pipeline while he was in office and accused his successor, President Joe Biden, of handing the pipeline over to Russia. ""President Trump sanctioned Russia. President Biden gave them a pipeline. And here we are,"" McEnany said in the post. McEnany’s dichotomy is exaggerated, experts told PolitiFact. The first part of her statement has some validity but ignores that both presidents have sanctioned Russia, without stopping the project. The second part is flat wrong.  Russian President Vladimir Putin during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron on Feb. 7, 2022 in Moscow. (AP) McEnany has a point that Trump did continue existing sanctions against Russia, in addition to imposing some new ones. Trump continued many of the policies toward Russia that had begun under his predecessor, President Barack Obama, particularly after Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. For instance, Trump kept in place the Magnitsky Act, which targeted high-ranking Russians with sanctions. His administration also put new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens over human rights abuses, and it approved lethal arms sales to Ukraine, which Obama had not. Trump also signed a bill in August 2017 that targeted Russia’s energy and defense sectors with sanctions.  However, experts said the 2017 legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in part due to widespread concerns that Trump was too cozy with Russia and Vladimir Putin. ""Trump’s early fawning of Putin sent strong signals that the U.S. would not be pursuing a tough policy towards Russia,"" said Susanne Wengle, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. Congress felt it had to get involved because both parties feared Trump could not be trusted with Russia, and they didn’t want to leave him the unilateral power to end sanctions via executive order, said Yoshiko M. Herrera, a University Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. When it came time to sign the bill, Trump did so grudgingly and called it ""seriously flawed."" McEnany, through a spokesperson at Fox News, where she is a commentator, also pointed to a 2019 law signed by Trump authorizing new sanctions on Russia related to Nord Stream 2. The sanctions were imposed on any company helping Russia finish the pipeline construction. These sanctions convinced a Swiss company involved in the construction to exit the project with about 6% of the pipeline unbuilt. A Russian company finished the remainder of the work in late 2020 and early 2021.  For the most part, Biden has continued the sanctions imposed by his predecessors and added new ones.  For instance, Biden issued an order in April 2021 that prohibited U.S. financial institutions from trading ruble-denominated bonds linked to a variety of Russian entities, and sanctioned six technology companies with links to Russian intelligence. And in May 2021, the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russian shipping and other entities involved in the pipeline project. However, in the course of pursuing U.S. diplomatic goals, the Biden administration has sought some flexibility. In May 2021, for instance, the administration waived sanctions on the company spearheading Nord Stream 2 as well as its CEO, arguing that a waiver was in the U.S. national interest. Secretary of State Antony Blinken cited Biden’s ""pledge to rebuild relationships with our allies and partners in Europe,"" a position widely seen as an effort to nudge Germany to curtail the pipeline without alienating the United States’ longtime ally. ""The Biden administration claimed this compromise was needed to repair relations with Germany,"" said Peter D. Feaver, a Duke University political scientist.  McEnany added that congressional Republicans have sought to stiffen sanctions related to Nord Stream 2 over the opposition of the Biden administration.  The issue came to a head in January 2022, when the Senate failed to reach the required 60 votes to advance legislation sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would have accelerated sanctions related to Nord Stream 2. Cruz’s legislation was backed by every Senate Republican except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, and won the support of a half-dozen Democrats. But every other Democrat opposed it, following the lead of the administration, which argued that the bill would have complicated U.S. diplomacy.

(AP) Trump was president through January 2021, so the vast majority of its construction occurred while he was president. A tiny portion was completed on Biden’s watch.  It is ""absolutely wrong to say that any president ‘gave’ Russia a pipeline,"" Wengle said.  Nord Stream 2 is a bilateral project between Germany and Russia, so the U.S. can only stop it using indirect leverage. ""It has been mainly Germany’s decision, so I don’t see how one can interpret Nord Stream 2 as a gift from Biden,"" Herrera said. ""All we can do is pressure Germany to not allow it to become operational."" Trump’s ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, urged Germany to stop construction of Nord Stream 2, but his urging went unheeded. It didn’t help that Trump had frayed relations with Germany and the rest of Europe, leaving the U.S. with ""virtually no leverage,"" Wengle said.  Biden prioritized improving relations with Germany but has faced obstacles in convincing Germany to forgo the pipeline, said Harley Balzer, an emeritus professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. The administration might be making some headway. Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington on Feb. 7 and said Germany was committed to ""acting together"" and taking ""necessary steps."" This was considered the strongest statement about what Germany might do with Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades. McEnany said, ""President Trump sanctioned Russia. President Biden gave them a pipeline."" This sets up a dubious dichotomy between what Trump and Biden have done to oppose the pipeline. Both presidents maneuvered with difficulty to oppose a project in which they had no official role and could only use indirect leverage. Trump did sanction Russia, although his friendliness to Putin sent contrary signals. Biden continued and extended sanctions, but he has also sought flexibility with sanctions as part of diplomatic negotiations. Only a tiny percentage of the pipeline remained to be finished by the time Biden took office; most of it was built on Trump’s watch.
