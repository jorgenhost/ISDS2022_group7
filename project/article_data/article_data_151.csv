Obama says Keystone XL is for exporting oil outside the U.S., experts disagree
","President Barack Obama and many other Democrats think there’s little to be gained by building the Keystone XL pipeline. On Nov. 18, Senate Democrats voted down a proposal to build the oil pipeline -- which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to Texas' coast.. But the issue isn’t going anywhere. When the new Republican-led Senate takes over in January, it will likely be at the top of their priorities list. Obama and other Keystone critics have argued that the pipeline would have a negative environmental impact, while having little benefit for the United States. For example, constructing the pipeline would result in few permanent American jobs. ""Understand what this project is,"" Obama said at a Nov. 14 press conference in Burma. ""It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices."" Two days later, in Brisbane, Australia, Obama described Keystone XL as ""a pipeline shipping Canadian oil to world markets, not to the United States."" Predicting the effect of the pipeline on gas prices is a little tricky. Experts tend to agree that it could impact gas prices, but the effect would be indirect and minimal. But in this fact check, we’re going to focus on the export question -- whether or not, as Obama said, Keystone XL’s primary destination is beyond the United States. We found that Obama’s off the mark. Crude oil In recent years, the United States has become a net-exporter of refined oil products, like gasoline, jet fuel and asphalt (meaning it exports more products than it imports), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, it is a net-importer of the crude oil it uses to make those products.  Keystone XL would transport crude oil from Canada’s tar sands through the Midwestern United States down to the Gulf Coast, and there are refineries all along the proposed route. (The map is from TransCanada, the pipeline operator.) America gets more crude oil from Canada than any other country. Nearly all of Canada’s exports go to the United States, and this accounts for about a third of America’s total crude oil imports. Much of its oil already makes it to the United States by rail and existing pipelines. We asked several energy economics experts, and they believe that quite a bit -- if not most -- of the Keystone XL crude oil will be bought and used by American refineries. ""It’s difficult to say with any certainty, but it is most likely that most would be refined in the U.S.,"" said Kenneth Medlock, an expert in energy economics at Rice University in Texas. A recent State Department report argues that it would not be ""economically justified"" for Canada to primarily export its Keystone XL oil to countries other than the United States, when there are plenty of American refineries to consume it. Some independent refineries -- particularly those in the upper Midwest, but also in Texas -- are in desperate need of crude oil, said Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow in energy security at the Brookings Institution. Currently, the refineries have to import crude from places like Venezuela and Mexico -- though it would be cheaper and better for overall energy security to buy from a North American source, rather than pay high transport costs. On Nov. 17, TransCanada told Reuters, it ""makes no business sense for our customers to transport oil down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, pay to export it overseas but then pay to transport millions of barrels of higher-priced oil back to the U.S. refineries to create the products we rely on."" Ebinger added that many American refineries are geared to use heavy crude, which is what Keystone would transport from Canada’s tar sands. There would, though, likely be oil coming through the Keystone XL pipeline in excess of what the American refineries would be able to use, noted Eric Smith, an energy economist at Tulane University. This excess oil could go to other countries capable of refining it. Still, most Keystone oil would stay in North America. Refined products Some Keystone XL critics have focused on the fact that American refineries could export some of the products they make with the Canadian crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel fuel or asphalt. They argue that because products made in the United States, using Keystone XL oil, will leave the country, the pipeline wouldn’t improve domestic energy security or independence. Anti-Keystone XL environmental group Tar Sands Action (part of the larger 350.org) said in a Keystone XL fact sheet, that American refineries will process the oil but, ""much of the fuel refined from the pipeline’s heavy crude oil will never reach U.S. drivers’ tanks."" However, American oil refineries’ product exports are ""not sensitive"" to the addition of a new pipeline, the State Department study says. Export trends are more dependent on demand -- both domestically and abroad -- as well as the cost of natural gas and foreign refining capacity. American oil refineries are already increasing their exports, and that trend could continue independent of Keystone XL. ""Refined product export levels have already increased and some of the crude used is from foreign sources,"" the report says. ""As this may already be occurring, it may continue with or without (Keystone XL)."" Further, the report says, ""The economic viability of exports does increase the demand for crudes in the United States,"" but, ""this demand does not depend on the proposed project."" Even if exports are increasing, the majority of oil products refined in the United States stay in the United States. For example, in 2013, Gulf Coast area refineries produced about 946,000 barrels of finished motor gasoline per day. They exported about one-third of that -- 323,000 barrels per day. In January, Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked at an ad by liberal PAC NextGen Climate that said, ""(China is) counting on the U.S. to approve TransCanada’s pipeline to ship oil through America’s heartland and out to foreign countries like theirs."" A spokesman for NextGen told Fact Checker that they were referring to refined product exports, rather than crude oil. Fact Checker gave the ad its lowest rating of Four Pinocchios. Even if Keystone XL isn’t built, experts said Canada will find other ways to transport their oil to the United States. Canada already sends crude from the oil sands into the United States by rail and other pipelines. ""I have no doubt that Canada will develop alternate means of monetizing its crude oil, whether that be via expanded rail shipments or by building pipelines to one or both of its coasts,"" Smith said. The longer that politicians debate Keystone XL, the more time Canada has to figure out these alternate means. ""Keystone XL is rapidly becoming irrelevant,"" said Michelle Foss, energy economist at the University of Texas’ Bureau of Economic Geology. Our ruling Obama said, Keystone XL allows ""Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else."" The general consensus among experts, as well as the State Department, is that American refineries would be the primary buyers of crude oil transported through the Keystone XL pipeline, by a vast margin. Some Keystone XL critics have a point that American refineries would likely export some of the products that they make with crude oil transported by the pipeline. The State Department says, however, that product exports are already increasing, and that trend would likely continue independent of a new pipeline. Additionally, American refineries tend to keep more products in the country than they export.

Martinez says Steve Adler hasn't been active in anything that has to do with Austin's City Hall
","Austin mayoral candidate Mike Martinez says his opponent, Steve Adler, lacks experience in municipal matters. Martinez, an Austin City Council member since 2006, told Austin’s KVUE-TV for a news story aired Nov. 11, 2014: ""He’s never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall,"" stressing ""anything."" Adler and Martinez are vying in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff. Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, asked us to look into Martinez’s claim. Asked how Martinez reached his conclusion, Martinez spokesman Nick Hudson emailed: ""Mike meant something specific when he made this statement. While Mike Martinez has been on the Austin City Council for nearly eight years and has a near-perfect attendance record, Steve Adler has not, to our knowledge, ever taken an active role in our local government by appearing before Council on an item."" That’s a way to get to ""never."" To be sure, Adler has been running as a City Hall outsider eager to get city government moving in a fresh direction. Wick told us Adler never has been on a council-appointed board or commission. But Wick said by email the eminent-domain lawyer has built familiarity with city affairs, in part by representing clients whose land was being condemned by the city. In 2004, Adler represented Lowe’s when the store and city of Austin tried to keep construction of a store continuing in Southwest Austin. The project ultimately proceeded after a 2005 legal settlement involving the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups. Adler also has volunteered in causes that connected with city government, Wick wrote. According to an October 2014 Austin American-Statesman profile, Adler led the board of the Austin-area Anti-Defamation League from 2009 to 2012. In that role, Wick told us, Adler ""helped conceive of and serves on the city-led Hate Crimes Task Force."" The Austin ADL says on a web page that when the task force was launched in December 2010, its ""convenors"" included the ADL, several council members and more than 70 individuals representing 40 organizations or departments. A May 2011 Austin Chronicle news story, pointed out by Wick, listed the ADL among groups having a hand in starting the task force. The story described Laura Morrison as one of three council members behind the task force’s creation in the wake of the beatings of two men outside City Hall in 2010. ""The attack prompted Morrison and colleagues Sheryl Cole and Randi Shade to ask the Austin chapter of the Anti-Defam­a­tion League to put together a proposal for what a city-led task force might look like,"" the Chronicle said. The story said: ""The idea is for the group – which includes"" Travis County’s district and county attorneys, the Austin Police Department, ""University of Texas and Austin Independent School District police, members of the Anti-Defam­ation League, Out Youth, and other civil rights groups, among others – to identify and develop an approach to dealing with hate-motivated violence ‘before, during, and after’ it happens."" That story didn’t mention Adler. But in May 2014, an Adler profile in the Austin Bulldog quoted Austin ADL board member Kirk Rudy saying Adler ""was instrumental"" in creating the task force. By phone, attorney Karen Gross, a former ADL staff member, told us she and Adler helped launch the task force by reaching out to any group with a possible stake in the collaboration of city, county and non-governmental entities. Wick said Adler also had a hand in writing the city’s cultural master plan. An April 2008 consultant’s report lists Adler among 71 members of the CreateAustin Leadership Council, an appointed group of ""civic, business and cultural leaders who agreed to provide the visible leadership in reaching out to engage the community, to assist in crafting the CreateAustin Cultural Master Plan and to galvanize the effort to implement the plan’s recommendations."" By telephone, Janet Seibert, the city’s civic arts program consultant, said the members were chosen by city staff. The report says the city’s Cultural Arts Division launched the CreateAustin ""strategic planning process"" in September 2006 because the city ""wanted to review and refine municipal roles and responsibilities for cultural support, but that was only half of it. The City recognized they couldn’t support arts, culture and creative industries alone. They sought to trigger and develop community leadership to explore major issues and develop strategies to sustain the creative culture of Austin."" The leadership council, the report said, ""met regularly to review research, findings and community input in order to help shape the cultural plan."" Adler, the report says, was on the  body’s Cultural Infrastructure task force. Adler co-chaired that task force, Seiberg said to our query. She said the Austin City Council accepted the master plan in June 2010. Our ruling Martinez said Adler has ""never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall."" Adler hasn’t been a member of city boards or commissions and we accept Martinez’s assertion Adler hasn’t addressed the council. Then again, Adler had a leadership hand in developing the hate crimes task force and the city’s cultural master plan. All told, this never/anything statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

Anti casino group Enough Already claims most revenue from Kenosha casino would go to Florida
","As a decision by Gov. Scott Walker draws near, debate over a proposed $800 million casino in Kenosha is rekindling on social media and the airwaves.

The Menominee tribe aims to build on the site of the long-closed Dairyland Greyhound Park dog track. The latest plan, which has received federal approval, calls for a project that would include a casino, hotel, spa and concert venue that would be developed and managed by Hard Rock International, which is owned by the Seminole tribe of Florida.

The Kenosha plan has drawn strong opposition from the Forest County Potawatomi, who argue the project would drain revenue from their Milwaukee casino, which recently added a $150 million, 381 room hotel.

Walker has the final say and has until Feb. 19, 2015 to make his decision.

Anti-casino group Enough Already Wisconsin, Inc. has been active on social media, including regular tweets criticizing the project. The group — which is not required to reveal its funding — is also running a new batch of television ads urging Walker to reject the plan.

A Nov. 8, 2014 tweet zeroed in on a key opposition argument — that the casino would benefit out-of-state interests, specifically the Seminoles in Florida: ""The Kenosha Casino, backed by the FL. Seminole Tribe, would send a majority of its rev to FL.""

That’s a lot of money, given that the casino is expected to generate revenue of more than $436 million in its first year of operation, according to figures provided to the state by Hard Rock and the Menominee.

Is the group correct?

When we asked Enough Already spokesman Brian Nemoir for evidence to back the claim that most of the revenue would flow to Florida, he walked back the statement.

""What I should have said is the money is being sent out of state, not just Florida,"" Nemoir said.

The Nov. 8, 2014 tweet was subsequently removed, but the same statement remains in the organization’s feed from the previous two months.

The financial picture

So what about the numbers? Let’s break down the anticipated spending and see what part of the Hard Rock revenue would go to Florida.

Enough Already and the casino backers agree — roughly — on how much revenue the project could generate each year. Nemoir said he used $410 million, based on a Menominee report to the federal government. A more recent figure, $436.7 million, was in a Menominee/Hard Rock report filed with the state in October 2013.

So for Enough Already to be right, a majority of that money — some $205 million to $218 million — would have to go to Florida.

Management fees: The Seminole-owned Hard Rock would receive an annual management fee. The Menominee-Hard Rock report lists that fee at $34.7 million in the first year that the facility is open — about 7.9 percent of total revenue of $436.7 million.

But Nemoir used a figure that was nearly four times higher — that the Seminole would receive $143.5 million a year, or about 33 percent of the gross revenue.

He said that figure was based on an estimate made by University of Wisconsin-Madison law professor Richard Monette in a Sept. 19, 2014 story in the Appleton Post-Crescent. The story contained this line:

""‘Hard Rock would likely receive 30 to 35 percent of the Kenosha casino's total revenue and as much as 40 percent,’ predicted University of Wisconsin-Madison law school professor Richard Monette, who is director of the Great Lakes Indian Law Center.""

But Monette told us his comments were basically a guess.

""When I was asked, the reporter didn't have the facts and I hadn't researched the matter, so I speculated based on other deals,"" he wrote in an email.

""That said, I would be very surprised if that $34 million were a total,"" he said, adding that the sum sounded like the ""development and management of construction only. Once the casino is opened, operations management is usually greater than that, annually.""

Construction loan: The Kenosha complex will cost an estimated $800 million, and the Menominee will have to repay with interest whoever lends that money. Nemoir puts the annual repayment amount at $58 million per year and assumes it will go the the Seminole tribe.

But there’s been no indication that the Seminole are planning to finance the project themselves.

Kenosha project spokesman Michael Beightol said three banks have said they would consider participating in the project, including Green Bay-based Bay Bank, which is owned by the Oneida tribe. He said the other two banks are much larger and neither is in Florida, or connected with the Seminole tribe.

The document that the Kenosha group filed with the state lists $50.5 million as the interest payment for the construction loan in the first year that the facility is open.

Other considerations

Nemoir pointed out the Menominee also owe money to the former owner of the dog track, based in Alabama, and the Connecticut-based Mohegan tribe, a former partner with the Menominee for the Kenosha project. Those payments total about $53 million.

That money would go out of state, but not to Florida, as claimed. What’s more, they would be one-time payments.

On the other side, Beightol noted that the casino would generate a projected $42.8 million in state and local payments and taxes; have $167.8 million in spending on money and goods purchased in the state, including labor; and $15.4 million in ""promotional allowances"" such as marketing and advertising.

Those expenses alone amount to about $226 million — well over half of the gross revenue.

As for what is going to the Seminole tribe, the best figure based on public filings is $34.7 million in the first year. That’s about 8 percent of total revenue -- a far cry from more than 50 percent.

Our rating

A group opposing the Kenosha casino project tweeted that the majority of revenue from the business would go to the Seminole tribe in Florida. For that to be right, it would have to be at least $200 million.

However, the claim is based a guess and a faulty assumption. The group’s spokesman admitted that the numbers fall short.

We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9B080>],/factchecks/2014/nov/20/enough-already-wisconsin-inc/anti-casino-group-enough-already-claims-most-reven/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Florida', 'John Thrasher']","
Thrasher says he has 'never received any contributions from the Koch brothers'
","Long before John Thrasher became president of Florida State University on Nov. 10, students were expressing opposition to his appointment, many of them charging that Thrasher had ties to ""special interests."" As the Republican former state senator begins his presidency, we decided to look back at a comment Thrasher made during a forum with FSU students and faculty on Sept. 15. Thrasher became defensive when questioned about his ties to Charles and David Koch, the billionaire libertarian brothers who have spent freely on anti-regulation causes. At one point, a graduate student asked Thrasher about campaign contributions he had received from the brothers. The former lawmaker from St. Augustine denied receiving any. ""I don't have a relationship with the Koch brothers,"" Thrasher said. ""You say I've got contributions from them? You go look at my contributions, I've never received any contributions from the Koch brothers."" Did Thrasher get any campaign contributions from the Koch brothers? Here’s the full story. The money trail Thrasher was approved as president by the FSU Board of Trustees by an 11-2 vote on Sept. 23. On Election Day, he was re-elected to his Senate seat. Two days later, he was confirmed for the presidency by the state Board of Governors and then resigned his Senate seat. (A special election is scheduled for Jan. 27, 2015, which could cost taxpayers as much as $1 million.) On Nov. 10, Thrasher was formally installed as the 15th president of FSU. But the possibility that he could become FSU’s president was controversial almost from the very beginning, with students and teachers decrying his lack of academic credentials. The controversy is colored by past concerns about the Koch brothers’ attempts to influence FSU. In 2008, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation pledged $1.5 million for economics professors if the organization was granted a say in the screening process -- a power that critics said ran contrary to academic freedom. The university accepted the deal. Thrasher, 70, has a business degree and law degree from FSU and served several terms in the Florida House starting in 1992, eventually becoming speaker of the House in 1999 and 2000. In 2009, Thrasher won a special election for a state Senate seat in northeast Florida, then won re-election the following year and served as chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. Commentators cited his political connections and fundraising savvy as the reasons he became the frontrunner for FSU’s presidency after applying in May 2014. (Outgoing FSU president Eric Barron was named president of Penn State University.) Some at Florida State preferred any of the other three candidates -- all administrators at other universities -- over Thrasher. The FSU Progress Coalition, a group of student leaders and faculty openly opposed to conservatives in the Florida Legislature, peppered Thrasher with questions at the Sept. 15 forum, eventually posting audio of the comment about the Koch brothers online (hear it at about the 2:30 mark). Because the recording is audio-only, PolitiFact Florida first set out to verify that the recording was actually Thrasher. The office of the president didn’t respond to our requests, but we found a variety of student, faculty and media sources that confirmed it. But is the statement accurate? A trip to the Florida Division of Elections website showed that Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kan., has made four contributions to Thrasher’s re-election campaign since 2012. The multinational group owns interests in manufacturing, energy, textiles, chemicals, paper, ranching, finance and investing, among other things. Current Florida campaign finance laws allow corporations to donate up to $1,000 per election to a legislative candidate. Koch Industries has given Thrasher $3,000 over the past three years. Two donations on Jan. 9, 2012, and Oct. 11, 2012, were $500 apiece. Two were $1,000 each, on Feb. 8, 2014, and Oct. 21, 2014. This final donation came after the forum in question, and after the Board of Trustees had voted for Thrasher. Thrasher campaign spokesperson Sarah Bascom said those contributions came from Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific, a pulp and paper subsidiary of Koch Industries that is the largest private employer in Putnam County, part of Thrasher’s old district. Thrasher has received campaign cash from Georgia-Pacific dating back to 1995; Koch Industries acquired the company in 2005. The four donations cited above were officially made in the name of Koch Industries. Integrity Florida, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign-finance issues, told us it was up to the campaign to list where the money came from. The contribution may have come from Georgia-Pacific, but we’ll go by the fact the donation was credited to the parent corporation, not the subsidiary. But Thrasher’s camp cautioned against jumping to conclusions about what he meant. He ""was referring to contributions from them (the Koch brothers) personally,"" Bascom said. ""His comments were not referring to all of the companies that they may have a business interest in."" (Thrasher told the Tampa Bay Times on Sept. 18 that he didn’t know the Kochs. ""I have been saying I've never met them, I've never talked to them and I wouldn't recognize them if they walked into the room,"" he said.) The distinction between receiving corporate money from a Koch-owned company and money from the Koch Brothers personally adds some complexity to this question. University of Florida professor Dan Smith said it’s appropriate to declare the money came from the powerful siblings. To a reasonable person, crediting the donations to Koch Industries looks like the money comes from the company’s owners. ""It’s quite clear that Sen. Thrasher has received contributions from the Koch brothers over the years,"" Smith said. ""Whether or not they come directly from the Koch brothers or the corporations that they control, that is Koch dollars."" But T. Wayne Bailey, a political science professor at Stetson University’s DeLand campus, gave a more nuanced answer. Given Thrasher’s influence over the years, Bailey said, it’s probable special interests like the Koch brothers no doubt have taken great interest in ""cultivating"" him. Being chairman of Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign would likely have been a factor as well, Bailey said. But whether those donations count as coming directly from the Koch brothers is a question of point of view, he said. If anything, it points out just how much of American industry the Kochs own, and the influence they wield as a result. The circumstances demand that Thrasher ""be open and transparent"" going forward as FSU president, Bailey said. There are a few other bits of context worth mentioning. First, while Koch Industries’ donations have totaled $3,000, that’s a small fraction of the almost $882,000 Thrasher’s raised since 2011. Second, one of the most important Koch Brothers-linked organizations, Americans for Prosperity, has run hot and cold on Thrasher and his agenda in recent years. The group’s Florida affiliate gave him a grade of D in 2014 after having earned an A+ before. Those grades were based on whether Thrasher voted in favor of policy decisions AFP endorsed. Democrats almost universally receive F grades. Our ruling Thrasher said he has ""never received any contributions from the Koch brothers."" Thrasher says he has never received money personally from the Koch Brothers, and as far as we can tell, that’s correct. However, he did receive four donations totaling $3,000 from Koch Industries, a company they own. That's what we're checking, not whether he knows Charles and David Koch. His campaign said those donations specifically came from the subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a major employer in his district that had donated to Thrasher years before being owned by the Kochs, but the contributions were officially categorized as coming from Koch Industries. Experts say it could be reasonable to equate those donations as coming from the company’s owners. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097815480>],/factchecks/2014/nov/19/john-thrasher/thrasher-says-he-has-never-received-any-contributi/

No, the Kochs won't make $100 billion from the Keystone XL pipeline
","Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline are stoking fear about the project by connecting it to two of the biggest bogeymen in politics: Charles and David Koch. The claim goes that the Koch brothers stand to make $100 billion if the pipeline gets built. The figure, which would effectively double the Kochs’ net worth, has bounced around liberal news organizations and was repeated this month by progressive radio talk show and TV host Thom Hartmann on his RT show. Take it with a block of salt, a PunditFact analysis finds. The $100 billion estimate is far from a neutral analyst’s prediction, based instead on the far-out calculations of a group that wants the pipeline, and the Koch brothers, to fail. Here’s what you need to know.  Keystone and Kochs in context First, let’s put $100 billion in perspective. That’s an enormous sum, half as much as Facebook’s value, about the same as the Dominican Republic’s GDP and approximately equal to the Kochs’ combined, reported net worth. If the brothers had a sure windfall on their hands, you might think they would be actively promoting the pipeline, or at least be positioned to pounce by reserving space in it or actively drilling in the area. (Map via TransCanada.)  But the Kochs have repeatedly told reporters and Democratic lawmakers that the company has no involvement in the pipeline and is not a proposed customer. For the record, ""we are supportive of it,"" Koch Industries spokesman Rob Tappan told PunditFact. Pipeline builder TransCanada has also tried swatting down Koch connections, saying Koch Industries has ""absolutely nothing"" to do with the pipeline. Koch Industries is, however, a major player in the Canadian oil market. The Washington Post identified the company in April 2014 as the largest foreign leaseholder of acres of Canadian oil sands. An Alberta Energy spokesman told us the agency could not confirm the Post’s analysis of Koch-leased lands -- estimated to be between 1.12 million to 1.47 million acres -- because ""organizations like Koch can change and occasionally restructure."" Even so, the considerable amount of land leased by the Kochs does not automatically signal that the Kochs will get a sure $100 billion payout, or any payout. Many of the Koch land-leases, the Post reported, came before Keystone was ever proposed, the company has not reserved space in the pipeline as is typical, and the pipeline route would not run near Koch-owned refineries. How you get $100 billion The origin of the Keystone = $100 billion for the Kochs line stems from a 2013 report from the International Forum on Globalization. While that group may sound neutral, it in fact opposes ""free market"" institutions such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and North American Free Trade Agreement. The group also makes no secret of its opposition to the pipeline and Koch Industries. It produced an October 2013 report, ""The Billionaires’ Carbon Bomb: Koch brothers and Keystone XL."" Experts we consulted were struck by the report’s bias, with chapters devoted to victims of ""Koch greed"" and the Kochs’ vast web of nonprofit spending for political aims, as well as its calculation that the Keystone XL pipeline carries ""$100 billion in potential profits"" for the Kochs. Experts in energy, economics and business called the methodology behind the figure ""absurd"" and ""puzzling."" In PunditFact terminology, that would be Pants on Fire. In an email, International Forum on Globalization executive director Victor Menotti (notable for his arrest during anti-WTO protests in 1999) said his group kept the methodology ""simple to give people a credible idea of what Koch has at stake with Keystone."" The group came up with two different numbers -- experts didn’t vouch for either -- and multiplied them together to come up with Kochs' potential profits. The group assumed that the land leased by Koch would contain 15 billion barrels of ""profitable-to-produce"" Canadian tar sands oil, a guesstimate extrapolated from one documented 2006 sale of a 374,000-acre parcel with 47 billion barrels of oil mixture (more details on page 8 of the IFG report). The group assumed a $15 gross production per barrel due to Keystone XL. Multiply one by the other and you get $90 billion. Round it up by $10 billion and you get headlines. Counting the ways We consulted four experts in energy economics and the petroleum industry to review the forum’s report and offer their analysis. They pointed out 10 significant flaws. 1. Price of oil is down: When the report was released, oil prices were about $100 a barrel. They’ve since fallen to about $75 a barrel, a drop that cuts into the report’s estimated profit of $15 per barrel. Menotti acknowledges this and said his group is working on an update that accounts for the drop in the price of oil since the summer. 2. Not realistic: The amount of oil the group says the Kochs will pump through the pipeline (15-16 billion barrels) is ""enough to fill Keystone XL to capacity for about 80 years if you assume that all the oil is shipped as diluted bitumen,"" said Andrew Leach, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta School of Business. 3. Unlikely payoff: Leach said a better measure to understand the potential return for the Kochs is by looking at current lease sale prices. In Alberta, oil leases are running about $70 an acre. Multiply that by 2 million acres -- the high end of what the Kochs may have -- and you get $140 million. ""It’s pretty hard to believe that a pipeline would increase the value of an oil sands lease by three orders of magnitude,"" Leach said. 4. Development takes time: According to the Vancouver Observer, Koch has filed a development permit for one site, ""but the time to develop all 2 million acres would be very long,"" Leach said. The weather and infrastructure costs present more of a challenge to produce in Alberta. 5. Keystone creates more competition: The pipeline would introduce more competition into refineries that have been bottlenecked with too much oil from Bakken and Midwestern crude at Cushing, Okla., pipelines, the experts said. If the pipeline is built, more Canadian oil sands could enter the market at Gulf Coast refineries to compete with oil brought in from the Middle East and Venezuela. ""Competition doesn’t usually lead to increased prices,"" said Anastasia Shcherbakova, a University of Texas Dallas clinical assistant professor in energy economics and energy finance. 6. Does not factor in taxes: The report does not factor in taxes or royalties that need to be paid to the Canadian government, another factor that eats into the assumption of $15 profit per barrel, said Detlef Hallermann, a Texas A&M University associate clinical finance professor who earned his doctoral degree in mineral economics. 7. Lack of discount rate: The usable oil substance will not be plied from below the surface all at once. Oil-sands mining is a long-term, high-cost investment, and the report does not go into how long the estimated 6 billion barrels would take to produce. Revenues generated over time should be calculated in present value, not nominal terms, to reflect how much it costs to bring the project online and maintain it, Shcherbakova said. ""My understanding of the analysis ... is they’re counting all $100 billion as if it’s all coming to you today,"" Hallermann said. 8. The Kochs don’t own the land: The Kochs are not the owners of these acres, they own the rights to explore the parcels themselves. Leases are held for a term, not for forever, said Terry McInturff, chairman of Texas Tech University’s area of energy, economics and law. 9. Every acreage is not equal: The report assumes the geology of the leased land is uniform and will yield uniform amounts of oil. But that is not how it works in Alberta’s boreal forests. ""That would be too easy,"" Shcherbakova said. 10. Assumes no Keystone, no oil: Experts also noted that the report mistakenly assumes that other methods to transport crude oil sands would not happen if the pipeline is rejected. Our ruling The claim here is that the Koch brothers will turn a $100 billion profit if the Keystone XL pipeline is constructed, essentially doubling their net worth. As we’ve shown, the Kochs hold oil leases in Canada. We're not ruling out that they could benefit in some ways from the Keystone XL pipeline. But trying to extrapolate their oil-sands leases into a specific profit figure is sheer folly. The authors of the report that tried to do so made so many assumptions and mistakes that experts deemed their analysis ""absurd.""

Barack Obama says MIT professor Jonathan Gruber was just 'some adviser'
","Even overseas, President Barack Obama couldn’t escape questions about a domestic controversy surrounding the health care law. Footage emerged last week of Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist, claiming more than a year ago that the ""stupidity of the American voter"" and a ""lack of transparency"" were key to passing the Affordable Care Act. Why is that of interest? Because Gruber played a role in helping to write and pass the health care law. Obama, however, downplayed Gruber’s involvement while speaking at the G20 summit in Australia. A reporter asked Obama about Gruber’s remarks. Obama replied, ""I just heard about this. I get well briefed before I come out here. The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is no reflection on the actual process that was run."" Here, we wanted to hash out what role Gruber had in crafting the Affordable Care Act and whether Obama accurately recounted his involvement. Getting to know Gruber Gruber was instrumental in helping Massachusetts build its health care overhaul from 2003 to 2006, sometimes called ""Romneycare"" after former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, which is widely viewed as the model for the federal law. Both share the central idea to require everyone to purchase health insurance and similarly set up a marketplace to allow individuals to buy coverage.  In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum claimed a Romney adviser, who turned out to be Gruber, admitted that the Massachusetts law was the model for the federal law. We rated Santorum's claim was Mostly True. We’ve interviewed Gruber from time to time as an expert on both laws. A month after Obama took office in 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted Gruber to provide ""technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform,"" according to a federal job posting. Gruber was the only person considered for the position because he developed a ""proprietary statistically sophisticated micro-simulation model that has the flexibility to ascertain the distribution of changes in health care spending and public and private health sector costs."" Essentially, Gruber had built a way to accurately estimate health care costs and spending for varying health insurance proposals, federal programs and tax policies, and it made him ""uniquely positioned to provide the analytic work."" For this, Gruber was paid quite well. According to a recent story by the Washington Post Fact Checker, Gruber earned about $400,000 for his work with HHS and the Obama administration. He has since made seven figures helping various states set up their own insurance marketplaces in compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The Gruber Microsimulation Model Gruber’s model, called the Gruber Microsimulation Model, was able to predict important factors, such as how much insurance would cost for individuals to buy in each state. Another important element of Gruber’s model is its outputs were very similar to those produced by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper. With everyone watching closely to see how the Congressional Budget Office was evaluating the fiscal impact of the various health care bills, having a model that could accurately predict what the CBO would say was very valuable to the process. Gruber declined to comment for this story. But others who worked on the legislation have rebutted claims that Gruber was ""an architect"" of the Affordable Care Act. John McDonough, a Harvard health policy professor who was a senior adviser to the Senate Health and Education Committee when the law was written, told PolitiFact that Gruber’s involvement was important, but it did not involve the actual writing of the bill. ""Jon had designed an economic model to be able to estimate any changing set of parameters like how much a policy would cost and how many people would get covered and various other effects,"" said McDonough, who also worked with Gruber in Massachusetts. ""In 2009 and 2010 he took a year off from his teaching and other duties and worked out of his home in Lexington, Mass., and was basically on call almost 24-7 to run various models for us."" ""But he was not in the room in the determination of what policies would be in or not be in the law,"" McDonough added. ""I was one of an army of people who were in the room at various times. Jon was not."" Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress who served as a senior adviser for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services from 2009-10, wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that Gruber ""did not make policy, nor did he work for the White House, HHS, or any congressional committee."" ""The true architects of the ACA are the members of the Senate Finance and Senate Health committees who wrote the bill,"" she wrote. Gruber and Obama Gruber may not be an architect of the bill, like some have said, but referring to him as ""some adviser"" is somewhat misleading as well. After all, his microsimulation model made him uniquely qualified for the critical task of figuring out just how much all of this would cost the government and consumers. Such a flippant characterization also dismisses Gruber’s influence on Obama’s positions on health care reform in the lead-up to his presidential bid and during his first year in office. A video clip that resurfaced last week showed then-Sen. Obama speaking at a Brookings Institution event in 2006 (Gruber spoke later in the event). During his remarks, Obama said about the forthcoming Hamilton Project, ""You have already drawn some of the brightest minds from academia and policy circles, many of them I have stolen ideas from liberally, people ranging from Robert Gordon to Austan Goolsbee; Jon Gruber; my dear friend, Jim Wallis here, who can inform what are sometimes dry policy debates with a prophetic voice."" Further, Gruber visited the White House a dozen times from 2009-10, according to visitor logs. This included a July 20, 2009, meeting with Obama. According to a 2011 NBC news story, Obama or his staff sat down a dozen times during 2009 with three different people who helped advise Romney’s health care overhaul in Massachusetts, including Gruber. ""The White House wanted to lean a lot on what we’d done in Massachusetts,"" Gruber told NBC News in 2011. ""They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model."" Gruber also had meetings with many of the heavyweights on Obama’s economic and health care staff: Peter Orszag, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget; Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council; Jason Furman, the deputy director of the National Economic Council; and Jeanne Lambrew, the director of the Office of Health Reform for the Department of Health and Human Services. Our ruling Obama said Gruber was ""some adviser who never worked on our staff."" This careful wording significantly downplays the MIT economist's role. Gruber was an adviser. But he was not just ""some adviser,"" an especially flip characterization. By HHS’ own documentation, Gruber was considered ""uniquely positioned"" for a contract job assisting with Obama’s health care reform efforts. In that sense, he was a very important adviser. Further, while Gruber never worked ""on our staff,"" he was paid by the federal government quite handsomely, and worked very closely with the staff. His economic simulation model was very important to those writing the bill, even if he wasn’t the person deciding what would make the legislation and what would be left at the cutting board. He also met with Obama in the White House and had a dozen meetings that often included some of the most senior members of Obama’s economic and health care teams. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967ACFC0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/19/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mit-professor-jonathan-gruber-wa/

Mitch McConnell says U.S.-China climate deal means China won't have to do anything for 16 years
","During a recent visit to China, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a potentially landmark climate change agreement between the two countries, which are among the world’s biggest economies and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, and notably carbon dioxide, are produced when burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy. When these gases build up in the atmosphere, most scientists say, they trap heat and raise surface temperatures, leading to changes in climate such as climbing sea levels. For years, one of the key arguments made by opponents of U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions has been that rising emissions from other big and fast-growing economies, such as China, could swamp any reductions the United States makes. The agreement with China potentially weakens that argument. But congressional Republicans, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., weren’t pleased with the terms of the accord. McConnell, who represents a coal-producing state, said so on Nov. 12, 2014, while talking to reporters covering a meeting with newly elected members of his Republican conference. ""The president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving toward the middle,"" McConnell said. ""I was particularly distressed by the deal he’s reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country."" Several readers asked us to check whether McConnell is right that the bilateral agreement ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."" We turned to the announcement released by the White House on Nov. 12. Here’s the relevant portion: ""Today, the presidents of the United States and China announced their respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer range effort to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of the global temperature goal of 2℃. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Both sides intend to continue to work to increase ambition over time."" Boiled down, the key tasks for China in this deal are: 1.) an intention to max out carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, if not sooner, and; 2.) an intention to increase to about 20 percent the proportion of non-fossil fuels, such as renewables, in China’s energy mix. When we asked for backup on his claims, McConnell’s office made two reasonable points. First, his office noted that the agreement is based on intentions, rather than on ironclad promises with enforcement mechanisms. They pointed to a column by Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international-affairs think tank, and a veteran of President George W. Bush’s State Department. Manning wrote that ""this is not a binding agreement and includes no benchmarks to measure progress or penalties to encourage it."" The second point McConnell’s office makes is that China may already have been planning to make these emissions cuts anyway. According to a report in Reuters, the 2030 peak date was ""in line with forecasts already made by several state-backed think-tanks, with the China Academy of Social Sciences saying in a study last week that slowing rates of urbanization would likely mean that industrial emissions would peak around 2025-2030 and start to fall by 2040."" In theory, China could ""simply shut down a lot of plants on Dec. 31, 2029,"" Jonathan R. Nash, a law professor at Emory University, told PolitiFact. ""In that case, the agreement itself doesn't obligate China to take action before 2030."" Experts said this is theoretically possible, but, in the real world, unlikely. It will take ""significant work"" for China to reach the 2030 target, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at UCLA. ""You can't stop your emissions immediately. Imagine if China said they would stop emissions today. That would require massive changes to implement -- no increases in driving unless cars were cleaner, no new economic growth without cutting emissions elsewhere, and so on. For China to achieve a cap in emissions by 2030, they will have to begin to find clean energy replacements very soon or seriously limit economic growth."" Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, agreed. ""Given the inertia in the economic and energy systems of China and its recent rates of emissions growth, there is absolutely no way that could happen without … an earlier slowing of emissions growth,"" he said. ""No sensible policy would allow"" any different course, he said.   But as questionable as it is to suggest that China could do nothing until Dec. 31, 2029, and still meet the targets, there’s still a second task for China -- to increase non-fossil fuels to about 20 percent of the nation’s energy mix by 2030. Because no such infrastructure can be created overnight, China will have to start work on this part well before December 2029. Indeed, such efforts already appear to be under way, said Michael B. Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia University who has studied the issue. ""China is engaged in a massive program of building wind, solar and nuclear energy plants,"" he said. Our ruling McConnell said the climate-change agreement between the United States and China ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."" McConnell’s staff has a point that the agreement isn’t binding and may simply be codifying changes China had already planned to make. Still, his claim is at best an exaggeration. While it’s theoretically possible that China could meet its emissions target simply by shutting down major plants on Dec. 31, 2029, experts say it would be much less risky to China’s economy to spend the next 16 years working toward the goal, rather than doing it overnight. But even if China did choose to make a literal overnight shift on emissions, that still doesn’t account for China’s pledge to increase non-fossil-fuel use to 20 percent of its energy mix. Building that infrastructure cannot be done overnight and will take years to carry out, experts said. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DD59C0>],/factchecks/2014/nov/19/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-us-china-climate-deal-means-c/

Study correct on Georgia's gender-based murder rate
","Anyone who follows the constant drum beat of crime news in metro Atlanta might not be surprised by a new study that puts Georgia among the most dangerous states for a very specific crime: women who are murdered by men. A Violence Policy Center report released in September shows Georgia ranks ninth among all states, with a homicide rate of 1.66 per 100,000 women in 2012, the last year data is available. The national rate is 1.16 per 100,000. ""We call on Georgia’s lawmakers to make it an urgent priority to keep guns away from domestic abusers and protect women from harm,"" Kathryn Grant, co-founder of GunSense Georgia said in a statement related to the study. ""This is literally a matter of life and death."" PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know if our state really ranks that high on the list for women murdered by men. We went straight to the website for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Supplementary Homicide Reports. That data showed Georgia had 102 homicides in 2012 – 19 percent more than the 84 tallied in the Violence Policy Center report. The VPC’s study has a lower overall number because it takes that data and then weeds out crimes with more than one victim or perpetrator, said VPC policy analyst Marty Langley, who authored the report. An analysis of the SHR data, available only in hard copy from the FBI, confirms those numbers are accurate for incidents where one woman is killed by one man. James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who has studied and analyzed such data for decades, said the adjustment oversimplifies the information. Taking a more narrow slice of victims also allows for further analysis of their characteristics such as age (the victim in Georgia was 38) and race (51 were black and 30 were white in Georgia). And for homicides where the data could be found, 69 percent of victims were killed with guns and 93 percent of them were murdered by someone they knew, the study found. ""An overarching point we want to make with this study is that it’s a myth that a woman’s risk of homicide comes from being attacked by a stranger,"" said Kristen Rand, the group’s legislative director. ""The risk of stranger homicide is really quite low."" But missing from the report is another key fact: the risk of homicide in Georgia is among the highest for any victims. It’s easier to see in lists:   Rank State   2012 Homicide Rate per 100,000,  Females Murdered by Males 1 Alaska 2.57 2 South Carolina 2.06 3 Oklahoma 2.03 4 Louisiana 1.92 5 Mississippi 1.89 6 Nevada 1.83 7 Missouri 1.73 8 Arizona 1.70 9 Georgia 1.66 10 Tennessee 1.60 (Source: Violence Policy Center)   Rank State 2012 Homicide Rate  per 100,000, Overall 1 Louisiana 10.8 2 Mississippi 7.4 3 Alabama 7.1 4 Michigan 7.0 5 South Carolina 6.9 6 Missouri 6.5 7 Maryland 6.3 8 Delaware 6.2 9 Tennessee 6.0 10 (tie) Arkansas, Georgia 5.9 (Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics)   Southern states such as Georgia dominate both lists, Fox said, because of factors beyond gender. Gun ownership rates are higher here. The South also has a long history of  people solving personal conflicts with violence versus lawsuits, Fox said. And, he added, the region is also more diverse than much of the country, and murder rates by and against blacks are higher than those among whites. ""The fact that most of the states on (the VPC) list are in the south is not so much an issue of male-female violence,"" Fox said. ""It’s about homicide, generally."" In summary, the data bears out the study’s findings that rank Georgia ninth in the nation for the rate of women killed by men. One caveat is that tally counts only single victims and perpetrators. It ignores some crimes it hopes to draw attention to, such as a former partner killing a woman before committing suicide or a man killing his ex-partner and a new love interest, if there are two victims. More importantly, the tally also fails to acknowledge Georgia’s dismal rank for the risk of homicide overall, and the other factors that contribute to it. The numbers are right, but it’s also true that there is more to the story. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BEFA80>],/factchecks/2014/nov/19/violence-policy-center/study-correct-georgias-gender-based-murder-rate/

Conservative talker Dana Loesch says 4.7 million people lack health insurance due to Obamacare
","Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch gamely agreed to debate Obamacare last week with liberal pundit Ed Schultz on Schultz’s program on MSNBC. Unfortunately, what emerged was the verbal equivalent of mixed martial arts as one would interrupt the other, and the preferred rhetorical device seemed to be talking louder and louder. (We also checked Schultz's claim about 10.3 million people benefiting from Obamacare.) In the course of the melee, Loesch delivered a salient criticism about the Affordable Care Act. ""4.7 million people have lost their insurance in 32 states,"" Loesch said. We reached out to Loesch to find the source of that claim and did not hear back. However, it matches a list compiled by the Associated Press in December 2013. It represents a tally from AP staffers and calculates a low-end figure of how many Americans received insurance cancellation notifications. (Not every state was able to provide a figure, hence Loesch isolating on 32 states.) You likely remember stories about the cancellation notices, which were the result of individual insurance plans not meeting the minimum standards of the new health care law. PolitiFact’s 2013 Lie of the Year was a claim by President Barack Obama that ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" Since that chaotic time, however, some clearer data has emerged. While the AP said that millions of people had received cancellation letters, there are reasons to doubt the numbers in certain states. For example, the list said 333,000 notices went out to Blue Cross/Blue Shield customers in Florida. But as reported by PolitiFact Florida, a company spokesman said it mailed only 44,000 cancellations letters. The AP said 290,000 cancellations letters were sent in Washington state. A few weeks later, the state’s insurance commissioner called that ""inaccurate."" Analysts at the Urban Institute explored the discrepancies in a survey conducted the same month as the AP published its list. When they asked people with individual insurance, they found that about 20 percent said the plan they had in 2013 would no longer be offered. Based on this survey, the analysts estimated that about 2.6 million people had lost their existing plans due to the minimum standards set by Obamacare. But the institute analysts also noted that a great deal of churning always takes place in the individual market. They found that less than 20 percent of the customers ever kept a plan for more than two years. This fits with the experience of another health care researcher, Christine Eibner with the RAND Corporation. ""It appears that the number of people that lost coverage from 2013 to 2014 is similar or less than the number of people who lost coverage in previous years,"" Eibner told PunditFact. So, while the Affordable Care Act’s standards played a role, some people would have changed, dropped or altered coverage anyway.  Moreover, the AP figure fails to factor in that due to the outcry in November 2013, Obama gave states the option to allow people to keep their existing plans, if insurers agreed.  In Florida, the 44,000 people who did get a cancellation letter later received a second one that said they could keep those policies for another year, if they wanted. In fact, the key problem with Loesch’s statement is that she said these people ""have lost their insurance,"" as if none of them replaced one plan with another. A study published by RAND in April 2014 painted a very different picture. Of an estimated 9.4 million people with individual insurance, fewer than 1 million ended up without any coverage at all. Over half of the original group bought another policy in the individual market. About 2 million took coverage offered through an employer, and a bit under a million found a plan through one of the government’s online insurance marketplaces. Finally, we should note that while some people have lost insurance since most of the main elements of Obamacare took effect, the net impact has been a boost in the ranks of the insured. An estimated 10.3 million more people have insurance today than did right before October 2013. Our ruling Loesch said that 4.7 million people have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare. That number matches one cited by the Associated Press based on preliminary estimates and incomplete data. The best estimate from independent researchers is that perhaps 2.6 million people received notices that their health care insurance policies were being canceled.  However, Loesch spoke as if these people, whatever their number, did not find replacement coverage. In reality, fewer than 1 million people who had been part of the individual insurance market ended up with no coverage at all. Given the constant churn in that market, it is unlikely that the Affordable Care Act caused all of them to be without health insurance. Loesch’s number is off, both in terms of the cancellations and what people did afterward. Still, the new law did hurt some people. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0F5280>],/factchecks/2014/nov/18/dana-loesch/conservative-talker-loesch-says-47-million-people-/

Ed Schultz: 10.3 million people would lose insurance with Obamacare repeal
","The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is back in the news as the 2015 open enrollment season gets underway. So far, unlike last year, the roll-out has been smooth. This hasn’t made Republicans a whit more fond of the law. Many want to repeal and replace it. Just before sign-ups began, liberal pundit and MSNBC show host Ed Schultz challenged Republicans to make good on that line. Schultz said he’s yet to see a fully fleshed out GOP alternative. Several bills spell out key elements of a Republican approach, but their full scope and impact remain unclear. Schultz zeroed in on this lack of precision. ""The Republican agenda seems to want to reverse everything on health care,"" Schultz said on Nov. 13, 2014. ""This is what (Sen. Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell wants to repeal. 10 million people. 10.3 uninsured Americans have received coverage since Oct. 1, 2013. That's a hard number that can be verified."" Schultz picked Oct. 1, 2013, because that was the day the federal health insurance exchange opened (as best it could) for business. Would, as Schultz said, repeal of the Affordable Care Act take away the health coverage gained by 10.3 million people? The baseline numbers suggest Schultz is correct. Between October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million nonelderly adults gained health insurance coverage. It’s possible that this number has grown since the data cut off in June 2014. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that, through June, 10.3 million adults gained health insurance coverage. Also through June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated the number at 9.5 million. And over the same period, the Urban Institute offered an estimate of 8 million. An earlier study -- through March -- by the RAND Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance. These are net figures, meaning they include people who may have lost insurance. While there is some fluctuation, they largely support Schultz’s claim. The more difficult question to answer is, does the Affordable Care Act deserve all the credit? There are generally three ways people were added to the rolls of the insured since October 2013 -- through an employer, through Medicaid or through federal or state marketplaces. There are scenarios in each category whereby people gaining insurance could see their health care taken away if Obamacare is repealed, and there are scenarios where their health care would remain. Insurance through an employer The RAND survey — which will soon be updated — estimated that millions of newly insured Americans got coverage through an employer (Employer-sponsored insurance or ESI). Why? Partly because of the Affordable Care Act, and partly because the economy is improving and more people are finding work. ""Enrollment in ESI increased by 8.2 million,"" the RAND analysts wrote, ""Most of this increase was driven by people who were previously uninsured. Some of these newly insured individuals may have taken up an employer plan as a result of the incentive created by the individual mandate; others may have newly found a job."" Since employer coverage provides most of the insurance in America, and unemployment dropped during this period, at least a portion of the newly insured would have gained coverage without Obamacare. However, the lead author of the New England Journal of Medicine article, Benjamin Sommers at the Harvard School of Public Health, said his analysis aimed to factor out the employment impact. ""As best as we could do, without a true ‘control group,’ we were trying to estimate the changes in the uninsured rate attributable to the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period,"" Sommers said. Sommers said even allowing for job growth, at least 10.3 million people gained coverage due solely to Obamacare. Insurance through Medicaid The RAND study also teased out that 3.6 million people relied on Medicaid to get out of the ranks of the uninsured. A major goal of the Affordable Care Act was to expand Medicaid by raising the income eligibility cut-off line to 138 percent of federal poverty. According to an analysis from the Urban Institute, virtually all of the higher Medicaid enrollment took place in the 24 states plus the District of Columbia that chose to expand Medicaid. Still, some portion of new Medicaid enrollees would have qualified under the previous terms. How big a portion is unclear, although Medicaid rolls increased by 5 percent even in states that did not raise the income limits. Insurance through marketplaces Lastly, the law created federal and state insurance marketplaces where people could pick and choose among private insurance plans. The RAND survey estimated that 1.4 million uninsured people wound up buying insurance this way. The total number is about 4 million, but that includes people who had insurance before. RAND economist Christine Eibner said the premium subsidies available through the marketplaces have helped millions of people. ""If the ACA were repealed many would lose access to subsidies or Medicaid coverage, and could no longer afford insurance,"" Eibner said. However, it’s not entirely clear if all of the 1.4 million uninsured people who purchased insurance wanted it in the first place. Some might have purchased insurance simply because it was required as part of the health care law. In that sense, it’s hard to say their insurance would be taken away if the health care law were repealed. Other cases of people getting covered The full impact of Obamacare goes beyond the marketplaces and Medicaid expansion, so the total number could be higher still. In 2012, the law gave parents the option to keep their kids on their health insurance policies until they turned 26. About 2.5 million to 3 million people had taken advantage of the change. However, some of those would have had coverage even without the new policy. Both Eibner and Sommers, who is a part-time advisor to the Health and Human Services Department, said all told, they believe at least 10.3 million people owe their coverage to Obamacare. It's hard to get a definitive number, but the estimates we find put Schultz in the ballpark. Our ruling Schultz said repealing the Affordable Care Act would take away insurance coverage of about 10.3 million people. Based on multiple independent sources, the combination of the individual mandate, insurance subsidies through the insurance marketplaces, Medicaid expansion and raising the eligibility age for dependents delivers a total that is in the neighborhood of what Schultz said. But there is a bit of uncertainty in all of the numbers, and Schultz’s suggestion that health care would be ""taken away"" for everyone is a tad strong. With those caveats, we rate his claim Mostly True. Correction: A previous version of this story described Sen. Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader.

Obama: U.S. has put more people 'back to work' than all other advanced economies combined
","By key measures, America’s labor market has crept back to pre-recession levels, leading President Barack Obama to repeat a talking point in recent days -- that the American economy has outperformed that of other advanced countries. On Nov. 16, 2014, Obama spoke with reporters in Brisbane, Australia, following the ninth G20 summit -- a gathering of leaders from 20 of the world’s major economies. The G20 summit followed a high-profile tour to meet leaders of major Asian countries. Obama said the gatherings ""came against the backdrop of America’s renewed economic strength."" ""The United States is in the longest stretch of uninterrupted private-sector job growth in its history,"" he said. ""Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined."" We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that ""we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office."" The new version Obama offered at the G20 summit was slightly better, since it uses a more flexible time frame -- ""over the last few years"" -- rather than the more specific ""since I came into office."" If you start counting the day he came into office -- a period when the United States economy was still several months away from hitting rock bottom -- the statement is incorrect. At the G20, Obama changed his language from ""created more jobs"" to ""we’ve put more people back to work."" This makes it sound as if the specific people put out of work by the recession (or at least, the general types of people who lost their jobs in the recession) are now working again. It would seem like the evidence for this is equivocal at best. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? First, we’ll recap what we found out about job creation in advanced economies in our previous fact-check, using International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as ""advanced economies"" and seven of those as ""major advanced economies."" We looked at total average annual employment from 2009 -- Obama’s first year in office -- through 2014. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or group 2009 employment 2014 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.9 million 145.9 million 5.98 million 4.27 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.5 million 332.8 million 6.28 million 1.92 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.1 million 200.8 million 4.72 million 2.41 percent (For the full data, check out this Google spreadsheet.) According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by just shy of 6 million people. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the figure at about 5.7 million.) Obama had said this number was more than all advanced economies combined, but that’s not the case -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 6.28 million. That does make it fairly close, and it’s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it’s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations.   Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States’ percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on this list, including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The country with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of more than 18 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is close, but not exact. What about if you change the wording to putting ""more people back to work,"" as Obama said? To support its claim, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren’t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis ""finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half—or 7.5 million—are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million)."" The White House said it’s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share ""vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million)."" However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn’t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people ""back to work,"" as Obama said. It’s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama’s claim. On the question of putting people back to work, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009.  Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office.  If these two data points sound paradoxical, they’re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com’s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that ""the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat."" This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that ""we’ve put more people back to work"" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. ""Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?"" Sinclair said. ""This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph.""   Our ruling Obama said, ""Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined."" From publicly available data, we know that since 2009, the United States has created roughly the same number of jobs as the 35 other advanced economies combined, and more than the other six biggest economies. However, it’s not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting ""more people back to work,"" as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs. On balance, we rate Obama's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096A82800>],/factchecks/2014/nov/18/barack-obama/obama-us-has-put-more-people-back-work-all-other-a/
"['Georgia', 'Gas Prices', 'Taxes', 'Edward Lindsey']","
Gas tax comparison not so simple
","Transportation trumped all other issues in a recent survey of the 10-county Atlanta region. Some lawmakers float the idea of hiking the state’s gasoline tax almost annually, but now leaders under the Gold Dome have signaled they may consider the move to tackle some of the traffic woes in the region and state. But the political will to increase one tax may hinge on the ability to lower, or eliminate, another. Specifically, former state Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta, said the state may need to revoke local governments’ ability to levy sales taxes for nontransportation services such as education. ""The following two statements are both true: We have one of the lowest taxes on gasoline for transportation purposes in the country,"" he said. ""And we have some of the highest taxes on gasoline in the Southeast."" How can that be? We decided to check it out. First breaking the claim into two pieces, does Georgia have one of the nation’s lowest gas taxes? Yes, according to state motor fuel tax data from the Federation of Tax Administrators. Georgians pay $19.3 cents in state taxes for every gallon of gasoline. That includes a 7.5-cent excise tax – or a special fixed tax paid on the purchase of specific items such as gasoline, alcohol and tobacco products. The rest comes from a 4 percent sales tax the state levies on gasoline. As of January, that 4 percent sales tax translated into 11.8 cents. Only 14 states had lower state tax rates, including both excise and state sales taxes. Three of them are our neighbors: South Carolina (16.75 cents per gallon), Florida (17.1 cents) and Alabama (18 cents). Motorists in our other two neighboring states paid more, 37.75 cents in North Carolina and 21.4 cents in Tennessee. So far, so good. Georgia does in fact have some of the lowest taxes earmarked for transportation in the nation. But to Lindsey’s point, the state collections do not include the local sales taxes that drive up the cost at the pump but do not always end up fixing roads. That’s because Georgia state law allows all counties to levy a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST, for specific projects ranging from transportation to education. Voters must approve a SPLOST by referendum. Although some jurisdictions, such as Forsyth County, have successfully included road projects in their referendums, voters in metro Atlanta and some other regions in the state defeated a penny sales tax for transportation two years ago.  That is part of what has left roads, bridges and rails without enough money for repairs and growth – and why a study committee of politicians and business leaders is slated to recommend a new proposal by year’s end. Lindsey, who serves on that committee, unofficially known as the Plan B Committee, said he hopes drawing attention to the local sales taxes will show the state should wean local governments off those funds while simultaneously increasing the state collections, specifically for transportation projects. ""When we put a tax or a fee on gasoline, the average voter probably thinks those taxes are going to transportation and they’re not,"" Lindsey said. But are Georgians really paying some of the highest gas taxes in the region – and could therefore afford such a shift? That’s where the numbers get tricky. An October breakdown of motor fuel taxes by the American Petroleum Institute -- including fees and local taxes -- pushes what Georgians pay to 27.49 cents per gallon. Those local taxes and fees have a dramatic effect in Florida, as anyone who has trundled down to Disney World can attest. The API shows motorists there pay a state average of 36.02 cents per gallon. North Carolina motorists pay even more, 36.75 cents per gallon, according to the API data (although less than what the Federation of Tax Administrators’ data show). Wes Clarke, a senior associate at the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia, co-wrote a 2010 study that showed Georgia had one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation, The API data, he said, show that Georgia still ranks third-highest of its neighbors (and all other Southern states, except Kentucky) when it comes to gas taxes. The ranking is misleading, though. Based on the API data, Georgia could increase its gas tax by 8 cents a gallon – more than doubling the current excise tax – and remain in third. In fact, the Fiscal Research Center in 2010 recommended a somewhat smaller increase to the excise tax – a penny a year for six years – to help solve Georgia’s transportation woes. That would bring Georgia up to the national average on excise taxes, without changing its ranking among neighboring states, said Peter Bluestone, a senior research associate at the Fiscal Research Center. That would result in less than a 0.3 percent increase at the gas station. ""Even if you add in the local taxes, we’re in the middle,"" Bluestone said. ""We do recommend an increase that would keep us there."" So that means Lindsey is right in saying that Georgia has one of the lowest state tax rates in the nation. Other data show that, factoring in local taxes, Georgians still pay the third-most in the region when it comes to filling up at the pump. Lindsey errs in thinking a third-place ranking means the state is on par with the top two, which are among the highest in the nation. He undercuts his larger point about local gas taxes by ignoring Georgia falling a distant third in the region on what motorists pay for gasoline. But looking at rankings alone, Georgians do pay among the highest at the pump for the region but the lowest in the nation. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972BCE40>],/factchecks/2014/nov/18/ed-lindsey/gas-tax-comparison-mostly-target/

Social media post says Barack Obama-backed bill will offer free cars to welfare recipients
","Does the ""welfare queen"" now have a new car and gas card to go along with her trusty Obama phone? A recent claim circulating on the Internet says she does. A reader recently sent us a November American News article that says welfare recipients will be eligible for a free vehicle and receive a monthly $100 gas card beginning Jan. 15 under new legislation proposed by President Barack Obama. The article said: ""Recently, the White House announced a plan to offer free vehicles to welfare recipients. According to reports, the bill passed in a narrow vote. The program was initiated by President Barack Obama, and in many way mirrors what has become known as ‘The Obama Phone’, or the program through which welfare recipients can get free cell phone service. ""John Earnest announced the program launch, stating ‘The free automobile program gives low-income Americans the opportunity to take ownership of a vehicle at no cost, and will also include a monthly gas card for $100.’ ""Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that this passing will be the downfall of President Obama. "" ‘This absurd plan that the democrats have conjured up is beyond belief. I have no idea how or why congress passed this,’ McConnell stated."" The story earned more than 80,000 Facebook likes by Nov. 17, but here’s the deal: It's not accurate. There was no such bill proposed by the Obama administration, and Congress did not pass any such measure. The White House spokesman is Josh Earnest, not John Earnest. (The premise is also kind of amusing -- Congress hasn’t been in the habit of passing Obama initiatives for some time now, whether by a ""narrow"" margin or not.) Rather, the claim originated at an acknowledged fake-news site. First, let’s dispense with the old claim about ""Obama phones."" This claim is, at best, greatly exaggerated. We’ve checked various versions and found that their accuracy rated from Mostly False to False to Pants on Fire. As for the idea that the federal government has established a welfare program involving no-cost gas cards and cars for low-income Americans -- well, this is pure fiction. The story was originally posted on Empire News in August. Empire News offers a disclaimer on its About page: ""Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.""

Some of the site’s other posts have headlines like ""New Hollywood Trend Has Celebrities Getting Baby Pig Semen Injections To Look Younger"" and ""Kanye West Insists On Nobel Prize, Claims He ‘Brings Peace’ Everywhere He Goes."" The fact checkers at Snopes.com busted the claim earlier this fall. The article then made its way to American News, a site that received a ""Pants on Fire!"" last week for a claim that ""death panels"" under the Affordable Care Act had recently executed their first patient. American News offers a mixture of ads and has no information about the site or who runs it. But it includes many fake, yet often nominally believable, articles ripped from other sources that attract clicks from social media users and, presumably, Web revenue for American News.

"['Economy', 'Military', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says military makes up nearly 10 percent of Florida's economy
","
Gov.-elect Rick Scott kicked off a five-day, 10-city tour of the state's major industries on Dec. 6, 2010, by meeting with defense contractors and Florida-based military leaders.

Scott started the tour in the Panhandle, meeting with about 20 defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, L-3 Communications and InDyne Corp., at the University of Florida Research and Engineering Education Facility in Shalimar, before meeting with military leaders at Eglin Air Force Base.

""We want to make sure we're always thought of as a very military-friendly state,"" Scott said to reporters at a brief press conference. ""We're going to focus on what our strengths are. We're clearly a logical place for the military to expand and for the defense industry to expand. We've got a lot of talent in the state, we like the defense industry and the military, so we're going to figure out where we have the most value.""

Scott tried to underscore the importance of the military to Florida by noting that the military accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's economy, according to the St. Petersburg Times.

Florida is home to 20 major military installations and three unified combatant commands. The Gulf of Mexico is a key training ground for both the Air Force and the Navy, and the state also has two U.S. Coast Guard air stations and another dozen other Coast Guard stations.

But does all of that translate to a 10 percent share of the state's gross domestic product, which was $737 billion in 2009?

The answer comes from an arm of Enterprise Florida called the Florida Defense Alliance, a public/private partnership created in 1998 to help position Florida to keep its military infrastructure in place and expand in other areas when opportunities arise. The group commissioned a study in 2008 to examine the economic impact of Florida's stationed military and auxiliary defense industry work.

The study was conducted by Rick Harper, an economist from the University of West Florida, who has studied the economic impact of the film and entertainment industry in Florida and who represented Northwest Florida on former Gov. Jeb Bush's Council of Economic Advisers from 2001-2006. Using 2005 data, Harper concluded that defense-related spending is responsible for $52 billion, or 7.5 percent, of Florida's gross state product that year.

The military spent $27 billion across Florida counties in fiscal year 2005, Harper concluded -- $10.4 billion was for goods and services, $12.4 billion for pensions and transfer payments, and $4.3 billion for salaries and wages. The rest of the economic impact is measured in indirect and induced spending, which would include parts of the private defense industry as well as parts of the Florida economy that help service the military, the defense industry and their employees.

Harper said that defense and military spending accounted for 732,300 direct and indirect jobs in the state and generated state and local tax revenues of nearly $1 billion.

Counties with larger installations enjoy larger impacts, Harper found. Military and defense spending in Duval County had a $12.1 billion impact, a $5.3 billion impact in Hillsborough County and a $6.6 billion impact in Okaloosa County. All but six counties have at least $3 million per year in direct defense-related spending.

Harper and Florida Defense Alliance executive director Rocky McPherson noted that the study does not include the economic impact generated by the Florida National Guard or Coast Guard operations. You can see a short synopsis of the study for yourself here. Or if you have a lot of time, here's the three-volume version.

Harper's study relies on five-year-old data, so we wanted to see if there was anything more recent. McPherson said Harper and University of West Florida researchers were updating their study using 2008 data but, he said, that report is not available yet. Harper declined to share the results of the study with PolitiFact Florida, but did talk about the results in general terms.

Since 2005, Department of Defense ""spending has risen substantially, particularly in terms of procurement (i.e., contracting), as well as payments to disabled veterans, although active duty military staffing numbers (number of people) have declined somewhat and payments to retirees are not growing as they did earlier due to attrition of WWII and Korean era veterans,"" Harper wrote. ""The overall growth in military spending (the study to be released uses 2008 federal spending data), combined with weakness in other areas of the Florida economy in the most recent years, means that DoD (Department of Defense) spending will have risen as a share of the total economy.""

We searched around for other studies measuring the military's economic impact in Florida, but found none. In examining Harper's study, we found it to be a straightforward, unbiased report. Researchers relied on Department of Defense actual expenditures, precise personnel levels and actual government contracts.

Where does it leave us? Scott told reporters military spending makes up about 10 percent of the state's economy. In 2005, military spending accounted for 7.5 percent of the state gross domestic product, but that figure did not include the impact of the Florida National Guard or Coast Guard bases. The author of the study, who is now updating his report using 2008 numbers, said that while he cannot release more up-to-date numbers, that the military's position in the economy has risen since 2005. That will make Scott's point nearly right on. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973324C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-military-makes-nearly-10-percent-f/

Barack Obama says American public believes 'it's a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy'
","
In a Dec. 7, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama began the effort to sell a deal he struck with the Republican congressional leadership to extend the tax cuts initially passed under George W. Bush. 
Under the agreement, the tax cuts will be extended for two years for all income brackets, rather than just for families below $250,000 and individuals below $200,000 in taxable income, as Obama had vowed during the campaign and as many congressional Democrats have preferred. In exchange for a temporary extension of the cuts for wealthier Americans -- which Republicans wanted -- the GOP agreed to extend federal unemployment benefits and tax cuts passed under Obama that were also set to expire at the end of the year.

As expected, Obama faced tough questions from the assembled reporters about his decision to give in to the GOP demand to extend tax cuts for all Americans.

The first question, from  Associated Press reporter Ben Feller, was: ""You've been telling the American people all along that you oppose extending the tax cuts for the wealthier Americans. You said that again today. But what you never said was that you opposed the tax cuts, but you'd be willing to go ahead and extend them for a couple of years if the politics of the moment demand it. So what I'm wondering is, when you take a stand like you had, why should the American people believe that you're going to stick with it? Why should the American people believe that you're not going to flip-flop?""

Obama said, in part, that ""if there was not collateral damage -- if this was just a matter of my politics or being able to persuade the American people to my side -- then I would just stick to my guns, because the fact of the matter is the American people already agree with me. There are polls showing right now that the American people for the most part think it's a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy. 
""But the issue is not me persuading the American people -- they're already there. The issue is how do I persuade the Republicans in the Senate who are currently blocking that position. I have not been able to budge them, and I don't think there's any suggestion anybody in this room thinks realistically that we can budge them right now."" 
We were intrigued by Obama's argument that the American people were with him in their preferences on tax policy, since a few days earlier we had fact-checked a statement by incoming House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that was in some ways the mirror image of what Obama argued. 
Boehner, in comments to reporters on Dec. 1, said that ""the American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes...."" We gauged the accuracy of Boehner's claim by looking at four public opinion polls taken since the election that asked questions about what should be done with the Bush tax cuts.

We concluded that the polls showed that while many Americans opposed an across-the-board expiration of the Bush tax cuts, it was not accurate for Boehner to say that the public spoke ""pretty loudly"" that Congress should ""stop all the looming tax hikes."" In fact, we found that a plurality of the ""American people"" actually supported what amounts to a tax hike for the wealthiest Americans. So we rated Boehner's comment False. 
We'll add one new poll to the mix of those we used in the Boehner item. Here's the full data: 
CBS News, Nov. 29-Dec. 1, 2010 
The tax cuts should... 
Continue for all: 26 percent 
Continue for households below $250,000: 53 percent 
Expire for all: 14 percent 
USA Today/Gallup poll, Nov. 19-21, 2010 
What do you think Congress should do about the income tax cuts passed under George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of this year? 
Keep the tax cuts for all Americans regardless of income: 40 percent 
Keep the tax cuts, but set new limits on how much of wealthy Americans' income is eligible for the lower rates: 44 percent 
Allow the tax cuts to expire: 13 percent

A follow-up question clarified where Americans would draw that income line, using some widely discussed income thresholds. 
Keep tax cuts for all: 40 percent 
Keep tax cuts up to $1 million income: 5 percent 
Keep tax cuts up to $500,000 income: 12 percent 
Keep tax cuts up to $250,000 income: 26 percent 
Let tax cuts expire: 13 percent 
Associated Press-CNBC poll, Nov. 18-22, 2010 
The tax cuts that were passed in 2001 will expire this year if they are not continued. Which of the following best describes what you think Congress should do about the tax cuts? 
Continue the tax cuts for everyone: 34 percent 
Allow the tax cuts for people earning more than $250,000 to expire, but continue them for other people: 50 percent 
Allow the tax cuts to expire for everyone: 14 percent

NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Nov. 11-15, 2010

Congress will soon decide whether to keep in place the existing tax cuts enacted during President Bush’s time in office, or allow them to expire. Which one of the following options would be your preference for what they should do? 
Keep in place the tax cuts for everyone permanently: 23 percent 
Keep in place all the tax cuts for everyone for another year to three years: 23 percent 
Eliminate the tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 per year, but keep them for those earning less than that: 39 percent 
Eliminate all the tax cuts permanently: 10 percent

Quinnipiac poll, Nov. 8-15, 2010

How should Congress vote on the Bush-era tax cuts: continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, or let them expire for all? 
Continue for all: 35 percent 
Continue for those below $250,000: 43 percent 
Expire for all: 14 percent

How about if this was the choice on tax cuts; continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $500,000 a year, or let them expire for all? 
Continue for all: 33 percent 
Continue for those below $500,000: 40 percent 
Expire for all: 18 percent

So do those results support Obama’s claim? 
He said that the polls show that people ""for the most part think it’s a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy.""

The polls largely support Obama’s claim because they show that only a minority of people -- 23 to 40 percent -- favor extending the tax cuts to every income level.

There’s modest support for Obama’s point from poll respondents who wanted to see the tax cuts continue for those below a certain threshold but expire for those above that threshold. And those respondents ranged from 39 percent to 53 percent in the five polls.

So overall, the poll numbers support Obama’s general point, but they don’t fully justify his claim that ""the American people for the most part think it’s a bad idea."" Actually, in most of the polls just a plurality says that. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B8BF40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-american-public-believes-its-bad/

Bobby Scott says Republicans created $1 trillion prescription drug plan
","
As Congress approaches a deal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, Rep. Bobby Scott has taken the unpopular position of not only opposing the extensions for the wealthy, but for everyone.

Scott says allowing all cuts to expire would pare the deficit -- something he says the Republicans have been unwilling to do.

""Fiscal responsibility in the federal budget requires making tough choices,"" Scott wrote in a recent release. ""For the six years that the Republican Party held both chambers in Congress and the White House, they failed time and time again to make these tough choices. They enacted $1.3 trillion in tax cuts in 2001 and another $300 billion in 2003 without offsets. They created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it.""

That’s a smorgasbord of claims ripe for the checking, but we thought we’d look into the latter claim.

Scott’s office did not respond to a request for the source of the claim.

First, a definition: The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 -- better known as the Medicare Modernization Act -- created a new benefit called Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs.

Gauging its price is tricky. How do you measure the cost of something that will continue to accumulate over the years and and has no end date?

Brian Riedl, a federal budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, gave us a hint.

""Most people talk about costs in a 10-year period,"" he said. ""When the Congressional Budget Office scores a bill, they often will score the 10-year costs.""

OK, so we’ll look at the CBO’s Nov. 20, 2003 cost analysis of the program over its first decade, 2004 through 2013. It’s just shy of $400 billion.

That’s a long way from Scott’s $1 trillion.

What about a more recent estimate?

According to a fiscal 2011 analysis from the Office of Management and Budget, the cost of the program from 2011 to 2020 would be more than $950 billion, close enough to $1 trillion.

Is that a fair measure?

Well, better than the $400 billion from 2004-2013, says Riedl, noting that the program wasn’t fully implemented until 2006.

But he added that Scott could have been more clear in what period of time he measuring.

""I know as a budget geek what people mean, but I think a regular layman may think he means a trillion dollars a year,"" he said.   

But here’s the other thing Scott leaves out -- Democrats, led by Ted Kennedy, had pitched an even more expensive Medicare Part D plan scored by the CBO to cost $800 billion in its first 10 years, double the cost of the Republican plan. (Scott voted against the Republican plan when it came to the House floor.)

With a big budget surplus in 2000, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore pledged on the campaign trail to add prescription drugs to Medicare coverage.

""No one ever talked about how to pay for it,"" Riedl said. ""There was never any serious discussion on any side of offsets because at the time, that’s when we were supposed to have a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years.""

He added: ""Then the budget collapsed and now we’re in deep doo doo.""  

To review:

Scott says Republicans created a trillion dollar prescription drug entitlement program without paying for it.

The true cost of the program is unknown since it will continue to grow. In fact, the Government Accountability Office shows that the cost could exceed $7 trillion in 75 years.

If we use a 10-year cost measure, Scott would be wrong looking over the first decade of the program, which is estimated to cost shy of $500 billion.  But if we look at the cost over the next 10 years, Scott is close to correct based on current projections.

So we find the claim to be Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972AE940>],/factchecks/2010/dec/07/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-republicans-created-1-trillion-pr/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jim Doyle']","
Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle says it would be illegal to stop negotiating with unions as Scott Walker requested
","
The campaign to convince outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle and Democratic lawmakers to relinquish control of contract negotiations with state employee unions to Governor-elect Scott Walker has been marked by plenty of political maneuvering.

But Doyle recently said it’s all about the law, not politics.

Soon after winning the Nov. 2, 2010 election, Walker sent Doyle’s administration a letterasking to suspend the negotiations, citing state budget troubles. Walker takes office Jan. 3. At a Marquette University Law School appearance Nov. 30, 2010,  journalist Mike Gousha asked Doyle why he hadn’t stopped.

Said Doyle: ""It’s illegal for a state to say we’re simply going to cut off negotiations. There’s a legal requirement that you are involved in good faith bargaining.""

Doyle’s declaration elicited howls of protest from his critics, and a spirited defense from his supporters. We wondered: Is it all as cut and dried as Doyle described it?

We asked Doyle’s office for support for his claim -- and were directed right back to the session with Gousha, a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University.

Doyle, a lawyer and former state attorney general, did lay out his general reasoning in the interview: Refusal to bargain would be a violation of state labor law -- especially when unions had taken a renewed interest in accepting a concessions-laden two-year deal some 18 months after their last contract expired.

""A governor cannot say … I am walking away from the bargaining table,"" Doyle said in the interview. ""How would I say, ‘We’ve been offering you this package for the last 18 months and now we’re taking that package off the table; sorry, you can’t have it.’ ""

Doyle didn’t spell it out, but the union’s interest in finalizing the contracts apparently flared up as it became clear that Walker -- who campaigned on getting more concessions from state employees -- would succeed Doyle.

That political reality no doubt drove the union to action, a variety of public, private and academic officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Let’s hear from them.

But first, a word of warning: While Doyle asserted his statement as fact, the experts we consulted said getting at the truth of it is tough because the situation -- from the politics to the timing -- is unprecedented.

Then there’s that notoriously vague legal definition of ""good faith bargaining."" And the fact what was said at the bargaining table -- central to any potential legal ruling -- is private.

Let’s start with Walker’s initial Nov. 10 request that ""all contract negotiations be suspended."" As worded, that suggests a unilateral move on the part of the state, not a request to seek the consent of unions to hit the pause button.

Had that happened, it certainly would have prompted an unfair labor practices complaint, according to lawyers who represent labor unions.

Why the certainty? For one thing, walking away from negotiations would have been a rare -- and perhaps unprecedented -- move.

Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, said he knew of no instance where an employer or union has pulled out of talks since the implementation of the 1971 State Employment Labor Relations Act, which governs labor practices. Davis has worked at the commission since 1975.

Another thing is clear: All of our experts agreed a refusal to negotiate with a recognized collective bargaining unit -- the union -- is indeed an unfair labor practice under the state law.

The rub: What constitutes an unlawful ""refusal to negotiate?""

Would a seven-week delay -- from early November until after inauguration day -- fit that definition?

Answering that gets tricky.

Some lawyers say such a delay would stand a good chance of violating the law.

Perhaps most notable among them is David Vergeront, who was the chief legal counsel in the  Office of State Employment Relations for 13 years until he retired last summer. That state office negotiates state labor contracts.

Vergeront told us the union could make a ""very good"" case the delay was a refusal to bargain. But it would not be a ""slam dunk,"" he said.

Marquette University labor law expert Paul Secunda agreed. He said suspending talks would have left the state vulnerable -- although proving illegality is hard.

Marianne Robbins, another experienced attorney for labor unions, said Doyle would have violated good faith if he had walked.

""You’re the man right now,"" she said of Doyle. ""You’ve got the authority right now, and if you’re not willing to meet, then you don’t want to reach an agreement and you’re not bargaining in good faith.""

Attorneys who represent the management side see it differently.

Daniel Vliet and James Scott said a delay of a couple months would not have constituted a violation. Said Vliet: ""I think he could have stopped on this one.""

Lawyers on both sides agreed the state could walk away lawfully by citing an emergency change in circumstances. But the consensus was that it would have to be a major change.  

Examples they provided: In the private sector, a manufacturing plant burns down. In the public sector, a massive new financial problem is revealed.

Walker’s early November letter made only a general reference to ""the state’s fiscal condition."" He apparently meant the estimated $3 billion looming in the next two-year budget period, but did not say so explicitly.

Lawyers said the state would need to prove a deterioration in state finances in recent months to have a chance at justifying a halt to talks.

Top labor lawyers on both the union and management side said Davis -- the lawyer for the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, the state agency that rules on labor disputes -- was in the best position to address this scenario.

Since the commission could be asked to rule in the Doyle-Walker dispute, if it escalates, Davis could offer only a general thought: It would have been irresponsible for Doyle, given the spirit of the labor law, to tell union leaders he was just going to pass the baton to Walker.

""The fact there is new sheriff coming into town would likely not be a sufficient basis for saying ‘We’re stopping,’ "" Davis said. ""It would be akin to a governor saying, ‘I lost that election, but I’m going to Bora Bora for the next couple months.’ ""

Of course, irresponsible is different than the ""unlawful"" that Doyle asserted.

Another factor is what agreements were in place at the time.

Doyle spokesperson Adam Collins said at the point Walker made his request two state employee unions already had reached tentative deals -- and one of those deals already had been ratified by union members. Fifteen other unions were still in talks.

Any tentative deals in place would have been legally problematic to walk away from, our experts said.  

It is unclear whether Doyle received any legal advice that said a suspension of talks would be unlawful. Collins suggested that Doyle -- a former attorney general -- was perfectly capable of reading the law. They declined to provide anyone to PolitiFact Wisconsin who could add more details from inside the talks, such as the state labor negotiator or attorneys who directly advise him.

Finally, a bit of history.

In late 2002, Doyle’s predecessor, Republican Gov. Scott McCallum, negotiated a deal with a big state labor union right before leaving office.

Doyle cites that now as proof that deals have come together in the past under governors on the verge of leaving office.

In the 2002 case, McCallum and the lawmakers left it to the next Legislature and a just-sworn-in Doyle to handle the deals. Republicans objected to the substance of the contracts and a major fight broke out.

Such a scenario could play out again.

Or Doyle and the outgoing Democratic-controlled Legislature will rush to ratify the labor deals -- which Walker and Republicans could attempt to undo after Jan. 3.

That’s the politics part of all this. But let’s come back to the legal question:

In making his claim, Doyle asserts that it would be unlawful for him to suspend bargaining with the state’s labor unions. Experts generally say there is a good chance such a step would be considered a refusal to bargain but acknowledge the scenario is unprecedented. The state could stop negotiations in the face of an emergency, experts say, but the deficit may not qualify. It’s big, but that problem was looming for months -- and accounted for with deals that reportedly have no pay increases.

The Truth-O-Meter puts the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, the weight of the available evidence may tilt toward Doyle, but he offers few specifics -- on his own or from his lawyers -- to address the many points that would clarify things even further. And there was plenty of context missing in his flat assertion of unlawfulness.

We rate Doyle’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EB2C00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/07/jim-doyle/wisconsin-gov-jim-doyle-says-it-would-be-illegal-s/

Sen. Sherrod Brown disputes notion that unemployment benefits are similar to welfare
","
If you lose your job and it’s not your fault -- you didn’t steal, sell trade secrets or tell rude  customers what they could do with that hideous tie they want to return the hellish day after Christmas -- you can usually get unemployment benefits. Here’s how it works: The state of Ohio will help you out for 26 weeks. Then a federal program kicks in to cover 20 more weeks during times of high unemployment.

But in the recessionary doldrums of the last two years, Congress has given even more help -- up to 53 weeks more. That makes all these jobless benefits add up to 99 weeks.

The latest congressional extension, though, expired on Nov. 30, and Congress hasn’t decided whether to grant another one.

The money would have to come from the federal Treasury, which already borrows money to keep the government operating, and that’s the biggest hangup. Some lawmakers say they don’t want to keep adding to the deficit, so they’re insisting on offsets from other domestic programs.

Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is not in that camp, however. He says that people who get unemployment compensation tend to spend it right away on groceries or rent, so it has a stimulative effect. Many, but not all, economists agree. Regardless, Brown says that Congress needs to show some compassion, because so many Americans are struggling to find work.

""Understand, this is unemployment insurance,"" Brown told MSNBC anchor Contessa Brewer on Nov. 30. ""It’s not welfare, as a lot of my Republican colleagues like to suggest it is. You pay into it when you’re working. You get help when you’re not.""

Brown raises several points that we thought were worth checking. The key point: Do workers pay into the unemployment system and then draw benefits from it if they lose their jobs?

The unemployment system is a bit more complex than that. Workers don’t pay into the system. But their employers do, up to a point.

In Ohio, private employers pay anywhere from 0.5 percent to 9.4 percent of the first $9,000 of workers’ wages into the state uninsurance fund, according to the state’s Department of Job and Family Services. A company’s payroll size, its total contributions and its claims experience account for the variation. Generally, companies that lay off a lot of people have higher unemployment taxes.

There also is a federal unemployment compensation fee, but it comes to only 0.8 percent.

Back to Brown’s claim: ""You pay into it when you’re working."" As just mentioned, it’s actually the employer who pays into it.

Brown and his communications director said he is fully aware of this, but that employers regard their premiums as part of the cost of compensation, so in a figurative manner he was saying the same thing. Brown made that point again Dec. 1 in a conference call with reporters to discuss an unrelated matter and we asked him about paying for  unemployment compensation.

We checked with economists at the socially liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Regardless both agreed Brown is essentially right.

""That’s a cost of hiring workers, and that’s a reduction in the amount of money that they’re willing to pay in wages,"" said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at Heritage, said that economists believe 85 percent of the cost of these taxes on employers would otherwise fall back to the employees.

OK, so the employee pays the taxes indirectly. But that only covers the state portion of jobless benefits, or 26 weeks. Everything after that is coming from the federal government. ""It’s mostly deficit financing at this point,"" said Sherk.

Money from that first 20-week extension would ordinarily be split between the state and federal governments, but the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- better known as the stimulus act -- picked up the state’s portion.

One more component of Brown’s claim: that ""a lot of my Republican colleagues"" like to suggest that unemployment insurance is like welfare. This was an important part of the claim because it explains why he felt the need to clarify how the system is funded -- not by freeloaders but by workers who pay into the system. So we asked Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, to back up this part of the claim, too.

She sent us news stories and links to transcripts, newscasts and news releases in which lawmakers or candidates said that unemployment payments can encourage people to stay jobless (Senate candidate Sharon Angle, Sen.-elect Ron Johnson, Sen. Richard Burr and others); are a disincentive to seeking work (Sen. John Kyl), or, stated another way, pose the risk of creating hobos (Rep. Dean Heller of Nevada). Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah proposed that people receiving federal benefits, including jobless benefits, be tested for drugs.

Far be it from us to analyze the behavior of all people who are out of work or say whether they’d rather collect benefits -- which average about $300 a week -- than get a job. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Federal Reserve Bank estimates that the receipt of unemployment benefits explains only 0.4 to 1.7 percentage points of the unemployment rate, which nationally is 9.8 percent. In other words, most people would rather work.

So let’s break down Brown’s claim and our fact-finding. 
This entire discussion needs a caveat. MSNBC put Brown on the air because of the ongoing debate over extending federal jobless benefits. The reason for debate is the fact that the federal government has to pick up the tab and it will have to borrow more to do so, at least in the short term. To put matters clearly: You pay into the unemployment compensation through your employer, and that pool of money pays for your state benefits -- but not your federal benefits -- if you lose your job.

We could use the averages from the three pieces to Brown’s claim -- Half True (but unmeasurable), Mostly True and True -- and arrive at a rating of Mostly True. Or we could turn to the principles of the Truth-o-Meter. According to those principles, a statement is Mostly True if it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Either way you slice it, we arrive at the same place: Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DED480>],/factchecks/2010/dec/07/sherrod-brown/brown-says-congress-needs-show-compassion-and-exte/
"['Georgia', 'Crime', 'CQ Press City Crime Rankings, 2010-2011']","
Atlanta ranks 25th in crime ranking
","
Atlanta may be the city too busy to hate. But for crime, we make time. 

The city ranks 25th of 400 cities in what's widely described as the annual ""Most Dangerous Cities"" list. St. Louis is No. 1. 

Last year, Atlanta was 18th. So while we still rate among high-crime cities such as Detroit and Baltimore, we're safer than we used to be. 

Or are we? In terms of crime, is Atlanta's really getting better? And was it that bad to begin with?

We looked at the same 2009 FBI data used by the crime ranking. These numbers predate high-profile attacks in the Virginia-Highland neighborhood and elsewhere in recent weeks.  

Violent crimes reported to or uncovered by Atlanta police dropped from about 14 percent between 2008 and 2009. Property crime fell by about 12 percent. Crime is dropping nationally, too, but more slowly, the data said.

The problem is this: The FBI warns against ranking cities. Doing so leads to ""simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents,"" its website says.

CQ Press' list has been at the center of the ranking controversy.

Until recent years, Morgan Quitno Press, a small Lawrence, Kan., publisher, released the ranking along with a thick book of crime statistics. The publisher called it the ""Most Dangerous Cities"" list.

Although there's little consensus among criminologists on how to compare crime between cities, leaders of the American Society of Criminology agreed on this: The ranking deserved condemnation.

The group passed a resolution in 2007 that called it ""invalid, damaging, and irresponsible.""

""They fail to account for the many conditions affecting crime rates, the mismeasurement of crime, large community differences in crime within cities, and the factors affecting individuals' crime risk,"" it read.

What's worse, Morgan Quitno kept its methodology secret. Criminologists had no way of verifying or analyzing the results.

That same year, CQ Press, which is known for printing authoritative material on government and policy, bought Morgan Quitno. It responded to criticism by making big changes, including hiring Rachel Boba, a Florida Atlantic University criminologist.

CQ dumped the ranking's ""Most Dangerous Cities"" name. It also revealed its methodology.

A city's crime score is based on murders, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor vehicle thefts reported in cities with populations of 75,000 or more.

CQ computes the differences between city and national crime rates for each offense, then basically adds them together to determine a city's score.

A higher score means higher crime. This year, Atlanta's score is 168.53. First-place St. Louis scored 381.62.

Although this is a very basic type of analysis, it can be useful, Boba said. Since it compares city rates with the national average, it can help agencies flag issues that need further scrutiny.

When combined with other statistics in the 388-page book, the rankings are also a useful entry point for people who want a snapshot of a city's crime, she said. 

But these numbers need to be used very carefully, Boba stressed.

The ranking's old name was incorrect. It does not show whether a city is ""safe"" or ""dangerous,"" she said, or that a resident of one city would be safer if he moved elsewhere.

A person's risk of becoming a victim often depends on whether he frequents high-crime neighborhoods and how he spends his time, Boba said.

Richard Rosenfeld, former head of the American Society of Criminology and a professor with the University of Missouri-St. Louis, goes further. Some city streets are as safe as suburban ones, and what city you're in has little to do with whether you become a crime victim.

""You learn next to nothing of a person's risk for becoming a victim of crime by what city they're in,"" Rosenfeld said.

Although the book addresses this issue, the news release for the 2010 ranking does not expressly discuss the reason for the name change or warn media against calling the ranking the ""Most Dangerous Cities"" list.

CQ's ranking also does not say why crime is higher or lower from one community to the next. Those issues are ""beyond the scope of this book,"" as Boba wrote in its introduction.

Plus, cities with different rankings may have very similar crime rates. Atlanta would have dropped off the Top 25 entirely if its score were just four points lower.

The list has other limitations.

We discussed CQ's methodology with Rosenfeld and Georgia State University professor Robert R. Friedmann, who studies ways to improve crime statistics.

Friedmann, who has been critical of rankings, said that CQ's general approach has been around for some time. 

It's not invalid, but specialists are dissatisfied with it. The CQ rankings report is often misused or misconstrued and does not tell a city what it needs to do to lower crime.

""I cannot say what they say is true or not true,"" Friedmann said. ""The question is whether what they do is meaningful.""

The ranking weighs auto theft equally with homicide, Rosenfeld notes.

Also, many cities would fare much better or worse if their boundaries included larger or more representative portions of the metro area. 

Rosenfeld and Friedmann issue their own ranking, which adjusts a city's homicide rate for socioeconomic factors such as age, the number of single-mother heads of household and poverty rate that are common in neighborhoods with high crime.

Their ranking shows whether a city's homicide rate matches expectations and tells policy-makers what social problems they need to tackle to help prevent violence. 

To sum up:

CQ's analysis is neither invalid nor incorrect. Using its math, Atlanta does rank as 25th among cities with the highest scores for crime rate.

But as one of its authors acknowledges, the number does not mean Atlanta's residents are in more danger than those in other cities. She and other experts emphasize that a person's safety is more dependent on his lifestyle and what neighborhoods he frequents than the city he's in.

Although the list's name was changed, the book addresses this point while its news release did not. And the message has not stuck with the public.

Because the news release does not tackle the list's misuse head on, we conclude the statement meets AJC PolitiFact Georgia's definition of Half True. It was accurate but left out important details or took things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x000002809733AB00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/07/cq-press-city-crime-rankings-2010-2011/atlanta-ranks-25th-crime-ranking/

Vern Buchanan says illegal immigration costs Florida taxpayers $4 billion a year
","
Sarasota-area congressman Vern Buchanan, a Republican who many think could run for the Senate in 2012, released a video Dec. 2, 2010, arguing against the DREAM Act -- a controversial piece of immigration legislation that would create a path to citizenship for youths brought to the United States illegally.

The minute-long video included some sobering figures on the cost of illegal immigration to Florida taxpayers.

""In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion. This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida,"" Buchanan said. ""Incredibly, some in Congress are still trying to pass a law to grant amnesty. The so-called DREAM Act would grant amnesty to as many as 2 million illegal immigrants. Amnesty rewards people who break our laws and encourages more illegal immigration.""

PolitiFact just recently ruled False the claim that the DREAM Act would grant amnesty to as many as 2 million illegal immigrants, noting that the 2 million figure is the number of people who would be potentially eligible for citizenship. It's also a matter of debate whether the path to citizenship can be called amnesty. You can read that analysis here.

The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or enlist in the military. There are currently several versions of the DREAM Act kicking around in Congress, but under the version introduced in March 2009, people under 35 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and have lived here at least the last five years would be able to apply for legal permanent resident status on a conditional basis if they have obtained a U.S. high school diploma or GED. That conditional status would be upgraded to permanent after six years if they successfully complete at least two years of college or military service and if they maintain ""good moral character.""

In this item, we wanted to check Buchanan's figures on the cost to taxpayers.

Buchanan's press secretary, Sally Tibbetts, said the number comes from a 2009 study by the group the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). It is a group that opposes the DREAM Act and advocates against congressional action that includes amnesty for illegal immigrants, or a path to citizenship. The group also wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States.

The FAIR study examined projected government spending on education, health and incarceration for illegal immigrants and found that illegal immigrants cost Florida taxpayers $3.8 billion.

To determine the ""cost"" of illegal immigration to Florida, FAIR identified the average cost of government services according to, in many instances, other private studies, and then multiplied those figures by the number of illegal immigrants in the population.

One of the problems with that kind of analysis, however, is that there's no official number of illegal immigrants living in Florida (illegal immigrants being a group that aren't exactly eager to raise their hands and be counted, after all). For example, FAIR ranked Florida's illegal immigration population fourth in the nation, with an estimated 950,000 immigrants in 2008. In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security ranks Florida third in the nation, with 720,000 illegal immigrants in 2009.

But that's not the only problem.

The FAIR report tries to identify spending on illegal immigrants in three different areas -- education, health care and incarceration.

Of the $3.8 billion estimate, the lion's share -- $3.4 billion -- is spent on education.

FAIR uses estimate after estimate to create a ""fact."" The group used its estimate of the illegal immigrant population in Florida to craft an estimate of illegal immigrant school-aged children -- a number they peg at about 146,000. Then, they use another estimate, a per-pupil figure from the National Center for Education Statistics of $8,234, to say that K-12 illegal immigrant children cost Florida taxpayers ""at least $1.2 billion per year.""

Then, they create another estimate for the sons and daughters of illegal immigrants who were born in the United States -- and thus are American citizens. That number, they say, is 204,000. Add the cost for them in (an estimate) and you get an additional $1.7 billion in cost per year, or $2.9 billion combined.

We admit, we can't offer you better estimates for the number of illegal immigrant schoolchildren or the number of legal sons and daughters of illegal immigrants -- because those numbers don't exist. But we can tell you, for instance, that the Florida Department of Education says its per pupil spending is $6,871, not $8,234. And if you use the state number, and not the one from the National Center for Education Statistics, the total cost is $2.4 billion not $2.9 billion.

That's $500 million saved by using a different, and at least as reputable figure -- without even dealing with the other estimates, mind you.

The remaining education funding, about $566 million FAIR figures, comes from teaching English language instruction for non-native English speakers. FAIR estimates that 80 percent of all children in English language training, a number they estimate to be around 250,000, are the children of illegal immigrants. They multiply that number by another estimate -- they say the amount of additional cost for these students is $2,264 -- to reach a taxpayer cost of $566 million. More estimates on top of estimates.

FAIR bases its health care costs on a 2002 Florida Hospital Association survey that found unreimbursed emergency medical care for illegal immigrants topped $40 million. But the survey includes responses from private hospitals that are not funded by the state. So the cost to taxpayers is overestimated.

And FAIR produces the state's incarceration costs for illegal immigrants based on the state Department of Corrections' ""illegal alien"" count of inmates. However, no such count exists. Instead, the state keeps tabs on all inmates who are not U.S. citizens, whether they're in the country legally or illegally. While many of those inmates are eventually released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further immigration processing, including possible deportation, the state does not track whether its inmates are legal U.S. residents. (We covered some of this ground already in a fact check from June about this same FAIR study).

""I would take FAIR's numbers with a big shaker of salt,"" said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. ""The organization exists to portray immigrants in a bad light.""

One of the easiest ways to see just how malleable the numbers are is to look at FAIR's 2010 state-by-state report. In 2010, FAIR said illegal immigrants cost Florida taxpayers almost $5.5 billion -- that's about a $1.7 billion or 44 percent increase in a year.

Nothing that we've discussed, for the record, accounts for the money illegal immigrants pay in state sales taxes and federal income taxes. All people are required to pay state sales taxes. And while some illegal immigrants are paid cash under the table, many are paid by payroll check just like everyone else. Recent estimates suggest illegal workers are now paying $9 billion to $12 billion a year into Social Security through payroll taxes, for instance, with no legal way to get that money back in retirement benefits. (Illegal immigrants provide faked documentation and fake Social Security numbers).

So while there is a cost, there also is a revenue side to the equation.

In 2009, FAIR said illegal immigrants contributed $1.6 billion in taxes in Florida. In 2010, the number dropped more than $1.3 billion, to $261 million. Eric Ruark, FAIR's director of research, said the group greatly overestimated the amount of disposable income of illegal immigrants that would be subject to sales tax.

In defending the study, Ruark notes that FAIR does not estimate the increased tax payments that Florida would gain from having legal workers replace illegal ones, or the cost to the state in payments to Floridians who are unemployed because of the presence of illegal workers in the labor force. The point is, the actual cost could be higher.

The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, tried back in December 2007 to quantify the fiscal impact of illegal immigrants on state and local governments. It couldn't, and found problems with studies that did. The CBO noted that illegal immigrants who just arrive in the United States might use more government resources than those well or better integrated into American society, that it is difficult to capture all revenues and costs, and that there is little information on how much illegal immigrants contribute to American life through taxes, or how much they utilize government services.

Instead, the CBO made a series of more general findings. Among them:

*  State and local governments incur costs for providing services to unauthorized immigrants and have limited options for avoiding or minimizing those costs. 
*  The amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions. 
*  The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants.

To us, that's a more appropriate and tempered analysis.

A quick side note: In his comments, Buchanan said the per-household cost of for illegal immigrants is $700 a year. To get there, Buchanan again uses FAIR, which divided their cost figure for taxpayers ($3.8 billion) by the number of households headed by native-born residents (5.65 million). FAIR excludes households headed by non-native-born residents regardless of whether those heads of household are citizens or living in the United States legally. If they included all households (7 million), the cost per household would be about $550. We're unclear why FAIR, for instance, excluded citizens not born in the United States as well as legally documented residents -- who are all paying taxes -- from their calculations.

Let's review. Buchanan said: ""In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion (a year). This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida."" He is mostly quoting accurately from a study performed by the group Federation for American Immigration Reform, though he doesn't cite FAIR in his comments. The FAIR study is highly suspect. It relies on estimate after estimate, and was conducted by a group that is hardly objective when it comes to analyzing the effects of illegal immigration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned specifically against trying to put dollar figures on the costs associated with illegal immigrants because of the large number of unknown variables. We'd consider offering more leeway if Buchanan sourced his statement back to FAIR, so at least people could know the source and question it independently. But Buchanan makes his pronouncement sound like it's fact, when it's far from it. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097332740>],/factchecks/2010/dec/06/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-illegal-immigration-costs-flori/

Sen. Harry Reid says Sen. John McCain opposes 'don't ask, don't tell' due to economy
","
In an address from the floor of the Senate on Dec. 4, 2010, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid used the analogy of Lucy from the Peanuts cartoon -- who repeatedly pulled the football away every time Charlie Brown went to kick it -- to describe Sen. John McCain's reasoning for his opposition to abolishing the military's controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.

""First, Sen. McCain said he would seriously consider repealing it if the military leadership thought we should, and (when) the military leadership said it should be repealed, he pulled away the football. Then Sen. McCain said he would need to see a study from the Pentagon. When the Pentagon produced the study saying repeal would have no negative effect at all, he pulled away the football again,"" Reid said.

""And his latest trick, he said yesterday that he opposed repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' a proposal that would be a great stride forward for both equality and military readiness ... because of the economy,"" said Reid, whose quote was picked up in Politico. ""I repeat, the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy.""

""I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either,"" Reid said.

Reid's statement -- based on comments McCain made the day before during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department's report about the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy -- seemed to suggest that McCain believed ""don't ask, don't tell"" had some sort of negative economic consequences.

But that's not the context for McCain's comments. Rather, it was an issue of legislative priority. McCain's point was that the issue of how to address a flailing economy ought to be addressed before the Senate considered something like ""don't ask, don't tell.""

""I will not agree to have this bill go forward ... because our economy is in the tank,"" McCain said. ""Our economy is in the tank, and the American people want that issue addressed. And the military is functioning in the most efficient, most professional, most courageous fashion than at any time in our history.

""So to somehow believe that this is some kind of compelling issue at a time we're in two wars ... is obviously not something that we should be exercising a rush to judgment.""

Two days earlier the entire Republican caucus in the Senate signed a letter, sent to Reid, promising to filibuster any bills proposed by Democrats until the Senate had acted to prevent the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers. Republicans have argued that letting the tax cuts expire even for the wealthy, as Democrats proposed, would deal a devastating blow to the economy.

McCain's comments about not taking up ""don't ask don't tell"" in light of the economy are consistent with that Republican pledge.

McCain added that he would be willing to consider the ""don't ask, don't tell"" issue in depth during the next legislative session.

""I would be more than eager in the coming year to have additional hearings, as they had some 13 hearings when 'don't, ask, don't tell' was enacted,"" McCain said. ""And I would pledge to work with you on that effort, but certainly not during a lame-duck session when parts of my state are suffering in ways that they never have in the history of my state.""

It's true that McCain listed the poor economy as a reason he would not support ""don't ask, don't tell,"" but only in the context of the economy needing to be a higher priority for the Senate. When Reid claimed, ""the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy,"" the implication seems to be that McCain was making an argument that ""don't ask, don't tell"" would harm the economy. Especially when Reid added, ""I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either."" The policy's impact on the economy would be a confusing argument. But in context, McCain's reference to the economy was quite clearly ranking other priorities against it.

"['National', 'LGBTQ', 'Military', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Wesley Clark']","
Wesley Clark says 92 percent of troops surveyed would have no problem after a ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" repeal
","
On Dec. 5, 2010, ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour devoted much of its program to a discussion of whether, and how, to end the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy and open the ranks fully to gay and lesbian service members. A portion of the discussion addressed a detailed Pentagon study of the issue released on Nov. 30.

The study, among other things, included a survey of some 115,000 active-duty and reserve members, which the report called ""one of the largest surveys in the history of the U.S. military."" Those who back the effort to open the military to openly gay and lesbian personnel hailed the survey as concrete evidence that any problems integrating gay men and women into the services will be limited and manageable. Opponents of a change, for their part, found evidence within the survey that showed a greater likelihood of problems, especially in specific groups such as combat units.

On This Week, retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the former top NATO commander in Europe and a former Democratic presidential candidate, cited one finding from the survey that indicated that a transition away from ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" should be achievable with relative ease.

Clark said ""what the survey showed is that essentially all of the service members, 92 percent, agree that they could serve -- they could serve in a unit in combat, and they could work together effectively, and it wouldn't compromise mission readiness.""

He continued, ""I think a lot of the survey, honestly. It shows the effects of six, eight months' politicization, continuing coverage in the media, and some of it is just people in the military saying, just leave us alone and let us do our job. They come down on one side or the other of this. Let's just get on with it.""

We wondered whether the study really showed that 92 percent of service members were comfortable serving with gay men and women, as Clark suggested. We found that Clark was off the mark in describing what that poll result meant.

Once we looked at the report, we were able to find the 92 percent statistic easily. It appears in the report summary, as one of three findings that ""best represented"" the survey as a whole. ""When asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a co-worker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92 percent stated that the unit’s 'ability to work together' was 'very good,' 'good,' or 'neither good nor poor,'"" the report said.

Superficially, that sentence seems to back up Clark's comment. However, the report is worded somewhat unclearly, and it took us a couple readings before we fully understood what the 92 percent figure referred to.

In a footnote, the report sources the statement to Question 47a. But there's a problem for Clark. That question was asked only of a subset of survey respondents -- those who ""said they served with a coworker they believed to be gay or lesbian and where all, most, some or a few other unit members believed the coworker to be gay or lesbian.""

Of the roughly 115,000 service members interviewed for the survey, only about 78,500 -- or two-thirds -- fell into that category.

One can imagine that service members who have been through the experience of serving alongside a gay or lesbian colleague might feel more comfortable about the arrangement than those who have not. So using this subset to extrapolate to all service members is problematic. And when survey questions were asked of all respondents, rather than just the subset of those who think they served with someone gay, the levels of comfort are consistently lower.

In Question 68a, for instance, the survey asked, ""If 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' is repealed and you are working with a service member in your immediate unit who has said he or she is gay or lesbian, how, if at all, would it affect how service members in your immediate unit work together to get the job done?""

For this question, 26 percent answered ""negatively"" or ""very negatively."" That's more than triple the 8.4 percent that answered ""poor"" or ""very poor"" when an equivalent question was asked only of those who believed they had served with a gay or lesbian colleague.

Answers were similar with other questions asked of the entire set of respondents. When asked how ""service members in your immediate unit (would) pull together to perform as a team"" after the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" a little more than 29 percent of all respondents answered ""negatively"" or ""very negatively."" And when asked ""how service members in your immediate unit (would) trust each other"" after repeal, about 33 percent of all respondents answered ""negatively"" or ""very negatively.""

It's worth noting that even at these higher rates, only a minority of survey respondents said that repealing ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" would produce exclusively negative consequences. So while the level of comfort Clark cites -- 92 percent -- is too high, the survey nonetheless found a notable degree of comfort with a repeal ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" within the ranks. (Or at least a tolerance for repeal. Only about 18 percent of all respondents went so far as to say repeal would be ""very positive"" or ""positive,"" while 52 percent -- an absolute majority -- said it would either have no effect on performance or an equal mix of positive and negative effects.)

So Clark is generally right that only a small minority of service members think a repeal would have negative or very negative effects on unit performance, but he exaggerates just how small that minority is. For this reason, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0864C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/06/wesley-clark/wesley-clark-says-92-percent-troops-surveyed-would/

RightMarch.com claims DREAM Act would provide amnesty to two million illegal immigrants
","
The DREAM Act  -- which would provide a path to permanent citizenship for children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants -- is on the agenda for possible action in the final days of the 111th Congress.

With Democratic leaders hoping to bring the issue to a vote in the lame-duck session, opponents of the DREAM ACT have amped up their efforts to derail it.

In a message posted to Conservative Action Alerts, and copied and circulated via chain e-mail, a group called RightMarch.com warns that the Dream Act ""would give amnesty to over two million illegal aliens.""

As the name implies, RightMarch.com is a conservative group that boasts being ""on the front lines of fighting against amnesty for illegal immigrants."" The message was signed by RightMarch.org president William Greene.

The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or enlist in the military. There are currently several versions of the DREAM Act kicking around in Congress, but under the version introduced in March 2009, people under 35 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and have lived here at least the last five years would be able to apply for legal permanent resident status on a conditional basis if they have obtained a U.S. high school diploma or GED. That conditional status would be upgraded to permanent after six years if they successfully complete at least two years of college or military service and if they maintain ""good moral character.""

It is a matter of debate whether that can accurately be called ""amnesty."" The difference between ""amnesty,"" ""legalization,"" and ""earned legalization"" is more about framing and semantics than anything else, said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.
 
""That said, 'amnesty' emphasizes the fact that an unauthorized immigrant is being forgiven for having been here illegally,"" Rosenblum said. ""There is an element of that in the DREAM Act given that supporters emphasize that DREAM beneficiaries were brought here by their parents and should not be held strictly accountable/responsible for becoming unauthorized immigrants.""

The 1986 immigration bill -- which allowed many illegal immigrants who entered the United States before 1982 to earn temporary, and eventually permanent, residency and citizenship --  explicitly included an ""amnesty."" Supporters of the DREAM Act, however,  do not describe it as ""amnesty,"" partly because ""amnesty"" has become a politically toxic term in the debate, Rosenblum said.

The bigger issue here is the claim that the DREAM Act would provide citizenship to more than two million people. 
In July, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) completed an analysis of the potential Dream Act beneficiaries and concluded there are about 2.1 million people who would be potentially eligible for citizenship.

Using Census data, here's how MPI broke it down:

* 114,000 qualified people with at least an associate's degree. Those people would be eligible for conditional status, and permanent status within six years.

* 612,000 with a high school diploma or GED eligible for conditional status; but who would need to complete two years of college or enlist in the military to obtain permanent status.

* 489,000 between the ages of 18 and 34 with no high school degree, and who would not therefore, be eligible for conditional status unless or until they got a GED.

* And 934,000 under the age of 18 who would be eligible for conditional status in the future if they obtain a high school degree.

So that's the universe of the 2.1 million people who would potentially be eligible for citizenship under that version of the DREAM Act. But according to the MPI report, ""historical trends indicate that far fewer are likely to actually gain permanent (or even conditional) status, due primarily to the bill’s education attainment requirements.""

In fact, when considering factors such as English language ability, income levels, the presence of children and employment status, MPI estimated that only about 38 percent of that 2.1 million would likely obtain permanent legal status. That comes to 850,000 people.

Several newer versions of the DREAM Act have been proposed in recent months, all of which would be more restrictive (such as lowering the eligible age from 35 to 30). Therefore, MPI's Rosenblum said, the newer versions would decrease the number of those likely to gain citizenship (to about 750,000, depending on the version).

One factor not considered is how much that number might increase due to the incentive it creates for undocumented youth to go to college in order to obtain citizenship.

""It's difficult to predict how big a carrot that is,"" Rosenblum said.

But even the folks at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group critical of illegal immigration, acknowledge that it's unlikely that 2.1 million people would achieve citizenship.

Because of the educational requirements, ""it doesn't seem likely that anywhere close to that number would ultimately qualify,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies. ""Nobody thinks all of the people would get it.""

We called RightMarch.com to confirm the ""more than 2 million"" figure was obtained from the MPI analysis. We did not hear back from them, but we couldn't find any other reputable group that has analyzed the DREAM Act to estimate the number of people it might affect. And data from MPI is regularly cited by all sides in the immigration debate. 

The claim by RightMarch.com is that the DREAM Act would give amnesty to 2.1 million illegal immigrants. That's very definitive. In fact, though, that's the number of people who would be potentially eligible to earn citizenship. The RightMarch.org figure assumes every single child of an illegal immigrant who meets the age requirements will complete two years of college or join the military. That's not realistic. In fact, the Migration Institute estimates the number of people likely to obtain permanent citizenship is actually less than half that. It's in the same report. We rate the RightMarch.org claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809730EEC0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/06/rightmarchcom/rightmarchcom-claims-dream-act-would-provide-amnes/
"['Abortion', 'Wisconsin', 'Pro-Life Wisconsin']","
Pro-Life Wisconsin says African-Americans make up about 6 percent of population, account for 24 percent of abortions
","
Using 13 billboards in Milwaukee, Pro-Life Wisconsin says it wants to raise awareness of what it calls the disproportionate abortion rate among African-American women in Wisconsin.

According to the organization, which works to outlaw abortion, the billboards appeared Nov. 29, 2010, and will stay up for 30 days. They feature one of two messages: ""Black children are in danger"" or ""Black & Beautiful."" 

Each billboard shows a picture of an African-American infant and lists a website -- TooManyAborted.com/WI. That website, and an announcement about the billboards issued by Pro-Life Wisconsin, make the same claim:

In Wisconsin, ""6.2 percent of the population is black, yet 24 percent of all state abortions are on African-Americans.""

On the face of it, that seems like a large disparity. And it suggests race is a determining factor in abortion rates.

We decided to take a look.

Pro-Life Wisconsin’s claim is based on figures cited by the Georgia-based Radiance Foundation, which is co-sponsoring the Milwaukee billboards. The foundation accurately cites U.S. Census figures on the percentage of Wisconsin’s population that is African-American, and the state’s annual abortion report on the percentage of Wisconsin abortions that are performed on African-American women.

But in doing so, it is setting up a false comparison.

It compares the number of abortions obtained by black women to the entire black population. Obviously, only females in a certain age range can become pregnant.

Nationally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looks at abortions by comparing the number each year per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44.

The most recent CDC figures show the national rate abortion rate generally declined between 1997 and 2006. But the 2006 rate of 16.1 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 was up 3.2 percent over the previous year.

The abortion rate for black women, meanwhile -- 33.4 abortions per 1,000 black women ages 15 to 44 -- was more than twice the overall rate.

Abortion rates for black women have been higher for years, ""and have been attributed to high unintended pregnancy rates,"" according to the CDC.

In making its claim, Pro-Life Wisconsin is suggesting that race is somehow the determining factor in people seeking an abortion. Experts say there are many other factors at play.

Like the CDC, Jacquelyn Paykel, an OB/GYN at the Medical College of Wisconsin, points to the higher unintended pregnancy rate among black women. She said unintended pregnancies tend tend to occur among women with less education, lower socioeconomic status and less access to reproductive health care.

And those factors are more likely to be present among black women, she said.

So, the construction of the statement can lead to another false impression.

Now, on to the Wisconsin figures, which are more current than the national ones.

In Wisconsin, the estimated overall abortion rate for 2009 was seven abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 -- less than half of what national figures have shown. The rate was the same in 2008, according to the state’s annual abortion report.

That report doesn’t provide statistics by race for the 15-to-44 age group. But we were able to make calculations, for 2009, using abortion and population statistics from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: 
  

Using this approach, which focuses on child-bearing years, the disparity among black women isn’t quite as large as what Pro-Life Wisconsin stated.

We asked the group, which is based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, the purpose of the billboards. They are located mainly on Milwaukee’s north and northwest sides, the areas of the city where the largest numbers of African-Americans live.

Spokeswoman Virginia Zignego said the organization wants to publicize the disparity in the abortion rate among black women and highlight abortion alternatives such as adoption. The website listed on the billboards, which is run by the Radiance Foundation, mentions adoption, but most of the material criticizes Planned Parenthood and other organizations.

Zignego said the campaign also aims to show that Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is racist because it locates many of its facilities -- some of which perform abortions -- in areas with the heaviest concentrations of African-Americans.

Amanda Harrington, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said its services are geared toward pregnancy prevention -- and its sites are in areas where women need access to health care.

Let’s return to the claim itself.

The group accurately stated cited census and abortion numbers. But it used an approach that takes in the entire African-American population, not just women between age 15 and 44 -- the approach used by federal and Wisconsin authorities. By that measure, the actual disparity is smaller than what Pro-Life Wisconsin claimed.

The group’s claim also leaves out important details -- namely, that socioeconomic factors, rather than race, have been identified as key contributors to the higher abortion rate among black women.

We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809730F780>],/factchecks/2010/dec/06/pro-life-wisconsin/pro-life-wisconsin-says-african-americans-make-abo/

Rep. Dennis Kucinich assails tax deductions for fast food advertising that targets children
","
Childhood obesity in the United States has more than tripled the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association. It has reached epidemic levels and increased risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer and osteoarthritis.

The inactivity associated with watching television has long taken much of the blame. But a recent UCLA study reported in the American Journal of Public Health found that commercials, not TV itself, were the link to obesity.

In fact, it found no association with television viewing and obesity for those who watched videos or commercial-free programming.

For Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the implication is clear: Taxpayers are subsidizing the obesity epidemic by providing tax breaks to the food industry for marketing fast food and junk food to children.

""We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse,"" he said in a news release Nov. 10.

That whet our appetite for curiosity. So PolitiFact Ohio sank its teeth into Kucinich’s claim that taxpayer dollars are used to market to bad food to children.

On the ills of fast food and marketing efforts, Kucinich cited a new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University:
""The research is clear. Eating fast food harms young people’s health,"" the study says. And it concludes that efforts to market fast food to children are both effective and rapidly expanding.

The fast food industry spent more than $4.2 billion in 2009 on TV commercials and radio, magazine, outdoor and other ads, the Rudd study said.

The industry spent nearly $2 billion in 2006 on marketing and advertising specifically aimed at children, according to a report to Congress from Federal Trade Commission.

But how do taxpayers subsidize that?

That answer is simple. Fast food marketers get the same break that other businesses do. The federal tax code allows companies to deduct  ""reasonable and necessary"" expenses of marketing and advertising from their income taxes.

That doesn’t sit well with Kucinich when the marketing targets kids. The Cleveland Democrat introduced a bill, HR 4310, to eliminate that tax deduction. The bill attracted 28 co-sponsors and has been referred to the Ways and Means Committee.

Kucinich's bill would prohibit any company from claiming a tax deduction for the expense of marketing fast food to children. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated ""on a very preliminary basis"" that the legislation could raise $15 billion to $19 billion in additional federal revenue over the 10-year budget period -- ""which is almost 2 billion per year,"" said Kucinich’s press aide.

A revenue estimate from the Joint Committee is treated as confidential unless released by the member of Congress who requested it. Confidentiality allows the committee staff to maintain its nonpartisan role in the policy process.

Kucinich’s office gave us a copy of the staff letter with the committee’s estimate, but we were unable to get background details. But the letter notes that a number of unsettled issues surround the bill -- ranging from defining ""fast food restaurant"" or ""food of a poor nutritional quality"" to determining what constitutes advertising that is ""primarily aimed at"" children -- and all of those issues would affect the bill’s impact (including the amount of new tax revenue).

The committee’s estimate clearly covered more than the child-oriented fast food advertising in the 2006 FTC survey. At the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent, the $2 billion cited in that report would have yielded about $700 million in additional tax revenue.

A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research does support Kucinich’s assertion that eliminating the tax break would reduce the number of overweight children. Eliminating the tax deduction would reduce the number of overweight children by 5 to 7 percent, it said,  and banning advertising to children would prompt an even larger reduction.

So where does that leave us on Kucinich’s assertion?
  
Childhood obesity is a serious topic and the congressman may be nobly intentioned. But dollar figure he uses is shaky at best and his description of the money as taxpayer dollars is misleading.

That’s why we rate Kucinich’s claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F5DB78C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/06/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-assails-tax-deductions-fast-fo/

NFL players claim gets sacked by experts
","
(Want to discuss this story? Go to our Facebook page.) 
Imagine Sunday afternoons next fall without the Dirty Birds.

The organization that represents the Atlanta Falcons' players and those from the National Football League's 31 other teams recently warned it could happen next year if the players and owners don't reach a labor agreement.

And what could the financial impact be to Atlanta?

""The conservative estimate is that every team city will lose over $160 million in lost jobs and revenue in the event of a lockout by NFL owners,"" the players association wrote in a Nov. 22 letter to Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.

""As you well know,"" the letter continued, ""this is not what Atlanta area families need in these dire economic times.""

The association wrote similar letters to Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Gov.-elect Nathan Deal. The players are attempting a blitz on NFL owners such as the Falcons' Arthur Blank by lobbying Deal, Perdue and Reed to pressure Blank into working out a new collective bargaining agreement.

Since we're always ready for some football, the prospect of no pigskins being tossed around troubled us. The economic impact on Atlanta piqued our interest. Would the economic impact of no Falcons season in 2011 be $160 million?

""It's not going to lose that activity,"" said a skeptical Mark Rosentraub, the Bruce and Joan Bickner Endowed Professor of Sports Management at the University of Michigan. ""If you can't spend that money on football, you will spend it on something else.""

The NFL Players Association arranged a conference call with reporters late last week to explain how it came up with the estimate. An economist hired by the association based its estimate on economic impact studies done about 10 different NFL franchises since 2000. Falcons spokesman Reggie Roberts said the team has not commissioned any economic impact studies. The economist, Jesse David of Edgeworth Economics, concluded that the average economic impact for a city when an NFL game is played is $20 million. David multiplied that by eight, the number of regular-season games each team hosts, and reached his conclusion of $160 million. He told reporters that anywhere from 30 percent to 50 percent of the total economic impact could come from player salaries.

Greg Aiello, the NFL's communications director, sent AJC PolitiFact Georgia a list of more than a dozen economic impact studies of NFL franchises done between 1987 and 2004 by researchers, consultants, professors and accountants. The more recent estimates ranged from $144 million from a 2000 study of the Green Bay Packers to $402 million from a 2002 study of the New Orleans Saints. The estimates include money spent by people inside that city's metro area and outside the region. Aiello cautioned that these studies are often debunked by experts.

Aiello called the players association's findings ""fairy tales.""

We went in search of the truth in that black hole of research, the Internet.

The city of Santa Clara, Calif., hired a company to study the potential economic activity from a proposed football stadium there for the San Francisco 49ers. The researchers generally agreed with the 49ers' findings that the activity could be as much as $85 million a year, but that included $19 million for non-49ers events at the stadium. A study in March found the Minnesota Vikings' playoff victory against the Dallas Cowboys in January was a financial win for the region of about $13 million. Using that estimate for eight regular-season games (we know a playoff game may bring more activity), would equal $104 million. We could find no similar studies for the Atlanta Falcons.

In 2006, three professors looked at the economic impact of strikes in professional sports in Florida because it is one of the few states with all four major American sports leagues. They focused on sales-tax data, determining that none of the labor disputes in recent years had a significant reduction in taxable sales.

Another group of researchers reached a similar conclusion that work stoppages in sports have little economic impact on a city or region. They made a point similar to Rosentraub's.

""Attending a professional sporting event is one of many entertainment options in metropolitan areas,"" Dennis Coates and Brad R. Humphreys of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County wrote in a 2000 study. ""Fans could alternatively go out to dinner and a movie, or bowling, during a sports strike.""

We asked David about the research that there's little negative economic impact from sports strikes. He conceded that there are a range of assumptions about the idea, but he maintained ""football is not substitutable for some other economic activity.""

Robert Baade disagreed. He was one of the three authors who wrote the 2006 study. Baade, an economics and business professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois, did research several years ago that found little to no economic impact when Los Angeles lost both of its pro football teams, the Raiders and Rams. He also questioned the players association's argument that there could be a major loss in economic impact from stadium workers who may lose their jobs if there is a work stoppage, saying most of those jobs are part-time.

""Are you going to support a family on selling parking tickets or beer?"" Baade asked us.

Baade said a more likely annual economic impact estimate is $16 million, citing his past findings that the Super Bowl brings in one-tenth of the financial impact experts claim.

Regarding the likelihood of no NFL action next season, Baade deadpanned, ""if you're following a losing team, it might be a relief.""

We've found an array of research and opinion on this topic, and it is across the spectrum. We wish there were some concrete research by the NFL, but it is apparently wary from past criticism of such studies. The lowest recent estimate of annual economic impact on a city we found was the $85 million for the San Francisco 49ers.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Jeff Fitzgerald']","
Jeff Fitzgerald says Gov. Jim Doyle and Democrats rushed through a tax-raising budget repair bill with no public hearings
","
One of the Republican leaders at the new-look Wisconsin statehouse thinks he knows exactly why voters ushered Democrats out the door in November -- they operated in secret and were careless with your tax dollars.

So says state Rep. Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon), the incoming Assembly speaker.

In a Nov. 29, 2010 news release under the headline ""Democrats continue closed-door deals,"" Fitzgerald warned against a possible December special session to approve labor deals with state employee unions before Republicans take control in January.

He then reached back a year to portray a pattern of bad conduct: ""In 2009, (Gov.) Jim Doyle and the Democrats rushed through a budget repair bill with billions in tax increases and held no public hearings.""

As devoted Madison watchers, that raised a few obvious questions: Were there really no hearings, not a one? And ""billions"" of tax hikes slipped into a bill meant to fix a mid-budget shortfall?

In short: Is Fitzgerald rewriting history?

When we asked Fitzgerald spokesman Jim Bender about the tax figure, he told us he erred in using ""billions.""

Oops.

The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the official scorekeeper, estimated the repair bill would raise $290 million from tax changes. The main source was ""combined reporting,"" in which lawmakers closed what some viewed as a loophole that allowed corporations to shuffle profits to subsidiaries in states that don’t tax them.

If a new fee on hospital revenue was included, the new revenue total was $1.2 billion over three years, according to the fiscal bureau.

That element features its own mini debate:

The fiscal bureau calls the hospital assessment a fee. Media reports commonly referred to it as a tax. Hospitals backed the fee because it allowed the state to tap a large new stream of federal money that boosts Medicaid reimbursement to hospitals; Republicans derided it as a ""sick tax"" that would raise costs to patients.

Bender told us he counted the hospital fees as a tax -- but mistakenly used ""billions.""

""Normally, I use specifics, but in this instance generalized,"" he said.

So, the underlying math in the statement is off -- by either $800 million or $1.71 billion, depending on how you view the hospital fee.

But what about the way the bill was passed?

It was pushed through the Legislature at warp speed -- two days -- when compared with four previous repair bills dating to 2002. The range on those was from 21 to 150 days. The speed was partly a function of the Democrats controlling both houses and the governor’s office.

As for the lack of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right -- there were none.

But a look into the past shows a spotty record on such hearings when it comes to budget repair  bills -- with Republicans and Democrats both on the hook for blame or credit.

We looked back at four such bills -- one in 2002 offered by Republican Gov. Scott McCallum -- and three earlier fixes under Doyle, a Democrat. Budget repair bills have become much more common in recent years as the economy sagged.

On the earlier Doyle bills, the Legislature twice held public hearings. In one case, Republicans controlled both chambers; the parties shared control in the other.

But in 2007, another year with split control, no public hearing accompanied the action.

Under McCallum in 2002, lawmakers convened two such hearings on a highly contentious plan. The two parties split control at that time as well.

Let’s consign this discussion to the dustbin of history.

No matter how you add it up, Fitzgerald misfired badly on the tax figure he used in his news release slamming Democrats. His own aide admitted it. He is correct on the rushed nature of the 2009 budget fix. On the question of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right there were none -- but his rhetoric skipped past the fact such hearings have not always been held. Indeed, both parties have had a hand in that fact.  We rate his claim Barely True.

"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Howard Dean']","
Howard Dean says the health care bill that President Barack Obama signed is like the one Mitt Romney signed as the governor of Massachusetts
","
During a wide-ranging interview at Austin's KLRU last month, Texas Tribune editor Evan Smith talked health care with Howard Dean, a physician and the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 
""Barack Obama's health care bill is nothing new,"" Dean said during the Nov. 12 interview. ""Mitt Romney signed one just like it four years before."" 
That's a view Dean, the former governor of Vermont, shares with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, though their opinions of said plans diverge. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation Nov. 8, Perry said: ""The health care plan out of Massachusetts, I would suggest to you, is too much like the health care plan passed out of Washington."" 
We wondered whether Dean correctly compared the 2010 federal overhaul to Massachusetts' 2006 health care law. 
Karen Finney, a Dean spokeswoman, shared two news articles to support his statement. 
According to an April 1 story posted on Talking Points Memo, during an appearance at Emory University in March, ""Romney acknowledged that there are 'a number of similarities'"" between the Massachusetts health care plan and the legislation Obama signed into law March 23. ""If you lose a job or change a job, you won't lose your insurance,"" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted Romney saying. ""Everybody is able to keep insurance throughout their life. It's not taken away from them... you can't be canceled if you have a pre-existing condition or if you become ill once you're insured. So in that respect, it's very similar."" 
According to a March 31 Christian Science-Monitor news story, Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who advised Obama and Romney on health-insurance programs, told the Boston Globe that Romney ""is in many ways the intellectual father of national reform."" 
The plan Romney signed included an expansion of the state's Medicaid program to children in households whose incomes are less than or equal to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The plan also subsidized coverage for eligible residents and created an exchange system, a state-overseen marketplace enabling individuals and small businesses to purchase health coverage. Also, the plan requires most adults to have coverage at the risk of facing penalties for not complying. 
The 2010 federal law has similar features. It likewise expands Medicaid (to all individuals whose incomes are less than or equal to 133 percent of the federal poverty level), and makes government subsidies available to low-income individuals and families to help them pay health insurance premiums. The federal law also creates voluntary exchanges that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase health insurance. And it requires most folks to purchase coverage, though the plans' penalty structures differ. 
In February, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True economist Paul Krugman's charge that the health care bill that passed the Senate ""is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan — the same thing."" 
Except for some modifications made by the House (such as implementation dates and how the plan is funded), the legislation that Obama signed into law was basically the bill that passed the Senate. Other similarities between the federal law and the Massachusetts plan: 
-In Massachusetts, companies with more than 10 employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty. The federal approach imposes the requirement on companies with 50 employees or more. 
-Both plans restructure the insurance market. In Massachusetts, the reform law merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan and the market serving smaller employers). The federal law placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. 
-In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan. The federal law allows dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the federal law creates a similar type of plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage. 
-Both plans put limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums, but in different ways. For the most part in Massachusetts, the highest premiums can only cost twice as much as the lowest premiums. The federal plan allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchanges to vary based on age, geographic area, family composition and tobacco use. 
And the differences? 
Financing and cost containment. The Massachusetts plan has been criticized for its lack of cost-containment provisions, while the federal law makes changes to Medicare, health insurance that the government offers to senior citizens, that are intended to lower program costs. (Being that Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address it.) 
Both plans are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal plan taps cost savings from levying new taxes on, for example, high-cost health care plans. 
Upshot: the federal law is similar to the Massachusetts law, but not an exact copy. We rate Dean's statement as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A3340>],/factchecks/2010/dec/05/howard-dean/dean-howard-says-health-care-bill-prseident-barack/
"['Rhode Island', 'State Budget', 'Donald Carcieri']","
Carcieri says his team saved Rhode Island $1 billion
","
Forget the $64,000 question. That's chump change these days. With Governor Carcieri about to leave office, the question is: Did his administration save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion during his eight years in office?

Carcieri made that claim in a commentary piece published in The Providence Journal on Nov. 8.

""Today state government is leaner, more frugal and more accountable to the taxpayers than it was eight years ago,"" he wrote. ""We have enacted separation of powers; cleaned up Resource Recovery and Beacon Mutual; reduced the number of state employees by over 2,000; implemented state employee pension and health-insurance reforms; rooted out government waste, and instituted scores of efficiencies over the years. Combined, these measures have saved taxpayers nearly $1 billion.""

That's a lot of money, especially in a state facing huge budget deficits. We wondered where those saving came from, so we asked the Carcieri administration for the details to back up that $1 billion claim. After a week and a half, administration officials provided a spreadsheet that shows savings in 16 categories totaling $1,067,484,418.97.

We examined them all. But let's talk about the four big-ticket items that, together, account for $803.5 million of the savings.

""Staff Reduction""

The administration says it saved a total of $191.6 million by cutting the number of full-time-equivalent state employees from 15,312 to 13,050 -- a reduction of 2,262 jobs -- which matches Carcieri's claim that he reduced the number of state employees by ""over 2,000.""

The administration uses numbers from the start of the 2003 fiscal year -- six months before Carcieri took office. If you start counting when Carcieri became governor, the job cuts total 2,033, House fiscal records show. But that's still ""over 2,000.""

The administration excluded research positions at state colleges sponsored by third parties. But House fiscal officials, who have a big role in writing the budget, think it's best to include those positions, House spokesman Larry Berman said. If you do, the Carcieri administration has cut 1,761 jobs, he said.

We then questioned whether the administration had replaced state employees with contract workers. Berman said it's tough to tell, but the Assembly has established greater scrutiny and controls over use of contractors in lieu of state employees. Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Carcieri's director of administration, said the state had 873 contract employees before Carcieri took office and now it has no more than 646.

To calculate the $191.6 million in staff-reduction savings, the administration multiplied the number of full-time equivalents cut each year by that year's average cost of state employee wages and benefits. (The wage-and-benefits average rose from $68,315 in fiscal year 2003 to $95,197 in fiscal year 2010.)

""Pension Reform""

On the administration's original spreadsheet, the single largest category of savings was ""Pension Reform,"" totaling $398.8 million. Administration documents show the pension savings came in three waves, beginning in fiscal year 2006 when changes in retirement age, benefits and cost-of-living adjustments saved $44 million a year.

A second wave began in 2009 when changes in retirement eligibility, benefits and final average compensation resulted in savings of $59.4 million, on top of the annual $44 million amount. And a third wave began in 2010 when cost-of-living adjustments were limited to the first $35,000 of annual pension, saving an additional $16 million. Those cumulative savings are expected to continue, but the spreadsheet does not reflect pension savings for future years.

Retiree Health-Care

By contrast, the spreadsheet shows both past and future savings in retiree health-care costs as a lump sum of $111.3 million. Booth Gallogly explained those savings result from 2008 changes in eligibility and the requirement that those receiving retiree health care pay 20 percent of the cost. Those changes prompted many state employees to retire before the new rules took effect, she said. The state has already saved some of that money. For example, she said $10.6 million was saved in fiscal year 2009, but other parts of those savings will be realized over the next 30 years.

So why count the pension reform savings year by year while counting the retiree health-care savings all at once? Booth Gallogly said full documentation for the year-to-year retiree health-care savings were not readily available. But, she said, ""Actions you take now to reduce the unfunded liability should be counted in the year you take them. It's still good savings.""

""We drink from wells we did not dig,"" Booth Gallogly said, using a saying that stems from the Book of Deuteronomy. ""Many of the things being done will have a very significant impact over time, as long as they don't get reversed.""

Russell Dannecker, a former state Senate fiscal adviser who is now the fiscal policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Poverty Institute, said the state will eventually save $111.3 million, but it hasn't saved that total amount yet.

John Simmons, executive director of the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (and a member of Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee's transition team), said the Carcieri administration and the General Assembly deserve credit for both the $111.3 million in retiree health-care savings and whatever the full impact of the pension reform will be over time because those are ""structural changes"" that will lower the amount of money the state must spend in those areas. While some of those savings won't be realized for say 20 years, ""it's savings nonetheless,"" he said. And if you add all that up, it would exceed the $1 billion amount cited by the governor, he said.

""Co-share savings""

The last big category is savings on health insurance premiums for state employees. Booth Gallogly said state employees used to pay nothing toward their health insurance but now they pay up to 25 percent, for a total savings of $101.8 million. The changes started in 2005 with nonunion employees; union employees were added in later years.

Other categories

Those four categories account for about 75 percent of the $1 billion in savings cited by Carcieri, but it's also worth looking at a couple of smaller categories.

For example, the spreadsheet lists $15.5 million in savings from moving state offices out of leased space and into state-owned properties, such as the move of the Division of Motor Vehicles from the Apex building in Pawtucket to state-owned property in Cranston.

Dannecker said such moves undoubtedly save the state rent money. But the state can also incur considerable costs from renovating and operating state-owned properties, he said. The renovations to the Forand Building, which now houses the DMV, came to $17.9 million.

The final category of savings was $37.1 million in ""Department of Corrections Cost Avoidance."" Corrections Director A.T. Wall explained that state prisons were becoming overcrowded, threatening to exceed agreed-up limits resulting a from federal court action, so officials considered spending $31.7 million to build new housing units at the John J. Moran Medium-Security Facility.

But the state avoided that cost by enacting legislation in 2008 that allowed inmates serving shorter sentences to shave time off their sentences through good behavior and participating in rehabilitation programs, he said.

Dannecker said it's good the state avoided the cost of a new prison construction. But, he asked, ""Is cost avoidance a savings to the taxpayer? Isn't that really just good government? It certainly did not reduce the taxpayers' burden from what it was. When I think of savings to the taxpayer, I think we were paying this amount and now we are paying less. That's how I classify savings.""

He offered the example of a broken refrigerator: You could pay $200 to fix it or spend $2,000 for a new one, but if you choose the less expensive option, it's a good choice but it doesn't mean you have $1,800 more in your checking account. Simmons maintained that avoiding the cost of new prison construction does represent valid savings.

Berman said, ""It's important to note that the governor did not find these savings alone. Almost all of them were included in the budgets that the General Assembly enacted.""

Carcieri spokeswoman Amy Kempe agreed that, ""without the cooperation of the General Assembly, significant amounts of that savings would not have been achieved."" But she said the governor can set the agenda by making proposals, and he proposed going even further in areas such as pension reform.

Bottom line

In the end, Carcieri's statement that ""these measures saved taxpayers nearly $1 billion"" requires further analysis and explanation.

It's clear, for example, that many millions of dollars in savings are expected in future years but haven't been realized yet; that some savings come with offsetting costs; and that even the best budget experts disagree about issues such as whether ""cost avoidance"" is the same as take-it-to-the-bank, cut-my-budget savings. Also, it appears Carcieri tossed out the $1 billion figure before completing a full, accurate analysis of those savings.

It's also worth nothing that the total state budget grew from $5.77 billion in fiscal year 2004 to $7.86 billion in the current year. But that includes federal funding, a major portion of the budget. The state share of spending grew from $2.72 billion to $2.94 billion in that period, about 8 percent.

Booth Gallogly said state spending would have gone up more had the cuts not been made. ""We would have had to either increase taxes or other revenues or reduce expenditures in areas that might have been Draconian,"" she said.

But there's no doubt that the Carcieri administration, mostly in concert with the General Assembly, helped save taxpayers a lot of money over the past eight years. If you take the most liberal interpretation claimed by the governor -- factoring in both past and future pension-reform and retiree health-care savings -- the final figure could be substantially more than $1 billion.

If you take the most conservative estimate -- only counting pension-reform and retiree health-care savings to date and excluding ""cost avoidance"" -- the final figure, by our calculation, would total in the neighborhood of $930 million. We take the moderate approach, rating Carcieri's claim ""Mostly True.""",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F01800>],/factchecks/2010/dec/05/donald-carcieri/carcieri-says-his-administration-saved-rhode-islan/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Kirk Watson']","
Kirk Watson says more than $3.5 billion intended for special purposes being diverted to make state's books look balanced
","
State Sen. Kirk Watson says he's going to fight budgetary gambits when lawmakers confront an expected shortfall in state budget revenue in the legislative session starting in January.

In a Nov. 15 speech outlining his self-titled honesty agenda, the Austin Democrat names among his concerns a tendency by past legislatures to balance the budget by dipping into state income that's supposed to fund specific needs and functions.

The result, Watson said, has ""diverted billions of dollars that had been promised to roads, parks, hospitals, clean air, utility bill relief, and other necessities – using it instead as a special piggy bank to make the books look balanced. In fact, over $3.5 billion of what people pay to support specific, basic needs and government functions is (currently) being diverted in this way. That's a lot of promises made and then broken. And this practice has grown -- more than doubled -- over the past decade.""

Watson mentioned the budget-balancing strategy again in an interview excerpted in the Nov. 28 Austin American-Statesman and in a Nov. 30 talk at the University of Texas where he listed three of the affected funds, saying: ""Folks, I could go on (listing them) all day.""

The lege gets blamed for lots of things; has it really been taking funds dedicated to necessities to make the books ""look balanced?""

History: The Texas Constitution forbids the state from running in the red. Lawmakers who write each two-year budget must satisfy the state comptroller that budgeted expenditures won't exceed what the state gathers in revenue. That's what it means to balance the budget.

Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal responded to our request for back-up evidence by sharing a spreadsheet prepared by the state comptroller's office. According to the spreadsheet, since the 1993 session, lawmakers have balanced budgets by tapping special accounts that collect money for specific purposes. Money taken from such accounts increased steadily through eight of the last nine budget periods, reaching more than $3.7 billion for fiscal 2010-11, which runs through August. All told, money spent in this fashion totals $18 billion.

So, Watson's $3.5 billion-plus number sticks.

According to the spreadsheet, more than 25 different accounts took hits from the 2009 Legislature. A category broadly termed ""All Other GR Dedicated Certification Accounts"" accounted for the largest single amount, $840 million. Next highest: nearly $671 million from the System Benefit Fund, which consists of proceeds from a tax on some utility bills intended to help low-income residents pay utility bills; $515 million from the Emissions Reduction Plan, which funds grants in targeted counties to address polluting heavy vehicles and equipment; and $331 million from an account called Designated Trauma Facility and EMS, which helps hospitals recover costs of uncompensated trauma care.

An August 2009 news article in The Houston Chronicle quotes Dale Craymer, a veteran budget watcher who's president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, saying of such transfers: ""It's kind of like having your (household) budget laid out and spending part of your food money on entertainment, or vice versa.""

Finally, we turned to the tail of Watson's statement--that shifting money from such funds make the books ""look balanced"" as opposed to actually balancing the budget.

For expert perspective, we contacted consultant Billy Hamilton of Austin. He was the deputy comptroller when then-State Comptroller John Sharp recommended that the 1991 Legislature -- then facing a $4 billion-plus revenue shortfall -- consolidate more than 300 state funds. That change laid the groundwork for lawmakers to use accumulated cash balances to help balance future budgets.

The comptroller's July 1991 Texas Performance Review report, Breaking the Mold, anticipated criticism of the funds' consolidation as an ""accounting trick."" It says: ""The truth of the matter is that under the state's constitutionally mandated cash-basis budgeting system, there is no trickery involved. Bond rating agencies, for example, see funds consolidation as a component of prudent fiscal management; the one-time revenue gain from such consolidation is a valid and immediate benefit of improving the structure of fiscal management.""

As it turned out, the ""one-time"" revenue gain gave lawmakers a budget-balancing tool they have wielded ever since. In an interview, Hamilton said subsequent legislatures used it to balance budgets while avoiding major tax changes, save a 2006 overhaul of the state's largest business tax and a hike in cigarette taxes.

Per Watson's statement, Hamilton said, ""As a matter of sound public policy, if you agree that the Legislature in the past has set up these dedicated accounts to accomplish certain public policy goals, they're certainly not being accomplished because the money is being effectively used for other purposes."" Then again, Hamilton said, ""just because (lawmakers) set up a fund, that doesn't mean there's an inherent requirement that they spend the money (on that purpose); the Legislature has the power to appropriate"" most state funds as desired.

Strolling into wonk territory, we also interviewed Craymer, who said the legislative practice of tapping special-purpose accounts doesn't mean the accounts won't someday recover money spent on other budget items. For instance, future legislatures could vote to replenish the funds from other sources and/or quit draining their dollars.

Craymer continued: Lawmakers ""are not spending the dedicated revenue, they're spending cash balances the revenue creates."" Say what? ""It's a distinction only an accountant could appreciate.""

Separately, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the comptroller's office, agreed that dollars made available from the special-purpose accounts actually helped balance the 2010-11 budget, rather than just making the books look balanced.

Maybe so, Watson acknowledged, but conversely, if lawmakers spent the dollars taken from a so-called dedicated account ""on its intended purpose, then they couldn't make the books look balanced because they wouldn't be"" -- meaning funding would fall short somewhere else in the budget. And Watson reminded that once money from such accounts is spent on other items, the dollars aren't available to pay for the needs they were originally intended to support.

Watson also noted that on May 27, 2009, Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told his Senate colleagues that the Legislature was ""unable to write an appropriations bill that would serve the needs of this state without relying to a fairly significant extent on surplus balances in our general-revenue dedicated funds.""

Ogden also said that a review of the practice would belong in a comprehensive assessment of the state's finances. ""At the end of the story,"" Ogden said, ""the obvious answer is a tax overhaul in the state of Texas. We really have a pretty rickety system right now.""

Bottom line: Watson accurately recaps the amount of money allocated from specific-purpose accounts for the 2010-11 state budget. But the shifting of funds doesn't just look like a book-balancing; it's for real.

We rate Watson's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3B9E40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/04/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-more-35-billion-intended-special-/
