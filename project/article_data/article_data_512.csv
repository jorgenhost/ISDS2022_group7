Fox News' Andrew Napolitiano says U.S. is still paying interest on World War I costs
","The recent fight over raising the debt ceiling -- the limit on how much debt the federal government can carry at a given time -- has brought added scrutiny to the history of the United States’ reliance on debt to finance its operations. During a recent Fox News interview, legal commentator Andrew Napolitano offered an arresting factoid. ""The government today will borrow money to pay debt on money it has already borrowed and spent,"" he said. ""I’ll give you one statistic. Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it. That’s 95 years ago."" Really? We’re still paying off the cost of World War I? We checked with experts to see if Napolitano is correct. The United States government borrowed a fair amount during the World War I era. Hostilities related to World War I began in 1914, but the United States officially entered the war against Germany in April 1917 and against Austria-Hungary in December 1917. According to Treasury Department statistics on annual debt loads for the United States, the nation’s total debt rose by $23.8 billion between July 1, 1916 (the last available figure before war was declared on Germany) and July 1, 1919 (the first available date after the armistice that ended the war). That’s less than Napolitano said, but a different Treasury data source -- the department’s annual report from June 1920 -- said the U.S. had borrowed a total of $37 billion to finance the war. These two figures average out to about $30 billion, so we’ll accept Napolitano’s figure as a plausible estimate. To finance the war, the government sold Liberty Bonds and Victory Loans. Our first thought upon hearing Napolitano’s claim was that there were still Americans with fraying security certificates in their safe deposit boxes who receive periodic interest payments from the Treasury. But this is not the case. When we contacted the Treasury Department for this story, officials did some digging and found that there are actually still eight Liberty Bonds and two Victory Notes that haven’t yet been redeemed. However, these financial instruments have been mature since 1947, so they haven’t earned any interest for almost 70 years. (Their total value, however, isn’t shabby -- almost $4.2 million.) Napolitano told PolitiFact that he wasn’t referring to ongoing interest payments. Instead, he was referring to the fact that the World War I-era debt was ""rolled over."" For further explanation, we turned to Linda M. Hooks, an economist at Washington & Lee University. ""The initial debt issued to pay for the war no longer exists,"" Hooks said. ""However, Treasury debt gets ‘rolled over.’ That is, the Treasury sells new bonds to pay off the old bonds that are maturing. So those bonds did mature and get paid off, but the Treasury sold new bonds to pay them off, and then sold new bonds when the second batch matured, and so on."" So, Hooks said, ""in that sense, you could say the debt is still out there. However, it would be very hard to assign any specific current bond to that specific historical incident."" Other experts are even more skeptical of Napolitano’s characterization of rolled-over debt as being ""not paid back."" Since the public debt has not been zeroed out since 1835, by Napolitano’s argument, ""we are still paying off Civil War debt or even the cost of the 1848 Mexican War,"" said Franklin Noll, a historian of United States government financial and monetary history. And that, he added, doesn’t make sense. Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agrees, calling Napolitano’s claim ""obviously false."" All rolling over debt means, he said, is that federal elected officials have decided that it makes more sense to borrow money to finance other priorities than to increase taxes. ""Every well-run business does this,"" Buchanan said. ""A company might borrow money to build a new office headquarters, and years later its total debt might be higher than it was when the headquarters was financed. That doesn't mean the company is still paying interest on the loans to build the headquarters. It means that the company found that it had better things to do with its money than reduce its debt. Any growing enterprise will do that, and the U.S. economy has been growing for over 200 years, with occasional setbacks."" Our ruling Napolitano said that ""Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it."" The original Liberty Bonds and Victory Notes stopped paying interest decades ago. But Napolitano argues that, because the United States has never subsequently zeroed out its debt, the original World War I debt has been rolled over countless times, leaving subsequent bondholders to pay off a small, ancestral fraction of that old debt. That’s one way of looking at it, but not a view that carries much weight with experts, who call the rollover method straightforward and uncontroversial. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/23/andrew-napolitano/fox-news-andrew-napolitiano-says-us-still-paying-i/

Marco Rubio says he never favored a government shutdown and voted to fully fund the government
","Now that the federal government shutdown is over, the blame game is well under way. On Fox News Sunday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., emphasized that he didn’t favor a government shutdown even though many observers have accused his party of instigating the shutdown as a way of defunding or delaying President Barack Obama’s health care law. On Oct. 20, 2013, host Chris Wallace asked Rubio whether he was ""really prepared to keep the government shut down"" when he voted against the final deal to re-open the government and avoid hitting the debt ceiling. ""Well, let me be clear,"" Rubio responded. ""I never was in favor of shutting down the government. I was never in favor of defunding the government. I was in favor of funding the government fully, voted to fund the government fully, made efforts to fund the government fully."" Later in the interview, Rubio reiterated, ""I never wanted there to be a government shutdown. … The people who shut down the government were the president and the Democrats in the Senate, who basically said that unless you fund … Obamacare, we are unwilling to fund the entire government. They took that position, and they forced this situation that we've just gone through."" Rubio has a point that Democrats, including Obama, ought to shoulder some of the responsibility for the government shutdown. Democrats decided that voting to continue funding the government on the Republicans’ terms was too bitter a pill to swallow, and ultimately that turned out to be a successful negotiating position. But that doesn’t absolve them of all responsibility for the government closure. In this item, however, we are looking at the flip side -- namely, whether Rubio is right that ""I never was in favor of shutting down the government. … (I) voted to fund the government fully."" We’ll take the two parts of this question separately. (Rubio’s office did not respond to inquiries for this story.) ""I never was in favor of shutting down the government."" It’s true that on multiple occasions, Rubio stated publicly that he didn’t want to shut down the government. On Sept. 27, 2013, he told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News that ""I don't know of any Republicans in favor of a government shutdown. … The truth is, this isn't about shutting down the government. This is about shutting down Obamacare."" In a Capitol hallway interview with reporters the same day, Rubio said something virtually identical. He has frequently deflected blame on Democratic leaders for pushing a shutdown. However, we found two examples of Rubio stating support for positions that made the shutdown possible, even inevitable. • At a July 11, 2013, Washington breakfast sponsored by the Concerned Veterans for America and The Weekly Standard, Rubio advocated stripping Obamacare funding from the next temporary government spending measure, known as a ""continuing resolution."" ""We should not pass a continuing resolution, and I will not vote for a continuing resolution unless it defunds Obamacare for the period of time of the continuing resolution. I'd like to see it permanently repealed, but at a minimum, we should agree to do that."" Preventing passage of a continuing resolution would deny operating funds for the federal government and effectively shut it down. • Along the same lines, Rubio was quoted in the Washington Times on July 24, 2013, as saying, ""The argument I’ve made to my colleagues is that there are some issues that are so fundamental that we have to be willing to go all the way on them. I think Obamacare is one of them."" In this context, going ""all the way"" meant opposing a continuing resolution. We know this because the set-up to that quote in the Washington Times paraphrased Rubio as saying, in the Times’ words, that ""Republican opposition to President Obama’s health care law is so integral to the party’s principles that his colleagues should be ready to reject any spending bills that fund the reforms."" So these two sets of comments show that Rubio said he was comfortable pursuing a strategy that could lead to a government shutdown. Rubio ""voted to fund the government fully"" In numerous Senate votes immediately before and during the shutdown, Rubio sided with Republicans in opposing Democratic bills that would have implemented a ""clean"" continuing resolution -- that is, a bill to resume funding the government that didn’t include other conditions, particularly those backed by Republicans that would have defunded or delayed Obamacare. • Senate votes 206, 207, 208 and 209 on Sept. 27. In each of these votes, including both procedural and substantive votes, Rubio joined most Republicans in voting against a ""clean"" continuing resolution. He did so because the measure in question continued to fund Obamacare, a policy he opposed. Still, had he voted for these bills, they would have funded the government ""fully."" • Senate votes 210 and 211 on Sept. 30. In both votes, Rubio sided with Republicans in opposing a Senate Democratic move to strip anti-Obamacare provisions from a continuing resolution that had been passed by the House and that would have otherwise funded the government. • Senate vote 216 on Oct. 12. Rubio voted against another Democratic effort to pass a ""clean"" continuing resolution. The vote failed to reach the required 60-vote threshold because the Democrats couldn’t persuade any Republicans to break ranks. (Senate votes 213, 214 and 215 were not directly related to the shutdown.) • Senate vote 218 and 219 on Oct. 16. Senate leaders from both parties crafted a deal designed to end the shutdown, and it passed, 81-18. But Rubio was one of the Republicans who voted against it, both on a procedural vote and on the measure itself. (Senate vote 217 was unrelated to the shutdown.) The Rubio vote that comes closest to qualifying as one to ""fund the government fully"" was Senate vote 212 on Oct. 1. Rubio joined Republicans in voting against tabling (that is, setting aside and ignoring) a House request to convene a joint House-Senate conference committee to consider the bill the Senate had rejected on Sept. 30. The House-backed bill that failed in the Senate would have funded the government but delayed the individual mandate in the health care bill, eliminated employer premium cost-sharing for congressional workers forced to purchase plans on the Obamacare marketplace, and requested the bicameral negotiating conference. By voting not to table this request, Rubio did effectively keep alive a legislative vehicle that would have ended the shutdown, only with conditions that Democrats considered unacceptable. So that’s one vote that might be used to support this half of Rubio’s claim. But it’s outweighed by nine other votes in which Rubio opposed measures to re-open the government or opposed advancing such a bill through the legislative process. We shared our findings with Rubio's office and asked for their comments, but we didn't receive a response. Our ruling Rubio appears to be making the case that he would have liked to have achieved his goals without having to shut down the government, and that he would have been happy to fund the government fully if doing so was paired with provisions defunding or delaying Obamacare. He may have felt that way, but both of the specific claims he makes are problematic. His claim that ""I never was in favor of shutting down the government"" is undercut by two separate comments in which he supported a strategy of opposing Obamacare even if that meant rejecting a bill that would have kept the government open. And on the question of whether he ""voted to fund the government fully,"" he arguably may have done so once, but took the opposite position nine times. Given the political realities of the budget battle, Rubio's words and actions suggest he wanted Obamacare defunded more than he wanted to keep the government open. As we noted, where responsibility for the shutdown is concerned, it takes two to tango. But in this case, there’s very little to support Rubio’s twin claims. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-he-never-favored-government-shutd/

Chris Abele says his budget for improvements in county parks is biggest in a decade
","Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele was brimming with optimism and lung power when he addressed the future of Milwaukee County government in an Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. In one breath, he unleashed this accounting: ""A couple of years ago if anybody had said, ‘Hey in a few years the county will have a higher credit rating than anyone would guess it would have, would have a deficit that’s almost on its way out, would be on its second operating surplus with a surplus number higher than it’s been in years, would have a parks capital budget that’s bigger than it’s been in the last 10 years and is going to catch up on deferred maintenance, has a child-support service department that with less staff is hitting all-time records in the history of the department’ -- If anybody had told you that a couple years ago, people might have said, some people would have said, ‘No.’ Exhale. A Public Policy Forum report in October 2013 confirmed improvements in county finances under Abele, who won election in 2011 when Scott Walker left to become governor. But Abele’s boast about spending on major parks improvements in Milwaukee County was a new one on us. Abele has received plaudits for putting money into long-neglected central-city parks in Milwaukee, but recently drew criticism for proposing closure of two indoor pools at parks where he would replace them with a splash pad or a skateboard park. Has Abele set a new standard for capital improvements in parks countywide? We started with the adopted 2013 budget, because Abele’s office told us his claim referred to that year and because, for reasons we will explain, it was the first year in which Abele had total control over capital spending. Abele’s 2014 budget proposal is awaiting action by the County Board. First stop, the county’s capital budget book. The book contains the official numbers on capital improvements, which in the Parks Department include things such as fixing leaky pools, building new picnic shelters, paving parkways, replacing walkways and other major work. Going back 10 years puts you at 2004, two years into Walker’s tenure as county executive. We found four years with higher budgeted totals than 2013 -- all predating Abele. There is one wrinkle: Under Walker, the county doubled up its borrowing for capital improvements in 2009 and 2010 -- in effect borrowing for four years, including 2011 and 2012 too. That was so it could get federal subsidies to lower its normal borrowing costs, under President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus plan. Adjusting for that by spreading that over four years, we actually found six years in the decade with a higher parks capital budget than 2013. Another way to look at it When we asked Abele spokesman Brendan Conway for backup on the exec’s claim, he provided a 2013 parks capital budget figure that was more than double the amount in the budget book. Conway said it included parks-related projects and major maintenance that is spread around the county budget but not tallied under parks capital because other departments supervise the work. For example: Road construction on a county parkway. Abele’s not the first county executive to pull together the numbers that way. In fact, county finance officials told us it’s a legitimate alternative. But the list itself was a bit too broad. It included, for instance, a tally for countywide sanitary sewer repairs ordered by the state. What’s more, Conway didn’t provide any prior years for comparison. So we asked the county official in charge of capital finance, Pamela Bryant, to use Abele’s method to generate a decade’s worth of numbers. Bryant works for the independently elected county comptroller, Scott Manske. Before running her analysis, she conferred with Abele’s office and they came to an agreement on what to include using the broader method, Bryant told us. Bryant developed two tables that dealt with the ""double borrowing"" issue in different ways. In one table, 2007 and 2010 parks-related capital spending outpaced 2013. In the other, there were three years in which parks-related capital spending was higher than in 2013. It wasn’t close in two instances. In 2011 (Walker’s last budget) and 2012, the spending was about $4 million to $7 million higher than the $14.8 million in 2013. As we mentioned, that was the first budget over which Abele had total control over capital spending due to the stimulus-related borrowing for 2012. In addition, the 2007 budget was just a shade over Abele’s 2013 mark, though if inflation were factored in, the gap would grow. Our rating Abele told Rotarians that Milwaukee County has a ""parks capital budget that’s bigger than it’s been in the last 10 years."" By any measure, this claim misses the mark. While Abele’s 2013 budget funded parks capital at a higher level than at least six other budgets in the decade, it’s not close to the leader. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/23/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-his-budget-improvements-county-pa/

Anti-abortion activist Barth Bracy says people who buy health insurance on the Rhode Island Obamacare exchange must pay Gov. Chafee's mandatory abortion fee
","The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, is controversial enough. But the question of coverage for abortion adds yet another layer of contentiousness. Antiabortion activists do not want their premiums used to pay for a procedure they regard as murder. They have been pushing without success to require the Rhode Island health insurance exchange, known as HealthSource RI, to give consumers a choice by offering plans that do not include abortion coverage. Barth Bracy, executive director of the Rhode Island Right to Life Committee, said in an Oct. 2  news release that because no plans on the exchange exclude abortion coverage, all customers must pay a fee for such coverage -- and Governor Lincoln Chafee is responsible. Wrote Bracy: ""We have been fighting in the General Assembly since 2011 trying to blunt Chafee’s extreme agenda on government subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion-on-demand and, more recently, his imposition of a mandatory abortion fee on all Rhode Island individuals, families and businesses who wish to purchase health insurance through HealthSource RI."" We wanted to know whether there really is a separate, mandatory abortion fee and, if so, whether Chafee had anything to do with it. First, a little background. Chafee created Rhode Island’s health insurance exchange in September 2011 through an executive order after an effort to do so through legislation stalled in the General Assembly over abortion language. Abortion opponents, including close to 40 legislators, sued to overturn the order. The lawsuit is pending in Superior Court. When we asked Bracy for the source of his claim, he sent us to the ""Special Rules"" portion of the Obamacare law (Section 18023 of the U.S. Code). Beginning with paragraph b(2)B, the law says the entity that issues an insurance plan through an exchange must ""collect from each enrollee . . . a separate payment"" for money that will be used for abortion coverage. (How much is that payment? The insurance companies are required under the law to break out the monthly cost of abortion coverage based on the assumption that everyone gets abortion coverage. If it's less than $1 per subscriber, it is considered to be $1. For all of the plans in the Rhode Island marketplace, it's the $1 minimum.) This separate payment for abortion coverage would certainly seem to meet the definition of the ""abortion fee"" Bracy is referring to. It turns out to be a hidden fee. ""The customer is not billed a separate fee,"" Dara Chadwick, spokeswoman for HealthSource RI said in an email. The way the system is set up, the issuer of each plan (an insurance company  such as Blue Cross) does not bill the customer directly. HealthSource RI does. She asserted that another portion of the law, subsection b(3), prohibits separate billing because abortion services can only be mentioned in the summary of benefits when the person is enrolled. We're not convinced, but that's a side issue. Regardless of the mechanics of this fee and whether or not consumers see it, it's clear that the fee is required by federal law. It was not imposed by Chafee. Bracy said Chafee is responsible because there are insurance plans that exclude abortion coverage, yet none are being offered by the Rhode Island marketplace. More important, he said, the Chafee administration could have offered people a choice and made such a plan part of the exchange, but didn’t. (By 2017, all exchanges must offer a plan that doesn’t cover abortion.) ""The fact that ALL the Exchange plans do cover elective abortion, and thus there is no exception to the abortion premium (thereby making it mandatory for all who wish to purchase insurance through the exchange), can rightly be attributed to Chafee,"" said Bracy. Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger disagreed. ""It would be inappropriate for the governor to dictate what is or is not covered. It's the Executive Committee on Health Reform that determined the benchmark plan and the essential health benefits."" The plans the insurance companies chose to submit covered abortion. Our ruling Rhode Island Right to Life's Executive Director Barth Bracy said Governor Chafee has imposed ""a mandatory abortion fee"" on all Rhode Islanders who buy health insurance under Obamacare. There is a fee, whether it's hidden in the bill or presented as a line item as the law seems to require. That element of his statement is accurate. Did Chafee impose the fee? That's a big stretch. It’s a federal requirement, although Chafee, who created the insurance exchange system in Rhode Island, could have pushed for a plan that didn’t cover abortion, which would have allowed antiabortion consumers to have a choice on the issue. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

Huffington Post's Sam Stein says 'no one beta-tested' health insurance marketplace website
","The rollout of the Obama administration’s health insurance marketplaces website has been so roiled with problems -- from a pricing glitch, to flawed data, to widespread log-in fails -- that even journalists from left-leaning media are calling for top officials to be hauled before Congress. But while appearing on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Huffington Post political editor Sam Stein went a bit too far in criticizing the agency’s prep work before the Oct. 1 launch of healthcare.gov. Or at least that's what he told us when we asked him. ""It seems from all of the reporting, and from what I can gather, that up until very recently they (the Obama administration) didn’t realize how bad this was going to go out,"" Stein said on MSNBC. ""And no one beta-tested the site, which is almost criminal when you think about it."" The beta-testing line got picked up by conservative outlets such as the National Review and the Blaze, and we wanted to check it out. Stein directed us to a Washington Examiner report with a headline that somewhat contradicted his statement, which he acknowledged: ""Troubled Obamacare website wasn’t tested until a week before launch."" ""Unfortunately, in the rush of cable news, I didn't add the clause ‘until a week before launch,’ "" Stein told us. ""I should have done that and apologize."" That’s true. But Stein is more right than even he thinks, in part because he inadvertently used the word ""beta""  to describe the specific website testing. In the IT world, there are many kinds of tests under many kinds of names. Put another way, Stein goofed -- but by goofing, he got closer to the truth. Here’s what you need to know. The Examiner story, quoting someone speaking anonymously, said officials did not allow testing on the website until just days before it went live Oct. 1. The biggest problem, according to this report and others, was that leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided to act as the central coordinator for the project (CMS would not tell the Examiner if the agency holds that role). The next day, the Washington Post described how government officials and contractors proceeded with the rollout despite a botched crucial test days earlier. They ran a simulation, unsuccessfully, in which a few hundred people tried to log onto the website at the same time. The failure proved an early warning of the bumpy road to come. Officials went forward with the launch, and the website ""locked up"" almost immediately when 2,000 users tried step one, the Post reported. Unnamed sources told the Post that an end-to-end trial run of the process did not happen by as late as Sept. 26, the week before the launch. (Here at PolitiFact we don't rely on unnamed sources, but the reports from the Examiner and the Post appear credible.) ""Beta testing"" is a very specific term in the tech world that most professional software goes through before launching. It comes after a product is in an ""alpha"" phase, or the earliest version of software that is subject to some tests to find any big issues. When a product reaches beta, it is tested by a larger group of people not connected to its development in an effort to gather feedback and make more fixes before a large-scale launch. Big tech companies like Google sometimes launch products in beta mode, but enterprise and government software vendors don’t usually do it that way, said Alexander Howard, former Washington correspondent for tech-centric O’Reilly Media and a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. They stop adding features in the months preceding a launch to ""start testing the heck out of it,"" Howard said. The development of healthcare.gov has been an entirely different story, he said, with no use of those terms. ""The only thing we have is reporting that says the first testing occurred the last week before it went live, and then it went live,"" Howard said. ""There was testing, but it’s not clear that it was in a beta version."" According to published reports, healthcare.gov got additional features quite close to the launch, with no evidence of a consumer-centric test that went outside of the government. So Stein might have inartfully used the word beta-testing, but he might also have a point. ""Even if those tests nominally did occur, they were as good as nonexistent based on the complexity of the project,"" said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist. Testing of any kind was difficult because the specifications for the website were evolving the month before the website went up, said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project Hope and former Medicare director under former President George H. W. Bush. The Post story, by the way, said a test group of 10 insurers that had access to the site advised the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that the site was not ready to launch nationwide. Insurers have been in ""regular communication"" with government officials and contractors to test the back end of the site dealing with enrollment, Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, told us. But most people are getting hung up on the earliest steps of setting up an account and verifying who they are. We reached out to CMS and CGI Federal, one of the main contractors for the website, but did not hear back. (We suspect they’re busy.) Our ruling Here’s what Stein said: ""No one beta-tested"" healthcare.gov. Stein, in fact, meant to say something else, he told us. But at PolitiFact we check the statements as they are made. In this case, Stein is closer to the truth than maybe even he thought. Stein specifically referred to beta testing on MSNBC, which is a phrase that traditionally means certain members of the public were allowed to access the website well before it opened. There's no evidence to suggest that happened, and the federal government isn't talking. Ultimately, this is a glitch of a statement talking about the glitches of a website.

Davis opposes late-term abortions, with certain exceptions
","The day state Sen. Wendy Davis announced her run for governor, Texas Right to Life announced it would air a radio ad calling her an ""abortion zealot."" Audio that the anti-abortion group released Oct. 3, 2013, of its ad said, ""Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion."" That’s a clear-cut statement, which the group also had on its website. An Oct. 3, 2013, entry on the site said that Davis’s ""views are so fanatical that she opposes any safeguards for the unborn at any stage of pregnancy, up to and including the final weeks before birth… (Davis) thoroughly aired her abortion views during her 11-hour filibuster in June in her failed attempt to block the new Pro-Life law from passing."" A spokeswoman for the group, Melissa Conway, told us by phone that her group could not immediately provide backup information. Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, was indelibly linked to abortion issues by her June 25, 2013, filibuster, which made headlines worldwide and briefly helped derail changes in law intended to restrict abortions. Campaign spokesman Bo Delp told us by email it’s incorrect to say Davis opposes any limits. ""Like most Texans, Sen. Davis opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest or in the case of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities,"" Delp said. Delp’s response fits with an Oct. 5, 2013, news story in the Austin American-Statesman saying that Davis, while addressing the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2013, was asked, ""Could you discuss what legal limits on abortion you do support?"" She replied, ""You know, the Supreme Court has made that decision. And it’s one of the protected liberties under our Constitution. And I respect the constitutional protections that are in place today."" The Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v Wade struck down a Texas law that banned all abortions except those performed to save the mother’s life. The justices ruled then that states can’t restrict or ban abortions in the first trimester (roughly three months or the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy). Their ruling said, though, that states can make laws governing abortions in the second trimester if the laws are ""reasonably related"" to the woman’s health. After the point at which fetuses attain ""viability,"" meaning they can survive outside the womb, states can limit or ban abortions unless the woman’s life is in danger, the court held. So in her response in Washington, Davis signaled that she both accepts letting states limit abortions after the first trimester and limit or ban abortions after fetuses are viable, unless the mother’s life is at risk.   Elected to the Senate in 2008, Davis voted in 2009 and 2011 against state legislation requiring women to get sonograms before having an abortion. The measure passed into law in 2011 requires doctors performing abortions to provide a sonogram 24 hours before the abortion and describe what the image shows, including the fetus' size, body features and internal organs. Her 2013 filibuster delayed, but didn’t prevent the Republican-majority Legislature from approving restrictions that will soon begin taking effect. Starting Oct. 29, 2013, the law bans abortions after the 20th week post-fertilization, except when the woman’s life is endangered or in cases of severe fetal abnormality; requires abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic; and beefs up regulations on the dispensing of abortion-inducing drugs. Starting Sept. 1, 2014, the law requires that all abortion clinics meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers. In its October news story, the Statesman quoted a Davis adviser as saying that Davis would not have picked a fight over the 20-week provision by itself. However, she indicated in the early part of her filibuster that she was opposed to that provision on medical grounds. ""From our medical community, we’ve heard the concern that this interferes with the practice of medicine,"" Davis said, according to CounterPath Press’ transcript of the filibuster. ""As important, we know that concerns have been raised that this ban interferes with a woman’s health care decision before she and her doctor may have important health information about her own health and the health of the pregnancy."" Repeatedly during the filibuster, Davis said that a major reason she opposed the legislation was that in her view, its provisions were not intended to make women safer but to make sure fewer abortions were performed.

Celebrated chef Tom Colicchio tweets that relatively little debt accumulated under Barack Obama
","Tom Colicchio is a celebrated chef, restauranteur and reality TV personality. But how is he as a political tweeter? We recently noticed a tweet Colicchio sent to his 420,000-plus followers on Oct. 20, 2013, that offered the percentage increase in the federal debt under the past five presidents. Here’s the text of the tweet: ""Debt increase by POTUS: ""Reagan 186% ""Bush 54% ""Clinton 41% ""Bush II 72% ""Obama 23% ... ""Interesting."" This sounded familiar -- in 2011, we fact-checked a claim by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that President Barack Obama ""increased the debt"" by 16 percent, compared to George W. Bush, who increased it by 115 percent. We gave that claim a Pants on Fire. Colicchio’s claim is slightly different, and it comes almost two and a half years after Pelosi’s, so we decided to take a new look. Did the debt increase by 23 percent under Obama, a lower rate than under any president going back to Ronald Reagan? Because the most easily accessible Web data covers different time periods, we turned to two sources. The Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" feature, which tracks the debt on a day-to-day basis, goes back to 1993, so we used that source for Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. For Reagan and George H.W. Bush, we used Office of Management and Budget historical data, which shows the debt level at the end of the fiscal year. That’s not a perfect fit with presidential terms -- the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 while the president is sworn in on the following Jan. 20 -- but we determined it was close enough for a rough estimate. So how do the presidents stack up when you measure the raw increase in debt during their tenure -- the specific statistic the tweet appears to cite? Here’s the list: Reagan: Up 188 percent George H.W. Bush: Up 52 percent Clinton: Up 37 percent George W. Bush: Up 86 percent Obama: Up 61 percent So the tweet is wrong both on Obama’s percentage (the actual percentage increase in the debt was more than double what the tweet said it was) and on his relative position compared to the other presidents (Obama was in the middle of the pack rather than presiding over the smallest debt increase). However, another method of measuring presidential debt increases is superior to these raw numbers. This method adjusts the numbers to neutralize the impact of time, inflation and population growth -- issues that can skew debt comparison. We do this by tracking debt as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here’s how the numbers shake out: Reagan: Up 20.6 percentage points, or 2.6 points per year in office George H.W. Bush: Up 13.0 percentage points, or 3.3 points per year in office Clinton: Down 9.7 percentage points, or down 1.2 points per year in office George W. Bush: Up 28.7 percentage points, or 3.6 points per year in office Obama: Up 21.4 percentage points, or 5.4 points per year in office So by this measurement, Obama’s debt accumulation per year actually ranks as the most profligate record of any of the past five presidents -- quite the opposite conclusion of the tweet. We should note that presidents have some impact on the debt accrued during their tenure, but that impact is not all-encompassing. While presidents propose budgets and sign off, along with Congress, on final spending and revenue numbers, debt tends to go up during recessions, and Obama came into office with a doozy of a recession under way. That’s surely affected his numbers. We’ll also note that Obama has made progress on a related, but distinct, issue -- shrinking the annual federal deficit. People sometimes confuse deficits and debt. There’s a deficit if more money was spent in a given year than came in. But if you add up all the past deficits (and subtract all the past surpluses), the resulting figure, if it’s negative, is the ""debt."" And in this case, the tweet discussed the total debt, not annual deficits. When we contacted Colicchio, he quickly emailed us to walk back his tweet: ""This info was tweeted to me. I simply tweeted it and said it was interesting. Thanks for the info."" Shortly after that, he took it down. Our ruling Colicchio tweeted that under President Barack Obama, the debt has increased by 23 percent, a smaller rise than under any president going back to Ronald Reagan. Using the same method as the tweet, the actual increase under Obama was much higher -- 61 percent -- leaving Obama in the middle of the pack of the five presidents. Adjusting for each president’s time in office and the size of the economy actually puts Obama atop list of debt-creating presidents. We rate Colicchio’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/22/tom-colicchio/celebrated-chef-tom-colicchio-tweets-relatively-li/

Bartiromo says Obamacare is turning us into 'a part-time employment country'
","Among the many problems that critics of Obamacare like to highlight, one of the more common is that the health care law undermines jobs and the economy. This was Maria Bartiromo’s theme when she was on NBC’s Meet the Press. Bartiromo, anchor of CNBC’s Closing Bell, said the glitches that have beset the rollout of Obamacare are not the only issue. ""Businesses have changed their plans as a result of Obamacare,"" Bartiromo said. ""We are becoming something of a part-time employment country. We're seeing some groups moved off of health care from business because business is complaining that it's too expensive."" If we boil that down, we have this claim to check: ""As a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country."" Our research finds Bartiromo’s claim flawed. Not because we don’t have a lot of part-timers. We do. But the overwhelming driver is a lackluster recovery, not Obamacare. And when you look at the past, the percentage of part-timers has been even higher than it is today. A closer look We contacted CNBC and they pointed us to a couple of articles on Bartiromo’s behalf. One from Red Alert Politics, a website affiliated with the Weekly Standard and Washington Examiner, gave examples of companies that have said they will shift or might shift to using more part-time help. They said they would do this to avoid the Obamacare rule that firms of 50 or more employees must offer health insurance to anyone working 30 hours or more. The list included White Castle, the hamburger chain, and Trig’s, a Wisconsin supermarket chain. (The rule, which was supposed to go into effect Jan. 1, 2014, has been delayed by one year.) Another item was an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. The CEO of a company that owns several fast-food chains, among them Hardee’s, made the claim that the ""numbers show"" that Obamacare is affecting hiring. The proof? The job numbers that came right after the administration announced in early July a one-year delay of the requirement that all larger employers offer health insurance. ""Full-time job creation rebounded and part-time employment subsided,"" the CEO, Andrew Puzder, wrote. ""In July and August, the economy lost 20,000 part-time jobs and added 132,000 full-time jobs."" But that's a historical trend that coincides with the American summer; not necessarily a statement on Obamacare. Between June and August, historically, part-time employment falls and full-time employment increases -- partly because better weather boosts seasonal work in the construction and tourism industries. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that between 2003 and 2007, the average drop in part-time work was -.28 percent from July to August, while the average rise in full-time employment was 0.2 percent. It’s also worth noting that the firms that have announced plans to reduce hours for part-timers tend to be in fast food and retail. These industries might have a special reason to keep an eye on the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act. They tend to use part-timers more than other sectors of the economy. The average hours worked per week by non-supervisory staff in fast-food restaurants was 25.7 in 2012 and in retail, the figure was 31.6. But for financial services, it was 37.4, manufacturing was 40.7 and construction was 38.8. For fast-food and retail, increasing the use of part-time work could be a viable strategy. That doesn’t mean they represent the entire job market. It’s the economy A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco puts the current situation into context. The recession drove up the fraction of part-time workers from about 17 percent in 2007 to a peak of 19.7 percent in 2010. It has declined since then. As of the latest data, it stands at 19 percent. The study’s bottom line is that recessions drive up the fraction of the workforce who are in part-time jobs when they would rather be working full-time. The 1983 recession pushed the share of part-timers to 20.3 percent. That’s significantly higher than the peak for the 2008 recession. What’s different this time though is that the part-time employment rate has remained higher for many more months than in past recessions. The authors put the cause squarely at the feet of the overall economy. ""The U.S. labor market has recovered only about three-fourths of the jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath, which leaves finding a full-time job still challenging for many workers,"" they said. ""General labor market slack remains the key factor keeping part-time employment high."" The report considers whether the Affordable Care Act could be shaping employers' hiring decisions, but concludes that other factors -- including long-standing IRS rules -- suggest the ACA has not made a significant change. ""Before the law was passed, most large employers already faced IRS rules that prevented them from denying available health benefits to full-time workers. These rules gave employers an incentive to create part-time jobs to avoid rising health benefit costs."" Our ruling Bartiromo said under Obamacare ""we are becoming something of a part-time employment country."" There is anectdotal evidence that some companies are or will reduce the hours of some employees. But those individual instances fail to make a case of moving to a ""part-time employment country."" Government numbers actually show that the fraction of part-timers in the workforce has declined since 2010 and in a longer historical perspective, the share of part-timers was less during this recession than in the downturn of 1983. The argument that the delay of the employer mandate boosted full-time hires is suspect. We see the same trend in previous years well before President Barack Obama was elected. An independent analysis suggests that the lack of full-time work is the most significant explanation for a persistently high share of part-time work in the labor force. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/22/maria-bartiromo/bartiromo-says-obamacare-turning-us-part-time-empl/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Common Core is turning U.S. Education Department into a national school board, Rubio says
","The Common Core education standards were the topic of contentious public meetings in Florida this month. Now they’re coming between two of Florida’s top Republicans -- U.S. Sen Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush. Bush appeared on ABC’s Sunday morning news show This Week to discuss his Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was hosting a conference in Boston. During the interview, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl noted that a lot of conservatives are suspicious of Common Core. ""I mean Marco Rubio said not long ago, it’s (Common Core) increasingly being used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a National School Board."" Bush responded: ""Based on the facts as I know them, that’s not accurate. Marco's concerned about a national curriculum, and I am as well. There's a big fear on the right about this massive government overreach. I totally appreciate that. But that’s not what this is. This is a national imperative. It’s not a federal government program."" We couldn’t resist fact-checking a disagreement on the facts between Rubio and Bush, both of whom are considered possible presidential candidates for 2016. We tracked down Rubio’s original comments to a statement he gave to the Tampa Bay Times on July 26: ""Common Core started out as a well-intentioned effort to develop more rigorous curriculum standards. However, it is increasingly being used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board. This effort to coerce states into adhering to national curriculum standards is not the best way to help our children attain the best education. Empowering parents, local communities and the individual states is the best approach."" (That statement to the Times followed an interview that Rubio had given to the conservative Shark Tank blog the day before.) We decided to check whether the Obama administration has used Common Core to ""turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board."" Common Core is about standards Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, including Florida. They came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Obama administration has used its education grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Rubio said that the Obama administration would turn the Education Department into ""what is effectively a national school board."" His office didn't answer our questions about what he meant by his comments. We should note that school boards have a variety of duties, including setting budgets and dealing with school finances. But Rubio specifically mentioned curriculum, which means selecting what students study. So we'll focus our fac-tchecking on questions of curriculum. We looked into the claim that Common Core ""nationalizes"" curriculum in 2012. Back then, five education experts told us they disagreed that Common Core standards nationalize curriculum. Experts told us that setting standards -- such as understanding decimals or reading comprehension -- isn’t the same as telling educators what curriculum to use to teach those standards. ""It describes a destination -- again, voluntary for states -- not the means of getting there,"" Chester Finn, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Education in the 1980s who is president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education. ""Yes, if a bunch of states faithfully implement it (45 have signed up but many won't seriously implement them), it will bring greater commonality to what is taught across the country in those two subjects. In my view that's a good thing. Why should 5th graders in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Ore., be learning different math?"" We ran Rubio’s comments by the state Department of Education and other education experts. They told us that under Common Core, the federal government has not supplanted the role of state and local officials to make curriculum decisions. While Common Core are standards, the decisions about what books teachers should use to meet the standards are decisions made at the state and local level. In fact, federal law predating Common Core prohibits ""an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s curriculum..."" The law bans the federal use of funds to ""endorse, approve, or sanction any curriculum designed to be used in an elementary school or secondary school."" At the local level, the authority to set school curriculum doesn’t necessarily lie with the school board. For example, in Hillsborough County, committees of content specialists -- many of them teachers -- review the state approved list of textbooks and narrow it down to three finalists. Then, teachers in that specialty area vote on a final pick, and the school board votes on approving the money to buy that textbook. A spokesman for Pasco County schools told us emphatically that Common Core doesn’t create anything like a national school board. ""To suggest that the Obama administration is meddling in state and district curriculum decisions is not supported by the facts,"" Linda Cobbe, spokeswoman for Pasco schools told PolitiFact. ""First of all, who in state leadership would allow that to happen in Florida? Second, the Pasco district is writing our own curriculum and selecting our own textbooks to meet the Common Core standards, and neither the president nor Arnie Duncan has had any input."" We also found similar explanations in a presentation developed by the Florida Department of Education and Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s staff. It states: ""Standards are not curriculum. The standards describe ‘the what’ that students need to learn; however, they do not spell out ‘the how’ for teachers. Curriculum and instruction define ‘the how.’ ‘The how’ is determined at the local levels; the district, the school and the classroom."" This means that districts across Florida -- and the nation -- could make different curriculum decisions to achieve the same standards. We found several examples nationwide of local school districts of setting their own curriculum in response to Common Core. (And there are even Common Core consultants that districts can hire.) Some English teachers in Miami-Dade County are already making changes to their reading lists, according to an article by the Hechinger Report, a news outlet affiliated with Teachers College at Columbia University. A teacher at Coral Reef Senior High moved some novels including To Kill a Mockingbird and The Great Gatsby off the syllabus and replaced them with nonfiction texts, short stories and plays. The new standards call for more challenging reading, so the teacher added Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night and Cyrano de Bergerac. In Wisconsin, the Germantown school district is planning its science curriculum around Common Core and might offer biology to students earlier in high school than in the past and blend various strands of science for a more rigorous curriculum, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote. In Oregon, the Tigard-Tualatin School District has added more nonfiction reading to its curriculum. ""As an adult you spend most of your time engaged in informational text,"" said Sue Scott, Tigard-Tualatin’s associate director of curriculum and instruction. The Oregonian reported: ""Take dinosaurs — an instructional text could be an encyclopedia-like entry about pterodactyls, a chart categorizing different species as herbivores, carnivores and omnivore or notes from a fossil dig."" The Louisiana Department of Education has provided teachers with some sample Common Core lesson plans, but no specific curriculum. ""The flexibility is meant to empower school districts and teachers to make up their own lesson plans..."" the Times-Picayune reported. Our ruling Rubio said that Common Core is being ""used by the Obama Administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board."" That makes it sound like the federal government is telling local school districts what to teach under Common Core. Our reporting showed that’s not the case. Decisions about curriculum lie where they did before Common Core: with state and local education officials. The U.S. Education Department has been given no new power by Obama -- or anyone else -- to act like a school board and dictate which math or reading books are used at schools across the country.

Broun uses only negative scenario in GAO report
","Among the Republican Party, President Barack Obama’s health care plan doesn’t have a lot of fans. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, has been criticized for cost, requirements and supposed federal overreach. Days before enrollment opened on Oct. 1, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, took another shot at Obamacare in an Augusta Chronicle editorial. ""Three years ago President Obama touted his 2,700-page health care plan as the solution to our nation’s health care needs … But since that time, statistic after statistic proved these statements false, causing the president’s promises to fall flat,"" Broun said in the Sept. 29 piece. ""According to a report released by the Government Accountability Office, Obamacare will increase the long-term federal deficit by $6.2 trillion."" Such a large figure immediately triggered our curiosity. That $6.2 trillion is more than a third of the country’s $16.7 trillion national debt right now, a staggering amount that we had to investigate. Broun is one of several Republican candidates seeking the seat held by retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss. He used the editorial to promote his own health care plan, the Patient OPTION Act. Broun’s plan fully repeals the Affordable Care Act, makes all health care expenses 100 percent tax-deductible and lets families buy health insurance across state lines, he said. (At press time, Broun’s Patient OPTION Act -- introduced in August with no co-sponsors -- sat in a House subcommittee.) We asked his office about the source for his $6.2 trillion statement. A spokeswoman said the figures were taken from articles in conservative publications, including the Heritage Foundation’s Foundry blog and National Review. This $6.2 trillion figure has been bandied about by conservative politicos for some time. Our PolitiFact Virginia colleagues have examined a similar claim made by a congressman from that state, who received a Mostly False rating for creating a misleading claim about the GAO report. The articles Broun referenced based the $6.2 trillion claim on a January 2013 GAO report -- requested by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. -- examining the health care law’s impact on the federal budget over the next 75 years. The report found that the impact depends largely on whether cost-controlling elements of the health care law are sustained long term, and considered two scenarios. In the optimistic scenario where the law and those cost provisions -- including reductions in Medicare payments and hospital readmission -- are fully implemented, the health care law is expected to reduce the federal deficit by 1.5 percent over 75 years. The second scenario assumes the cost-containment provisions are phased out starting in 2019. Doing that would mean the law would increase the deficit by 0.7 percent over the same time period. Under either scenario, the GAO report noted, models show that the federal budget is on an unsustainable fiscal path, driven by rising health care costs and an aging population. The report is full of numbers, but does not include the $6.2 trillion deficit figure. That number was computed by Republican staff members on the Senate Budget Committee. Staffers used data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to calculate the country’s gross domestic product for the 75 years ending 2085. That GDP is expected to total $883 trillion. Using the GAO report’s deficit increase figure with the GDP data results in the $6.2 trillion figure that is repeated by Broun and used in the various articles. Broun did not mention the $13.25 trillion that would be the savings over 75 years using the same GDP and GAO optimistic scenario figures. We also checked the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency, for data on the health care law’s budget impact. In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the law would decrease the federal budget $210 billion over 10 years ending 2021. So is Broun correct? The Georgia congressman said that a GAO report said the Affordable Care Act would increase the federal deficit by $6.2 trillion. But the GAO report doesn’t include the $6.2 trillion figure. That amount was extrapolated using data from the GAO report by a group of GOP Senate Budget Committee staffers. What the report does say is that the health care law could cause the federal deficit to increase if cost-savings measures are phased out over time. But if the law is fully implemented, it could actually lower the deficit over time. Broun, like other politicos before him, repeats a selective version of the report to support his claim, while omitting alternative positive findings of the same report. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/22/paul-broun/broun-uses-only-negative-scenario-gao-report/

Half of all CEOs said the shutdown set back hiring plans over next 6 months, says Obama
","After a Senate deal brought the 16-day government shutdown to a close, President Barack Obama wanted to make sure the impact of narrowly avoiding a default wasn’t lost on the nation. ""These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy,"" he said in a public address Thursday. As proof, he offered up specific claims including, ""Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months."" PolitiFact wanted to know whether Obama’s CEO statistic was accurate. The White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey. ""Fifty percent of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months,"" the report reads. On its face, that’s in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired their results. They would not disclose their exact question wording to us. Their report notes, ""Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total Business Roundtable membership.""  Business Roundtable’s membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it’s safe to say the poll responses don’t reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses. Since Obama often speaks to the Business Roundtable, we wanted to see what his relationship with the group was like. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, who specializes in lobbying, said there’s not much of a connection. ""Many of them have long-term relationships with government (simply because of their size and the government’s size), but probably only a handful have any kind of even semi-close relationship with Obama,"" he said. We ran the poll results by another business group, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Senior policy analyst Holly Wade said she saw a similar sentiment among the smaller business owners that the federation represents. ""In September, there were more small business owners that were feeling pessimistic about business conditions six months out,"" she said. There wasn’t much opinion voiced about delaying employment specifically, though. But Wade said that could be because small businesses were already hiring less during the economic recovery compared to bigger corporations. Why would CEOs want to delay hiring? With another possible debt ceiling default looming Feb. 7, University of Maryland finance professor David Kass said it’s likely that a budget deal will lead to tighter fiscal policy, which would slow down the economy and cause CEOs to put off hiring decisions for a few months. Another factor that would contribute to CEO anxiety is consumer behavior. While day-to-day spending probably won’t change post-shutdown, consumers will likely postpone higher ticket purchases, like homes and cars. ""On the demand side, there’s uncertainty on the consumers’ part, which in turn will have an impact on CEOs,"" Kass said. ""They’re trying to predict their future sales and what the environment will look like. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone."" In any case, Obama is trying to communicate that the shutdown had a significant financial impact on the nation, and he’s not wrong there. Independent forecasts agree that the shutdown was a setback for the U.S. economy, though they differ on exact figures. Our ruling Obama said 50 percent of CEOs are delaying hiring due to the shutdown, which accurately cites the results of a poll sponsored by the Business Roundtable. The survey’s limited sampling, though,  means the responses aren’t necessarily representative of all U.S. businesses. But the idea that the shutdown affects how businesses think about hiring is more broadly applicable. Experts said it’s reasonable that CEOs would be hesitant to hire, given that uncertainty about government fiscal policy can affect consumer confidence.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Virginia', 'Mark Obenshain']","
Obenshain says Herring voted to shorten prison sentences for sex offenders
","The front of the campaign brochure has a mug shot of a grimacing, heavyset man in a undershirt. He’s holding a prisoner identification tag that says, ""There are 1,268 convicted sex offenders in the Richmond area."" Under the photo, Mark Obenshain, the Republican nominee for attorney general, asks, ""Which candidate for attorney general will protect your family?"" Open the glossy brochure and you get this answer: ""Mark Herring voted to allow sex offenders, including rapists, to serve shorter sentences."" Obenshain made the same charge against Herring, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, in a TV ad that began airing Oct. 7. So we checked whether Herring really did vote to ease prison sentences for sex offenders. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Obenshain’s campaign, said the claim centers on a bill that came up in the General Assembly earlier this year. Both Obenshain and Herring are state senators. The bill concerned about 155 crimes that, under Virginia law, must be punished with mandatory minimum sentences in prison. As introduced by Del. Robert Bell, R-Albemarle, the measure would have required that each count of a mandatory-sentence conviction be fully served in prison -- as opposed to allowing an inmate to serve several terms concurrently.    Lets say, for example, a person is convicted on three counts that each carry a mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years. Bell’s legislation would have required the criminal to serve at least 30 years. The bill grew out of a criminal case concerning Charles Lordell Jefferson Jr., who in 2011 was convicted in Fauquier County on six counts of production of child pornography, each carrying a mandatory minimum of of five years. Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey W. Parker imposed a six-year sentence for each count, but allowed allowed the prison terms to be served concurrently. So Jefferson faced only six years behind bars for child pornography crimes. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli contested the result, arguing it was the legislature’s intent in passing mandatory minimum sentence laws that prison time would be tacked on for each count. The Court of Appeals of Virginia rejected Cuccinelli’s argument. A three-judge panel noted that state laws specified consecutive prison terms for some mandatory-minimum crimes but not for others, including production of child pornography. The panel said that it must assume the General Assembly had a reason for setting the condition for some mandatory-minimum offenses and not for others. Bell introduced his bill to end the controversy, but the Senate stripped out the blanket provision that sentences for all mandatory-minimum counts be served sequentially. Instead, the Senate simply added a specification to child pornography laws that perpetrators would serve consecutive sentences for each violation. The House agreed to the change. But Gov. Bob McDonnell was unhappy with the amended bill. He sent it back to the General Assembly with a recommendation that consecutive-sentencing stipulations be added to laws of the nine mandatory-minimum crimes that were not covered, including rape and production of child pornography. Also on that list were various offenses involving gang activity, violating protective orders, shooting or throwing missiles at vehicles, transferring firearms, forcible sodomy and object penetration. McDonnell’s version of the bill flew through the House on a 95-3 vote, but narrowly passed the Senate on a 23-17 vote. Obenshain voted for the bill and Herring voted against it. ""Sen. Herring did not support the Governor's recommendation because it deprived judges of too much of their existing discretion and made the justice system less flexible,"" Kevin O’Holleran, a Herring spokesman, said in an email. ""Sen. Herring has supported mandatory minimums and strong penalties for crimes against children in the past (including life sentences) and this bill did not affect the length of any sentence for any crime."" A study by the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission suggests the new law will cause little change in the actual time offenders spend in prison. The research examined 130,531 criminal sentences imposed in the state between mid 2005 and mid 2010. Of those crimes, only 18,659, or 14.3 percent, involved mandatory-minimum offenses. Only 3,225, or 2.5 percent, involved convictions on multiple counts of mandatory-minimum offenses. And of those 3,225 cases, the report says judges imposed sentences below consecutive-term standards only 3.1 percent of the time. That breaks down to about 100 cases over five years, or 20 cases annually. Now, keep in mind that those 20 annual cases in which judges used sentencing discretion could have involved nine different offenses -- not all of them sex crimes. Meredith Farrar-Owens, director of the sentencing commission, said her agency lacks data to break down by each offense the  instances when judges used discretion in passing out sentences on multiple count, mandatory-minimum convictions. ""It’s a small percentage of a small percentage of cases where judges elected not to give consecutive sentences,"" she said. Our ruling Obenshain said Herring voted to allow sex offenders to ""serve shorter sentences."" Herring voted against a bill that ended the sentencing discretion judges had in rare cases when some sex offenders and a few other types of criminals were convicted on multiple counts. Because judges occasionally invoked their option to allow inmates to serve multiple prison terms concurrently, there’s a slight basis for the claim that Herring’s vote would allow some offenders to serve shorter terms than they would have if the judges had no choice. But for the most part, Obenshain’s claim is misleading. Herring’s vote would not have shortened the prison time faced by sex offenders, it merely would have continued the the sentencing procedures in place. And Obenshain, in his broad reference to sex offenders, omits the fact that only a tiny percentage of them had circumstances in their cases that allowed for discretion in sentencing.

Common Core expects English teachers to spend half of their reading time at every grade on informational texts, says opponent
","With full implementation of the Common Core State Standards just a year away, Florida is taking last-minute feedback from supporters and critics alike. Gov. Rick Scott, whose tea party base has been among the most vocal critics, called for three public hearings in October to garner input. Education officials have said that the comments could be used to ""tweak"" the standards, which already are being used in the state’s schools. Education Commissioner Pam Stewart listened during the first hearing on Oct. 15 in Tampa as dozens of people spoke. The first speaker was Sandra Stotsky, an education professor at the University of Arkansas and staunch critic of the Common Core. One of Stotsky’s complaints was that literature and fiction would be replaced with nonfiction informational texts. ""Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts — a percentage from which students cannot benefit intellectually,"" she said We decided to check the part of her statement about what kind of texts English teachers will be required to use in their classes. There’s plenty of evidence that the Common Core standards emphasize informational texts. The introduction says, ""The standards are not alone in calling for a special emphasis on informational text."" The Common Core also states that it follows the lead of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in ""balancing the reading of literature with the reading of informational texts, including texts in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects."" Common Core follows a NAEP framework that spells out percentages of literary versus informational texts by grade level. It calls for a 50 percent/50 percent split in grade four, with an increasing emphasis on informational texts in later grades. In grade eight, there’s a 45 percent/55 percent split, while in grade 12, the split is 30 percent/70 percent. Some news stories suggest that English teachers are using more informational texts in their classrooms as they move to the Common Core. An Oct. 15 story in The Hechinger Report found that some English teachers in Florida have replaced some classic works of literature with nonfiction books or added informational texts to their instruction. One teacher replaced the novel The Great Gatsby, with a memoir, The Glass Castle. Another said she would assign students Martin Luther King Jr.’s ""I Have a Dream"" speech alongside the novel To Kill a Mockingbird. In a piece for The Heritage Foundation last year, Stotsky pointed to such stories as evidence that the Common Core is damaging the English curriculum. ""Anecdotal reports from high school English teachers indicate that the amount of informational or nonfiction reading they are being told to do in their classroom is 50 percent or more of their reading instructional time—and that they will have time only for excerpts from novels, plays, or epic poems if they want students to read more than very short stories and poems,"" she wrote. Stotsky said her remarks were based on the number of reading standards in Common Core. There are 10 standards for informational text and nine for literature in every grade level. ""That is approximately 50/50,"" she wrote in an email sent after publication. ""Many departments of education and superintendents have told local school districts to spend 50 percent of their reading time on 'informational texts' and 50 percent on literary study. They have interpreted the 10/9 numbers in exactly the same way.""  However, Stotsky’s claim that English teachers must spend at least half their reading instructional time on informational texts is a misread of the Common Core standards and the percentages it outlines. The Common Core website specifically states that the ""percentages on the table reflect the sum of student reading, not just reading in (English) settings.""  It goes on to say that ""teachers of senior English classes, for example, are not required to devote 70 percent of reading to informational texts. Rather, 70 percent of student reading across the grade should be informational."" So those percentages also count what students read in their science, math and history classes -- which would likely be all, or nearly all, informational. To meet the 30 percent threshold for literary reading at grade 12, an English teacher would have to focus on stories, novels and plays, said Timothy Shanahan, a retired education professor from the University of Illinois at Chicago and a member of the English Language Arts Work Team for the Common Core State Standards Initiative. ""Depending on how a school is organized, it would be possible for an English teacher to never touch an informational text,"" he said. Kathy Short, a professor at the University of Arizona, discussed the issue in a blog item about misconceptions about the Common Core, writing, ""English teachers are encouraged to use more short informational texts, such as primary sources that can be found online and in newspapers to surround their reading of a novel, but not to switch their reading to primarily informational text. In fact, students need to primarily read literary texts in English in order to have the 30 percent of their day be fiction reading."" The Common Core website also says that the English classroom ""must focus on literature (stories, drama and poetry) as well as literary nonfiction."" Because of that, ""a great deal of informational reading in grades 6–12 must take place in other classes if the NAEP assessment framework is to be matched instructionally."" Finally, Common Core leaves most of the decisions about what should be taught to the states and local school districts. It requires, for instance, the inclusion of ""classic myths and stories from around the world, America’s founding documents, foundational American literature and Shakespeare."" All other content decisions are left up to the local education officials. Teachers can replace The Great Gatsby with The Glass Castle if they want to, but they don’t have to, Shanahan said. ""That’s all local decision making,"" he said. Our ruling Stotsky stated that the Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts. The Common Core does emphasize informational texts. But it specifically counts reading informational texts in science, math or history classes, and it says that English classes must focus on literature as well as literary nonfiction. Most of the decision-making about what students read in English classes is left to the local and state levels. We find this statement False. Editor's note: This report has been updated to include Stotsky's comments, which we received after our initial publication. The ruling is unchanged.

No, immigrants cannot apply for asylum at U.S. embassies or consulates abroad
","While lamenting family separations at the border and the perilous journey many immigrants take to come to the United States, Republican U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador said immigrants didn’t need to come to U.S. borders to make their asylum requests. They could do so at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad, Labrador, of Idaho, claimed. In a June 27 opinion piece for the Idaho Statesman, Labrador criticized ""catch-and-release"" — the release of immigrants apprehended at the border, under the expectation that they will later show up to immigration court — saying it increased illegal immigration. Some immigrants coming to the United States illegally faced abuse, rape and even death in their journey, Labrador wrote. ""What makes these tragedies so unnecessary is there’s already a process in place for those who are legitimately seeking asylum,"" Labrador wrote. ""They can show up at any embassy or consulate abroad or any U.S. port of entry to make their asylum claims."" Individuals can make asylum claims at U.S. ports of entry, but can they also make those claims at ""any embassy or consulate abroad""? No. Asylum claims must be made within the United States. Asylum may be granted to individuals who have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, and/or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. U.S. law says that in general, ""any alien who is physically present in the United States, or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum."" Asylum seekers must generally apply for the protection within one year of their arrival to the United States. ""A U.S. consulate or embassy is clearly outside the U.S., so you can’t apply for asylum at a U.S. consulate or embassy,"" said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. Going to a U.S. embassy or consulate does not count as being physically present in the United States for purposes of the asylum statute, said Deborah Anker, a clinical professor of law, founder and director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at Harvard Law School. Diplomatic asylum is an entirely different matter, one that is very limited and generally not recognized under international law. U.S. embassies serve as the headquarters for U.S. government representatives in foreign countries and are normally located in the country’s capital. Embassy branches (consulates) are in other cities. An embassy’s primary purpose is to assist American citizens who live or are traveling in the foreign country, though they may also provide visa services for people who want to come to the United States temporarily or permanently. Online pages for U.S. embassies in Italy and Poland, explicitly say, ""The United States does not grant asylum in its diplomatic premises abroad."" Scholars have noted that while there are special diplomatic provisions among countries when it comes to embassies and consulates, embassy grounds are not the territory of the sending country; rather, they remain territory of the host country. Todd Winer, a spokesman for Labrador, said there’s already a legal process in place for those seeking asylum, ""so there is no excuse for anyone trying to cross the border illegally."" (According to U.S. law, immigrants can apply for asylum even if they enter the country illegally). ""True victims of persecution can show up at any U.S. port of entry to make their asylum claims. They can also submit their application online when in the U.S.,"" Winer said. ""The Democrats’ charge that people need to illegally cross the border to gain asylum is what really needs to be fact-checked."" Some people may be confusing provisions for asylees and for refugees, said Karen Musalo, a professor and director of the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies at U.C. Hastings College of the Law. While individuals applying for asylum must be in the United States, some individuals outside the United States can seek refugee protection there and enter the country as refugees, Musalo said. Still, Musalo said, there are many conditions for the refugee program, including an annual cap on refugee entry. The Trump administration plans to admit no more than 45,000 refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2018, which ends Sept. 30. The Obama administration set a cap of 110,000 for fiscal year 2017. Labrador said immigrants ""can show up at any embassy or consulate abroad"" to make their asylum claims. This assurance is completely wrong. Asylum seekers must be within the United States to apply for the protection, according to U.S. law. Immigration law experts affirmed that individuals cannot apply for asylum at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. Labrador’s claim is inaccurate.

Trump's Supreme Court pick said presidents shouldn't be investigated, Schumer said
","Democrats pounced on a years-old statement by president Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh to drum up concern about how he might shield the president from Robert Mueller’s investigation. In an interview July 10, Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer suggested the comment about presidential power by Kavanaugh could give Trump a pass in the investigation, even though it came long before Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""You are worried about president Trump’s overreach. So am I,"" Schumer said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""This nominee has stood more, both certainly before he became a judge, for presidential overreach. He has said the president shouldn't be investigated. He has gone so far as to say a president if he declares a law unconstitutional doesn’t have to obey it. How is he going to react if Mueller needs a subpoena? If Mueller needs some other action?"" Many Democrats have latched onto Kavanaugh’s statement about investigations into presidents. But we found that Democrats aren’t telling the full story about what Kavanaugh said. The statement by Kavanaugh stems from his 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review about the separation of powers. At the time, he was a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. His article was adapted from remarks he made at the University of Minnesota Law School on Oct. 17, 2008, a couple of weeks before the presidential election. Kavanaugh made a reference to his experience with the Starr Report, which said that president Bill Clinton lied under oath in Clinton vs. Jones regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, obstructed justice, and refused to testify. Clinton was impeached in 1998 but acquitted by the Senate. In the law review article, Kavanaugh wrote that Congress could consider a law exempting the president while in office from criminal prosecution because it is ""inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics."" Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court‘s decision in Clinton vs Jones that presidents are not constitutionally entitled to deferral of civil suits ""may well have been entirely correct"" but Congress ""may be wise"" to set a statute to allow temporary deferral. Democrats have zeroed in on this passage by Kavanaugh: ""Even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation — including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators — are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the president’s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president."" Kavanaugh also wrote that the Constitution already provides a check on executive power, because an impeached president is then subject to criminal prosecution. ""In short, the Constitution establishes a clear mechanism to deter executive malfeasance; we should not burden a sitting president with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions. The president’s job is difficult enough as is. And the country loses when the president’s focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution."" In a footnote, Kavanaugh wrote that the independent counsel statute, which was used by Kenneth Starr to investigate Clinton, ""was a major mistake."" ""The law itself created a perverse structure that was inconsistent with foundational principles of separation of powers and that created problems for both the president and the independent counsel,"" he wrote. Law professors told us it was important to put Kavanaugh’s 2009 comments in context. Kavanaugh was calling for Congress to pass a statute granting presidents temporary immunity. ""Schumer is using that notion — that in general, it is bad policy to allow presidents to be pursued by prosecutors while in office — to imply that Kavanaugh thinks Trump shouldn’t be investigated, and to question how he would rule as a judge,"" said Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt. ""That is disingenuous, because Kavanaugh was calling for Congress to pass a statute granting immunity. They have passed no such statute, and it is not reasonable to suggest that Kavanaugh as a judge would ignore that fact."" If Kavanaugh became a justice and had to react to a future Mueller subpoena of Trump, Kavanaugh ""would almost certainly respect the unanimous precedent of U.S. v. Nixon, which held that the president is not immune from subpoenas. If Congress passed a statute exempting the president from such subpoenas — which it hasn’t — then he would say that the president is exempt,"" Kalt said. Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor, wrote in a Bloomberg column that while Democrats argue that Kavanaugh believes a president shouldn’t be indicted while in office, ""Kavanaugh’s expressed views actually support the opposite conclusion: that the president can be investigated and maybe even indicted unless Congress passes a law saying he can’t — which Congress has not done."" Kavanaugh said only that Congress should pass a law that delays certain investigations until after the presidency, Feldman told PolitiFact. ""He did NOT say that was the state of affairs without the law — and there is no such law. For comparison, that is what Bill Clinton wanted even for civil investigation. Totally mainstream,"" Feldman said. ""On the subpoena, we don’t know. But given that there is no law in place protecting (the president) and that Ken Starr issued subpoenas while Kavanaugh was working for him, my money would be on requiring Trump to comply."" Schumer said that Kavanaugh ""has said the president shouldn't be investigated."" Schumer is plucking one part of what Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 Minnesota law review paper without recapping his comments in full. Kavanaugh wrote that civil suits and criminal investigations take away from a president’s focus on his or her work responsibilities. He didn’t call for the court to take away the power to investigate the president; he said that Congress could consider writing a law to exempt the president. As for Schumer’s concern for the Mueller investigation, experts said there is unanimous Supreme Court precedent that the president is not immune from subpoenas, and Kavanaugh has not indicated so far that he would change that.

Conservative website wrong on effects, purpose of UN conference
","A conservative website falsely claimed that U.S. representatives to the United Nations promised to push for gun-control policies at home. ""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans,"" said a July 5, 2018, headline from the Conservative Daily Post website. The report cited a similar story from the New American, a bimonthly magazine for ""freedom-loving Americans"" who support ""limited government under the Constitution,"" according to its about page. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is not the first time we have encountered falsehoods concerning the U.N. and gun control. We previously looked at the claim that a U.N. treaty would mandate a ""new international gun registry"" and a chain email that wrongly accused the Obama administration of planning to use international treaties to ban all weapons. As with these past statements, there is also a lot wrong with this new report about the U.N. conference. The report said U.S. representatives attending the Third Review Conference for the June 2018 U.N. Program of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons agreed ""to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ … that will enforce ‘proper management’ of ‘small arms and light weapons’ stockpiles."" The report went on to say, misleadingly, that the United States pledged to help the U.N. track and confiscate firearms, including stockpiles owned by private citizens. ""In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people,"" the story said. ""If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the U.N. will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not. This agreement is wildly unconstitutional."" Citing six points spelled out in the ""implementation at the national level"" section of the conference’s outcome document, the story said the meeting resulted in the United States’ willing violation of Second and Tenth Amendment rights. But the story erred in its understanding of the conference. In reality, the conference provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons. According to the website for the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs, the original meeting in 2001 saw governments agree ""to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management — and to engage in cooperation and assistance."" Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., attended this year's conference along with several advisers, according to the U.N.'s list of participants. The State Department and the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the role of U.S. representatives at the conference. Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights. ""The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,"" Dorminey wrote in an email. ""The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion — especially across borders — that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions."" ""Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade — not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for."" Conservative Daily Post did not respond to a request for comment submitted via its contact page. A headline stated, ""US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans."" The story said U.S. representatives at a U.N. conference pledged to adopt new gun-control measures that would threaten Second and Tenth Amendment rights. U.S. representatives at the conference did reaffirm the nation’s agreement in 2001 to work toward limiting the illicit international trade of small arms and light weapons.

Did Facebook remove, censor the Declaration of Independence?

""It’s not surprising,"" the story said. ""The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda.

Facebook users flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Geller Report cited an article from the Guardian, and Geller pointed in an email to multiple other outlets that also reported on the incident, including the Washington Post, USA Today, Fortune and the Independent. Here’s what happened: In anticipation of July 4, the Liberty County Vindicator, a small local newspaper in Texas, posted sections of the Declaration of Independence to Facebook. The Vindicator soon received notice from Facebook indicating that one of the posts was removed because it ""goes against our standards on hate speech,"" according to a July 2 write-up from Casey Stinnett, the paper’s managing editor. Stinnett said the section was likely removed for its reference to ""merciless Indian savages."" ""The removal of the post was an automated action,"" Stinnett wrote. ""If any human being working at Facebook were to review it, no doubt the post would be allowed."" Later, Stinnett updated the article and posted to Facebook to announce that the post had been restored. He said the Vindicator received an email from Facebook that said, ""It looks like we made a mistake and removed something you posted on Facebook that didn’t go against our Community Standards. We want to apologize and let you know that we’ve restored your content and removed any blocks on your account related to this incorrect action."" Geller acknowledged in her email that Facebook apologized and restored the post, but her story did not mention the apology or the fix. ""We restored the post and apologized to The Vindicator on July 3 as soon as we saw our error,"" said Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for Facebook. ""We process millions of reports every week, and sometimes we make mistakes."" This is not the first time Facebook’s censors have removed posts of historical significance.

The photo, removed as nudity and child porn, was eventually restored. The Geller Report story had a point that a newspaper’s post of the Declaration of Independence was temporarily removed from Facebook for appearing to violate ""hate speech"" standards.

Did Justice Kennedy quit due to family ties to Trump and Russia?
","The New York Times detailed connections between the Trump White House and Justice Anthony Kennedy, searching for factors that might have inspired Kennedy to retire so abruptly before the November midterms. The newspaper examined a number of connections that the Trump family might have exploited to earn Kennedy’s trust: constant praise for his work, the routine promotion of his clerks, and visits from the president’s family. But some conspiracy-minded bloggers have honed in on two paragraphs, nestled in the middle of the article: Kennedy’s son, Justin Kennedy, had worked with Deutsche Bank when it loaned over $1 billion to Trump, even when other banks had become wary of him. In the New York Times article, this is just one piece of evidence to show that the Kennedy and Trump families were close outside of politics. However, liberal clickbait site Kwotable used the detail to suggest corruption on a much more massive, though unsupported, scale. Its June 30 headline read, ""Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank."" The New York Times report didn’t go that far, so we decided to dig deeper into the Kwotable claim. Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank began in the late nineties when many other major lenders were unwilling to do business with him. Between 1991 and 1992, Trump declared bankruptcy four times, making him unpopular among Wall Street bankers, who referred to making deals with him as ""Donald risk."" Deutsche Bank opened up to working with Trump after launching its real estate division in 1998. Mike Offit, a newly-hired managing director, gave Trump a loan to renovate his building on Wall Street, and continued to work with him through the 2008 financial crisis. According to a 2017 report by the New York Times, Trump has done more than $4 billion in business with Deutsche since then, including the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Doral in Miami. Justin Kennedy began working at Deutsche in 1998 as the managing director and global head of Real Estate Capital Markets, a role he held until leaving in 2009. Kennedy oversaw and approved major real estate loans given through the bank, including multiple loans made to Trump for his real estate enterprise. Trump’s connections to Russia are still being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Deutsche Bank’s relationship to the country is well-documented, and controversial. In early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal ""mirror-trading."" (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch, and then a conspirator would sell identical stocks for the same price, but through the London branch and in dollars. This money would be transferred to offshore accounts, effectively allowing traders to illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. According to Reuters, this scheme began in 2011.) Between 2010 and 2014, the bank was also involved in the ""Global Laundromat"" scandal, which allowed over $20 billion to be funneled from Russia to other countries around the world. The Global Laundromat was a much larger operation than the mirror-trading. It involved top Russian oligarchs and criminals — including Igor Putin, cousin of President Vladimir Putin. The bank’s name has come up in the Mueller investigation as well, but not in the way the Kwotable article makes you think. In December 2017, Mueller’s team subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records connected with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had been indicted in October on suspicion of money laundering, among other crimes. However, there has been no evidence to date that Trump himself was involved with any of the money laundering — or that either Kennedy was involved. Democrats have called for more transparency in Trump’s banking history, but the bank has denied their requests, citing confidentiality concerns. The records would be released only in the event of a formal investigation. As for Justin Kennedy, he left Deutsche Bank in 2009, before investigators say the Global Laundromat or mirror-trading scandals began. He has not been formally investigated or accused of involvement in financial foul play. Kennedy and Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story. Bloggers wrote that Justice Kennedy retired last week because ""he and his son helped launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank."" This story has all the buzz words to make a good conspiracy theory: Russia, real estate, billions of dollars, coincidence, corruption. But there is no evidence that Trump and Justin Kennedy ever had a relationship beyond Trump’s real estate loans. There is also no evidence that Kennedy was involved in Russian money laundering, as he left the bank before either of the major scandals happened, or that the Trump White House was blackmailing his father because of it.

Did Claire McCaskill vote for 100% of Obama's judicial nominees?
","The prospect of President Donald Trump’s second Supreme Court pick became an issue in the Senate midterm elections even before Trump tapped Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacant seat on the court. Josh Hawley, the Missouri attorney general who is challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, put up a website — supremeclaire.com — to draw a contrast between his stance on judges and the incumbent’s. One of the statements on the website was that ""Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees."" From a Josh Hawley campaign website When we contacted McCaskill’s campaign, they did not dispute that she voted for all of Obama’s nominees. (They added that she has voted for 68 percent of Trump's judicial nominees.) So the substance of Hawley’s assertion is accurate. It’s worth noting, though, that the Republican ranks of senators that Hawley hopes to join also supported Obama’s judicial picks overwhelmingly. We looked at a database of Obama and Trump judicial picks maintained by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. For Obama’s tenure, the database includes 323 Obama nominees for district and circuit court seats who were ultimately considered by the Senate, along with the results of their confirmation votes. Here’s our breakdown of the results. The ""no nay votes"" category includes voice votes, approval by unanimous consent, recorded votes with zero nay votes: Degree of Senate opposition to nominee Obama nominees with this result No nay votes 220 Nay votes in single digits 45 Between 10 and 19 nay votes 10 More than 20 nay votes 48 In other words, 82 percent of Obama’s nominees received minimal opposition from Republicans. Eighty-two percent support is lower than the 100 percent support rate for McCaskill, but it does make Hawley’s seemingly black-and-white contrast between hard-line Republican opposition to Obama’s picks and blanket Democratic support a bit blurrier. This may surprise people who tune in to judicial nominations only for Supreme Court seats, battles that have become increasingly acrimonious. But for Obama’s lower-court nominations — and particularly for district-court seats, which are the initial trial-level federal courts — most nominees were easily confirmed. Why? Experts point to a few reasons. The first is that most judicial nominations that fail do so before a vote is cast. If opposition coalesces on the Senate Judiciary Committee, a nomination may be pulled before consideration (or a potential nomination may never be made), said Anthony Madonna, a University of Georgia political scientist. A second reason is that senators have historically been given an informal say on judicial nominations in their home states, enabling the most controversial candidates to be weeded before a nomination is even made, Madonna said. The GOP's ability to use these rules under Obama means that the nominations that made it to the floor ""would have been likely to attract GOP votes,"" said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist. McCaskill, for her part, was deferential to President George W. Bush’s judicial picks, Madonna said. He could locate only one McCaskill nay vote against a Bush judicial nominee — Leslie Southwick, who was up for an appeals-court seat — in McCaskill’s two years in the Senate when Bush was president. The growing acrimony over judicial nominations has dropped the percentage of slam-dunk nominations under Trump. The approval number, however, remains substantial. According to Wheeler’s data set, district-court nominations are still overwhelmingly approved without controversy: So far, 74 percent of Trump nominees have been confirmed by either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. But for circuit court seats (that is, seats on appeals courts) only 17 percent of Trump’s picks have been approved with either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. The remaining 15 Trump nominees have averaged 39 nay votes, meaning that most are getting some crossover support from Democratic senators, but not much. The increasing opposition under Trump, Wheeler said, stems from Senate Democrats’ anger over the GOP majority’s handling of Obama nominees toward the end of his tenure. In addition to blocking Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for more than a year, Senate Republicans confirmed barely any circuit court judges during 2015 and 2016, which is ""way below standard patterns for the final two years of eight-year presidencies,"" Wheeler said. Republicans counter that the confirmation system was broken well before 2015, including by the Senate Democrats’ decision to use the ""nuclear option"" to enable simple-majority approval for district- and circuit-court nominations in 2013. Hawley said, ""Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees."" Senate Republicans also approved Obama’s nominees with minimal objections 82 percent of the time, and McCaskill voted for most of Bush’s nominees. Hawley's statement is accurate but requires a touch of clarification. That's our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/jul/10/josh-hawley/did-claire-mccaskill-vote-100-obamas-judicial-nomi/

In Ohio governor's race, liberal PAC exaggerates impact of Obamacare repeal
","A liberal super PAC says repealing the Affordable Care Act could lead to dire consequences for the health of Ohioans and hurt the economy. ""Repealing the Affordable Care Act — and with it, Ohio’s Medicaid expansion — could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs, jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage, and leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance,"" claimed the For Our Future PAC on its Stop Mike DeWine website. For Our Future PAC, launched by California billionaire Tom Steyer and unions, is targeting Republicans including Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is running for governor against Democrat Richard Cordray. DeWine unsuccessfully sued in an effort to overturn the health care law. Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to achieve a repeal. We found that the statements require more explanation about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute published an analysis related to jobs and the Affordable Care Act in March 2017. At the time, the Republicans were pursuing the American Health Care Act, a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The bill never became law. The first thing to know about economist Josh Bivens’ analysis is that he didn’t predict layoffs but instead came up with a rough estimate of the potential drag on job growth if the repeal occurred. For Ohio, that number was 81,385 jobs. The For Our Future PAC’s website doesn’t take into account the caveats in the report which stated: ""Given all of this uncertainty, we present our findings as a drag on potential job growth, rather than as clear predictions of ‘jobs lost.’"" George Washington University experts came up with a lower estimate for job losses in Ohio by 2026 based on the House bill and a higher one for the Senate bill. However, other experts have expressed doubts that repeal would lead to such a high number of job growth losses or that it’s possible to put a precise prediction on job losses. Joe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said such analyses take ""an extreme view that everything is going to collapse."" Antos said if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, he would expect some initial reduction in employment in the health care sector but some increase in other sectors. ""On balance, what happened to employment, I don’t know,"" he said. Antos said that the predictions about job losses by Democrats are similar to the predictions by Republicans in 2010 that the requirements for small firms to cover employees would create massive disruption, but that ultimately didn’t happen. (We have fact-checked several claims that the Affordable Care Act is a ""jobs killer"" and repeatedly found the evidence fell short.) Two experts on health care economics, Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota and Anne Beeson Royalty at Indiana University, reviewed literature and concluded that the Affordable Care Act had minimal effect on employment, hours of work, and compensation. For Our Future pointed to analysis by the Urban Institute in 2017 that analyzed the implications of partial repeal through the budget reconciliation process, an approach considered by Congress at that time. The Urban Institute predicted that it would lead to an increase of the uninsured population in Ohio of 964,000. However, the Urban Institute has done a more recent analysis of full repeal and nationally found a smaller number for how many would be uninsured due to policy changes. It didn’t publish new estimates for the states; however, Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, said it would be lower than the 964,000 figure. There are about 1 million people in Ohio who are insured through the Affordable Care Act, including about 230,000 people through the marketplace and almost 700,000 as a result of expanded Medicaid. This part of the statement refers to research by Harvard health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied. They said in January 2017 that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have ""stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses."" Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. They found that repealing the health care law would particularly harm states hit hard by opioid deaths, including Ohio where 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law’s marketplace or Medicaid expansion. Since there is no Obamacare replacement bill under serious consideration right now, it’s unknown whether all of these people would end up uninsured. For Our Future Ohio PAC said ""repealing the Affordable Care Act — and with it, Ohio’s Medicaid expansion — could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs, jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage, and leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance."" The statement about jobs ignores the caveats in the study by the Economics Policy Institute. The study came up with a number about the potential drag on job growth under a scenario that was pushed by Republicans in 2017 but that never became law. It does not refer to job layoffs. About 1 million Ohioans are currently covered by the Affordable Care Act. An academic study found that about 220,000 Ohioans with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law. However, since there isn’t a repeal-and-replace bill under serious consideration right now, it’s difficult to predict how many people in Ohio would be left without coverage.

Nevada TV ad cherry-picks tax cut benefits to top 1%
","A new ad on the air in Nevada against the Republican tax law features a cheerful grandmother doling out brightly wrapped candy to her grandchildren. To the girl, she gives heaping handfuls. To the boy, a few pieces. When he complains how that’s unfair, the grandmother explains, ""Some people start off with more than others, and so, we’re going to be giving them even more."" On the screen appear the words ""83 percent of Trump tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent,"" with a reference to a Dec. 18, 2017, article on Vox. The ad from the group Tax March rehashes a Democratic talking point that we’ve addressed before. The number is roughly correct, but it leaves out a lot of important information. The tax cuts are a dividing line in the Nevada Senate race between the Republican incumbent Dean Heller, who voted for the law, and his Democratic challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen, who has said she would change it. A December 2017 analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, is the underlying source for the 83 percent. The center modeled the impact of the tax law and looked at how different income groups fared in three years: 2018, 2025 and 2027. Only in one year, 2027, did 82.8 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent of tax filers. In 2018, the number was 20.5 percent, and in 2025, it was 25.3 percent. Both are a far cry from the big number in the ad. Why the large shift? In order to stay within the Senate rules that shaped the bill, most of the individual tax cuts end after 2025. That leaves the corporate tax cuts, which do more to help upper income earners. Also, the law changed the calculation for factoring in inflation and those adjustments become less favorable to taxpayers over time. As this chart shows, the lopsided benefits come in the final year. ""How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at,"" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told us in January. We asked Rosenberg if the center’s work allows any way to figure out the cumulative gains and losses over the 10 years of the tax law. He said there was not. ""We only published single year results, and only for three years,"" Rosenberg said. It is worth noting that not everyone inside each income group does equally well. For example, among the top 1 percent in the final year, about a quarter of the group sees a small tax increase of $1,250 on average. Finally, the statement talks about the ""wealthiest"" 1 percent. The study looked at annual income, which is how much money a person takes in. Wealth is the assets someone has accumulated over time. The Tax March ad says 83 percent of the Trump tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent. The number is about right, but only for the last year of the tax law. In the two earlier years estimated by the Tax Policy Center, the share going to the highest income group was between 20 and 25 percent. The law does favor the well-to-do, but not by nearly as much as the ad says. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/jul/10/tax-march/nevada-tv-ad-cherry-picks-tax-cut-benefits-top-1/

NC Democrat mostly right about Mike Pence expanding Medicaid
","Democrats in North Carolina argue the state should expand Medicaid to help residents pay for health care. Such a move would help hundreds of thousands of uninsured residents, they say, adding that most of the cost would be paid by the federal government. The Affordable Care Act enabled states to cover more people under Medicaid. But the legislation, signed into law by Democratic President Barack Obama, remains deeply unpopular among Republicans, and some state governments — including North Carolina’s — are refusing to expand Medicaid coverage. In North Carolina, a bill to expand Medicaid through a program called ""Carolina Cares"" was authored by Republicans but doesn’t have enough support to pass in the GOP-controlled legislature. So on June 26, a member of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s cabinet urged Republican legislators to follow in the footsteps of another prominent conservative: Vice President Mike Pence. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, told the crowd at a ""Close the Gap Advocacy Day"" event that Pence approved Medicaid expansion while governor of Indiana. ""When (the Vice President) was Governor of Indiana, he expanded Medicaid,"" Cohen said, according to this tweet by the executive director of NC AIDS Action. Cohen’s comments came in the waning days of the N.C. General Assembly session, when legislators could have taken up the Medicaid expansion bill but didn’t. When PolitiFact contacted Cohen’s office, spokesman Cobey Culton referenced the websitefor Indiana’s health care program to support her claim. A deal with Obama The ACA, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand Medicaid programs to adults earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2015 was about $2,743 a month for a family of four. And it encouraged states to expand coverage by offering to pay for a large majority of the cost. Under standard Medicaid, the federal government offers states a cost-match ranging from 50 to 73 percent. Under the ACA, the federal government paid 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs between 2014 and 2016. It then dropped its support to 95 percent in 2017 and plans to cut its support to 90 percent by 2020. In 2015, then-Indiana Gov. Pence reached an agreement with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid under a custom program known as the ""new Healthy Indiana Plan."" The words ""Medicaid"" and ""expansion"" rarely appear together on Indiana’s health care website. The state describes the program as a ""homegrown consumer-driven health care coverage program for low-income adults."" And, upon announcing the news, Pence avoided praising Medicaid as an effective coverage option. ""I believe Medicaid is not a program we should expand. It's a program that we should reform — and that's exactly what we're accomplishing,"" Pence said during a speech at an Indiana hospital. ""HIP 2.0 is not intended to be a long-term entitlement program. It's intended to be a safety net that aligns incentives with human aspirations."" But expand Medicaid, Indiana did. And, by the time Trump and Pence were elected to the White House, Pence was one of 10 Republican governors to expand Medicaid. ""Indiana and Arkansas have different names for their programs, but they are accessing federal funds through the ACA Medicaid expansion legislation,"" said Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the program on Medicaid for the Kaiser Family Foundation. KFF is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on health care issues. As a result, about 381,000 people were enrolled in Indiana’s program by 2016, according to the State Health Reform Assistance Network. Indiana’s program Some conservatives oppose the idea of expanding Medicaid mainly because they fear the government might shift more of the financial burden to state governments over time. (Despite expanding Medicaid in Indiana, Pence wants to repeal the ACA and has falselyclaimed that expansion made it harder for disabled Ohioans to obtain coverage.) Indiana’s expansion plan gained support from Republicans in part because the Hoosier state implemented controversial qualification requirements. For example, all participants in Indiana’s program must contribute money — from $1 to $27 per month — to a health savings account. Enrollees who miss payments face a reduction in benefits. ""In Indiana’s case their waiver contained elements like some increased cost sharing and health savings accounts — other states that have expanded Medicaid have used some of these ideas too,"" said Adam Searing, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s school of public policy. At the time, Indiana was the 28th state to expand Medicaid and one of the first to require premium payments. Since then, that list of states has grown to 33, and Utah is putting the issue to a vote via a statewide referendum this November. ""While Indiana’s expansion doesn’t look exactly like say California’s or New York’s where they just expanded coverage under their existing Medicaid program to the new group of adults, it does look a lot like Arkansas or Kentucky or Arizona or Montana which all used such waivers when they expanded Medicaid,"" Searing wrote in an email. Effect of conditions The latest Medicaid expansion proposal in North Carolina (Carolina Cares) is modeled after Indiana's program. It would charge premiums and impose work requirements. Critics worried that Indiana’s rules would hinder its ability to cover more people. A recent study found that insurance coverage increased in states that expanded Medicaid — including Indiana. Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University’s School of Medicine and a critic of Indiana’s payment requirements, summarized the findings in a July 2 article for The New York Times. ""The good news is that even with these extra requirements, Indiana saw significant gains in Medicaid coverage,"" Carroll wrote. ""But we don’t know if gains would have been even larger without them,"" he continued. ""It’s possible that the churn caused by cost-sharing requirements may be causing the state to underperform. Neighboring states did see larger gains than Indiana itself. But Indiana overperformed compared with other, more distant states, making this unclear."" Cohen said Indiana expanded Medicaid while Pence was governor. Though Indiana doesn’t refer to its program as Medicaid expansion, the state did expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act while implementing controversial conditions.

Donald Trump falsely says ICE liberated towns from MS-13 control
","President Donald Trump argued against calls by some Democrats to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying he’s watched the agency ""liberate"" towns from the violent MS-13 gang. ""The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 & clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!"" Trump tweeted June 30. (Read more about the growing calls to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.) Trump repeated the message in a July 5 tweet, ""Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!"" We wondered: Has ICE freed towns from MS-13’s dominion, as Trump claimed? Trump’s tweet did not say which towns had been liberated, or when. ICE referred PolitiFact to the White House for comment. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for clarity. We searched for facts to support the statement but did not find any. MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, operates in at least 40 states with an estimated 10,000 U.S.-based members. The street gang ""has a large presence"" in New York, Virginia, and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the U.S. Justice Department has said. The FBI does not have a breakdown of their presence by state or location, said FBI spokeswoman Nora Scheland. Trump’s use of ""liberate"" suggested that towns had been under the rule or full control of MS-13. But neither the White House or ICE have named such towns. Experts on sociology and gang research told PolitiFact they were unaware of U.S. towns wholly controlled by the gang, and that Trump’s wording sounded like political hyperbole. ""This is hyperbolic and misleading language,"" said Jorja Leap, an adjunct professor of social welfare and director of the Health and Social Justice Partnership at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. ""Liberation is usually the terminology of military forces — as in, the Allies liberated France from the Nazis."" ""The claim is sort of outrageous and rather difficult to support since no U.S. government or state government has identified a city over which we lost sovereignty or control,"" said Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. ""MS-13 in certain cities have made inroads, in certain neighborhoods and schools, but to say entire towns have been under MS-13 control, that simply has never been substantiated,"" Armstrong added. ""In the absence of any evidence, one would have to say it's either a gross exaggeration if not a fabrication, because we've never known that."" It would be a major accomplishment if a town got rid of MS-13’s presence, said David C. Pyrooz, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. ""But most gang crackdowns or raids only temporarily improve the condition of communities by reducing crime and fear, since the underlying factors giving rise to gangs and violence go unchanged by these police practices,"" Pyrooz said. News outlets have reported on MS-13’s brutal violence, its recruitment efforts, and the fear its members instill largely in immigrant communities and minors who come to the United States illegally without a parent or guardian. MS-13’s primary target is the immigrant community, though there have been cases where non-immigrants have also been victims, said Joseph Kolb, executive director of the Southwest Gang Information Center, which accumulates and shares gang-related information and training with law enforcement at local, state and federal level. MS-13 gang members have been charged in the 2016 murders of New York teenagers Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, who were walking together in their hometown. ""MS-13, they don’t control towns, but they control niches in towns,"" Kolb said. MS-13, like any ethnic or racial gang, have higher levels of crime in certain areas and flourish in the communities that they live in, Kolb said. Trump generally omits the fact that MS-13’s main targets are immigrants. Hundreds of gang members from MS-13 and others have been arrested in ICE-led operations over recent years. It’s worth noting that ICE isn’t necessarily the only law enforcement unit going after gang members. Established in 2005, Operation Community Shield is ICE’s anti-gang enforcement initiative that works with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. ""Gang-related enforcement activity is much more effective in areas where the partnership between ICE (Homeland Security Investigations) and local law enforcement is strongest,"" ICE’s website said. A six-week ICE-led gang operation that ended in May 2017 resulted in the arrest of 1,378 people (1,095 confirmed as gang members and affiliates). The majority of the arrested were U.S. citizens. And of the 1,378 arrested, 104 were MS-13 gang members, according to ICE. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division arrested nearly 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017 and 405 in the first-quarter for fiscal year 2018, the agency previously told PolitiFact. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October 2017 also said he was designating MS-13 as a priority for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces. The coalition includes ICE, the FBI, Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Department of Labor Inspector General, and others. ""Large gang crackdowns, especially those involving violent gangs, often include multiple agencies,"" Pyrooz said. ""It would be rare, although not necessarily impossible, for a raid to occur without the assistance of local police, owing to the ground-level intelligence that police have on the gang dynamics in a city."" Trump tweeted, ""I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13."" Neither ICE nor the White House identified towns that had been under MS-13 rule and were then liberated by ICE. Experts said the gang targets niches or immigrant communities within larger jurisdictions, and did not have entire towns within its violent grasp. Raids by law enforcement temporarily improve the safety of communities, but usually do not act as permanent solutions because the underlying circumstances of gang violence remain.

"['Jobs', 'Illinois', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Emanuel wrong again on Chicago jobs
","Chicago’s unemployment rate is at its lowest point since the run-up to the Great Recession. And as of this spring, fewer city residents were jobless than at any other time in at least three decades. So there’s good news on the jobs front that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could reasonably tout. Instead, he is now clinging to a variation of a boast we rated as False when we first heard him utter it in January. Back then, he declared Chicago in 2017 enjoyed the ""highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city."" His revised variation narrows the comparison by more than a century and no longer explicitly confines it to workers in the private sector. ""Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950,"" Emanuel declared recently during a public television interview on WTTW’s ""Chicago Tonight"" program. A few minutes later in the interview, he repeated the point to underscore how attractive the city has become to employers. Is Emanuel now on more solid ground with his amended jobs claim than when we checked him early this year? We decided to take a second look. Emanuel didn’t explain the basis for his new claim. We sought clarification from a mayoral spokesman, but he did not provide it. But, in a nutshell, the answer to our question is no. State and federal headcounters conduct different jobs tallies, but none render numbers that match the superlatives uttered by the mayor either now or in January. Underlying our skepticism of Emanuel’s initial claim was an obvious demographic reality: Chicago’s population has been shrinking for decades and, at 2.7 million residents, is 900,000 fewer than its 1950 peak recorded by the Census. Early this year, an Emanuel spokesman said the mayor’s numbers came from an annual report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. That report does not tally jobs held by Chicago residents, but rather private-sector jobs located in the city held by Chicagoans and suburbanites alike. For 2017, that report showed 1.18 million private-sector jobs in the city, the highest number reported by the state since 1990 when it recorded 1.2 million private-sector jobs for Chicago. But the report series dates back to the late 1950s, and for most years prior to 1990, the city’s private-sector jobs count far exceeded its 2017 tally. Loading... It is also important to note that state officials say their private-sector jobs report has not been updated since Emanuel spoke last January, so nothing has changed in the intervening months that could make his false claim true based on state figures. Of course, Emanuel did not limit his WTTW comments to private-sector jobs. But his argument would fall just as flat if he meant to refer to the broader measure of all jobs held by Chicagoans—whether inside city limits or not. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged Chicago’s preliminary employment numbers for May, the most recent available, at 1,286,424. That is up more than 76,000 from May 2010 during the depth of the Great Recession. But in 2000, BLS numbers for Chicago employment exceeded today’s count by more than 32,000; in 1989 they were more than 60,000 higher; in 1984 more than 103,000 higher; and in 1976 nearly 215,000 greater. Emanuel said the city is experiencing its ""highest employment since 1950,"" a variation of a claim he made in January about Chicago’s private-sector employment hitting the highest level in city history. But Chicago has a much smaller population these days than it did in the post-war era, so it stands to reason that jobs numbers would shrink over the decades as well. And they have. Still, the city’s employment picture these days is indisputably brighter than it was just a few years ago. Preliminary federal figures for May show city jobless numbers at 48,602, down from nearly 170,000 in 2010. And the state’s private-sector jobs report, which the mayor’s office gestured to last time around, shows improvement as well—even if it doesn’t match the mayor’s rhetoric. Yet Emanuel continues to dwell on claims of job benchmarks that don’t exist instead of the ones that do. He was wrong the first time we checked him and he is wrong again now.

Has marijuana caused emergency room visits to skyrocket?
","Advocates against marijuana legalization frequently cite increased marijuana-related hospitalizations as proof the drug should not be sold commercially. But how much of a threat does cannabis actually present? Since retiring from Congress in 2010, Patrick J. Kennedy has been speaking out about his struggles with drug addiction and mental health. Kennedy is the co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a non-profit dedicated to combating cannabis legalization. The group refers to marijuana as ""the next ‘Big Tobacco’"" and advocates for increased research into cannabis as a potential medicinal source, rather than a recreational drug. In Kennedy’s home state of Rhode Island, the push for recreational legalization continues. In February 2018, the Rhode Island General Assembly resolved to create a working committee to study the effects of legalization. In May, Sen. Joshua Miller introduced a bill to the House to legalize for all people 21 and over. The day after the bill was introduced, the Providence Journal published an editorial by Kennedy. In it, Kennedy draws connections between addiction and mental illness, and encourages readers to take control of their mental health through ""healthy coping mechanisms and problem solving skills."" Especially for children, he writes, turning to drugs as a way of handling stress is a dangerous road to follow. Good as that all sounds, one line in particular stood out to us: ""These drugs (marijuana/THC), which masquerade as food, have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket,"" Kennedy wrote. Researchers are still working to determine the long-term health consequences of marijuana. Although each person reacts to THC differently, no deaths caused by marijuana alone have ever been recorded, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet. Regardless of immediate health risks, though, marijuana can impair judgement, leading to more accidents, or cause anxiety and paranoia in some users, leading to panic attacks that may prompt hospital visits. We decided to look at the numbers and determine if marijuana really has caused emergency room visits to increase. When we contacted Kennedy about this claim, Kennedy’s spokeswoman directed us to two studies about marijuana usage in Colorado: one conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and another compiled by Smart Against Marijuana. Colorado was one of the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Retail marijuana stores opened in early 2014, and medical marijuana had been legal since 2000. Colorado has also collected the most data on the consequences of marijuana legalization, serving as the template for other states considering the move. Hospitalization and emergency department visit rates related to marijuana are studied based on patient records. When a patient arrives at the emergency department, they are assigned ""billing codes,"" which list their conditions. According to the American Health Information Management Association, the primary diagnoses should be listed first. The 2015 report from the Colorado Department of Public Health shows that hospitalizations with marijuana-related billing codes have climbed steadily over the years. In 2011, 1,313 per 100,000 hospitalizations had marijuana-related billing codes, a figure which had risen to 3,025 by 2015. However, hospitalizations and emergency department visits—the statistic that Kennedy claims to be citing—are slightly different. Emergency department visits refer to patients who come to the hospital and are treated without being admitted. According to Dr. Daniel Vigil, program manager of the Marijuana Health Monitoring and Research Program at the Colorado Department of Public Health, hospitalizations are more likely to include marijuana-related billing codes. ""The limitation that a marijuana code might be present even when it isn't a causal factor in the visit may be more pronounced with hospitalizations, because there's more opportunity for gathering and documenting substance use information,"" Dr. Vigil told us in an email. ""For this reason, I'm more likely to discuss the (emergency department) visit rates when asked about health impacts."" So, although hospitalization rates are increasing in Colorado, emergency department rates are not. The emergency rate had increased from 2011 to 2014, peaking at 1,034 per 100,000 emergency visits, but then fell significantly in 2015 to only 754 per 100,000. In both this dataset and the data for hospitalizations, researchers counted any patient with a marijuana-related billing code, even if that code was unrelated to the injury being treated. So, if a patient were to come in with a cut on their hand, but also had smoked a few hours prior, they would receive a billing code and count as a ""marijuana-related hospitalization."" What’s it all mean? In Colorado, there has been a significant increase in patients being hospitalized with marijuana in their system. In the last decade, the hospitalization rate has more than doubled. However, it’s important to recognize that these numbers, while increasing, still make up a very small percentage of the total hospital visits. Three percent of hospitalizations in Colorado had a marijuana-related code in 2015, which could mean anything from ""patient is currently high"" to ""patient smokes weed habitually."" Only 0.6% of Colorado hospitalizations list marijuana in the top 3 billing codes. And again, none of that means that people are in the hospital because of marijuana. There are currently few studies which examine marijuana-related hospitalizations within individual states, even in areas where recreational cannabis has been legalized. One nationwide study by Dr. He Zhu of Duke University Medical Center showed that across the United States, between 2004 and 2011, emergency department visits that involved the use of cannabis had increased from 51 to 73 per 100,000 patients between 2004 and 2011. Those that involved cannabis combined with other drugs had also increased from 63 to 100 per 100,000. So again, definitely a trend upwards, but marijuana-related cases still encompassed less than 0.01% of total hospitalizations. Similarly to the Colorado studies, the researchers relied on hospital records that could not identify cannabis as the cause of the visit, but rather just a contributing factor. Additionally, because the study only used data up until 2011, it could not accurately reflect the trends related to recreational sales. We cannot conclusively say that marijuana has caused an increase in visits to the emergency room. Rather, the data show that more people are arriving at the hospital having recently or habitually used cannabis, even if that is not their primary condition (or related at all to their primary condition). Through it seems plausible that impaired judgment or slowed reflexes may be a culprit, it is impossible to say how often that is true. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us for a 2016 fact-check, ""The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe."" Kennedy wrote that marijuana and THC, ""have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket."" It is true that hospitalizations have increased over the last decade by people using marijuana, both in states like Colorado that have legalized recreational cannabis and nationwide. However, due to the way hospitals keep patient records, it is impossible to say that marijuana is the cause of these visits. Rather, it is possible that the higher numbers of high patients are due simply to the fact that more people are using marijuana overall. To say that marijuana is causing emergency room visits to skyrocket is unfounded based on the limited data that has been collected. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: This article has been revised to better reflect uncertainty about the long-term medical effects of marijuana. It does not change the rating of the fact-check.",/factchecks/2018/jul/06/patrick-kennedy/has-marijuana-caused-emergency-room-visits-skyrock/

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez misrepresents ICE’s detention bed quota
","Before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez upset top-ranking Democrat Joe Crowley in a New York congressional primary election in June, she laid out her stance on Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in an interview with The Intercept. ""The fact that they operate without the accountability of the Department of Justice is extremely concerning to us all,"" said the Democratic candidate for Congress in New York’s 14th Congressional District, who has recently become well-known for leading calls to ""abolish ICE"". Ocasio-Cortez went on to say the fact that ICE operates under the Department of Homeland Security, rather than the Department of Justice, is problematic. ""As a matter of fact, ICE is the only criminal investigative agency, the only enforcement agency in the United States that has a bed quota. So ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009,"" Ocasio-Cortez stated. Ocasio-Cortez’s claim had us wondering: Is ICE required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every night? Although the experts we spoke to told us ICE faces pressure from a variety of places to detain a large number of people, we found the legislation Ocasio-Cortez was referring to doesn’t require ICE to detain 34,000 people a day. Rather, it requires ICE to maintain 34,000 available beds a day. ‘Beds, not people’ Ocasio-Cortez was referring to a clause in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2016, which states that with the funds it receives from Congress through the act, ICE ""shall maintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2016."" According to Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the mandate exists because Congress wants to ""make sure that ICE does not use the detention bed money for something less effective."" The mandate first appeared in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2010. So while Congress requires ICE to make 34,000 beds available each day, it doesn’t require those beds to be filled. This isn't the first time this figure has come up. During a congressional hearing in 2014, U.S. Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, asked then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson for clarification on the detention bed quota, as it is known.   ""There is nothing in the law that is mandating you to put 34,000 people on these beds. Is that correct?"" Labrador asked. To which Johnson responded: ""I don’t read the law that way. It doesn’t read that way … It says beds, not people."" Peter Margulies, a professor of law at Roger Williams University, told us, ""unfortunately, this became a little bit of an urban legend, in a way, about what the appropriations statute required."" An ICE official also confirmed to PolitiFact that the language in the appropriations bills require ICE to maintain at least 34,000 beds each day, but don’t require ICE to fill those beds. However, according to a DHS report, in order to track compliance with the congressional mandate, ICE measures its ""average daily population."" So while the letter of the law may not require ICE to detain 34,000 people each day, it may have been in ICE’s best interest to act like it did. Unwritten rules Under DHS Secretary Johnson, ICE’s position was clear: 34,000 beds needed to be available, but not necessarily filled. But DHS secretaries have interpreted the appropriations legislation differently. In a 2013 congressional hearing, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano hinted that the detention bed quota was tying ICE’s hands, saying that ""we ought to be managing the actual detention population to risk, not to an arbitrary number."" Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told us that bureaucracy is a driving force behind the increased detention. ""A plain reading of the statute would be that they (ICE) just need to have the beds available but not fill them. I think in practice, they have felt that they needed to fill them (because) they are being funded for those beds and they don't want to lose that funding."" Has the number always been increasing? Ocasio-Cortez also stated that that number ""has only been increasing since 2009."" Though we’ve already established that no such numerical detainee requirement exists in the law for ICE, we decided to see if this part of Ocasio-Cortez’s claim was correct by looking at how the language in the appropriations bills changed from year to year. We found that her claim was not accurate. The DHS appropriations bills from 2010 to 2016 all included similar bed quotas. But the most recent 2017 and 2018 appropriations bills contained no such language. Experts confirmed with us that the detention bed quota language had been eliminated in 2017, and did not reappear in the current bill. While ICE’s average daily population has overall been on the rise since 2009, to say that the number tied to the detention bed quota has risen, as Ocasio-Cortez did, is inaccurate. Our ruling Ocasio-Cortez claimed that ""ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009."" The language in the congressional appropriations bills from 2009 through 2016 only mandates that ICE keep at least 33,400 (later 34,000) beds available. The bills don’t state that those beds need to be filled. Under different DHS secretaries, the government’s interpretation of the law has varied as to whether the beds need to be filled or not.   In addition, the last time the language requiring ICE to maintain a certain number of beds appeared in an appropriations bill was 2016. So, Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that the ""number (of detainees ICE is required to detain) has only been increasing since 2009"" is inaccurate. We rate Ocasio-Cortez’s claim False. ​ ",/factchecks/2018/jul/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-misrepresents-ices-detent/

No evidence that Obama secretly granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuclear agreement
","President Donald Trump repeated a viral claim from conservative media that President Barack Obama granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials, as part of the Iran nuclear agreement reached in 2015. ""Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal,"" said a July 2 headline on Diamond and Silk, who are pro-Trump activists. Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story was largely lifted from Fox News and repeated by Trump and other websites. ""Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?"" tweeted Trump, who announced in May that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. We found that the claim lacks evidence. Our fact-checking friends at Factnameh, a Canada-based website that fact-checks claims about Iran, found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up. Factnameh.com found that the original source of the claim was an anti-regime website called Amad News. It published the claim on Feb. 14, 2017, quoting an anonymous ""informed source."" Fox News attributed its report to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee. Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency, a ""semi-official"" organ of the Iranian government. Zolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, Fox said. ""When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran deal), decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,"" he claimed. Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News, ""This sounds like totally made up B.S."" Other officials in the Obama administration also said the statement was false. Richard Nephew, who works for Columbia University and was the State Department’s lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014, told PolitiFact that the claim ""is entirely nonsense."" ""It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed/requested citizenship,"" he said. ""While I was on the team, this wasn't even discussed, considered or thought about. I would bet any sum you'd care to wager that this didn't come up after I left the talks. And, it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this, we never heard of it. I find it hard to believe that's because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it."" Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, who served on State’s Policy Planning Staff from 2005-07, also expressed disbelief. (She held a part-time outside advisor role during the early part of Obama’s administration.) Maloney said the issue of U.S. citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment. There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period. There are also Iranian officials whose children have attended U.S. universities and stayed in the United States, or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship. ""Given the longstanding estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism,"" she said. Zolnour is a hard-line cleric, she said. ""So it’s not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump’s dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement,"" Maloney said. ""And yes, Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories, especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the U.S."" Ali Vaez, the anti-war Crisis Group's Iran Project Director, told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims. Vaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual-nationals from serving in the Iranian government. We emailed the Diamond and Silk website and did not get a reply. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to Fox News, and we didn’t get a reply to our email. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert was asked about Trump’s tweet at the July 3 press briefing and referred reporters to homeland security. A headline on a Diamond and Silk website said ""Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal."" The article stemmed from a Fox News report which was based on comments by Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, an Iranian official, who made the allegation during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s semi-official Fars News agency. The report doesn’t appear to include any actual evidence. Fox News’ report contained no confirmation by U.S. government officials working in the Trump administration. Former Obama administration officials denied the report and experts expressed skepticism. We rate claims based on available evidence, and so far have found none to support the claim.

Phony image said Maxine Waters called for undocumented immigrant as SCOTUS nominee
","As the nation awaits President Donald Trump’s announcement of a nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, social media has erupted with chatter from politicians and pundits about the potential pick. Another person dominating the internet space has been U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who first made headlines on June 23, 2018, when she told protestors at a Los Angeles rally to put pressure on the Trump administration over its policy separating immigrant families at the border with Mexico. Waters has been under constant fire from conservatives — including Trump, who elevated her profile with a series of Twitter attacks — for her comments at the rally. Waters also has become a target of several false reports and internet memes. The latest example: A doctored image purporting to show her telling CNN that an ""illegal immigrant"" should be nominated as the next Supreme Court justice. ""Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant,"" said the chyron in what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN interview with Waters. The photo was posted to Facebook on June 28, 2018, by Trump Nation, a group devoted to supporting the president. On a ticker at the bottom of the image, Waters is quoted as saying, ""It’s the only way the Democrats can ever win again."" In a comment accompanying the image, the post said: ""... and this is why WE don't watch CNN... They are bat shit crazy! SHARE if you agree …"" But, as several media outlets were quick to point out, the image is fake. The screenshot was likely lifted from an Oct. 24, 2017, interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo in which Waters explained what she had meant when she said she would ""take Trump out."" In the original clip, Waters can be seen wearing the same attire and jewelry — and speaking in front of the same backdrop — as in the doctored photo. She makes no mention of a judicial nominee being an immigrant.  We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports indicating that the doctored image was real. Trump Nation did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this image Pants on Fire! ",/factchecks/2018/jul/05/viral-image/phony-image-alleged-maxine-waters-called-undocumen/

No, it's not correct that 39% of California students are undocumented
","A viral image on social media -- one that’s critical of illegal immigration -- has been circulating for years. The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves. With immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again.  In this article, we’ll fact-check No. 6: ""39% of All California Students are illegals."" According to estimates by Enrico A. Marcelli of San Diego State University and Manuel Pastor of the University of Southern California, only about 3 percent of the child population in California -- defined as those under 18 -- were undocumented immigrants in the period 2008 to 2012. That’s far below the 39 percent suggested by the meme. There’s another way to look at the scope of undocumented immigrants within the California K-12 system -- to look at the percentage of California K-12 students whose parents are unauthorized. According to the Pew Research Center, 12.3 percent of K-12 students in California in 2014 had an unauthorized immigrant parent. This is a broader category -- encompassing parents rather than just students -- but even this doesn’t come close to the meme’s 39 percent figure. It’s worth noting that ""the vast majority of children of unauthorized immigrants are U.S. citizens—upwards of 80 percent,"" said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew Research Center. The 39 percent is ""way off,"" said Manuel Pastor, director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California. The viral image said, ""39% of All California Students are illegals."" That’s well above the most solid estimates we’ve seen. Perhaps 3 percent of students are themselves undocumented, and 12.3 percent have a parent who is undocumented.

Viral image overstates births to undocumented mothers in California
","A viral image on social media -- one that’s critical of illegal immigration -- has been circulating for years. The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves. With immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again.  In this article, we’ll fact-check No. 4: ""More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal."" Medi-Cal is the name of California’s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state. Undocumented immigrants may be eligible for health plan options through Medi-Cal, although the benefits may be limited. The most recent complete data we found was from 2011. That year, the state had 502,120 total births. According to Medi-Cal, 50.4 percent of the state’s births that year were paid for by Medi-Cal. That works out to 253,068 total births on Medi-Cal. Medi-Cal also reported that 29 percent of Medi-Cal mothers in 2011 were undocumented. So that year, 73,390 undocumented mothers gave birth on Medi-Cal. As a percentage of all births in the state, that works out to about 15 percent -- not 66 percent, as the meme says. After we initially published this article, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided statistics for 2012 and 2013. As it turns out, the percentage declined in those years -- to 13.4 percent in 2012 and 12.6 percent in 2013. In its previous review of these claims, Snopes evaluated an earlier version of the assertion that was worded, ""Over 2/3’s of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal whose births were paid for by taxpayers."" So we looked at the data for Los Angeles in 2013, the most recent year we could find on the California Department of Public Health website. That doesn’t support the earlier version of the claim either. That year, about 57 percent of births to residents of Los Angeles were Hispanic. But that refers to all Hispanic births -- not just those to undocumented immigrants, who accounted for only a fraction of the total Hispanic population. The meme says, ""More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal."" That’s wrong. Between 2011 and 2013, the most recent years available, between 12 percent and 15 percent of all births statewide were to undocumented immigrants using Medicaid, not 66 percent. We rate the statement False. UPDATE, July 5, 7:00 p.m.: This article has been updated with the most recent figures provided by California's Department of Health Care Services. The rating remains the same.",/factchecks/2018/jul/05/viral-image/viral-image-overstates-births-undocumented-mothers/
