Koch-backed group says Georgia solar policies cost more
","A group backed by the Koch brothers is arguing a proposed constitutional amendment that would change Florida solar energy regulations will lead the Sunshine State down a dark path. Americans For Prosperity Florida says a petition being circulated by solar advocates Floridians for Solar Choice is the wrong move for the state, and will result in higher costs and decreased competition. The proposal needs nearly 700,000 signatures to get on the 2016 ballot, allowing voters to decide on an amendment that would change current Florida law that says customers can only buy electricity from a utility. If the amendment is approved, customers could buy electricity from solar installers and not just utility companies. We’ve written about it before here. At a March 10, 2015, news conference, AFP members said the amendment was misguided. They backed up their point of view by implying Georgia’s solar policies are ""burdensome and expensive government mandates"" that shouldn’t be emulated, and cited a Louisiana study that solar power would be very expensive to implement. AFP Florida followed up the conference with a release that read, ""In Georgia, similar net metering policies have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable."" Is it true that energy regulations in Georgia -- often cited as a leader in implementing new solar policies -- have made electric rates go up? Time to rate the rates. Electric move It turns out we’ll be taking a quick look at Louisiana, too, because that’s the state AFP meant to name when citing net metering. They apologized and said they would correct the release, thanking PolitiFact for pointing out the error. We’ll be discussing both states for this check. What is net metering, anyway? In simplest terms, it’s the process of selling self-generated electricity, such as the power made by solar panels on your house, back to a utility company for a credit. The proposed Florida amendment doesn’t really concern itself with that, but rather removes a roadblock to buying power from someone other than a registered electric provider, like Duke Energy or Florida Power & Light. Right now, if a solar provider wants to sell its power, it must sell it to one of these utilities. Critics say being able to end this monopoly is key to expanding solar efforts in Florida, which is ranked 13th in solar installations by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Florida also is one of five states that specifically outlaw buying solar power directly from a provider. The others are Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Georgia. While Georgia isn’t trying to open the market the same way the Florida amendment would, the Peach State is enjoying its own moment in the sunshine on the subject of solar. The state in 2008 offered homeowner tax credits to boost solar installations, a program that expired in 2014.The Georgia Public Service Commission worked with the state’s largest utility, Georgia Power, to create the Georgia Power Advanced Solar Initiative in 2012. The utility created programs to let businesses and homeowners sell solar energy to Georgia Power, as well as working out power-purchase agreements with big solar developers. The plan has been called a success by advocates, the state’s PSC and electric providers, and plans for expanding the amount of solar power in the state are in the works. Georgia Power has said there has been no ""upward pressure on consumer rates."" Spokesman John Kraft told PolitiFact Florida that from the beginning, part of the initiative was that the company would be able to buy solar-generated electricity at or below rates it would cost the company for traditional means, such as electricity generated by burning fossil fuels or using nuclear power. The program was voluntary from the beginning and not a state mandate. ""There isn’t a regulation per se that says you have to do this amount,"" Kraft said. ""The PSC had been asking us for ways to do more solar."" So what about Louisiana? AFP Florida told us that’s really the place that saw higher electric rates because of solar policies. They cited a 2015 study for the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which was debating what to charge solar power customers for electricity. The report focused on the state’s 50 percent tax credit for installing new solar panels, and said those credits cost the state at least $89 million. The study became controversial because the study’s author -- consultant and Louisiana State University energy studies professor David Dismukes -- had written favorably about the oil and gas industries before. Solar advocates called the report biased for not focusing on the jobs the industry had created and misrepresenting how the state’s tax credits work. Setting aside the controversy over the study, Louisiana customers outside of New Orleans did see a base rate hike in 2014, which cost the average ratepayer about 47 cents per month. But that increase was approved by the PSC in 2013 and was over several issues, including the cost of maintaining an aging power grid. Electric utility company Entergy did not specifically mention solar as being an issue when announcing the base rate change. Last year, Louisiana voted to end its 50 percent tax credit for solar installations in 2017. Gov. Bobby Jindal is considering cutting it sooner to fill a $1.6 billion budget gap this year. So while Louisiana did see a rate increase, we don’t see evidence that it was specifically related to a solar initiative. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity Florida said recent solar energy policies in Georgia ""have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable."" The group admitted it meant to say Louisiana, which is having its own debate on the issue. But the program in Georgia is thriving. Part of Georgia's implementation plan was that using solar power wouldn’t affect rates, and it hasn’t, Georgia’s largest utility said. Louisiana did see a rate increase, but it doesn't seem to be specifically related to a solar initiative. The statement is completely wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2015/mar/24/americans-prosperity-florida/koch-backed-group-says-georgia-solar-policies-cost/

Creflo Dollar’s need for $65 million jet never gets off the ground
","Pastor Creflo Dollar’s plan to travel the world in the fastest and most luxurious business jet ever built never got off the ground. He and other leaders at World Changers Church International in College Park launched Project G650 with the goal of raising nearly $65 million for the airplane, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful. But negative public reaction to Dollar’s fundraising plea was so swift that it was halted within days of its launch. A promotional video featuring Dollar was quickly pulled down, but lives via YouTube. Some of the harshest words came from the faith community, including contemporary gospel’s Kirk Franklin who said: ""When I camouflage my ‘greeds’ to look like ‘needs,’ that’s a shortage of character."" Others asked: Why couldn’t pastor and evangelist Dollar conduct his mission travels as most do, via commercial airline, rather than a Gulfstream G650? We tried to reach Dollar directly but  were referred to Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president at 5W Public Relations in New York. He is representing Creflo Dollar Ministries and has been fielding questions about the now-defunct fundraising campaign. In an article that appeared March 13, Engelmayer told The Christian Post that Dollar is now taking commercial flights when he visits churches in New York. But, ""it’s not that simple,"" Engelmayer said, when a ministry team of 10 to 15 people ""take thousands of pounds,"" even 100,000 pounds, ""of food and provisions with them when they go around the world."" That’s why the Gulfstream G650 is needed, he suggested. ""The plane is not so Creflo Dollar can get on by himself and fly."" Engelmayer made similar comments to the Associated Press. He said members of the ministry travel much of the year bringing their message, food and supplies to people around the world, and this jet has the fuel efficiency, speed, cargo space and seating the church needed. So is that a reason the ministry wanted donations of $65 million -- to have an airplane with cargo space capable of carrying thousands, possibly 100,00 pounds of food and other supplies? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts. First a little background about the 53-year-old megachurch pastor and evangelist and how he came to say he was praying for a Gulfstream G650. Dollar preaches what is known as the prosperity gospel, a religious doctrine that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. A native of College Park, he founded the non-denominational World Changers Church International, which boasts 30,000 members, 350 employees, an 81-acre campus and mission work on six continents. Dollar has long been criticized for being a preacher who lives a lavish lifestyle with Rolls Royces, million-dollar homes and jets. The tax exempt status of his ministry -- as well as five others -- was the focus of a U.S. Senate committee’s three-plus year investigation that started in 2007 and was based on public complaints and media reports about large salaries, lavish expenditures. Dollar protested the investigation, which closed with no findings of wrongdoing. Committee investigators said Dollar and the ministry at that time had four airplanes, including the one he wanted to replace with the $65 million Gulfstream. The plane World Changers and Dollar made the case for the new jet -- the Gulfstream G650, which is manufactured in Savannah -- after the church’s longtime Gulfstream G1159A, more commonly known as a G-III, was damaged and taken out of service last last year. They said the jet -- built in 1984 and purchased in 1999 -- traveled four million miles and had two recent mishaps: one where the right engine failed near Hawaii enroute to Australia;  and a second in which the airplane’s nose hit a London runway while Dollar’s wife, Taffi, and three of his daughters were aboard. It was after these incidents, Dollar told potential donors on the video,  ""I knew it was time to begin to believe God for a new airplane."" PolitiFact found a National Transportation Safety Board report confirming that older jet received  ""substantial airframe damage"" in the accident that occurred on takeoff from London to Canada. Eight people were on the airplane, including one woman who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia confirmed that the jet likely would need to be replaced if it had substantial airframe damage. But Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group in Washington, said Dollar -- in proposing that the disabled jet be replaced with a $65 million G650 -- was suggesting going from ""the old Honda to the new Rolls Royce."" This 18-seat jet, which won aviation’s most prestigious honor, the Collier Trophy in 2014, is considered the best and fastest high-end corporate jet ever built. It’s the mode of travel for world governments, the very top echelon of business executives and likely the richest of the rich, he said. Does it have cargo space for thousands of pounds of food and other supplies? Experts told us the answer is no. Carrying cargo is not this jet’s mission, Aboulafia said. ""If they make that claim [that they were buying the Gulfstream G650 to carry cargo], they're expecting the public to be a lot dumber than it is,"" he said. Cargo space on a business jet is measured in terms of golf bags, Aboulafia said. Steve Cass, vice president for technical marketing and communications with the jet’s manufacturer, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., confirmed the jet’s space limitations. The G650 has room for 18 passengers and 2,500 pounds of baggage, Cass said. We sent an email to Engelmayer asking him to clarify his ""cargo’ comments. He did not respond specifically to that request, but said there is ""no campaign for a plane, and the ministry’s work helping people in need and spreading the gospel continues as it always has. ""There is nothing more about this to discuss,"" he said. Rusty Leonard, founder and CEO of MinistryWatch.com said he was ‘disturbed, but not surprised"" to learn Dollar was trying to raise money for a $65 million jet. ""This is normal behavior for a prosperity gospel preacher who turns the gospel upside down by making it all about your/their own blessings/success rather than about sacrificially blessing others who are in need as Jesus actually taught,"" he said. His organization does not recommend donating to Dollar’s organizations, Leonard said. Our ruling: Dollar and other leaders in World Changers Church International launched and then dropped a campaign that asked  followers to pony up  $65 million for a top-of-the-line luxury jet. It’s an airplane generally reserved for world leaders, the top crop of business executives and billionaires. One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods -- as well as ministers bringing the Word of God -- to other parts of the world. That argument never got off the runway. It is inaccurate and bordering on ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.

Is NYC mayor de Blasio responsible for uptick in murders and more subway delays?
","Fox News host Greg Gutfeld is no fan of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and he laid bare his complaints in a personal commentary. ""Unless you’re a well off liberal, it’s been a bad year for New York City,"" Gutfeld said on March 10, 2015. ""Shootings are way up, homicides too by 20 percent. Subway delays have soared by 45 percent."" ""Is it any coincidence this is happening under the most progressive leader since Marx?"" Gutfeld continued, ""If he were a Republican with these stats, he'd be hog-tied, bobbing in the Hudson."" We’ll take Gutfeld’s factual assertions about murders and subway waits in order and see how well they fit the data. Fox News sent us items from the New York Post that backed up Gutfeld. A March editorial noted that ""homicides are up 20 percent in New York the first two months of this year over the same period in 2014."" That is in line with New York Police Department statistics. As of March 8, 2015, there had been 59 murders, compared to 48 by the same time last year. But Candace McCoy, a criminologist at  the City University of New York, urged a bit of caution in drawing conclusions too quickly. ""Two months is not a trend,"" McCoy said. The danger of jumping on the latest figures is that the numbers can bounce around. Back in February, the city set a new record of 10 days without a single homicide but no one was ready to say that the Big Apple had cured itself of murder. McCoy also noted that in 2014, the city had the lowest number of slayings since 1963 -- just 333. That was de Blasio’s first year in office. ""We can definitely say that homicides are not up 20 percent since de Blasio took office,"" McCoy said. ""In fact, the trend is the opposite."" If Gutfeld wanted to look at 2-month snapshot, it’s instructive to see what happened in 2013. By early March that year there had been 58 deaths, or just one less than in the same period in 2015. But having 58 or 59 deaths by March doesn’t necessarily translate into high numbers overall for the entire year. In 2013, the year closed out with just two more murders than in the record low year of 2014. So the number of murders by March doesn’t tell you much about how the entire year will turn out. Even the editorial that Fox News cited as a source was more restrained. ""We’re reluctant to draw big conclusions from such limited data,"" the New York Post said. Subway blues Gutfeld said that delays for subway riders have shot up 45 percent. The New York Post reported that the average number of delays each month rose from about 29,000 in 2013 to over 43,000 in 2014. We went to the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s monthly reports for its Transit and Bus Committee, and there’s no problem with the numbers. The average number of delays is up, as Gutfeld said. We note that there are other ways to measure how well the system is running, such as looking at how often the trains run on-time. That also is worse compared with 2013, but not as dramatically -- just about 8 percent. John Raskin is executive director of Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for the people who rely on the city’s buses and trains. Raskin agreed that performance has dropped. He said it’s due to equipment breakdowns, repair work left over from Hurricane Sandy, and chronic underinvestment by New York state. But Raskin’s overarching point is that it makes no sense to blame de Blasio for the decline. ""The subway system runs as an independent authority that reports to the state,"" Raskin said. ""Someone connecting subway delays with the change in administration is showing they don’t understand how the transit system runs and is misleading people."" While it might sound odd that the transit system of New York City isn’t controlled by the city, in fact the governor nominates the 17 members of the board that governs the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the state Senate confirms them. The mayor recommends four people for that board. One could argue that the city is free to put more money into the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The municipal budget contributes about $100 million each year, and one advocacy group, the NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign, wants that to rise to $125 million saying ""the city should do better by the riding public."" But the senior attorney for NYPIRG (New York Public Interest Research Group) Gene Russianoff told PunditFact that despite that stand, he puts real responsibility at the feet of the governor and the state Legislature. Our ruling Gutfeld faulted the performance of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and noted that murders are up 20 percent and subway delays are up 45 percent. Gutfeld’s numbers are correct, but he commits extreme cherry picking with the murder statistic. A full year assessment of de Blasio’s administration would show that the murder rate is holding about steady compared to the year before he took office. As for the increased suffering of subway riders, it is real, but a large portion of that falls outside of de Blasio’s direct control. The state wields final authority over the trains. While de Blasio could press to add more city funds, he doesn’t control the budget and his representatives represent less than a quarter of the votes on the MTA board. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/23/greg-gutfeld/nyc-mayor-de-blasio-responsible-uptick-murders-and/

Ken Plum says Pre-K education leads to less crime and welfare
","Del. Ken Plum, D-Fairfax, recently renewed his call on Virginia to invest more money in preschool education. During a cable television discussion in Reston, Plum said, ""We’ve got 40 years of study now that show that, with a good preschool start, you’re less likely to be on public dole. You’re less likely to be in prison. You’re much more likely to be a good productive citizen.That money spent up front saves money in the long haul."" The value of a preschool education is a hot topic among early childhood education experts, gaining steam in 2013 when President Barack Obama proposed expanding publicly funded programs to include all 4-year-olds who come from low and moderate-income families. Much of the research has focused on whether preschool provides lasting gains in the thinking and social skills of low-income children.   Plum’s statement focuses on a narrower area of study -- whether participation in a quality preschool program lowers the likelihood that a person will wind up in prison or on welfare. We examined Plum’s assertion that it does. State and federal preschool programs provide instruction for more than 2 million children aged 3 and 4 nationwide, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. The federal Head Start program is only available to children living below the poverty line. Most states, including Virginia, fund programs for children from low-income homes with earnings above the poverty line. Ypsilanti Plum backed his statement by referring us to a widely cited study that tracks the lives of 123 low-income black children who lived in an elementary school district in Ypsilanti, Mich., in the 1960s. The children were randomly divided into two groups --  one that attended a high quality preschool program and another group that didn’t enroll in any preschool program. In 2005, the HighScope Educational Research Foundation issued a follow-up report on the students, who had reached age 40. Researchers concluded that those ""who had the preschool program had higher earnings, were more likely to hold a job, had committed fewer crimes and were more likely to have graduated from high school than adults who did not have preschool."" The report found that 28 percent of those who went through the program were sentenced to jail or prison, compared to 52 percent of those who didn’t attend. The study also noted that the students who went through the program had fewer criminal arrests than peers who weren’t enrolled. The difference was less stark when it came to comparing the use of welfare and other social programs. The study found that 71 percent of the program’s students were on the dole at some point in their adult lives, compared to 86 percent who hadn’t attended preschool. Researchers said the distinction ""was not significant."" Chapel Hill Another ongoing study of a high quality pre-K program is the Abecedarian Project at the University of North Carolina. It began in the 1970s, tracking 111 low-income black children ranging in age from 0 to 5. The children were split into two groups: those who ultimately attended the preschool program, and those who did not. In 2012, researchers interviewed members of the sample, who were now 30. They found that those who didn’t attend the program were six times more likely to have received welfare benefits for at least nine months between the ages of 22 and 30. But unlike the Ypsilanti study, the North Carolina researchers found little difference between the two groups when it came to crime. Among those who didn’t go through the program, 28.6 percent reported having had a criminal conviction by age 30. Of those who did go to preschool, 27.5 percent said they had a criminal conviction. The Michigan and North Carolina studies are often cited by researchers to prove that high quality preschool programs lead to better life outcomes and end up paying for themselves in the long run.   But critics note that the programs in Ypsilanti and Chapel Hill were small, intensive initiatives that spent much more per student than typical state-run preschool programs and therefore, shouldn’t be generalized beyond the communities they served. Both programs, for example, allowed students to have more than one year of preschool while most states -- including Virginia -- offer only a single year of pre-K. Russ Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said people often make generalizations on the long-term effects of preschool based mainly on the results of the Ypsilanti study. ""This is a very risky generalization to today’s programs from a small study done 40 years ago,"" Whitehurst told us. Whitehurst, the former director of the Institute of Education Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education, wrote in a 2013 paper for Brookings that  ""the circumstances of the very poor families of the black children who were served by these model programs 30-40 years ago are very different from those faced by the families that are presently served by publicly funded preschool programs."" He noted that the Ypsilanti and Chapel Hill programs didn’t include any Hispanic students, who make up nearly half of the 4-year-olds enrolled in the federal Head Start program. But Larry Schweinhart, lead researcher of the Ypsilanti study, said in a 2004 statement that the results they discovered could transport to other publicly funded programs -- as long as they embraced the same type of high-quality program as Ypsilanti’s. Chicago Many researchers who believe in the long-term impact of preschool point to a study of 1,500 low-income children who attended 20 Chicago Child-Parent Centers at public schools during the 1980s. Two-thirds of the children went through the program and the rest did not. Researchers have tracked the students’ life experiences ever since. We contacted Arthur Reynolds, a University of Minnesota professor who was the lead author of the report. He said researchers concluded that the preschool graduates, by the time they reached their mid-20s, had a 20 percent lower rate of incarceration than those who didn’t go through the program. ""Preschool graduates also had a more stable employment history and were more likely to attend a 4-year college. This is associated with higher wages that would increase tax revenues and lessen public aid receipt,"" Reynolds emailed. Our ruling Plum said, ""We’ve got 40 years of study now that show that, with a good preschool start, you’re less likely to be on public dole. You’re less likely to be in prison."" Three major studies on the issue vary in their results but provide a basis for Plum’s contention. Two of the three studies showed that preschool students were less likely to be incarcerated as adults than those who were not enrolled. All three studies suggested pre-K children were less likely to go on the public dole as adults, although the Ypsilanti study was more equivocal about that conclusion. The variations in the reports underscore that the linkage between pre-K and successful citizenship is not as ironclad as Plum suggests. Analysts debate whether the results from the three local programs studied would extend to other preschool initiatives across the county. With those clarifications in mind, we rate Plum’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/23/ken-plum/ken-plum-says-pre-k-education-leads-fewer-arrests/

Are alligator attacks more common than 'attacks' by those with a gun permit in Florida?
","The Florida Legislature is moving toward allowing guns on college campuses. House and Senate panels have voted in favor of a proposal that would let concealed weapon license holders -- who must be 21 -- have their guns in college facilities. Currently, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. The Legislature had previously rejected allowing guns on campuses, but a shooting last year reignited the debate. Gunman Myron May, a former Florida State University student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. During a Senate Higher Education Committee hearing on March 16, 2015, students testified both for and against the proposal. ""According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than by someone who happens to carry a conceal-and-carry permit, and that was a study over the first 10 years of the conceal-carry law in Florida,"" said Erek Culbreath, president of Florida Students for Concealed Carry, a group that advocates for concealed carry of firearms on all the campuses. Are gator attacks twice as common as attacks by someone who has a conceal-and-carry permit? We went in search of the evidence. Data on gators and guns Florida’s concealed weapon permit program started in 1987. Currently, about 1.3 million people have Florida concealed weapon licenses. (By coincidence, the number of estimated wild alligators in Florida is also 1.3 million.) We found no study that compared gator attacks with any sort of ""attack"" by gun license owners. What Culbreath sent us -- and what we found elsewhere -- was that over the years, pro-gun advocates obtained separate data from state officials on gator attacks and gun license revocations and combined them to make such a comparison. In fact, this claim even made its way to the Connecticut General Assembly when politicians there considered a handgun safety bill in 1998. For example, one website wrote it this way in 1999:  ""Do firearms carry laws result in chaos? No. Consider the case of Florida. A citizen in the Sunshine State is almost twice as likely to be attacked by an alligator than to be assaulted by a concealed carry holder. During the first ten years that the Florida law was in effect, alligator attacks outpaced the number of crimes committed by carry holders by a 146 to 88 margin."" (The footnotes stated that the information came from a Fish and Wildlife Conservation spokesman and a statistical report about gun licenses.) We obtained some updated data from state officials. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has documented the number of alligator bites on people between 1948 and November 2013 for a total of 357 bites. (For the record, that is strictly bites by alligators and not crocodiles, which are rare.) During the hearing, Culbreath mentioned data from the first 10 years of concealed carry in Florida. We found no comprehensive source of data for ""attacks"" by gun license holders. However, the state does have data on revocations for misuse of a firearm. Between October 1987 and February 2015, the state revoked 9,636 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to data maintained by the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which handles gun permits. Of that group, 168 were revoked for misuse of a firearm. (In January 2011 the state stopped maintaining information about the breakdown of license revocations by type.) We were unable to obtain more details about whether those 168 assaulted someone or misused the gun in some other way. We also couldn’t isolate data just for 1987 through 1997 to provide a decade comparison to the alligator bites. But overall, alligator bites happen more often than the revocation of gun permits for misuse of firearms. Is it a meaningful comparison? Experts didn’t think it should carry much weight in the policymaking process. ""As for comparing bites to bullets, it is more than silly,"" said James Alan Fox, criminology professor at Northeastern University. ""The risk of attack by an armed person exists virtually anywhere one travels. Gators only attack near certain bodies of water. At the University of Florida, for example, the only gator you’ll see is the mascot at sporting events."" (After our fact-check posted we heard from a couple of readers who noted that there are indeed actual live alligators on the University of Florida campus. ""We do indeed have real alligators on campus,"" university spokesman Steve Orlando said. ""There are several in Lake Alice on the west side of campus, though I couldn’t give you an exact number. We have no record of any alligator attacks."") UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, an expert on the Second Amendment, had this to say about our query: ""Are you serious? I'd rather not be attacked by an alligator or a concealed carry permit holder. The data on permit revocations suggest that concealed carry permits are revoked far more often than alligator attacks. Alligators are also subject to stricter controls than concealed carry permit holders: You can't bring an alligator to the mall when you go shopping."" David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and author of the book Private Guns, Public Health, said that revocations don’t capture every misuse of a gun by a permit holder. ""It would be like looking at the small number of driving licenses that are revoked and claiming that is a good measure of how well people are driving,"" he said. Florida State University Professor Gary Kleck said that the comparison to gator attacks was likely used to indicate how rare gun crimes by carry permit holders are. ""It could just as easily been something else that's really rare, like death from meteor strikes or midair aircraft collisions. The point is merely that these things are extremely rare,"" he said. Our ruling Culbreath said, ""According to the state of Florida, you are almost twice as likely to get attacked by an alligator than by someone with a conceal-and-carry permit."" We don't have data on attacks committed by people with conceal-and-carry permits. The gun data is based on an approximation using permit revocations that may or may not accurately reflect the number of ""attacks."" Also, the data is 10 years old.  That said, these statistics, imperfect as they are, do support the notion that both kinds of attacks are uncommon. Whether this is a valid argument in favor of the bill is in the eye of the beholder. We find the statement has an element of truth but ignores other information that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/23/florida-students-concealed-carry/are-alligator-attacks-more-common-attacks-those-gu/

Don Beyer says 7,000 Americans died from climate change events in 2014
","After a long career as a car dealer, lieutenant governor and ambassador, Democrat Don Beyer was elected to the U.S. of House Representatives last year with a focus on protecting the planet against climate change. Beyer, D-8th, reiterated his goal in a March 4 column for the Falls Church News-Press, calling global warming the ""existential crisis of our generation, and of course the preeminent environmental issue."" ""More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year,"" he wrote. Beyer posted a similar statement on his congressional website on Feb. 4, saying climate change caused ""almost 7,000"" U.S. deaths last year. We wondered whether his claim is correct and asked for the source of Beyer’s information. Thomas Scanlon, a spokesman for Beyer, said the congressman’s office had made a mistake about the 7,000 deaths. ""That number should be globally, not just in the United States,"" he emailed. ""We made an error in editing this column for FCNP."" That said, we wondered if there was even proof that 7,000 worldwide deaths were caused by climate change last year. Scanlon referred us to a two-page report on global warming issued in January by the American Academy of Actuaries. It said ""global natural loss events"" caused 7,700 fatalities last year. The academy attributed the number to Munich RE, a global insurance company based in Germany that issues an annual report on worldwide losses from natural catastrophes. In a study released in January, the company said 7,700 deaths were caused by global disasters -- including earthquakes, storms, floods, landslides, drought, extreme temperatures and wildfires. But Munich RE doesn’t assess whether whether the natural catastrophes -- resulting in $110 billion in financial losses last year -- were caused by climate change. ""We do not have the ability to identify the direct impact of global warming on fatalities caused by natural catastrophes, other than to say any fatality caused by the earthquake peril are not due to global warming,"" emailed Peter Hoeppe, Munich RE’s head of geo risks research. ""Our data indicate an upward trend in regard to losses from weather catastrophes which, over time, have increased in both frequency and severity."" Of the 7,700 deaths, Munich RE estimated 850 were caused by earthquakes. The remaining 6,850 deaths, the company wrote, were caused by ""weather-related"" events. While there’s no precise way to measure the number of deaths caused by global warming, we should note that many experts believe it will be the root of many fatalities in coming decades. The World Health Organization predicts that an additional 250,000 people -- largely in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa -- will die annually between 2030 and 2050 because of conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change. Our ruling Beyer wrote, ""More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year."" The congressman lacks documentation and admits he got his facts wrong.

Does average UW-Madison faculty member bring in ""close to a quarter million"" a year in grant money?
","A leading Democrat predicts devastation if Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed $300 million cut over two years to the University of Wisconsin System is adopted. ""For UW-Madison it’s a major issue,"" Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, said in a March 12, 2015 Wisconsin Eye interview. ""It’s penny wise and pound foolish there."" Barca added: ""The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year. So you cut them and they’re leaving. They have plenty of opportunities to go to Harvard or Princeton or Stanford."" Barca was joined on the Wisconsin Eye program by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester. He thinks the university cut is too large, but says Democrats are overreacting. ""Let’s remember that the cut that’s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (former Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat), and I didn’t hear Democrats complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end."" We’ll test Vos’ claim soon. For now, let’s examine Barca’s statement about the prowess of the Madison faculty in attracting research grants. Researching the research When we asked Barca to back up the claim, spokeswoman Laura Smith pointed to a page on the UW-Madison website that answers frequently asked questions about the 2015-’17 budget -- at least from the UW System’s perspective. The page asserts that asking professors to teach more classes -- as Walker suggested -- would cut into critical functions of the university: ""Research is central to their jobs. According to university statistics, each faculty member is bringing in approximately $242,000 on average to support their research in a highly competitive national environment. Faculty and staff brought in more than $500 million in federal research awards in 2012-13, money that would not otherwise come to Wisconsin."" So there’s Barca’s ""close to a quarter million"" figure. We asked UW-Madison about the numbers. They are from 2012-13, and were published in March 2014 in the university’s ""Data Digest"". The document provides a detailed look at various aspects of the campus and is put together by three offices: Academic Planning & Institutional Research, Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Finance & Administration. UW-Madison is one of the leading research institutions in the country as measured by total grants from outside sources, mostly the federal government. Out of its 2,173 faculty members, 1,275 (or 59 percent) secured research grants in 2012-13, the latest year available. So there’s a point of clarification: Barca frames his claim around the idea that any cuts will hurt the university’s ability to bring in research money. But in the year examined, 41 percent did not bring in grants. The university says it uses the total number of faculty when calculating the per-professor grant haul because all faculty members are expected to do research. In all, professors pulled in a total of $525.7 million in grants from outside sources. The grants are in these areas: biological sciences, humanities, physical sciences, social sciences. Spread over 2,173 faculty, that’s the $242,000 figure. If you spread it out over just the faculty receiving grants, the average is $412,000. Jocelyn Milner, a UW official who helps prepare the ""Data Digest,"" told us that grant productivity is calculated in another way as well. There’s another $355 million in grants that are not awarded to individual professors, but to a dean or other official even though professors end up doing the research. When you add those in the per-faculty grant figure rises to $399,000 per year, Milner said. UW prefers the more conservative methodology that is behind the $241,935 figure, Milner said. We found that ranking universities on research prowess often turns on how much money they pull in. There are other factors that can help judge research prominence, such as journal articles published, endowment assets, faculty awards, and so on. Our rating Barca said, ""The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year."" He referred to research grants won. UW-Madison figures back up the claim, but there’s one point of clarification, in that not all faculty get grants. We rate Barca’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/23/peter-barca/does-average-uw-madison-faculty-member-bring-close/

Brooks lacks data to back up food stamp claim
","Georgia taxpayers are already on the hook for $17 million for parking improvements for the new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and that cost is expected to grow to $30 million with passage of this year’s state budget. But not everyone agrees that parking for Falcons fans should be a state budget priority when Arthur Blank, the billionaire owner of the Falcons, could pay for the improvements himself. ""Our priorities are so mixed up,"" veteran state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, D-Atlanta, said in an interview Jan. 20. ""We have state employees on food stamps who have to work two or three jobs to make ends meet.""
Could Brooks be right? Is the state paying millions for parking while some employees earn so little that they qualify for food stamps? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. But first a little background about the parking. Officials had long promised that the state wouldn’t have to chip in for the $1.4 billion stadium, which will be adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center. Then suddenly last year there was a push for $17 million for the first phase of a plan to add 1,000 parking spaces, helping to offset 1,300 lost in the football stadium’s construction. World Congress Center officials didn’t formally ask for the money until the final days of the legislative session, so it saw virtually no debate among lawmakers. Most didn’t find out about it until after the final budget deal had already been struck. Gov. Nathan Deal said he was only swayed to support the project by a broader argument that it also could be used for conventions, the College Football Hall of Fame and a hotel that is envisioned for the site. This year, World Congress Center officials were more open about a request for an additional $23 million to complete the parking deck, which they aggressively cast as an economic development tool and the first phase of a broader vision for the complex. The House and Senate have signed off on budget proposals that include the $23 million, although a conference committee report settling differences in their two versions of the budget still has to be negotiated, approved and signed by the governor. But what about Brooks’ claim? As we do with all fact checks, we contacted Brooks and asked for his evidence. When we first reached out to him, he was traveling. But Brooks told us there was a report that backed up his statement. He gave us the name of one legislative colleague and two private organizations, one or more of which he said could provide us with the report. We reached out to all three, but we found no such report. We circled back to Brooks, but he did not offer any information to support his claim. The state doesn’t keep data that we could find on how many of its workers are on food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. SNAP is available to people in Georgia with a gross household income that does not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level, $1,265 a month ($15,180 a year) for one person and $2,584 a month ($31,008 a year) for a family of four. Given those thresholds, it’s more than plausible that there are state workers who are teetering near that line and could obtain food stamps. The left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute identified one of the cleanest examples last year in a report headlined ""Teaching pre-k children shouldn’t require a vow of poverty."" The report pointed out that a pre-k assistant teacher makes $13,300 a year. We found other examples, including at the state Department of Corrections and even in the food stamp program itself, where an entry-level case worker makes $24,322. ""Given many of our employees are single parents earning entry-level salaries, there's no question we have a percentage of staff who turn to SNAP benefits to support their family"" said Susan Boatwright, spokeswoman for the state Division of Family and Children Services. Last year, a state audit showed the starting pay for a state corrections officer was $24,322, lower than in any bordering state except South Carolina. Based on SNAP criteria, an assistant pre-k teacher who is single could qualify for food stamps and so could a starting corrections officer who is married and the sole support for a wife and two children. With more than 100,000 people in the state government’s employment, there’s likely no doubt at least some would be part of the 840,815 households -- including about 92,000 in Fulton County and 72,000 in DeKalb County -- that received food stamps in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Our conclusion: It’s legitimate to question the use of taxpayer money for a project driven largely by a push for a new football stadium. And that debate will likely continue. But Brooks questioned whether a parking deck should be a state priority when there are state employees on food stamps and working two jobs. We found anecdotal evidence to suggest he could be right. But he did not produce evidence to back up his claim. Therefore, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/23/tyrone-brooks/brooks-lacks-data-back-food-stamp-claim/

Liz Cheney: Iran not meeting nuclear reporting obligations
","As President Barack Obama’s administration moves forward with negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal, many are questioning if Iran can be trusted to comply. Iran, the United States and five other international powers intend to establish a framework agreement by the end of March for a long-term deal that curbs Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But verifying information about Iran’s nuclear program is a challenge at present, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, conservative pundit Liz Cheney said on Fox News Sunday March 22. ""The IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations,"" said Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, referring to the question of verification. We weren’t able to get in touch with Cheney. But the IAEA pointed us to a February report regarding Iran’s implementation of the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty safeguards. The agency is in charge of inspecting Iran and other countries’ nuclear programs and answers to the United Nations. The IAEA found, in sum, that it could not affirm that Iran was fully complying with the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty because Iran did not provide enough information for the agency to clarify outstanding questions. ""The Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,"" the report said. In March 10 remarks to the IAEA Board of Governors, Director General Yukiya Amano elaborated on the report's findings. The IAEA is able to verify that while all of Iran’s declared nuclear material and activities are peaceful and in accordance with their safeguard agreements, they are not able to make the same assurances about undeclared material and activities. ""The Agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,"" the report said. Iran is expected to comply with the agency’s expectations because it is an IAEA member state, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.   Because Iran has in some cases stonewalled the IAEA -- preventing them from verifying whether Iran’s past and present nuclear programs are entirely peaceful -- the agency has felt for years that Iran has not ""lived up to its obligations,"" Albright said. Iran has dodged IAEA questions about past work on nuclear weapons for at least three years, according to the New York Times. Specific outstanding issues the IAEA has with Iran include questions about a missile initiator system and neutron calculations. Iran’s IAEA envoy told Iranian media that the agency’s claims were baseless, according to Reuters. In addition, Iran has simply never accepted some of the United Nations resolutions that required them to suspend uranium enrichment and other activities, meaning they haven’t lived up to some of their other obligations, said Matthew Bunn, professor and nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. A key distinction The IAEA’s February report is not related to the interim nuclear agreement (Joint Plan of Action) between the United States, Iran and the five other world powers reached in 2013. In December, PolitiFact found that the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. (Though Iran did take some actions that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement.) Additionally, PolitiFact found in November that the interim deal curtailed Iran’s ability to advance its nuclear program, for the first time in about a decade. The interim deal is fairly limited in scope and doesn’t as much address the problem of Iran not giving IAEA enough access to sites and information, Albright said. If the countries reach a nuclear deal in the coming weeks, it’s likely that it will involve Iran giving the IAEA unfettered access, he added. While Cheney’s statement is correct in terms of verifying information about undisclosed past activities, it ignores the context that Iran is complying with the latest agreement, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran and energy expert at the Brookings Institution. ""By avoiding the specific dimension of the IAEA criticism, Cheney’s statement is somewhat misleading,"" Maloney said. Bunn agreed that the statement might ""carry false implications"" because many who hear Cheney’s claim are likely to think she is referring to the interim deal. Our ruling Cheney said, ""The IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations."" The IAEA published a report a month ago that said Iran wasn’t giving the agency the level of access and information required to verify that all nuclear activity in Iran is peaceful -- a violation of their obligations as signatories of the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty. That is separate and distinct from the interim Joint Plan of Action deal between the United States and Iran. The IAEA has found Iran is keeping up with its obligations in that regard. Given the context of Cheney’s comments, people could assume she was talking about the Joint Plan of Action. Because that clarification is needed, we rate her statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/22/liz-cheney/liz-cheney-obama-iaea-iran-agreement/

Israeli ambassador tells U.S. audience Netanyahu didn't change position on two-state solution
","Sunday shows fixed their spotlight on newly re-elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose campaign-season remarks shutting down a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict inflamed tensions with the White House. Now Netanyahu and his delegates are saying the comments were misunderstood. The international uproar started when Netanyahu said a Palestinian state would not happen during his tenure if he won re-election to a fourth term, which widely sounded like a departure from his previously stated support for a two-state solution. After Netanyahu’s Likud Party won enough seats to maintain coalition control of the government, Netanyahu tried to temper his position in interviews with American journalists, but President Barack Obama said he is taking Netanyahu ""at his word"" when Netanyahu said a two-state solution ""wouldn’t happen during his prime ministership."" Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday to defend the Israeli leader. Host Chuck Todd asked, ""So the president is wrong that he takes the prime minister at his word at what he said before the election?"" ""He didn't say what the president and others seem to suggest that he's saying,"" Dermer said. ""And he was very clear about it in his interview with Andrea Mitchell. He didn't change his position. He didn't run around giving interviews saying he's now against the Palestinian state."" Dermer’s claim seems contrary to widespread analysis of Netanyahu’s record, so we wanted to find out if Netanyahu’s position had changed. What has Netanyahu said Netanyahu is on track to be the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s statehood, elected to a fourth term in office with last week’s close election. Netanyahu had already miffed the Obama administration by accepting an invitation from congressional Republicans to denounce a possible Iranian nuclear deal in a Washington address. The water between them turned even hotter after a video interview published the day before Israel's March 17 general election on NRG, a right-leaning Israeli news website. Netanyahu said in Hebrew, according to a New York Times translation: ""I think that anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state today and evacuate lands is giving attack grounds to the radical Islam against the state of Israel. This is the genuine reality that has been created here in the past few years. Those who do not understand that bury their heads in the sand. The left-wing parties do it, bury their heads in the sand, time and again."" The reporter asked, ""But if you are the prime minister, a Palestinian state will not arise?"" ""Indeed,"" Netanyahu said. He went on: ""An international initiative will be presented to us, to return to 1967 borders, to divide Jerusalem. Those are real things. It is going to happen. We need to form a strong, firm national government, headed by Likud (his party), to push those pressures away."" Reports from the New York Times, Washington Post and others cast these comments as a departure from his 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University, when Netanyahu endorsed a two-state solution -- with caveats -- to the conflict. Secretary of State John Kerry had been working on peace talks, of which the agreement of two states is the desired result, but those fell through last year. For supporters of a Palestinian state, Netanyahu’s present-day comments saying the two-state solution would not happen affirmed fears that he was never serious about pursuing that. But was it a true reversal? The backtracking Victory in hand, Netanyahu sought to clarify his comments about his support for a two-state solution in interviews with American media. On MSNBC, he told Andrea Mitchell, ""I haven’t changed my policy. I never retracted my speech at Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality. ""Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, refuses to recognize the Jewish state, has made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, and every territory that is vacated today in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces, so we want that to change so we can realize a vision of real, sustained peace,"" he said. His rhetoric had been consistent in the closing weeks of the election, as a Likud Party press release, according to the Post, quoted Netanyahu as saying ""there will be no withdrawals and no concessions"" because evacuated territory would fall to radical Iran-supported terror groups. A similar newsletter distributed by a Likud leader said Netanyahu had dismissed his Bar-Ilan speech as ""null and void,"" according to this New York Times timeline of Netanyahu’s position on this issue. But when the party followed up by saying the support voiced at Bar-Ilan was ""irrelevant,"" his office countered he had ""never stated such a thing."" Netanyahu doubled down that he did not change his position in an interview with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, who pointed out that the comments were awkward because presidents before Obama had also pressed for the two-state solution. Inskeep asked if it was still Netanyahu’s position to be against a Palestinian state. ""What I said was that under the present circumstances, today, it is unachievable,"" he said, citing the Palestinian Authority’s government with Hamas. ""I said that the conditions have to change."" Expert analysis What to make of Netanyahu’s words -- is he a flip-flopper or being taken out of context? Ultimately, it’s hard to know his true position. Jonathan Schanzer, Foundation for Defense of Democracies vice president for research and author of books on the conflict, offered several notes of context. First, and perhaps most importantly, Netanyahu’s support for the two-state solution has always been tepid, Schanzer said. In his first term that started in 1997, he opposed Palestinian statehood. The switch came at the university speech in 2009, and he reaffirmed in October 2014 his support for ""a vision of peace of two states for two peoples based on mutual recognition and rock solid security arrangements on the ground"" during a visit with Obama at the White House. For him to say now, unequivocally, that there would be no Palestinian state during his time in office may seem to indicate that he is against it on principle, Schanzer said, ""but he didn’t say there would never be a two-state solution."" To Schanzer, that is a fine distinction. Netanyahu always seemed reluctant to be part of the peace talks brokered by the United States, but he showed up anyway, Schanzer said. For him to acknowledge how poorly the talks have gone, and how unlikely they are to improve given the dwindling tenures of all leaders involved, ""is actually a moment of honesty,"" he said. Still, the potentially candid assessment had convenient timing, as Netanyahu spent his final days of campaigning trying to consolidate Israel’s right-wing voters, who have several political party options unlike the United States. It was also in the election’s final days when Netanyahu warned in a video that Arab-Israelis were voting ""in droves"" and could threaten conservative rule, which critics saw as steeped in race-mongering. ""The point is to say this was certainly done in the heat of the campaign,"" Schanzer said. ""But I also believe that this does not discount the idea of a two-state solution moving forward permanently."" Our ruling Dermer pushed back against widespread reports that Netanyahu changed his position on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the general elections. Dermer said, ""He didn't change his position. He didn't run around giving interviews saying he's now against the Palestinian state."" His position on this issue is much more complicated than Dermer lets on. Netanyahu has been all over the place. While he originally opposed Palestinian statehood, he has voiced support for a two-state peacemaking strategy as recently as October. Fast forward to this month: Netanyahu told a reporter for a right-leaning website that a Palestinian state wouldn’t happen under his watch. While he didn’t literally say he was ""against the Palestinian state,"" his comments certainly signalled he would not be working toward that anytime soon."" He has since clarified his position again, to say he supports the prospect of a Palestinian state, with caveats. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/22/ron-dermer/israeli-ambassador-tells-us-audience-netanyahu-did/

Sen. Donna Nesselbush: three quarters of processed foods have genetically modified organisms
","There’s a longstanding campaign to require special labels for foods made from genetically modified organisms -- plants or animals created by precisely manipulating their DNA, in ways  that don’t occur in nature. In Rhode Island, Sen. Donna Nesselbush, D-Pawtucket, has submitted legislation requiring such GMO labeling. ""Are [genetically modified foods] good for us or bad for us? The problem is that we really don’t know,"" she asserted in a commentary supporting her legislation. ""In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."" She made a similar comment in a news release, saying that most processed foods contain GMOs. There’s little solid evidence that foods made from genetically modified organisms pose a greater risk to consumers than their non-modified counterparts, a fact noted by major scientific organizations such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization. They have been on the shelves for nearly two decades. U.S. products have been approved for market by as many as three different federal agencies. Independent safety testing has been done in Europe. We were interested in whether these products have become as commonplace as Nesselbush says. But first, we note a distinction that will be important in evaluating part of Nesselbush’s claim. She references foods that contain genetically modified organisms, which sounds scary to many people. But in reality, GMO foods typically don’t contain organisms; they’re derived from organisms that have been genetically modified. For example, if you eat a genetically modified ear of corn, you’re eating the once-living cells of a genetically modified organism.  But if you eat a brownie baked with corn syrup extracted from genetically modified corn, you’re only eating the syrup, not the organism. When we asked Nesselbush for a source, she didn’t have an immediate answer, saying that the information came from her staff. She promised to check further. In the meantime, we did our own research. It appears that the number, although widely reported, is mostly an educated guess. We contacted the Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, which told PolitiFact National in 2007 that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual genetically modified organisms. When we asked where their numbers came from, spokeswoman Abigail Seiler said they came from the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade group opposed to labeling for products manufactured through genetic modification. The latest grocery association statement says, ""70-80 percent of the foods we eat in the United States, both at home and away from home, contain ingredients that have been genetically modified."" When we heard back from Nesselbush, she cited the same statement as her evidence. We noted that the percentage is on target but her characterization wasn’t. The grocery association says it’s 70 to 80 percent of ALL foods we consume. She said it applies to processed foods in a grocery store. The federal Food and Drug Administration defines processed foods as ""raw agricultural commodities"" that have been ""subject to canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration or milling.""  Processed foods also include any foods that are not raw agricultural commodities under the FDA’s legal definition. It turns out that there’s little consistency in how the estimate is used. For example, Whole Foods in 2010, citing the grocery association, said ""GMOs are now present in 75 to 80 percent of conventional processed food in the U.S."" (We’re not sure if there are ""unconventional"" processed foods.) And where does the grocery association get its figure? Spokesman Brian Kennedy said it was an estimate based on  data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We found updated numbers showing that in 2013, genetic engineering had been done on 90 percent of all cotton planted in the United States, 93 percent of all soybeans and 90 percent of all corn. Cottonseed and soybean oils are used in mayonnaise, salad dressings, cereals, breads and snack foods. Corn syrup is a widely used sweetener and corn starch is used in soups and sauces. ""Also, more than half of the sugar sold in the U.S. comes from sugar beets,"" Kennedy said. ""Sugar beets crops are 90 percent [genetically modified]."" We asked the association to detail how it settled on the 70 to 80 percentage. Kennedy repeated that it was an estimate. ""And it's important to keep in mind that these particular crops, though widely used, are not used in all processed food products. Plus you’re also overlooking all of the organic and non-GM processed food products on the market today,"" he said. John Ruff, past president of the Institute of Food Technologists, told us in an email that estimates of around 75 percent are widely quoted and are based on data from the late 1990s. ""I’m not aware of any definitive studies, perhaps because the presence of GMO derived ingredients often cannot be detected in the finished product,"" he said. ""This is because the GMO itself is not present in the product."" Nesselbush is incorrect when she says that such foods contain genetically modified organisms. Often they only contain substances created by genetically modified organisms, such as sugars, which may be identical to the sugars created by non-modified plants. Our ruling Donna Nesselbush said, ""In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."" Nesselbush quoted a percentage intended to apply to all foods and not restricted to processed foods. Although the figure is widely cited by both sides in the debate, it’s not clear that this is anything more than an estimate. And finally, in the cases of many processed foods created using the sugars, oils and other products of genetically modified organisms, the organisms themselves aren’t present in the food at all. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

Ted Cruz's world's on fire, but not for the last 17 years
","The world’s on fire, according to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- but it’s not because of global warming. On Late Night with Seth Meyers March 17, host Meyers brought up an incident that had happened several days earlier -- in which Cruz seemed to frighten a 3-year-old girl when he said ""Your world is on fire."" (He was talking about foreign policy.) ""At first I got excited because I thought maybe you were coming around on global warming, but that’s not the case,"" Meyers said. ""Because I think the world’s on fire -- literally."" Cruz responded, ""My view actually is simple. Debates on this should follow science and should follow data. Many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem because the science doesn’t back them up. In particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming. None whatsoever. It’s why -- you remember how it used to be called 'global warming' and then magically the theory changed to 'climate change'? The reason is it wasn’t warming, but the computer models still say it is, except the satellites show it’s not."" We’ve fact-checked statements like Cruz’s before -- that global warming has stopped over the past 17 years, and that’s reason to be skeptical of accepted science about global warming -- and found the claims lacking. (Here’s the head of a human-caused climate change skepticism organization, as well as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and environmentalist-turned-skeptic Patrick Moore.) Cruz does have a point: There hasn’t been any significant warming over the past 17 years. However, the scientific mainstream counters that it’s misleading for climate change skeptics to assume this flat trend line will continue indefinitely, or that it negates the long-term likelihood of global warming. Cherry picking NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index -- that is, how much the temperature deviates from the long-term average:  As the chart shows, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures accelerated their increase in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998 and have plateaued at similarly high levels ever since. Scientists say it’s worth noting that 1998 was an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. El Nino refers to an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally by releasing heat into the atmosphere. So global temperatures have not changed much since 1998, aside from minor fluctuations. The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since that peak in 1998, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By starting his 17-year count with 1998 -- an abnormally hot year because of the El Nino -- Cruz exaggerated the nature of the pause. ""Looking at the last 17 years is cherry picking,"" said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-affiliated organization that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has specifically addressed claims about the period since 1998. The panel argues that short-term trends are likely a result of natural climate variability and are not representative of the long-term climate outlook. The panel attributes the recent temperature plateau to changes in volcanic and solar activity. Data always fluctuates somewhat, scientists say. ""The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise,"" but superimposed on this general trend are ""periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, told PolitiFact for a previous fact-check. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, ""the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming."" And many scientists fully expect warming to pick up again, though there is less agreement on exactly when that will start. The United Kingdom’s weather office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Climate scientists are still trying to understand the pause, said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University. However, he said he would be willing to make a bet with Cruz that ""globally, the next 10 years will be warmer than any previous 10-year period since recordkeeping began."" Cruz’s response Cruz Spokesman Phil Novack said the senator was not intending to cast doubt on climate change science. He said Cruz recently voted to affirm that climate change is real (though the statement voted on did not attribute those changes to human activity, a key point for climate-change activists who say changes to human activity will be required to keep the environmental impact from worsening). Rather, Novack said, Cruz was trying to emphasize the fact that ""the computer models that climate scientists rely on predicted the Earth should be significantly warmer than it is now"" based on satellite measurements. What Cruz is casting doubt on is the idea that we should make major policy decisions affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in the name of theoretical conclusions that in fact cannot currently be drawn from science or data,"" he added. For support, Novack pointed to a blog by physicist Carl Mears, vice president of satellite data company Remote Sensing Systems. In the blog, Mears noted that the company’s satellite-collected data shows that there has been little warming in the past 17 years, and that the observed temperatures were less than what had been predicted by many computer simulations. However, Mears also cautioned that the discrepancy between the model and observation should not be reason to doubt the climate’s sensitivity to human-caused activity. Many factors other than scientific modeling errors, he said, could explain the discrepancy between the models and the observations -- including satellite measurement errors, factors external to the climate (such as volcanic activity), or random climate fluctuations. Jackson of Stanford added that while computer prediction models aren’t always perfect, there are other ways to confirm scientists’ general predictions about the rate of global warming and future climate change. For example, even though the global temperature has stayed relatively stagnant since 1998, this winter saw a record-low of Arctic sea ice, and ocean temperatures are rising rapidly. The fact that the past 17 years since 1998 have been so warm even without a strong El Nino of the sort that occurred in 1998 might in itself be an indication of an overall warming trend and climate change, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Reilly also cautioned that models are reasonably good at measuring long-term trends, but their ability to predict specific years or decades (such as Cruz’s 17-year time period) is ""limited."" ""The models are unable to capture some of the exact aspects of how the heat accumulation is being allocated between atmosphere and ocean,"" Reilly said. ""But the fundamental idea that greenhouse gases cause the earth to warm is not undermined."" ""A temporary slowdown does not negate 200 years of climate research,"" Jackson added. Our ruling Cruz said, ""Satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there's been zero warming."" Cruz does have a point: There’s been little global temperature change since 1998, and the temperatures measured are lower than what many computer models had predicted. However, focusing on that period essentially means cherry-picking a timeframe that starts at an extremely warm year and ignores that the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been stable -- has been the warmest on record. While scientists don’t deny that there’s been a recent ""pause"" in warming, they expect it to be a temporary trend. Not only is one anomalous period not enough to undercut longer-term projections, but other types of measurements do show evidence of continued global warming over the past two decades, including rising ocean temperatures and shrinking sea ice. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-worlds-fire-not-last-17-years/

Glenn Beck says Barack Obama took Iran, Hamas off U.S. terror list
","The confluence of elections in Israel and the possible culmination of international talks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities has vaulted United States policy on Iran to the top of the national agenda. A reader emailed us to note that on March 19, 2015, Glenn Beck -- a multiplatform commentator on the right -- took to Facebook to criticize President Barack Obama’s handling of policy with Iran. Here’s the beginning of the lengthy Facebook post: ""This is just Evil,"" Beck wrote, ""A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list. He is negotiating with Iran WHILE their supreme leader said that they ‘will fly the Islamic flag of jihad over the White House.’ … Christians are being liquidated, beheaded and crucified, their children being sold into slavery, his big bombing plan to stop Isis is SEVEN bombing runs a day. 7!!! How many did we run in Bosnia: 165?!!!"" Beck makes a number of claims in this short snippet, but the one that jumped out at us was that ""a few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list."" By diplomatic standards, that would be a pretty big deal, especially if it was a unilateral move before a major nuclear deal was even completed. And we certainly hadn’t seen any media coverage about this happening. Did Obama really take Hamas and Iran off the terror list? The short answer is no. Here’s the long answer. The State Department lists The most signifcant ""terror lists"" are the ones maintained by the State Department. One is for ""state sponsors of terrorism."" This includes countries ""determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,"" and inclusion on the list establishes restrictions on foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and a variety of financial and other restrictions. Currently, four nations are on the list: Cuba, Sudan, Syria … and Iran, which has been on the list since Jan. 19, 1984, when Ronald Reagan was president. Nothing with this status has changed in the last few weeks. The second State Department list includes ""foreign terrorist organizations."" Under United States law, it is unlawful to knowingly provide ""material support or resources"" to a group on the list. Other restrictions on financing and immigration come into play as well. Hamas -- a militant Islamic movement based in the Palestinian territories -- is on this list, and has been since Oct. 8, 1997, when Bill Clinton was president. Like Iran, it has not been taken off the relevant terror list. So what is Beck talking about? The Clapper report We failed to reach Beck through a representative of his radio network, but judging by previous posts in the conservative blogosphere, we believe he was referring to the 2015 report by the director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Clapper presented the annual report -- ""Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community"" -- to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 26. The report is divided into two parts ""global threats"" and ""regional threats."" The global section include such topics as cyber threats, counterintelligence, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, space, organized crime, global economics and natural resources. The regional section covers most parts of the world, including the Middle East and north Africa. Most of the recent discussion of the Clapper report on the Internet stemmed from a Hebrew-language analysis by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli think tank considered close to the country’s military and intelligence sectors. The center’s analysis received coverage in the Israeli media and then quickly spread to the United States. The center’s analysis noted that the ""terrorism"" section in the 2014 report mentioned both Iran and Hezbollah, but the 2015 section did not. Before we go any further, we’ll note that Beck wrote ""Hamas"" in his Facebook post when he presumably meant ""Hezbollah,"" a predominantly Lebanese Shiite Muslim party and militant group that is backed by Iran and that has been on the State Department terrorism list since 1997. While Hamas was not mentioned in either of the past two Clapper reports, Hezbollah was mentioned in the terrorism section of the 2014 report but not in the terrorism section in the 2015 report. The conservative blog posts that preceded Beck's post correctly cited ""Hezbollah,"" so we’ll chalk this up to carelessness. Now let’s take a closer look at what changed between the two reports. The strongest evidence for Beck is the disappearance of the following language, which had been included in the terrorism section of the 2014 report: ""Iran and Hizbullah are committed to defending the Asad regime and have provided support toward this end, including sending billions of dollars in military and economic aid, training pro-regime and Iraqi Shia militants, and deploying their own personnel into the country. Iran and Hizbullah view the Asad regime as a key partner in the ‘axis of resistance’ against Israel and are prepared to take major risks to preserve the regime as well as their critical trans-shipment routes. Outside the Syrian theater, Iran and Lebanese Hizbullah continue to directly threaten the interests of U.S. allies. Hizbullah has increased its global terrorist activity in recent years to a level that we have not seen since the 1990s."" The  2015 report only mentions Hezbollah once, and it’s in passing. Still, we should note that the 2015 report hardly lets Iran off the hook. The report accuses Iran of: • ""Preserving (the) nuclear weapons option,"" • Remaining ""an ongoing threat to US national interests because of its support to the Asad regime in Syria, promulgation of anti-Israeli policies, development of advanced military capabilities, and pursuit of its nuclear program,"" • ""Pursuing policies with negative secondary consequences for regional stability and potentially for Iran,"" • And pursuing actions to protect and empower Shia communities that ""are fueling growing fears and sectarian responses."" Administration officials cautioned against over-reading the choices made in Clapper’s written report. ""There is no change in the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment of the threat posed by Iran or Hezbollah,"" said Brian P. Hale, the director of public affairs in the office of the director of national intelligence. The report, Hale said, ""was written to be an overview of top threats. … There were a lot of topics to consider this year -- ISIL, cyber, Ukraine-Russia, etc. Iran was included, too."" Hale added that Clapper fleshed out the national-security concerns about Iran and Hezbollah during testimony at the Senate hearing. Responding to a question from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Clapper cited several entities linked to Iran, including Hezbollah, as methods for Iran to use as ""a physical manifestation of their spreading their influence in the region."" And Nick Rasmussen -- director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the principal adviser to Clapper’s office on intelligence operations and counterterrorism analysis -- testified on Feb. 12 that ""beyond their role in Syria and Iraq, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah remain committed to conducting terrorist activities worldwide, and we are concerned their activities could either endanger or target U.S. and other Western interests."" Reading between the lines We see two questions here. First, is it valid for him to call the Clapper report ""the terror list""? And second, are the changes in the 2015 report -- the basis for his otherwise inaccurately worded claim -- noteworthy? On the first question, experts agreed that the phrase ""terror list"" is typically reserved for the one with the legal bite -- the State Department’s. Beck has ""no justification for calling it 'the terror list,' "" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. On the second question, Beck may have a point, said Rick Brennan, a senior political scientist with RAND Corp. ""The entire tenor of the 2015 report on terrorism focuses on Sunni terrorist organizations, and there is no mention of Shia terrorist organizations,"" Brennan said. ""The reality is that that Islamist terrorism has both a Sunni and Shia variant. Focusing on one part of the problem and excluding the other is not analytically accurate."" Brennan added that he doesn’t see any sign that Iran has ""changed its behavior in exporting violence throughout the region"" between 2014 and 2015, which raises the question of why the report ""significantly softened the tone and tenor of the assessment"" of Iran and Hezbollah. However, Beck buried this more justifiable point under several errors and hyperbole. Our ruling Beck said, ""A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list."" Beck made a few clear mistakes here. First, it appears he mistook Hamas for Hezbollah. Second, Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah remain on the official, and legally binding, State Department terror lists, as they have for decades. Obama did nothing to change that ""a few weeks ago."" Beck's claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/20/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-barack-obama-took-iran-hamas-us-te/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Did Scott Walker flip-flop on how budget shortfalls are measured??
","It’s a favorite talking point of Gov. Scott Walker, one he’s taking national as he charges up a potential presidential campaign: He inherited a $3.6 billion budget shortfall from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but dug out of it by cutting costs and limiting union bargaining power with state and local government. Walker even dropped the figure into his well-received January 2015  speech at an Iowa cattle call for 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls. So our eyebrows went up Feb. 6, 2015 when Walker was questioned about his stewardship of the state budget by Fox News anchor Bret Baier in a profile on the rising presidential hopes of the Wisconsin governor. During the interview, Baier said: ""You talk about $2 billion in (tax) savings for individuals and businesses, but you also have a $2.2 billion budget shortfall in the coming two years."" Walker immediately questioned the credibility of the $2.2 billion number and portrayed it as a media creation. ""I would contend that’s based on numbers from some of the Wisconsin media outlets as if everybody who asked for anything got it,"" Walker said. ""Even in your own household budget that never happens."" Has Walker changed his view on the validity of these shortfall estimates now that he’s in the governor’s chair? This is another one for the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. Let’s go back to November 2010, shortly after his election to replace Doyle. Walker pounced on the numbers from a statutorily required report by the state Department of Administration that showed -- in combination with other debts -- Walker would inherit a $3.6 billion shortfall six months after taking office in January 2011. Time and again …. and again … Walker used that number to portray the state as broke, and to explain the cuts he proposed -- and which were ultimately made -- in public education funding and other programs. We, and other media outlets, examined the figure then and declared it credible, as far as it goes. As we’ve explained, it’s not a ""deficit"" number as Walker and others in Madison often call it. It’s a pre-budget estimate designed to illustrate the size of the shortfall or challenge the governor faces when putting together a budget. The shortfall figure includes all the requests from state departments, and also predictions of how much tax revenue the state will collect. Fast forward to the Fox interview. Walker said the report of a $2.2 billion shortfall heading into his budget was a media creation. But the fact is, it came from a report from his own budget shop in his Department of Administration. What’s more, tax cuts pushed by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature play into some of the challenge that faced budget-makers, as projected revenues have fallen short. But by far the biggest chunk of the $2.2 billion projection is -- as Walker alluded to on Fox -- the spending increases sought by state agencies. But that’s always been the case. That’s the purpose of the report -- to see how tax revenue projections are looking compared to what state agencies say they want and need. Nothing’s changed about the methodology behind the shortfall projections. The only thing that’s changed is Walker’s tune. He still talks up the 2010 figures as if describing a budget-balancing miracle, but now dismisses their 2014 version as a big nothing. This merits a Full Flop. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.",/factchecks/2015/feb/13/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall/

Maggie Hassan says NH had highest median income in U.S. in 2013
","For all its troubles, New Hampshire is actually pretty lucky — or so report, after report, after report, would say. Just ask Gov. Maggie Hassan. In her second inaugural speech in January and in her budget address Thursday, Feb. 12, Hassan, a Democrat, made a point of drawing attention to New Hampshire’s rosy reputation. ""Our country’s economy continues to strengthen – and in many respects, New Hampshire remains ahead of the curve,"" Hassan said, ticking off a number of economic statistics. One was that ""our median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation,."" In both speeches, Hassan pointed out that statistics don’t always tell the whole story, saying that some working class families in the state continue to struggle. Still, was New Hampshire really at the top of the nation in 2013 in terms of household income? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check it out. The statistic Hassan cited came from data collected and compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, her staff pointed to a set of data released in September 2014 that summed up the latest findings from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. While the census conducts a population count every 10 years, it also compiles other types of data — on income, for example — through other surveys that occur more frequently. In this case, the data was collected over a period of three months in 2013 — February, March and April. According to the census data, New Hampshire’s median household income was $71,322 in 2013 — which was not only higher than the national median, but also higher than any other state. As with any survey, there are some limitations to consider. One factor concerns how the data was calculated. To determine income, the census asks people to report the money they received during the previous year from multiple sources, including: earnings, unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, public assistance and more. The census also notes that ""money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits,"" such as food stamps. As noted by Drew Desilver for Pew Research Center, ""some economists say that income data have too many flaws to be the primary measure of inequality."" ""For one thing,"" Desilver said, ""most income-inequality measures use income before taxes and transfer payments (such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment benefits), which act to reduce inequality."" Some researchers, Desilver notes, have instead suggested that other measures — someone’s consumption, for example — would be a better way to measure someone’s ""economic well-being."" Another factor to consider is the timing of the data. Using other census data that looks beyond just 2013, the year Hassan cited, shows that New Hampshire loses its top spot to Virginia when 2012 and 2014 information is considered. Our ruling Gov. Maggie Hassan said New Hampshire’s ""median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation."" Looking at U.S. Census data only for that year, Hassan is correct. For other recent periods, however, New Hampshire ranks just below the top. In the meantime, census data is widely trusted, but other calculation methods may have produced different results. However, Hassan was correct in qualifying that statement by suggesting that the survey might not tell the whole story. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/13/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-nh-had-highest-median-income-us/

Alabama Chief Justice: Opposition to gay marriage in Alabama hasn't changed since 2006 state ban
","CNN’s Chris Cuomo challenged Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore to defend a decision that will allow local courts to ignore a federal judge’s ruling striking down the state’s anti-gay marriage law. ""Times have changed as they did with slavery,"" Cuomo said Feb. 12 on New Day. ""The population no longer feels the same way. And even in your state, people no longer feel the same way."" Moore held firm that marriage was defined as between a man and a woman, and said, ""81 percent as recently as 2006 said it was the definition. They haven’t changed their opinion."" Support for gay marriage has increased nationwide significantly in just the last decade. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2006, 55 percent of Americans opposed gay marriage. By 2014, 52 percent supported marriage rights for same-sex couples, and opposition was down to 40 percent. But has there been no movement on the issue in Alabama, as Moore claimed? We decided to take a look. In June 2006, voters in Alabama overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment barring authorities from issuing marriage licenses to ""parties of the same sex."" The referendum passed with 81 percent of the vote. Moore’s office confirmed that was the number he was alluding to. What has happened since then? Being a solidly red state, and a rural one at that, Alabama is not surveyed as often as some other states. But here’s what we found from the polls that do exist. In 2012, a poll of likely voters by the Capital Survey Research Center — an arm of the Alabama Education Association and one of the most consistent pollsters in the state until it recently closed — found 71 percent opposed same-sex marriage. Likely voters would be those most expected to show up for an off-year primary election, as was the case when the referendum passed in 2006. So by that measure, while gay marriage remains deeply unpopular in the state, there was a 10 percentage point decrease in opposition. That drop in Alabama is largely in line with the slope of the decline in opposition at the national level. During the same time frame, nationwide opposition to gay marriage fell to 46 percent in 2012 from 55 percent in 2006, according to Pew. It’s not a perfect comparison to look at the 2006 Alabama referendum, which asked people to vote on a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and a 2012 survey that queried voters on whether they support gay marriage. For example, some people might have opposed gay marriage but didn’t think a constitutional amendment was necessary. But it’s a measurable change in sentiment on the overall topic that is backed up by other research. In 2005, 87 percent of registered voters told the Capital Survey Research Center that they supported the position of, ""Allowing only traditional marriage between a man and a woman."" But an Alabama television station found in 2015 that 70 percent of registered voters oppose gay marriage. Finally, the Williams Institute at UCLA estimated marriage opinions for every state in 2004 and 2012 based on each state’s demographics in those years. How was this accomplished? They took the demographic make-up (age, religion, race, etc.) of each state and compared it against national survey data that broke down sentiments about marriage by those demographics. Researchers took this approach because lack of polling data in many states made it difficult to spot trends. What they found was support for gay marriage in Alabama grew from 16 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2012. Alabama’s increase of 16 percentage points was actually larger than the national average (13.5 percentage point increase), though the starting point there was much, much lower than most states. And that’s an important point to note: Alabama was among the states with the lowest support for gay marriage in 2004 and it remains among the lowest today. By the Williams Institute’s estimate, only Arkansas and Louisiana have a fewer percentage of citizens supportive of gay marriage (31 percent). That result is echoed by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that Alabama and Mississippi in 2014 had the lowest support for same-sex marriage among their populations at 32 percent. Our ruling Moore said since voters passed a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage in 2006, Alabamians ""haven’t changed their opinion."" An overwhelming number of people still oppose same-sex marriage in Alabama, and it remains one of the least-supportive states of gay marriage, according to the information available. But polling data suggests measurable movement on this issue. In 2006, 81 percent of voters supported the referendum to prohibit gay marriage in Alabama. Recent polls show about 71 percent of likely voters oppose same-sex marriage today. That’s in line with other data that show growing support for same-sex marriage in the last decade there, and is similar to the rate of decline in opposition nationally. The statement contains partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/13/roy-moore/alabama-chief-justice-roy-moore-81-percent-alabami/
"['Climate Change', 'PunditFact', 'Dana Perino']","
Fox News host: Climate scientists 'fabricated' temperature data
","The U.S. Senate may have voted 98-1 that ""climate change is real and not a hoax,"" but the accusation that government scientists have cooked the books and invented a warming trend is as robust as ever. Fox News host Dana Perino joined several of her colleagues this week in casting doubt on the data scientists use to track temperature changes over time. Perino’s comments came on Feb. 9, 2015, as she and her co-hosts on The Five somewhat sarcastically discussed how the fight against Islamic State or ISIS drew attention away from other issues, such as climate change. ""They're (the White House) actually kind of lucky that we don't cover climate change as much as we should,"" Perino said. ""Because yesterday, it was reported that the temperature readings have been fabricated and it's all blowing up in their faces."" Co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle interjected that it was ""fraud science"" and Perino said, ""Yes, I agree."" We have checked this sort of claim before and found it wrong, but some time has passed, and Perino referenced new reporting. So we wanted to fact-check her claim that temperature readings ""have been fabricated."" We reached out to Perino to find the source of her statement and did not hear back. However, a couple of days before she spoke, the British paper The Telegraph carried an opinion piece entitled, ""The fiddling with temperature data is the biggest science scandal ever."" The article drew on the work of a well-known climate change skeptic, Paul Homewood, who on Feb. 4, 2015, blogged about alterations in the temperature records in Paraguay and some arctic locations. The Telegraph article concluded that these changes were part of the ""greatest and most costly scare the world has known."" But when we reached Homewood, he offered a more nuanced summary of his findings. ""I make no claims about the effect of (temperature) adjustments globally,"" Homewood said. ""I feel that by identifying specific examples, we have moved the debate forward by challenging how adjustments work in practice, and whether we can always rely on them."" Homewood’s concerns center on something most of us don’t think about too often: the massive data files used by climate scientists worldwide to track changes globally and in different regions of the earth. Raw data vs. adjusted data Every month, readings from thousands of land-based weather stations around the world are shared through the Global Historical Climatology Network. To measure ocean temperatures, there is a flow of data from buoys and ships. Climate trends play out over long periods of time, and the challenge has been to deal with changes in the way temperature is measured that have nothing to do with the weather itself. For instance, local officials might move a station from a valley to a nearby hilltop. They might change the time of day when they record their measurements from sunrise to sunset. They might change the kind of thermometer they use. In the ocean, the practice once was to haul up a bucket of water. Later, the standard practice was to measure the temperature from the engine’s intake valve. Researchers at the National Climatic Data Center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have to then come up with a way to work with the temperature readings so they can make apples-to-apples comparisons. What they do is take the raw temperature readings and apply a boatload of statistical techniques to pick out the most reliable data. Where necessary, they adjust the readings to account for the human factors that would skew the data regardless of what happened with actual temperatures. The controversy voiced by Homewood and others is that they don’t accept those adjustments. NOAA says the adjustments -- as was the case in Paraguay -- are necessary to make valid comparisons. ""Such changes in observing systems cause false shifts in temperature readings. Paraguay is one example of where these false shifts artificially lower the true station temperature trend,"" the agency said. Homewood is right that the Paraguay adjustments raised the temperature reported for that station. But what Homewood leaves out, NOAA says, is that nearly half the time the adjustments made by researchers lower the temperature below what was actually recorded. No change in the big picture Perino said that researchers’ theories of climate change were ""blowing up in their faces."" That is not the view of the researchers we reached. Judith Curry is chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Curry believes the issues with the adjusted data are ""greater than have been portrayed."" On the other hand, she told PunditFact that the concerns in the Telegraph op-ed were ""overblown"" and that the basic conclusion remains the same. ""The adjustments aren't of such a magnitude that they throw into question the overall increase in global temperature for the past 100-plus years,"" Curry said. An independent group of researchers called Berkeley Earth have the sole goal of working with the raw data and analyzing it for themselves. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with the group. Hausfather told PunditFact that the warning flag raised by The Telegraph article and bloggers amounts to cherry-picking the data. That’s because while some adjustments might make it seem like scientists are artificially raising temperatures, some adjustments at other stations actually would lead you to the opposite conclusion. ""(They) look through all those thousands of stations, find a few that show big adjustments, and tell everyone that they are evidence of fraud,"" Hausfather said. ""You will rarely see them pick out stations like Reno, Paris, London, Tokyo, or many others where the adjustments dramatically lower the warming trend."" Hausfather and his colleagues traced how the adjustment methods changed the temperature data differently around the world since 1850. In the graph below, zero is the baseline. Above zero, temperatures have been adjusted upward, below it temperatures have been adjusted downward.   In the United States, with about 5 percent of Earth’s land area, the official data file raised temperatures compared to the original readings. But the same methods lowered the data records in Africa, and for all land-based readings taken together, the adjustments basically made no change at all (the black line). With ocean temperature trends, the efforts to compensate for the human factor lower the numbers dramatically. ""The net effect of adjustments is to actually reduce the amount of global warming we've observed since 1880 by about 20 percent,"" Hausfather said. ""Folks skeptical of temperature adjustments are welcome not to use them if they'd like, but you end up with more global warming, not less."" Mark Serreze is professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Serreze said over the years, many people have vetted the statistical methods that lead to the adjusted data files. ""The features of the global temperature records have been verified by comparisons between analyses from different centers and sensitivities to different ways of treating the data,"" Serreze said. ""The peer reviewed literature is extensive. This is why there is consensus that the data are correct."" For the record, the author of the The Telegraph opinion piece made the same point about eight months ago. Back then, it inspired a similar flurry of claims that government scientists intentionally engaged in fraud. Our ruling Perino said that disclosures of fabricated temperature readings have upended theories of climate change. The source we believe she relied on, The Telegraph opinion piece, in turn relied on the work of a climate change skeptic and blogger. He told us that he was not challenging the overall trends of global warming, but instead wanted to draw attention to anomalies in the data. The researchers we contacted, who have no ties to the government agencies that produce the data Perino questioned, said that while the raw temperature readings are adjusted, the result is a record that more closely matches what has actually taken place. The greater mistake would be to take the raw data as somehow perfect and unblemished. The allegations raised by skeptics like the author of The Telegraph item have had no effect on the consensus that the Earth has seen an increase in temperatures over the past 100 years. This claim has been debunked before. To continue to repeat it moves it into the realm of the ridiculous.

Rush Limbaugh says it's ""rarer and rarer"" that married couples share the same last name
","On Feb. 2, 2015, Rush Limbaugh was giving some love to the presidential prospects of Scott Walker, declaring on his nationally syndicated radio show that Wisconsin's Republican governor had ""drawn the blueprints for beating the left."" Then, changing topics, the conservative commentator made a remark about -- if not love, at least marriage -- that caught our ear. And here we are bumping up against Valentine's Day. Limbaugh mentioned a pair of Washington, D.C. political consultants: Mercedes Viana Schlapp and her husband, Matthew Schlapp. Both served in President George W. Bush's administration. ""A married couple that go by the same name, which is rarer and rarer in our country,"" Limbaugh said parenthetically. Is it? Research overview  Limbaugh didn't refer to any time frame. And his spokeswoman did not provide us any information to back his claim. But we did find some limited data on the topic -- though not much of it national. In a nutshell: Very few married women kept their own surnames during the 1970s. The percentage rose in the '80s and in the '90s, but leveled off by the early 2000s. Research in detail Let's start by noting that, as best we know, the vast majority of American-born married women in the United States take their husband's last name. A 2007 U.S. Census Bureau research paper, based on the bureau's American Community Survey in 2004, found that only 6 percent of married women who were born in the U.S. had surnames that were ""non-conventional."" That includes hyphenated surnames, two surnames and women who kept their own surname at marriage. In other words, some 94 percent took their husband's last name after saying ""I do."" So, that's a solid, if dated, national snapshot. Unfortunately, the paper did not state whether the 6 percent was higher or lower than in previous years. And the census researcher who co-authored the paper told us she is not aware of any similar research done more recently. As for looking at changes over time, there are two major research efforts -- although, unlike the census paper, neither was national in scope. A 2004 study by a Harvard economics professor was based on New York Times wedding announcements, Harvard alumni records and Massachusetts birth records; it focused on college graduates. The percentage of women keeping their names after marriage was 2 to 4 percent around 1975 and just below 20 percent in 2001. Similar results were found in a 2009 study led by researchers from City University of New York and Ramapo College of New Jersey. That work was based on a sampling of wedding announcements in the New York Times from 1971 through 2005. The percentages of brides keeping their own name rose from 1 percent in the 1970s to 9 percent in the 1980s and to 23 percent  in the 1990s. The rate leveled off at 18 percent in the 2000s. So, both major studies -- though limited geographically and in other ways -- found that in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing percentage of married women kept their surnames. But by the early 2000s, that percentage leveled off. Time to wrap a bow around this one. Our rating Without stating a timeframe, Limbaugh said a ""married couple that"" use the same last name ""is rarer and rarer in our country."" There is some evidence to back his claim. Two academic studies, though limited in scope, found that compared to the 1970s, the percentage of married women who kept their own names rose in the 1980s and the '90s. But it leveled off in the early 2000s. But as best we can tell, married couples who share the same last name is not rare at all. The latest U.S. census figures on the topic show that as of 2004, some 94 percent of married, American-born women in the U.S. were using their husband's last name. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

DeKalb jobs claim needs some refining
","With economic indicators ticking up in Georgia and headlines of new jobs coming to metro Atlanta, the state’s third-largest county is touting its successes. DeKalb County has ""attracted and retained more than 2,300 jobs"" in the last year, interim CEO Lee May told business and community leaders during his State of the County address last month. May went on to describe his efforts to improve the county’s image to attract businesses and support job growth. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered, could the county often in the news for corruption allegations and political gridlock also be responsible for growing jobs? We decided to check. May directed us to DeKalb Workforce Development, the local agency that provides ""one-stop"" education, training and employment programs under the federal Workforce Investment Act. The agency keeps track of jobs in several categories, said Workforce Director Sheryl Stone.  They are: Geographic Solutions: A statewide database that counts only full-time employees hired or retained through federal Department of Labor funds. In 2014, DeKalb saw 731 new hires in this category and 602 people who retained new jobs for at least a year. Total: 1,333. Capital Improvement Plan (CIP):  A count of workers hired or retained, either part-time or full-time, as part of DeKalb’s $1.35 billion overhaul of its water/sewer system. Last year, 107 people were hired and 386 saw jobs retained as part of working for contractors on the program. Total: 493. Taleo: Employers who work on the county level to recruit for part-time and full-time jobs use DeKalb’s Taleo system to filter resumes. Some workers will transfer to the state Geographic Solutions system once they have completed probationary periods for full-time work. The county does not break out the number of jobs based on full-time or part-time in this category, but all are unsubsidized with government dollars. Total: 348. Job training: Workforce uses federal dollars to subsidize up to half of a new hire’s salary for 90 days. The employer recruits through the agency and must hire the employee at full time with benefits. The subsidy is designed to serve as a training cost. Total: 167. Stone said the agency determined that, over a 10-year period, the average salary for workers it helped find employment was $56,000. ""We really are making a difference,"" she said. And, adding up the categories, Workforce counts 2,341 people working for the year. That would fully support May’s claim, except for hiccups with the counts themselves. The local Taleo category, for instance, counts part-time jobs as equal to those with full-time hours (which the county considers after only 32 hours). Job seekers are apt to view even 32 hours per week to be part-time, suggesting that category is inflated, according to experts. The bigger question is how Workforce is counting workers in the water/sewer overhaul. Stone said the agency counts workers as reported by the contractors selected for different projects. Some of those people may work only a few days or months on a specific task, Stone said, but they are included in the total headcount reported. The agency’s lead over the CIP said each worker is only counted once, though they may work on several tasks in a specific project. And, if someone is hired or keeps a job for three months, that person then counts as a full-time equivalent worker, though the agency does not have a breakdown of how many would fall into that category. That’s problematic, because the definitions can affect the counts, said Tom Smith, a finance professor at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University. For instance, a pizzeria can claim to have sold a pizza for every 8 slices it sells. But those slices may not come from the same whole pizza – meaning the count doesn’t adjust for what would have been thrown away from one whole pizza that had been divvied up. ""You run into problems when you try to count things the same but in different ways,"" Smith said. ""Four thousand people who work a quarter of the year is not really the same thing as 1,000 jobs."" Barbara Neuby, a professor of political science at Kennesaw State University, said the massaged definitions also direct focus away from statistics that may not be as positive. For instance, state Department of Labor figures show that the number of new unemployment claims in DeKalb were down about 12 percent between December 2013 and December 2014. But the claims are up 44 percent between November and December last year, the last figures available. ""If they wanted to be truly accountable and transparent, they could say they created work in the private sector by issuing contracts,"" said Neuby, who specializes in government budgets and finance. ""But to say these are jobs created, no. We don’t have exact numbers to make that claim."" May said the county plans to do a better job of counting positions in that category going forward. But, he notes that the work is creating jobs – something that the experts agree on in principle. ""We spent $62 million on the CIP last year, and that translates into people who are working,"" May said. ""We didn’t define that and we will drill down to be more probing about what kinds of jobs. To us, a job is a job if you’re working, it counts.""   To that end, May is correct. The state Labor Department defines a job simply as a task that is performed. The number of people employed to do that task can be less than full time, or more. So, was May on target when he said DeKalb had created or kept more than 2,300 jobs last year? By the state’s broad definitions, the county’s Workforce Development office backs him up on the number of people working. That’s not the same thing as the number of jobs. The distinction boils down to that difference. Looking at the categories, the bulk of the people being counted - those on the state level, in job training and some hired on the local level - are likely to be the same as the number of jobs. But for some people working part-time on the local level, or in the CIP, the distinction could boost or underestimate the actual number of jobs. Without more data, which the county does not collect, we don’t know what is happening. Overall, that means the statement is mostly right, except for problems the county acknowledges in its counts. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/13/lee-may/dekalb-jobs-claim-needs-some-refining/

Obama calls terrorist attacks random, Rick Perry says he denies anti-Semitic motivation
","President Barack Obama took heat this week for seeming to imply that a recent attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris was ""random"" -- rather than anti-Semitic. Obama made his ire-arousing comment in a Feb. 9 interview with Vox’s Matthew Yglesias. Yglesias asked if Obama thought the media tended to overstate  the threat of Islamic terrorism, compared with issues like climate change. As part of his response, Obama said this: ""It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you've got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris. We devote enormous resources to that, and it is right and appropriate for us to be vigilant and aggressive in trying to deal with that — the same way a big city mayor's got to cut the crime rate down if he wants that city to thrive. But we also have to attend to a lot of other issues, and we've got to make sure we're right-sizing our approach so that what we do isn't counterproductive."" That was his only mention of the Paris attack in the interview, but it caught the eye of his critics. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential 2016 Republican contender, said the comments meant Obama was denying that the attacks were anti-Semitic. ""I am appalled that President Obama has chosen to deny the vicious anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris on Jan. 9,"" Perry said in a statement. ""What he called a ‘random’ attack was obviously meant to kill Jews -- which is precisely what happened. The individual victims may have been those unlucky enough to be in the grocery that day, but it was far from random."" But has Obama really denied that this attack was anti-Semitic? When we looked at the other things he’s said about the attacks, we found that’s not the case. The attacks and their aftermath On Jan. 7, two brothers carried out a terrorist attack on the Paris offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper, killing 12. A branch of al-Qaida in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack. Two days later, 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly -- who had declared allegiance to the Islamic State -- held several patrons hostage in HyperCacher, a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris. Coulibaly said he would kill his hostages unless police released the the Charlie Hebdo attackers. French special forces moved in, killed Coulibaly and found that he had killed four hostages. Coulibaly said he coordinated with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, according to Reuters, and he specifically targeted Jews. All four victims were Jewish and were buried in Israel. Despite describing the attack as ""random"" in the Vox interview, Obama has made other statements that show that he is aware Coulibaly targeted Jews. In a Jan. 22 statement to the United Nations General Assembly, regarding anti-Semitism, Obama said, ""Anti-Semitic attacks like the recent terrorist attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris pose a threat that extends beyond the Jewish community."" And on Jan. 27 -- International Holocaust Remembrance Day -- Obama said, ""The recent terrorist attacks in Paris serve as a painful reminder of our obligation to condemn and combat rising anti-Semitism in all its forms."" The day after the Vox interview appeared, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama meant that Coulibaly did not target specific individuals by name, so that the victims were people who just happened to be in the store that day. In that sense, the attack was random. ""The point that the president was trying to make is that these individuals were not specifically targeted. These were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli and were shot while they were there,"" Earnest said. Earnest also noted that not everyone in the deli was Jewish. This is true. At the very least, a Muslim man helped some shoppers hide in a storage freezer to protect them from Coulibaly. According to the BBC, it’s not certain why Coulibaly killed these four particular individuals, when there were others in the market. Two of the victims allegedly tried to take a gun that belonged to Coulibaly, but it was empty. Coulibaly killed another victim when the man tried to enter the store soon after the hostage situation began. So we know Coulibaly chose the HyperCacher store in order to target Jews. And we know he didn’t go into the store with particular victims in mind. But we can’t be certain that Coulibaly ""randomly"" chose who to kill once he was inside the store -- which makes Obama’s comments a poor choice of words. Our ruling Perry said, ""Obama has chosen to deny the vicious anti-Semitic motivation of the attack on a kosher Jewish grocery in Paris."" In one interview, Obama described the attackers as ""randomly"" shooting people, but he seems to have been answering a question about how the public perceives acts of violence by terrorists. On several prior occasions, Obama called the attack on the grocery an act of anti-Semitism. Obama’s press team said Obama only meant that the killer did not target particular individuals as long as they were Jewish. In the Vox interview, Obama may have used a poor choice of words to describe the way that people going about their normal, everyday business sometimes end up in terrorists’ line of fire. But Perry goes too far when he says Obama ""has chosen to deny"" anti-Semitic motivation. Obama has specifically cited such a motivation in several other instances. Because Perry’s claim is not accurate, we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/12/rick-perry/obama-calls-kosher-deli-attack-random-rick-perry-s/

Rick Perry says Texas vaccination rate rose from 65 percent to 95 percent on his watch as governor
","Rick Perry, saying parents should get their children vaccinated, went on to say his home state greatly stepped up vaccinations in his 14 years as Texas governor. In a Feb. 5, 2015, interview with The Washington Post and Texas Tribune, Perry said national and state leaders should use their power to encourage the childhood shots. ""I think governors, elected officials, people in positions of authority and power and influence, should use those positions to make sure that the people they either represent or have the opportunity to work for are as healthy as they can be,"" Perry said. ""Obviously vaccines are a very important part of that."" In the interview, Perry also said that when he came into office, ""our vaccination rate in Texas was 65 percent. When I left two weeks ago, it was 95 percent."" He continued, according to video placed online by the Tribune: ""We know that vaccines — science backs it up every day — that vaccines are a very very important tool to keep our citizens safe."" The next morning, the Post’s Fact Checker gave Perry three Pinnochios for those declared percentages, saying that according to federal data, nearly 64 percent of preschool children in Texas obtained all recommended vaccinations in 2000, the year Perry became governor, and about 73 percent of such children did so in 2013, his second-to-last year in office. Also, the story said, the latter rate was a decrease from 2007. (A Perry spokesman later told the Tribune Perry had used ""incomplete numbers."") State-provided charts For our own review, we asked Perry how he reached his figures and we turned to the Texas Department of State Health Services, whose spokeswoman, Carrie Williams, emailed us a couple charts indicating the state’s vaccination rates over the years. In 2000, one chart says, 69.5 percent of Texas children aged 19 months through 35 months had received recommended shots against diptheria/tetanus/pertussis, polio and measles, mumps and rubella, in accordance with state law. In 2013, the latest year on the chart, 80.1 percent of children in the age range had received those shots. On Perry’s watch, according to the chart, year-by-year shot rates for preschoolers ranged from a low of 71.3 percent in 2002 to a high of 81.7 percent in 2010. One takeaway: The share of Texas preschool toddlers getting basic shots was up about 10 percentage points toward the end of Perry’s time as governor. Perry's '95 percent' backup So, how did Perry arrive at his statement that 95 percent of Texas children were immunized? Perry spokesman Travis Considine offered as backup for this part of Perry’s statement an October 2014 CDC press release stating that in the 2013-14 school year, 97 percent or more of Texas children enrolled in kindergarten had gotten required-for-enrollment shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); diptheria and tetanus toxoids as well as acellular pertussis (DTaP); and varicella. Another chart in the release indicates 7,803 children were exempted from getting all the shots, amounting to 2 percent of all the kindergartners. Then again, the statistic for kindergartners getting shots is a different measure than the statistic for toddler immunizations. Indeed, the second State Health Services chart shows that nearly all the state’s kindergartners got fully vaccinated in all the years Perry was governor--and nearly all students had done so for years before. In 2000, Texas children in kindergarten had vaccination rates for different shots ranging from 95 percent to 99 percent, according to the chart. In 2013, the last year on the chart, kindergartners had vaccination rates of 97.2 percent to 98.1 percent depending on the shot being gauged. Shot rates for kindergartners were in the high 90s since the earliest year on the chart, 1993. We figure those particular rates have remained high because the shots are required by law before a student enters public school, as a state handout makes clear. A wrinkle: Parents may seek to exempt their children from the required shots for ""medical contraindications"" and ""reasons of conscience, including a religious belief,"" according to state regulations. To claim an exemption due to reasons of conscience, a student's parent or legal guardian must submit a State Health Services affidavit to the child's school; it’s valid for two years, the agency says. In 2013-14, 0.76 percent of children received conscientious exemptions, according to an agency chart. We forwarded what State Health Services gave us to Considine and didn’t hear back. Finally, for scientific perspective we reached Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. By phone, Troisi looked over CDC figures and the charts we fielded from the state. She said the contrast between young preschoolers' vaccination rates in 2013 to rates in 2000 reflected a  ""statistically significant"" improvement. As governor, Troisi said, Perry had some oversight of State Health Services. But she said she also credits the federal government, through the CDC, for improved immunization rates; federal aid helps low-income residents get shots, she said. Our ruling Perry said: ""When I came into office, our vaccination rate in Texas was 65 percent. When I left two weeks ago, it was 95 percent."" These percentages trace to reported immunization rates for different populations of youngsters. And by inappropriately pairing the figures, Perry left the incorrect impression of great progress on his watch when there actually was less dramatic improvement--with kindergartners almost uniformly getting all their shots, as required by law, as they did before his reign. With all this in mind, we rate the statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 3:48 p.m., Feb. 12, 2015: After this story published, a reader prompted us to notice that a Perry spokesman had told the Texas Tribune the ex-governor used ""incomplete numbers.""

Florida's Alcee Hastings says ""crazy"" Texas has law forbidding bear-shooting from second floor

In an interview with CNN, Hastings also let loose that there's a Texas law ""that you can't shoot bears out of the second floor of a window."" We spotted  the bear comment in CNN’s Feb. 5, 2015, news story; it came from the network’s telephone interview of Hastings. Whoa (or whatever it is Floridians holler when they’re riding their gators). We left messages with Hastings’ office and didn’t hear back. Next, we rang up Mike Cox, Austin-based spokesman for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, who offered his own whoa. In Texas, Cox said, ""you can’t shoot bears,"" from any location. ""You can’t shoot them from the second floor, you can’t shoot them from the first floor, you can’t shoot them from the 23rd floor. You flat can’t shoot them."" There’s this in a TPWD bear guide for hunters: ""It is a violation of law to kill a black bear in Texas, with penalties of up to $10,000, added civil restitution fines, jail time and loss of all hunting privileges."" Another snippet in the leaflet: ""The black bear is a protected and rare species in the state of Texas."" And we saw this on another department web page about Texas hunting regulations: ""Black bears are protected and cannot be hunted or killed."" Separately to our inquiry, Jon English, an attorney for the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, said the second-floor window claim reminded him of another myth about Texas barring hunters from firing at buffalo from the second story of a hotel. Similarly, a librarian at the Legislative Reference Library in the Texas Capitol replied by email that its researchers didn’t find evidence of a law restricting bear-shooting from the second story. We identified one instance in which a person may shoot a bear in Texas. Under the state’s penal code, it’s a defense to prosecution for a person to shoot a dangerous wild animal, including a bear, in a public place if they have reasonable fear of bodily injury. Our ruling Hastings said a Texas law says ""that you can’t shoot bears out of the second floor of a window."" We failed to learn where he heard or read this. His contention that Texas is so crazy that it has a second-floor bear-shooting law is flat wrong. Texas has no such law. Instead, it forbids hunting of bears, a protected species regardless of the windows they're standing under.

In Barbary wars, did U.S. declare 'war on Islam'?
","Ask most Americans about the details of the Barbary wars, and you’re likely to get blank stares. But the obscure, early 19th century wars between the newly established United States and a group of north African powers has become evidence for a chain email that lectures about the present-day dangers of radical Islam. Here are excerpts from the chain email. ""Most Americans are unaware of the fact that over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge!  ""At the height of the 18th century, Muslim pirates were the terror of the Mediterranean and a large area of the North Atlantic. They attacked every ship in sight, and held the crews for exorbitant ransoms. Those taken hostage were subjected to barbaric treatment and wrote heart breaking letters home, begging their government and family members to pay whatever their Mohammedan captors demanded.  ""These extortionists of the high seas represented the Islamic nations of Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Algiers -- collectively referred to as the Barbary Coast and presented a dangerous and unprovoked threat to the new American Republic. ..."" ""Islam, and what its Barbary followers justified doing in the name of their prophet and their god, disturbed Jefferson quite deeply. America had a tradition of religious tolerance. In fact, Jefferson himself, had co-authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, but fundamentalist Islam was like no other religion the world had ever seen. ""A religion based on supremacism, whose holy book not only condoned but mandated violence against unbelievers was unacceptable to him. His greatest fear was that someday this brand of Islam would return and pose an even greater threat to the United States."" This excerpt offers a lot to chew over (and the full text includes even more), but for this fact-check we’re going to focus on the opening claim -- that ""over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge!"" Some background on the Barbary Wars The Barbary wars aren’t entirely forgotten -- they are the source of the lyric ""to the shores of Tripoli"" in the Marine Hymn, among other things. But they did occur more than two centuries ago, so they offer fertile ground for questionable claims. The wars -- the first fought between 1801 and 1805 and a second in 1815 -- followed centuries of piracy in the Mediterranean by semi-autonomous outposts of the Ottoman Empire, including Tripoli and Algeria. Historians describe these actions as a well-developed protection racket. Countries paid hefty monetary ""tributes"" to the north African powers in order to get free passage for their ships. Countries that refused would risk being boarded, with crew members held hostage and cargo confiscated. (Technically, this was not ""piracy,"" which is committed by non-state actors; the proper term for such government-backed privateering is ""corsairing."") Over the years, many seafaring European nations concluded that payment of tribute was the lesser of two evils, so they complied. During the era of the American colonies, American merchant vessels received protection by virtue of being of being British; the British were among the countries that paid tribute. Then, during the American Revolution, an alliance with France protected American ships. But full independence brought an end to that. Initially, the United States decided to pay tribute. But American leaders, including Jefferson, seethed at having to do it, saying it would only inspire more and more outrageous financial demands. On July 11, 1786, Jefferson wrote to John Adams, ""I very early thought it would be best to effect a peace thro' the medium of war."" The following month, he wrote to James Monroe that the Barbary powers ""must see the rod; perhaps it must be felt by some one of them."" After Jefferson became president in 1801, he rejected Tripoli's demand for payment. The pasha of Tripoli countered by declaring war on the United States. Jefferson sent forces to the Mediterranean, and after sporadic combat, hostilities ended four years later with a negotiated settlement in which the United States paid a smaller tribute than had initially been demanded. The era of Barbary corsairs effectively ended a decade later, when, after the U.S. Navy, battle-hardened from the War of 1812, won a quick victory against Algiers, effectively ending all tribute payments. The role of Islam in the Barbary wars Not only did the United States never officially ""declare war"" (as the email puts it) against any of the Barbary powers, but historians of the period also say that religion was not a significant factor in the Barbary wars. To be sure, the Barbary powers were Muslim, and mentions of Islam and Christianity do pop up at times in the historical record. But historians say it was more like fighting the mafia than religious zealots. As early as 1797, the United States made clear in a treaty with Tripoli that ""as the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion, as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen (Muslims) and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan (Mohammedan or Muslim) nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries."" The experts we contacted agreed that the email vastly overplays the available evidence. ""Very little of this had to do with Islam,"" said Adrian Tinniswood, author of Pirates of Barbary: Corsairs, Conquests and Captivity in the Seventeenth-Century Mediterranean. ""It had much more to do with trading opportunities and economics."" ""We didn't attack them out of matters of faith,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""The wars were all about freedom of the sea and protecting the U.S. flag."" Robert C. Davis, author of Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, went so far as to slam the email as ""so riddled with errors, bad logic, and innuendo that I have to wonder why you feel called upon to critique it."" Our ruling The chain email said that ""over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge!"" The Barbary powers were Muslim, and religion sometimes crops up in the historical record. But historians agree that the overriding motivation of American military action against the Barbary pirates was to secure a vital national interest, namely protecting the U.S. merchant fleet and its ability to conduct international trade. They see no evidence that Jefferson or his contemporaries were undertaking a religious holy war. So we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/11/chain-email/barbary-wars-did-us-declare-war-islam/

Bush has talked for years about the gains of minority students in Florida. ""Florida’s Hispanic kids are the best of any Hispanic group of Hispanic students in the United States -- in fact, two grade levels ahead of the average in the United States,"" Bush said during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4 We decided to fact-check if Hispanic students in Florida perform ""the best"" of any Hispanic population in the United States. Let’s hit the books. Florida’s Hispanic students A spokeswoman for Bush told PolitiFact that Bush was referring to fourth grade reading scores from The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. Many educational experts consider the annual NAEP, dubbed ""the nation’s report card,"" to be the best state-by-state measure of education systems. Sponsored by the U.S. Education Department, the exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math. For 2013, the NAEP showed that Florida’s Hispanic fourth-graders ranked the first state in the nation for highest average reading score. (The Education Department considers Florida’s score statistically tied with a handful of other states.) So Bush chose a statistic that puts Florida’s Hispanic students in the most favorable light. While Bush can point to the NAEP reading results for fourth graders and argue Florida’s students are ""the best,"" that title doesn’t hold up on all NAEP measurements. For example, Florida’s Hispanic fourth graders were fourth among states for math, and eighth graders ranked lower in both reading and math. Is there a valid reason for Bush to zero in on fourth-grade reading? ""Reading scores in fourth grade are widely considered to be an important metric because early literacy has been linked to subsequent educational outcomes,"" said Sterling C. Lloyd, senior research associate at Education Week Research Center. ""For instance, according to research studies, students who are struggling to read in third grade are at greater risk of dropping out of high school. It’s thought of as an early warning sign predicting risk of dropping out."" But it’s helpful to consider NAEP scores in other grades and subjects, as well as high school graduation rates, to ""provide a more comprehensive view of educational results than a single metric,"" Lloyd said. For example, with respect to eighth grade NAEP reading, Florida’s scores for Hispanic students were 12th nationally (out of 46 states and D.C.). For eighth grade math, Florida ranked 20th. Another expert took issue with the definition of ""Hispanic."" Richard Rothstein, an education research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, previously told us that it’s a meaningless category for educational purposes. ""Florida’s ‘Hispanics’ are not comparable to ‘Hispanics’ in other states because Florida’s include a larger proportion of middle-class Cubans, and a smaller proportion of lower-class Mexicans. Without knowing anything else, you would expect middle-class Cubans to perform at a higher level than lower-class Mexicans, because of the literacy levels at home, if for no other reason."" University of Iowa Professor David Bills said we would need to know more about the family background of Hispanics in different states to reach any conclusions about why Florida outperforms other states. ""If there is anything we know for certain about test scores, it’s that the effects of families trump the effects of schools,"" he said.  ""My guess is that they’re more likely to have well-educated parents than are Hispanic kids from California or Wisconsin, which score much lower. I think in a properly conducted study, we would learn that Florida’s fourth grade Hispanics do pretty well more because they come from social backgrounds that facilitate their doing well, and less because of things happening inside schools."" Our ruling Bush said, ""Florida’s Hispanic kids are the best of any Hispanic group of Hispanics students in the United States."" Bush’s statement was too broad and he didn’t explain what measurement he used to reach that conclusion -- which was fourth grade reading scores. On NAEP, a respected source of testing data, Florida’s Hispanic fourth graders ranked statistically tied for first among states in 2013. But that's not the case for fourth grade math. Nor does the trend continue when looking at eighth grade test scores.  Bush's claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/11/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-hispanic-students-perform-be/
"['Georgia', 'Public Health', 'Mike Adams']","
Anti-vaccine claim rooted in bad science, confusion
","With a measles outbreak sprouting in 14 states, and Georgia reporting its first case in almost three years, vaccine opponents are reviving claims about the dangers of vaccines against the disease in newsfeeds across the country. An alert reader was skeptical of one Facebook post, reviving a 2012 story that purports to list ""10 outrageous (but true) facts."" It starts with the claim that helped spur the anti-vaccination movement, despite being repeatedly debunked: Childhood shots contain mercury, a powerful neurotoxin with no safe level of use. ""Doctors who inject children with vaccines are delusional,"" Mike Adams concludes from his list of claims. ""They are practicing a medical holocaust against humanity."" How could PolitiFact Georgia resist jumping in to such subtlety? Adams declined to speak with us about his conclusions regarding mercury. He referred us instead to studies on his website, most of which deal with effects of methyl mercury. That is a very different chemical from ethyl mercury, a component in the vaccine preservative thimerosal. We’ll get to that difference in a minute. But the story of thimerosal and vaccine safety bears repeating. Early vaccinations carried the risk of dangerous and sometimes lethal bacterial infections, such as a staph infection that killed four children in 1916. Thimerosal was added to vaccines to keep multi-dose vials free from such bacteria starting in the 1930s. In 1998, the British medical journal the Lancet published a paper that claimed there was a link between the MMR vaccine — for measles, mumps and rubella — and autism. The paper by Dr. Andrew Wakefield drew considerable publicity and is credited in pushing vaccination rates down in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration held meetings to discuss the idea that thimerosal — then used in three childhood vaccines such as the hepatitis B shot — was damaging immunized infants’ brains and contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses. At the time, Dr. Neal Halsey was the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. The Johns Hopkins pediatrician had long pushed for expanding vaccinations as a way for children to live healthier lives. But he was willing to entertain the idea that thimerosal was helping to impair infant brains, even though there were no data to support the theory. Thimerosal was removed and has not been used as a preservative in any vaccine on the recommended schedule for children since 1999. By 2004, Wakefield's study was retracted and would later be deemed an ""elaborate fraud"" by the British medical journal BMJ. Wakefield eventually lost his medical license over the ordeal. At the same time, several studies, including ones in 2001 and 2004 from the Institute of Medicine, found no evidence linking vaccines and autism. ""There was no convincing evidence that there was any harm from thimerosal, but I felt we would have difficulties with public acceptance of vaccines if we continued its use,"" Halsey said. ""We are not using it anymore. Now the science is definitive that the small amount of thimerosal did not cause autism or any other neurological damage. "" The damage may already have been done, though, regarding public suspicion of vaccines. Like Halsey, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, agreed that the science never supported the theory that thimerosal caused harm. But Offit worried attention to the unproven fear of ""mercury"" was minimizing the proven fear of the diseases the vaccines were designed to keep at bay. ""Before there were vaccines, whooping cough killed 8,000 children a year, polio crippled 20,000 kids and killed 1,500 to 2,000,"" Offit said. ""Measles killed 500 children a year and caused 48,000 to be hospitalized. The best way to address safety concerns is not to cater to false ones and focus on those real threats."" Adams also confuses the issue with the interchangeable use of the term ""mercury"" for both thimerosal’s ethyl mercury and the more problematic methyl mercury. Think of ethyl mercury like ethyl alcohol — easily expelled from the human body but dangerous in large quantities. Thimerosal was used in trace amounts in vaccines. Methyl mercury is the compound found in fish and water, which builds up because the body can’t easily expel it. While some amounts occur naturally in the environment, it’s more comparable to methyl alcohol, the methanol that fills your gas tank but isn’t fit for human consumption. Repeated research studies agree that there is no evidence of harm from thimerosal’s mercury compound in vaccines. But there is an even bigger problem with Adams’ claim. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, aware of the controversy and confusion, lists all ingredients in childhood vaccines for review. MMR, the vaccine making headlines now, never contained thimerosal. Neither did the shots for chickenpox, polio or others. Thimerosal, remember, was designed to prevent bacterial growth with repeated entry into a vial. Therefore, it wouldn’t be used in single-use vials most common in the United States. And there is no need for a preservative with the live virus vaccines such as measles, said Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review. In other words, our reader was right to be skeptical. There has been debate in the scientific community about removing a mercury compound from some vaccines. But the science has always been clear that there is no evidence that compound causes harm. Bluntly, vaccines help, not hurt. And if you still don’t believe that? Consider that the recipe in question — that is, the series of shots recommended for childhood immunization — does not include the ingredient singled out as the problem. Any claims to the contrary muddy what should be a simple issue. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2015/feb/11/mike-adams/anti-vaccine-claim-rooted-fraud-confusion/

Ted Cruz says 92 million Americans aren't working
","The federal government may have announced a good jobs report just days earlier, but Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wasn’t impressed with the state of the American labor market. On the Feb. 8, 2015, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Cruz whether he would run for president. He responded: ""I think we're facing enormous challenges in this country. The Obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. Ninety-two million Americans aren't working. Obamacare is a train wreck. We're seeing our constitutional rights under assault. And abroad the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. Leading from behind doesn't work. We’ve previously checked a claim by Cruz that ""we’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978."" We rated that Mostly True at the time, and it’s still an accurate claim today. But we wondered whether Cruz was right that ""92 million Americans aren't working."" So we took a closer look. In one sense, Cruz’s estimate is actually too low. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 249.7 million non-institutionalized civilians 16 years of age and older last month. Of those, 148.2 million were employed, leaving 101.7 million not employed. But neither Cruz’s 92 million figure nor the actual 101.7 million figure is especially meaningful -- because they lump in both the young and the old. Of the 101.7 million people who are not employed, 37.5 million are age 65 and over -- an age when Medicare kicks in and many Americans head into retirement. Another 11.9 million are between 16 and 19, meaning they’re either high-school-age or starting college. And another 8 million are age 20 to 24, when many are in college or graduate school. Combined, these groups account for 57.5 million Americans -- or more than three-fifths of the number Cruz cited. Could one quibble with our calculation? Sure -- one could exclude the 20 to 24 category since not everyone that age is college-bound. And improving senior health means that Americans can effectively work past 65. Still, we don’t see much justification for Cruz counting high-school-age kids (roughly 10 million) and Americans 75 and up (17.6 million). Even this far more restrictive definition leaves almost one-third of Cruz’s number questionable. Another point worth noting: Just because someone in the prime working-age range (25 to 64) isn’t working doesn’t mean that they are unemployed. They may be disabled, taking care of children full-time or have gone back to school. The actual number of officially unemployed Americans in January was a little under 9 million -- just one-tenth of the figure Cruz cited as ""not working."" Our ruling Cruz said that ""92 million Americans aren't working."" Once you strip out senior citizens and school-age Americans, the number is less than half that. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. UPDATED, Feb. 11, 2015: After this fact-check was published, Cruz’s office got back to PolitiFact with sourcing for the statistic. The statistic, they said, came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- Table A-1, for the total civilian, non-institutionalized population not in labor force, seasonally adjusted, for January 2015. The total for that month was 92.5 million. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said that Cruz was ""relying on objective federal labor statistics"" in making his statement. However, our fact-check didn’t question the veracity of the BLS statistics – only their relevance to Cruz’s point. We continue to believe the statistic includes Americans too young and too old to be expected to work, and we stand by our rating of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-92-million-americans-arent-working/
"['Debt', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says his proposed borrowing is lowest in a decade
","Even before he gave his 2015-’17 budget address, Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to borrow heavily for highways was under attack. So when he spoke before the Legislature on Feb. 3, 2015, Walker was ready for the critics -- including some fellow Republicans. ""In my predecessor’s last budget, the total bonding level was $3.6 billion,"" Walker said. ""In this budget, the total level of bonding is down to less than $1.6 billion. This is the lowest it has been in a decade."" It’s not shocking to think borrowing was higher in 2009, amid the Great recession when many states turned to borrowing to fill budget gaps. Wisconsin, then led by Democrat Jim Doyle, was among them. But was borrowing $2 billion higher than in Walker’s 2015-’17 budget plan, covering a period more than six years after the recession officially ended? The independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau tracks new borrowing in each state budget: Here’s a look at budgets enacted since 2005 -- a decade ago -- and Walker’s new proposal:   Year Governor Borrowing total 2005-’07 Jim Doyle $1.53 billion 2007-’09 Jim Doyle $2.76 billion 2009-’11 Jim Doyle $3.58 billion 2011-’13 Scott Walker $1.73 billion 2013-’15 Scott Walker $2.05 billion 2015-’17* Scott Walker $1.56 billion *Proposed   The figures back up both parts of Walker’s claim. But there are important caveats. Walker is comparing the borrowing in his proposed budget, which still has to go through the Legislature, to the new borrowing in the final enacted version of the 2009-’11 budget. That makes the comparison a bit of apples-to-oranges. To illustrate, consider that in 2009, Doyle stood where Walker stood and unveiled a two-year budget with a proposed $1.5 billion in borrowing, reports from the fiscal bureau show. That’s actually a bit less than what Walker wants. As is typical later in the budget process, the State Building Commission --  controlled by the administration -- brought forth a capital budget to borrow for building construction on the University of Wisconsin campuses and elsewhere. It sought another $1.2 billion in new bonding above Doyle’s original proposal. Then the Legislature added in another $900 million and -- in the end -- Doyle signed off. That increased the total to the $3.6 billion. To be sure, more typically, the Legislature has reduced the borrowing sought by the executive branch. That could happen this year, too. Plus Walker says he will not propose any new borrowing in the capital budget that goes through the Building Commission. (Instead, he will use $858 million in previously authorized bonding authority and repurpose it for capital projects, but that tactic is not unusual, and those figures are not included in the Fiscal Bureau’s tracking of new borrowing.) Finally, another wildcard is the UW System, whose building projects typically make up a big chunk of state borrowing. If Walker’s plan to spin the system off under a new authority is approved, it could seek borrowing on its own, effectively removing that item from the state’s books. That makes a comparison to 2009 a bit sticky as well. Our rating Walker said his plan borrows $2 billion less than Doyle’s last budget and is the lowest borrowing level in a decade. It’s accurate if you compare the adopted budgets from that time to Walker’s proposed budget for 2015-’17 (which is all you can do right now). But the claim needs clarification because Walker’s comparing his early-stage proposal to a 2009 final enacted budget after lawmakers and Doyle pumped it up. We rate it Mostly True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.  ",/factchecks/2015/feb/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-his-proposed-borrowing-lowest-de/

Alcee Hastings’ Texas dildo claim doesn't hold up
","U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., messed with Texas when he bashed the state during a congressional hearing on Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. At a Feb. 2 House Rules Committee hearing, lawmakers were discussing Texas’ decision not to participate in state health care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. At one point, Hastings said, ""I don't know about in your state, which I think is a crazy state to begin with, and I mean that just as I said it."" U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, decried Hastings’ comment as ""defamatory."" ""I wouldn’t live there for all the tea in China, and that’s how I feel,"" Hastings said. Hastings refused to apologize, vowing that Burgess would have to ""wait until hell freezes over"" to get an apology. (The spat later drew national attention when The Daily Show with Jon Stewart parodied the ""Southern Slam."") Then, on Feb. 5, CNN posted an article quoting Hastings, and the fur flew again. ""One of their cities has a law that says that women can only have six dildos, and the certain size of things. And if that ain't crazy, I don't know what is,"" Hastings said. In this article, we will fact-check Hastings' claim that a Texas city has a law about dildos and their sizes. We contacted a spokeswoman for Hastings but did not get a reply. Texas law struck down In the 1970s, Texas banned the promotion of ""obscene devices,"" defined as items ""designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs."" Such devices include, but are not limited to, ""a dildo or artificial vagina."" Part of the statute said, ""A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same."" Being presumed to promote sex toys is not necessarily the same as barring people from owning six or more of these devices. It seems clear the goal of the statute was to ban the sale of these devices, while Hastings’ claim suggested that Texas cops would go after individuals who owned a lot of dildos. In 1985, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the statute did not violate an individual's right to privacy, concluding that there was no constitutional right to ""stimulate another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose."" Violating the law carried a punishment of up to two years in jail. But in 2004, stores that wanted to sell such devices sued to overturn the law, and in 2008 a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court of Appeals’ Fifth Circuit struck down the Texas law, concluding that it violated the 14th Amendment to privacy. ""Whatever one might think or believe about the use of these devices, government interference with their personal and private use violates the Constitution,"" the court ruled, noting that Mississippi, Virginia and Alabama had similar statutes at the time. Courts have struck down nearly identical laws in Louisiana, Kansas, Colorado and Georgia. The court relied on another famous Texas case, Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state’s anti-sodomy law was unconstitutional. After the ruling, then-Attorney General (and now governor) Greg Abbott asked for another hearing by the full appeals court. But the request was denied, and that court informed Abbott that he would have to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which he decided not to do. The Austin American-Statesman reported at the time that the law was rarely enforced, though in 2003 a Texas woman was arrested for selling erotic toys at a Tupperware-type party. The charges were later dropped. Jennifer Kinsley, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, is now a law professor at Northern Kentucky University. She told PolitiFact that she wasn’t aware of any cities that had adopted obscene devices legislation. ""In fact, I think those types of laws at the municipal level would be pre-empted by the state statute, which as you found has been declared unconstitutional,"" she said. ""I do know that retailers throughout Texas sell more than six sexual devices now."" We should note a separate case stemming from the 2004 sale of a vibrator by a store in Corpus Christi, Texas. In July 2008, a state appeals court affirmed a lower-court ruling that upheld a guilty verdict in a case involving the state dildo ban as well as a municipal ordinance prohibiting the operation of a sexually oriented business without a permit. Legal experts say that technically, federal rulings are not directly binding on state courts, but plaintiffs would be assured of relief if they pursued their case in federal court. Our ruling Hastings said that one Texas city ""has a law that says that women can only have six dildos."" There's a law, now invalid, along those lines — though it was intended to prevent the sale of such devices, not the ownership of them. In addition, it was a statewide law, not a city law, and more importantly, it was struck down by a federal appeals court more than six years ago. Hastings’ office did not provide supporting evidence for an existing city law that sets a dildo limit. There’s some obscurity because the law is still on the books. But experts told us that, as a practical matter, the law has no teeth, and stores today in Texas can, and do, sell more than six dildos. We’ll reconsider our ruling if additional information comes to light, but for now, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/09/alcee-hastings/florida-democrat-texas-law-says-women-dildos/

Blog: Sheriffs group cried for Obama to be hanged
","A group of conservative sheriffs might despair over President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, but did they actually call for him to be lynched? That was the headline that ran on the Urban Intellectuals website in January, but there’s no evidence to back it up. Urban Intellectuals bills itself as a place on the Web to promote meaningful discussion within the black community. On Jan. 15, 2015, the group ran a story with the headline ""Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators."" A reader spotted it and asked us to take a closer look. This wasn’t the only website to carry that headline. We found a similar version at Addictinginfo.org, a website that boasts over 18,000 Twitter followers. Both websites drew heavily from the same source, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization. What the poverty center reported on Jan. 8 was distinctly different from the story conveyed in the Urban Intellectuals headline. Let’s start with the headlines. The poverty center wrote, ""As Extremist ‘Constitutional Sheriffs’ Meet With Senators, Their Supporters Call for Obama’s Lynching."" Urban Intellectuals shortened that, writing, ""Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators."" The poverty center article described a December meeting in the Russell Senate Building between sheriffs, including members of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, and three lawmakers, Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and David Vitter, R-La., and Rep. Martha Blackburn, R-Tenn. The sheriffs organization claims to speak for hundreds of police, sheriffs and other officials who wish to be part of the ""Holy Cause of Liberty."" The group urged lawmakers to overturn Obama’s decision to defer deportation action against millions of undocumented immigrants. While the sheriffs' antipathy for Obama’s priorities were clear, the actual call for lynching took place out on the streets. According to the poverty center’s article, ""Just down the Capitol Mall that same day, a small group of protesters supporting the sheriffs gathered at the White House and began shouting slogans and demanding the removal of President Obama. Some in the crowd demanded the president be lynched -- ‘Hang the lying Muslim traitor!’ one of them shouted."" The article said that an anti-government group called Operation American Freedom organized that protest. A video in advance of the demonstration said, ""The sheriffs are going to be here doing their rally, and Operation American Freedom, or O.A.F., are going to be there as well,"" according to the article. That line strongly suggests that the sheriffs and the protesters were two distinct groups. In fact, the article goes further to attribute the calls for lynching to a single man. One protester in particular—a bearded man toting an American flag—seemed especially intent on seeing Obama hung. ""Hang the lying Kenyan traitor terrorist piece of sh-t,"" he shouted at one point. ""He’s a traitor! Hang him!"" The same man kept shouting variations of this throughout the protest. While the article describes how the sheriffs group mingled with the protesters after their meeting, it gives no indication that any sheriffs participated in the calls for hanging the president. Other websites more accurately relayed the poverty center article. The liberal site Crooks and Liars wrote, ""As Extremist ‘Constitutional Sheriffs’ Meet With Senators, Their Supporters Call for Obama’s Lynching."" Our ruling The Urban Intellectuals website said that sheriffs called for Obama’s lynching. The article behind that statement amply describes that there were two separate groups in Washington that day. At no time does the article suggest that any sheriff spoke those words.

Author says half of daily users become addicted, roughly 2.7 million people
","Vigorous debate surrounds efforts to legalize marijuana around the nation and in Rhode Island, where advocates are pushing legalization proposals in the General Assembly. (In 2013, the state decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical  marijuana.) Author Susan Shapiro, who says she is ambivalent about legalizing marijuana, shared her story about what she called her ""extreme addiction"" to marijuana in a commentary published Jan. 10, 2015, in The Providence Journal entitled ""Susan Shapiro: My pot addiction nearly ruined my life."" She told of marijuana’s ""dark side,"" and included statistics to reinforce her point. ""The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S,"" she wrote. We wondered if the figure Shapiro used is true. We called her to find out how she backed up her claim. She referred us to a story that ran July 14, 2014, in USA Today entitled ""Marijuana poses more risks than many realize"" by reporter Liz Szabo. She took the information from that piece, she said. The story quoted Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research on drug abuse and addiction. The relevant section in the story Shapiro cited reads:  ""Up to half of people who smoke marijuana daily become addicted. According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2.7 million people over age 12 meet criteria for addiction to marijuana."" We contacted the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which produced the survey cited by Shapiro and Volkow. We also reached out to Volkow’s organization, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The SAMHSA survey found that 5.4 million people said they used marijuana daily or almost daily in 2012. Almost daily was defined as 300 or more days in the past year.  (Another 18.9 million said they had used marijuana at least once in the past month.) NIDA forwarded us a detailed table from the SAMHSA’s 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. It showed that 2.69 million people over age 12 with dependence on marijuana and hashish in the past year. That’s roughly half the number of daily marijuana smokers, as Shapiro said. Tamara Ward, a SAMHSA spokeswoman, told us that dependence on illicit drugs or alcohol is defined as meeting three out of seven criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, including the need for markedly increased amounts of the substance, withdrawal symptoms, and  reduction or abandonment of social, work or recreational activities because of use. That sounded like addiction to us, but to be sure, we also reached out to Wayne D. Hall, a professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland, in Australia. We asked Hall if dependence amounted to addiction. He said he used the words interchangeably but that not everyone does, especially not in the case of opioid drugs. We also contacted Dr. Stuart  Gitlow, an addiction medicine specialist in Woonsocket and president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. He agreed. ""Clearly, all those who have dependence also have addiction, but it's not as clear that all those with abuse also have addiction. Some probably do not,"" Gitlow said. Our ruling Susan Shapiro wrote ""The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S."" The survey found that 5.4 million people reported using marijuana daily or almost daily. A more detailed table from the same survey shows 2.69 million people -- just shy of 2.7 million --  with dependence on marijuana and hashish. Based on that number, and the definitions of addiction from SAMHSA, Hall and Gitlow, we rate Shapiro’s claim True. (Correction: Susan Shapiro says she is ambivalent about legalizing marijuana.
