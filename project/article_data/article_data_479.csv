40% of U.S. gun sales made by sellers who aren't required to do background checks, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says
","
The implicit call to arms made by Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. led to a nationally televised quarrel over guns between Clarke and one of his political rivals, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

The two appeared Jan. 29, 2013 on Piers Morgan's prime-time talk show on CNN. Clarke spoke about the Milwaukee radio ad he aired five days earlier, in which he urged citizens to consider taking a firearms safety course in order to protect themselves from crime.

Barrett, who defeated Clarke and eight other candidates in the 2004 mayoral election, criticized the ad and what he characterized as the sheriff's position on gun control.

""Right now, he is defending laws that have a loophole that allow those individuals -- those individuals who have criminal record, mental health records, that are involuntary or domestic violence orders -- to go buy guns on private sales,"" Barrett said of Clarke. ""I need our sheriff to support the initiative that says that individuals who sell guns ensure that those guns are not being sold to criminals, they're not being sold to people of domestic violence orders and they're not being sold to people of involuntary mental judgment commitments.

""And I need that because 40 percent of the sales are occurring outside of gun dealers.""

Barrett was making the point that many gun sales -- such as those done at gun shows or over the Internet -- don't involve a criminal background check of the buyer because only licensed firearm dealers are required to do the checks.

But if so many gun sales are done without creating a government paper trail, is it even possible to know what percentage of guns aren't sold by licensed gun dealers?

Let’s see if Barrett is on target.

Barrett's evidence

Barrett is a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which supports background checks for all gun sales. The group, though, hasn't always been as bold in making the claim Barrett did.

In one statement, the group said ""experts estimate"" that ""perhaps"" 40 percent of all sales are made by unlicensed private dealers who aren't required to do background checks. In another statement, the group puts the figure at more than 40 percent, but characterizes it as an estimate.

Like Barrett, scholars and news reports often state the figure without citing a source.

When we asked for Barrett’s evidence, the mayor’s chief of staff, Patrick Curley, cited a December 2011 statement by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The statement attributes the 40 percent figure to the U.S. Department of Justice, but does not cite a particular source or study.

Curley also pointed out that in July 2012, when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, PolitiFact National rated it Mostly True.

But new information has since emerged.

Newer claims, different ratings

Less than a week before Barrett made his claim, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., made the same claim Bloomberg had.  

PolitiFact National rated Gillibrand’s claim Half True and at the same time changed the rating on Bloomberg’s claim to Half True.

Our colleagues said that after the Connecticut school shooting in December 2012, new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. Here are the highlights of what they found in assessing Gillibrand’s claim: 
The 40 percent figure grew out of a 1997 National Institute of Justice study that found that 35.7 percent of respondents in a 1994 telephone survey reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. People citing the study have rounded up the figure to 40 percent. 
One of the authors of the study said he had ""no idea"" whether the 35.7 percent -- which he called a ""very old number"" -- was a reliable estimate for today. 
Two scholars said there is no way to know what the percentage is and one said the study was flawed. Two other experts said 40 percent is probably accurate. 
Also in January 2013, The Washington Post Fact Checker reassessed a claim by President Barack Obama, who said ""as many as"" 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check.

Initially, the Fact Checker did not issue a rating on the statement. But after further review, Obama was given ""two Pinocchios"" out of a possible four -- the Fact Checker’s rating for a statement that contains ""significant omissions and/or exaggerations.""

Our rating

Barrett said 40 percent of U.S. gun sales ""are occurring outside of"" licensed gun dealers.

Like others, Barrett made the claim without saying that the study he relies is from 1997. And expert opinion on the figure he cites is mixed, at best.

"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'Rob Woodall']","
Is Congress a millionaires club?
","
Despite the pathetically poor approval ratings of Congress these days, there is apparently one big advantage to being elected to the nation’s legislative body.

Nearly one-half of them are millionaires, one Georgia congressman said.

Rob Woodall, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Gwinnett County, made the claim in response to a question at a town hall meeting about the grass-roots effort to stop members of Congress from getting paid if they don’t pass a budget.

Woodall began his reply by needling the Democratic-led U.S. Senate for boasting that it plans to pass a budget this year. The Senate hasn’t passed a budget resolution since April 2009.

Woodall then made his claim about the wealth of Congress.

""Forty-seven percent of (members of Congress) are millionaires. They don’t care if they don’t get paid,"" the congressman said at the Jan. 25 town hall meeting he hosted at the Gwinnett government complex in Lawrenceville.

PolitiFact Georgia was at the meeting and wondered whether Congress is in fact a millionaires club.

Woodall voted Jan. 23 in favor of the No Budget, No Pay Act that passed in the House by a 285-144 vote. Thursday, the Senate passed the resolution, which also extended the debt ceiling to May. The bill states that the salaries of Congress be held in an escrow account if there is no budget passed by April 15.

To Woodall’s point, many of his colleagues are business owners, attorneys and doctors who earned a good living before coming to Washington. Congress also pays well. Most members make an annual salary of $174,000.

Members of Congress are required to file annual financial disclosure reports, which detail information about investments and liabilities. Last year, The Washington Post published a series of articles detailing the net financial worth of each member of Congress, using that information and other sources. The Post’s calculations do not include assets lawmakers are not required to disclose, such as personal residences, which could increase the net worth of some members. In January, the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics’ website unveiled a database detailing the minimum, average and maximum net worth of nearly every member of the current Congress.

The research shows many of them are rich. Very rich. The median estimated net worth of Congress is $966,000, according to the center. By contrast, the median net worth of the typical American household is slightly more than $66,000. Ten members had a net worth greater than $100 million on one or both sites.

The multimillionaires include:
-- House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who has at least $3 million in stocks and mutual funds.
-- U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., whose road to riches began in the 1970s as a writer on ""Saturday Night Live."" He has a listed net worth of about $8 million.
-- Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the former CEO of a company that created the Viper anti-theft system for vehicles, who has a net worth of nearly $500 million.
-- Outgoing U.S. senator and newly-appointed Secretary of State John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts, whose wife is an heiress of the Heinz ketchup fortune. He has an estimated net worth of about $200 million.
-- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, whose family real estate holdings are worth an estimated $100 million.
-- Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina, who was appointed to the Senate in January and owns about $3 million worth of real estate.

But there are some members who could use every penny they can get at the moment. Fourteen members had negative net worths on both sites. Many of them have taken out major loans for their businesses, such as U.S. Rep. David Valadao of California, or owe large sums in legal fees, such as U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings of Florida. Both are millions of dollars in debt, according to the CRP, which is better known as Open Secrets.

We thought the net worth was a reasonable approach to determining whether someone is a millionaire. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed the Post’s and the center’s research to determine the percentage of current members of Congress who are millionaires. The net worth was the same or close for many members. There were a few cases in which the net worth varied greatly. There are some vacant congressional seats, such as the one once held by Jesse Jackson Jr. in Illinois, and a couple of new members whose net worth wasn’t on the Open Secrets list.

We considered members of Congress a millionaire if both databases had their net worth as greater than $1 million or if their net worth was found to be close to $1 million by one group and greater than $1 million by the other group. We also included new members of Congress on our list if Open Secrets concluded their net worth is greater than $1 million.

By using that criteria, there are 257 members of Congress we believe belong in the millionaire category, which accounted for 48.5 percent of all members who had financial information available on either the Post or Open Secrets websites.

Woodall, by the way, is not part of the millionaires club. Woodall, who previously worked as chief of staff to now-retired U.S. Rep. John Linder of Georgia, has a net worth of about $300,000, according to both sites.

Seven of Georgia’s 14 members of Congress had a net worth greater than $1 million. They are John Barrow, Phil Gingrey, Tom Graves, Johnny Isakson, Jack Kingston, Tom Price and Austin Scott. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who announced last month that he will not seek another Senate term in 2014, has a net worth of $337,505, according to the Post and about $400,000, according to Open Secrets.

To sum up, Woodall said 47 percent of the members of Congress are millionaires. The research we found shows there’s a very strong case that he’s correct.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Keith Faber']","
Ohio Senate President Keith Faber says all of Ohio's economic numbers beat the national average
","
The opening day of Ohio's General Assembly last month brought questions about potential action by the legislature on a number of hot-button social issues.
But the new Senate president, Keith Faber, a Celina Republican, told reporters he wants to keep the focus on the economy over the assembly's two-year term.

""It’s pretty straightforward: Ohio is doing better right now than the national average on all the numbers — but better just isn’t good enough,"" he said.

The start of a new year and a new term is a good time to take stock. PolitiFact Ohio wondered how Ohio stacked up on the economic numbers. We asked Faber's office which ones he was talking about.

The answer: Unemployment and job creation.

Employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state’s economy, economic experts have told us, which is why they are so frequently cited.

We checked the numbers released last week by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee.
Its report showed the unemployment rate in Ohio was 6.7 percent in December 2012, which was more than a point below the national figure of 7.8 -- and down from the most recent peak of 10.6 percent in January 2010.

The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that Ohio's over-the-year jobs increase through December 2012 (up 90,700), was exceeded only by Texas (260,800), California (225,900) and New York (123,600).

We found similar significant job growth in a fact-check a couple of months ago.

That backs up Faber's statement.

But because two figures are ""both"" and not ""all"" the numbers, we looked at more.

Ohio's gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic production, totaled $484.0 billion in 2011, the most recent number available. That was 8th largest in the U.S., or above average, but failed to keep pace with growth nationally.

On a per capita basis, Ohio's GDP of $41,920 was 33rd in the nation.

Ohio also ranked 33rd in 2011 in per capita personal income, at $37,836, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That was below the national average of $41,560.

In median household income, the most recent figures show Ohio dropping precipitously. Ohio ranked 39th among the states in median household income in 2011, at $44,648, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That was a drop of 5.7 percent from a year earlier, or more than three times the national average. Ohio ranked 34th in median income the previous year, and 19th a decade earlier in 2000.

The state's percentage of population living below the poverty line, at 15.1 percent in 2011, was almost unchanged from the previous year, the Census Bureau reported last September. The official poverty rate for the nation was 15 percent, also almost unchanged.

Those numbers help to illustrate that Ohio was one of the half dozen hardest-hit states in the great recession. A recent analysis by JPMorgan Chase, though, says its economy is forecast to grow faster or as fast as the national economy in 2013 -- ""paralleling the national recovery.""

Even so, while the analysis says ""housing activity is forecast to gradually recover from current levels,"" it also says ""home building remains depressed, as in most other states, and there is little indication yet of a housing revival in Ohio,"" according to data from the Census Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency. The growth in house prices lags the national trend.

Where does that leave Faber?

At PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. And ""all"" is a little word that covers a lot of territory -- too much to apply to his statement about the economy.

Faber's point about Ohio doing better than average is backed up by what experts have told PolitiFact Ohio are key figures -- unemployment and job creation -- and they are the ones he cited.

Other figures, however, show Ohioans have lost ground economically and trail national averages.

Faber’s statement is partially accurate. But even allowing for political hyperbole, a statement that ""all"" of Ohio’s economic numbers are outpacing averages for the nation omits or overlooks important information.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates as Half True.

"['Texas', 'Guns', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without background checks traces to study done before checks were required
","
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, participating in a U.S. Senate committee hearing on gun-related proposals, warmed up to a Jan. 30, 2013, question by referring to ""much attention"" drawn by some advocates to gun purchases occurring without background checks.

""Indeed, the statistic of 40 percent has been bandied about,"" the Texas Republican said. ""Now that statistic is unfortunately based on a study that occurred before the background check went into effect, and so it is a highly dubious figure.""

Cruz was evidently referring to claims by gun-control advocates that 40 percent of gun purchases are made without the purchaser undergoing a criminal background check. This happens, they say, because the purchases are made from private individuals, who are not required to check purchasers backgrounds.

Advocates of a law requiring universal background checks have widely cited the 40-percent figure. President Barack Obama mentioned it in the White House ceremony outlining his slate of new gun restrictions. A white paper by researchers at Johns Hopkins University asserts it without qualification. Indeed, it’s a powerful claim: that 40 percent of guns are bought and sold in America with no paper trail, no fingerprint of the hands they fall into.
   
Coincidentally, our colleagues at PolitiFact’s national website posted a review of the 40-percent claim on the day that Cruz made his comment, rating as Half True this statement by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.: ""Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.""

We drew on research behind that fact check to get started on Cruz’s claim.
   
The 1997 study
   
The 40 percent figure originated in a 1997 National Institute of Justice study by researchers Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership taken months after the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 took effect, mandating background checks of individuals buying guns at gun shops.

Under the law, federally licensed dealers must verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day.
       
But only licensed dealers must conform. The law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. If a private seller suspects that a buyer would be disqualified under federal rules, then they can’t go through with the sale. But there is no background check.

The 1994 survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and where they were obtained.
   
Of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun.
   
In those answers, Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of respondents reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.) Some people answered ""probably"" and ""probably not"" if they weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, where the respondent skipped the question about whether the gun came from a licensed dealer, the researchers made a judgment call. Ludwig said in an email that they mined answers to other questions (such as whether the gun was a gift) to guide them.
   
""Our approach ... was to be conservative in estimating what fraction of sales are in the primary market,"" Ludwig wrote. ""Primary market"" refers to guns sold by dealers in retail stores or pawn shops. The ""secondary market"" includes gun shows and other transactions where a background check is not required.

Another fact check
   
Some critics find fault with the 40 percent figure because it includes guns that are inherited or won—in other words, transactions that could reasonably be assumed not to involve a background check, which could mean a different look at the answers generates a different percentage. When the Washington Post’s fact-checking project, the Fact Checker, asked Ludwig to revisit the data, the newspaper said, results suggested that purchases without background checks amounted to 14 to 22 percent, not 40 percent.

""And since the survey sample is so small, that means the results have a survey caveat: plus or minus six percentage points,"" the Post said. ""Moreover, … the survey was taken in late 1994, eight months after the Brady law went into effect, and the questions were asked about gun purchases in the previous two years. So some of the answers concerned gun purchases that took place in a pre-Brady environment.""

Current-day applicability

For his part, Cook, the other study author, told us he has no idea whether the 40 percent figure remains reliable. ""This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers,"" Cook said. ""How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number.""

Other scholars had similar views.
   
""I don’t see how anyone could know that number,"" said James Jacobs, Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law.

By telephone, we asked Cook about Cruz’s statement—that the percentage is dubious because the research took place before background checks were mandated.

The surveys took place after the law took effect, Cook said, but it’s correct that the vast majority of gun acquisitions identified by respondents took place before then, given that respondents were asked to focus on guns acquired within two years, meaning 1992 and 1993.

Of note: Most of the respondents had acquired at least one gun well before the Brady law took effect. ""Persons owning handguns in 1994 acquired about 28 percent of them in 1993-1994,"" Cook and Ludwig wrote, ""compared with 20 percent of long guns.""

States conducted background checks 
Another wrinkle: Eighteen states were imposing background checks before the federal mandate took effect, according to a research paper by Ludwig and Cook published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in August 2000. The states doing so included California, New York, Florida, Illinois and Michigan.

Even so, Cook told us, he and Ludwig did not use information on individual states in doing their analysis.  He emailed that ""the survey provides an accurate representation of the nation as a whole but not of individual states."" Also, he stressed, the survey had no questions about whether there had been a background check and respondents also weren’t asked the states where they had acquired their guns. He agreed there is ""no way to reach any conclusions about background checks for any of the transactions that are reported in the survey.""

As we closed out this review, Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton pointed out by email that 32 states were evidently not requiring background checks before the Brady law took effect. The 40-percent statistic is dubious, Rushton said, ""because it is not an accurate reflection of the number of gun transactions without background checks that are happening today.""

Our ruling
   
Cruz said the claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without background checks traces to information gathered before background checks were required.

However, the 1994 survey took place a few months after federal law mandated background checks--and about one third of states were requiring the checks even earlier. 
Given the infancy of the Brady law, it still may be that few respondents underwent the mandated checks. Significantly, respondents were not asked if they had undergone such checks or in which states they had acquired their guns.

Summing up: Some background checks were ongoing at the time of the survey. Still, Cruz’s statement drives at the fact that the oft-quoted survey was conducted nearly two decades ago, before the federal law had time to have much effect.",/factchecks/2013/feb/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-claim-40-percent-guns-are-sold-witho/

U.S. files criminal charges in fraction of gun denial cases, Mayors Against Illegal Guns says
","
Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has intensified its efforts since mass shootings spiked in 2012, claims the U.S. rarely prosecutes felons and others who can't legally own a gun but are caught trying to buy one.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the founding members of the group, which aired a TV ad in Milwaukee and other cities in January 2013 as part of its campaign to spur action by President Barack Obama and Congress. The group supports measures such as requiring every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check.

Regarding the prosecutions, Mayors Against Illegal Guns stated on its DemandaPlan.org website:

""It is a federal crime for felons and other prohibited gun purchasers to attempt to buy a gun. The (U.S.) Department of Justice, however, has not been prosecuting people who fail background checks at licensed gun dealers, leaving them free to buy from unlicensed sellers who don’t conduct checks – including largely anonymous Internet sales.""

The statement continued with a reference to one Department of Justice agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), claiming:

""In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred more than 71,000 such cases to ATF, but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them.""

Let’s look into the disparity.

Gun background checks

When asked for backup, Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, cited a 2011 report that was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and produced by the Regional Justice Information Service in St. Louis, Mo.

The quasi-government agency’s report explains criminal background checks and gives statistics about attempted gun purchases in 2009 that were denied as a result of background check provisions in the federal Brady Act.

The Brady Act was adopted in 1993, 12 years after President Ronald Reagan; his press secretary, James Brady; and two law enforcement officers were shot and wounded in John Hinckley Jr.’s assassination attempt on Reagan.

The law requires a criminal history background check be done by the FBI or a state agency on persons who attempt to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer. If the potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the ATF.

Prosecutions

In 2009, the FBI conducted more than 6 million background checks and denied 71,010 of them (1.1 percent). The most common reasons were the applicant had a felony conviction or indictment, had a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction or was under a domestic violence restraining order.

So, Mayors Against Illegal Guns is correct on the first number it cited.

But that doesn’t means a crime occurred in all 71,000 cases.

Jennifer Karberg of the St. Louis research organization that did the report told us that if a person trying to buy a gun indicates on the application form that, for example, he is a felon, the application will simply be denied. On the other hand, if a felon lied on the form about his conviction, that’s a crime that could be prosecuted, she said.

Moreover, after further review, about one-fourth of the applications that are denied by the FBI are reversed after a determination that no denial should have been done, Karberg said.

So those cases also don’t involve a crime.

Of the more than 71,000 cases that were referred to ATF, the agency sent only 4,700 cases to its offices around the country for further investigation, according to the report by the St. Louis research organization. The rest of the denials did not meet guidelines for further investigation, or they were overturned after being reviewed.

Of the 4,700 cases that went on to ATF field offices, the vast majority were not referred to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges, the report says. The most common reasons were ""no prosecutive merit,"" federal or state guidelines weren’t met, or the applicant should not have been denied in the first place.

Ultimately, the field offices asked U.S. attorney’s offices (there are two in Wisconsin) to file a total of 140 criminal charges. From there, only 77 charges were filed. The most common charges were submitting false information on the gun purchase application or being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.

Karberg told us the 77 charges likely involved fewer than 77 individual cases, given that multiple charges could be filed in some cases.

The author of the report, Ronald Frandsen, indicated to The Washington Post Fact Checker that the low rate of prosecution is the result of the priority given to such cases. And the Fact Checker said there is a troubling lack of detailed data that might clarify why few cases were referred for prosecution.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns argues that more cases could be prosecuted.

The group cited a 2004 Department of Justice review of enforcement of the Brady Act. The report found that ATF was referring ""standard denial"" cases to its field offices that ""were not likely to be prosecuted."" But it also said that historically, federal prosecutors ""have been unsuccessful in achieving convictions in many of these cases and consequently have been unwilling to expend their limited resources on prosecuting"" them.

The report went on to explain why prosecutors may not want to file charges in certain cases: A person prohibited from buying a gun may have committed a felony that was not violent or was committed many years ago; a prohibited person might be trying to buy a hunting rifle; and it’s difficult to prove that the prohibited person was aware of the prohibition and intentionally lied on his application.

So, there are indications that federal law enforcement authorities could file more criminal charges in cases in which a gun purchase application is denied. But it’s also clear that large numbers of the denials don’t involve any crime at all and some cases are not provable.

Our rating

Mayors Against Illegal Guns said that in 2009, the FBI ""referred more than 71,000"" cases of people failing background checks when trying to buy a gun to another federal agency, ""but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them.""

The two numbers are essentially correct, but the statement takes things out of context in that, in a significant number of cases, no crime was committed and other cases are not provable.

"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims state spending is lower today than under Gov. Jon Corzine in fiscal year 2008
","
The only way to make New Jersey a more affordable place to live is to have government spend less money, according to Gov. Chris Christie.

The Republican governor offered that solution when a man called into a Jan. 22 radio program and expressed concerns about the cost of living in New Jersey. The caller wanted to know the plan for keeping people like him in the state.

Christie told the man that property taxes have increased minimally in the last two years, because government spending has been capped. On the state level, spending is now lower than it was under Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine in fiscal year 2008, according to Christie.

""Now we’re making a difference. Because you know why? We’re capping spending,"" Christie said on New Jersey 101.5’s ""Ask the Governor"" program. ""We’re saying you’ve got to spend less, and on the state level, we spend less today than Jon Corzine spent in fiscal year 2008, five years later.""

The governor, who is seeking re-election this year, repeated the state spending claim on Thursday during a campaign stop at Tops Diner in East Newark.

Christie is right that state spending in the current fiscal year is lower than the spending level in fiscal year 2008, but the governor’s claim ignores the fact that spending has still increased with each new state budget since he took office.

Let’s break down the numbers:

For fiscal year 2008, Corzine approved a spending plan of about $33.47 billion, according to state Department of the Treasury reports. Final state spending that year ended slightly higher, at $33.61 billion, according to department reports.

In June 2012, Christie signed a budget for fiscal year 2013 that appropriates about $31.65 billion in state spending.

So, the governor’s current budget marks a nearly $2 billion decrease in state spending as compared to fiscal year 2008.

But just because state spending is lower than it was five years ago, doesn’t mean it hasn’t increased on Christie’s watch.

In his first budget after taking office in January 2010, Christie approved a roughly $28.36 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2011. For the next budget year -- fiscal year 2012 -- the governor approved a roughly $29.69 billion budget.

That means, in terms of the annual appropriations acts signed by Christie, state spending has increased by about $3.29 billion, or 11.6 percent, between fiscal years 2011 and 2013. 
In response to our findings about spending increases during Christie's tenure, Treasury spokesman Bill Quinn said the following in an e-mail: 
""We think your original question has been conclusively answered in the Governor’s favor as unequivocally true. You are now posing an entirely different inquiry that is not based on what the Governor actually said on the air that led to your fact check.""

The increased spending since fiscal year 2011 is due in part to the governor’s policies boosting the state’s economy, leading to higher tax revenues, according to Quinn. He pointed out how two of the major areas of higher spending have been in education and pension contributions.

Quinn added that ""the tough decisions needed to put the state budget on sound, responsible fiscal footing in fiscal years 10 and 11 allowed us to grow and make key investments in FY 12 and 13.""

Our ruling

In response to a caller during New Jersey 101.5’s ""Ask the Governor"" program, Christie claimed that ""on the state level, we spend less today than Jon Corzine spent in fiscal year 2008, five years later.""

The governor is correct in that the fiscal year 2013 budget is nearly $2 billion less than the level of state spending under Corzine in fiscal year 2008. But Christie’s claim ignores the fact that state spending has still increased during his tenure.

That means the governor’s statement ""is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That meets our definition of Mostly True.

80% of people who apply for medical marijuana don’t have qualifying ailments, Patrick Kennedy says
","When former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-.R.I., launched a national group in January that opposes marijuana legalization, he also took issue with medical-marijuana laws that he says may have been well-intended but are misguided.

And he questioned whether many of those who get permission to use marijuana for medical reasons are using it for legitimate reasons.

""Eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma,"" Kennedy said in a Jan. 8 story  in The Providence Journal. ""They have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana.""

(Kennedy’s group, Project SAM, which stands for Smart Approaches to Marijuana, argues that medical marijuana should only be used in non-smoked forms. )

Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use, although it is still illegal under federal law.

In addition to cancer and glaucoma, among conditions approved for medical marijuana use are HIV/AIDS, severe or chronic pain, persistent nausea and multiple sclerosis.

We decided to examine both parts of Kennedy’s statement, beginning with the specific ailments people cite when seeking permission to use medical marijuana.

Kennedy’s group referred us to Kevin A. Sabet, a professor and drug policy institute director at the University of Florida, who is a former Obama administration adviser on drug policy and a co-founder of Project SAM. He guided us to statistical links on the  Project SAM website and e-mailed some figures related to medical marijuana programs in Colorado.

The most recent Colorado data, as of Nov. 30, 2012, showed 3 percent of that state’s roughly 107,000 medical-marijuana patients reported having cancer and 1 percent had glaucoma, while Parkinson’s was not listed as a specific reportable condition. Ninety-four percent reported severe pain as their condition or one of their conditions.

We checked with other states and found similar figures.

In most states, including Colorado, medical marijuana patients reported more than one condition.

In Arizona, where medical marijuana became legal in 2010, just under 4 percent of its 33,600 medical marijuana cardholders reported having cancer while 1.5 percent reported glaucoma. By far the most reported condition as of Nov. 7, 2012, was chronic pain at 90 percent.

Nevada, one of the earlier states to legalize marijuana for medical use, adopting it in 2001, showed cancer cases were about 3.6 percent of reported conditions -- and glaucoma just under 2 percent, as of Jan. 8, 2013. Severe pain was overwhelmingly the number-one condition, hovering at more than 3,200 patients monthly.The total number of patients with medical-marijuana cards in Nevada, fluctuates; as of Jan. 8, it was 3,580. In Rhode Island, where medical marijuana became legal in 2009, 5.9 percent percent of those who received approval in 2010 cited cancer or cancer treatment, according to the Department of Health.

Four percent of those getting approval in 2012 reported cancer. Glaucoma accounted for about 1 percent in both years while Parkinson’s is not listed as a separate qualifying diagnosis.  

Rhode Island, which has 4,860 people approved to use medical marijuana in its program, lists a wider range of diagnoses than several states we examined.

Forty-four percent of Rhode Island patients cited ""severe debilitating chronic pain"" in 2012; 17 percent reported muscle spasms and 11 percent reported severe nausea.

So the first part of Kennedy’s statement is right: Only a very small percentage of medical marijuana users cited cancer or glaucoma as their reason for using the drug; states we checked do not specifically list Parkinson’s, indicating few cite that ailment.

What about the second part of the statement, that 80 percent of the people using medical marijuana ""have nothing you would associate"" with it?

Sabet, from Project SAM, said Kennedy didn’t mean that the 80 percent have no legitimate reason to use the drug.

But we think that most readers would understand that statement to mean 80 percent didn’t have an ailment generally associated with medical marijuana use.

The facts show otherwise.

As our research found, chronic pain, severe pain or severe debilitating chronic pain -- the most common conditions medical marijuana users cite -- are among several conditions or diagnoses listed by states as qualifying reasons for using, contingent on whatever standard a state requires applicant and physician to meet.

The states with medical-marijuana laws require some form of sign-off from a physician on an application.

Dr. Syed Rizvi, a neurologist at Rhode Island Hospital and associate professor at Brown University, said the patients he has approved for medical marijuana have included those with multiple sclerosis, are extremely disabled, maybe in extreme pain, and may not have responded well to other medications.  He said he limits it to patients he has seen for some time, even years. Dr. Josiah D. Rich, a professor of medicine and community health at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School, said in his experience and from what he knows of other physicians, there are other legitimate conditions than those Kennedy cited that are legal in states for medical marijuana.

""Some of my patients who have AIDS  … get very nauseous with the medicines they take,"" and therefore are approved to use medical marijuana, Dr. Rich said.

Our ruling

Former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy said that ""eighty percent of those who have applied for licenses have no cancer, no Parkinson’s disease or glaucoma"" and that ""they have nothing you would associate [with] the use of medical marijuana.""

Kennedy is right about the comparatively small percentage of medical-marijuana patients who use it for the conditions he named.

But he is wrong that most of those using the drug do so for conditions not associated with it. In fact, states with medical marijuana laws allow use for chronic and severe pain -- the most common conditions cited by patients.

Does everyone who has permission to use medical marijuana actually have a true medical need for it? We don’t know, but neither does Kennedy.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Animals', 'Rhode Island', 'Science', 'Central Falls Police Department']","
Central Falls, R.I. animal control says one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in just five years
","We love cats. They sit on your lap. They purr. They play with yarn. We tease them with laser pointers. Who knew the males of the species were lean, mean reproductive machines?

That's what we learned from a Jan. 28 news release from the Central Falls Police Department that announced a $30,000 animal control grant intended to help low-income pet owners keep the cat population down through spaying and neutering.

""Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in just five years,"" the release says.

Usually, when we see a statement we'd like to check, we ask, ""Is that true?""

In this case we asked, ""Is that even possible?""

We rushed to our calculator.

Five years is 1,827 days (counting leap years).

The typical number of kittens in a litter is four.

That means the male cat would have to find and successfully inseminate 57 females per day to create that many kittens over five years.

""He would be a very busy boy,"" joked Central Falls police Capt. Steven Bradley, listed as the contact person on the news release, after we told him what the numbers revealed. ""Maybe he's got a line on some good catnip.""

And steroids!

So clearly the math shows the statement is wrong.

Bradley said the statistic came from Rita Falaguerra of Cat Adoption Team Services, which secured the grant.

Falaguerra said she stands by the statistic because it came from the state veterinarian, Peter Belinsky.

Belinsky said she may have seen it as a pamphlet posted in his examination room which said 400,000 cats could come from one pair of cats over seven years under ideal conditions.

""I might have quoted it, but that was a long time ago,"" he said, acknowledging that he was not sure if the widely-cited number was true.

We found the questionable factoid (or differing versions of it) repeated on many pet-lover websites, such as the Pet Health Network, the ASPCA, and in the mainstream media. (The Journal repeated it on Jan. 29 and a day earlier on its website.)

Most often, the claims involve the reproduction potential of female cats, not male. The amount of time deemed necessary varies from five to seven years, depending on who is talking.

So what's the real story?

Belinsky also cited a 1993 article published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Like many similar claims, it offers numbers based on raw mathematical population growth and does not factor real life into the equation.

It said that if all the cats remain healthy and get enough nutrition, with no premature deaths, and each female produces eight kittens per year, it’s theoretically possible that 174,760 cats could descend from a single female after seven years.

That statistic is also quoted frequently. But it assumes that females are only fertile for one year. If all the females remain fertile indefinitely, the paper says, there would be 781,250 cats after seven years.

We checked the calculations. They turned out to be off. It would take eight years, not seven, to reach either number.

After five years, the timeframe we're looking at, the cat population would be 2,729 if female fertility lasted one year and 6,249 if all the females remained fertile. That's a far cry -- or should we say meow -- from 420,000.

Belinsky said even those lower numbers are unrealistic, especially when you're talking about cats in the wild.

""You've got predation, you've got toxins, you’ve got infectious disease, and they don't live more than a year or two in the wild, so this would be under ideal conditions,"" Belinsky said.

A more reasonable estimate for feral cats, he said, would be roughly 1.8 surviving cats for every female per year. At that rate, we calculated, you would have perhaps 49 cats alive after five years.

As it turns out, the 420,000 statistic has been debunked in articles going back a few years. The Wall Street Journal shot it down in 2006. The San Francisco Chronicle did so in 2010.

Where does it come from? The website HumaneWatch.org says it found the Humane Society of the United States using it in a news release in 1989. Whatever the source, the fallacious feline factoid has nine lives -- if not more -- among pet enthusiasts.

""That's the craziness of all these quotes,"" said Belinsky. ""They're not derived from actually following the animals in the wild or under a controlled experiment. They just extrapolate based on math and best guess.""

Our ruling

Central Falls police, citing a cat adoption service, said, ""Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in five years.""

In the real world, that's impossible.

The idea that one female cat and her succeeding generations could produce that many cats in half a decade is just as ridiculous.

There are overwhelmingly good reasons to have a cat spayed or neutered.

Trying to prevent a single male cat from producing more than 400,000 offspring in five years isn't one of them.

We rate this cat stat Pants on Fire!

"['Agriculture', 'Oregon', 'Federal Budget', 'Earl Blumenauer']","
Rep. Earl Blumenauer says cutting direct subsidies to farmers would save $28.4 billion over 10 years
","With Congress’ tendency to sidestep the really difficult questions on spending and deficits, even old statements remain relevant and worthy of examination. That’s what happens when the country is governed in two-month increments.

So once again Congress is sweating mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts called ""the sequester"" unless they are able to intervene between now and March 1. And yes, the matter was supposed to be settled. It remains because Congress enacted only a temporary fix. So for PolitiFact fact checkers everywhere, we express our bemused but sincere thanks for the budgetary gift that keeps on giving.

It’s also the reason a statement Rep. Earl Blumenauer made in December is still relevant as Congress looks at ways to avoid $109 billion in automatic spending cuts that begin in March.

""This is why I've worked to end the wasteful direct payment farm subsidy program that funnels payments to large corporate agribusinesses.  This action could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years that could be used to reduce the deficit,"" the Oregon Democrat said in a Dec. 21, 2012, news release.

That’s a lot of money at a time when Congress is desperate for big numbers.

But is the number real? Let’s take a look.

Trimming back or totally eliminating farm subsidies is one of the most popular ideas for cutting federal spending.

President Barack Obama called for eliminating them in 2011, at a savings of $5 billion a year. Blumenauer has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the payments that provide  federal dollars to recipients. The payments pour forth, according to the taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, ""regardless of current crop prices, and there’s not even a requirement these crops actually be grown on the land receiving payments.""

It’s time to change, Blumenauer says, especially now when farm incomes are near record highs and the blunt, inefficient nature of the subsidies qualifies even rich ""city slickers"" such as investment CEO Charles Schwab for payments. It’s not isolated. Five hundred fifty-one people with Portland addresses collected farm subsidies totaling $2.8 million in 2010, the Environmental Working Group found using federal records.

Those recipients are part of an agriculture ""safety net"" erected in 1996 that, in this case, provides payments to farmers (both genuine and hobby) who raise wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The Congressional Budget Office calculated that ending those subsidies would save $28.4 billion over 10 years. Blumenauer wants that money diverted from what he says are stable and profitable companies to paying down the nation’s $1.1 trillion deficit.

The politics are jumbled since legislation that would trim direct payments passed the Senate last year but never came to a vote in the House. But the number is solid. It was generated by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of then-Rep. (and now Sen.) Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who introduced legislation in 2011 to eliminate direct payments to farmers.

If you need help breaking the code, direct payments are federal payments made to qualifying producers ""paid at a set rate every year regardless of conditions.""
           
The merits of the program can be debated and the politics will remain tangled. But just as farmers return to the field every spring and seeds sprout into crops by summer, Blumenauer’s numbers are certain and correct. For that reason, we are this claim: True.

"['Immigration', 'Population', 'Texas', 'Texas Federation of Republican Women']","
Republican group says 9 million to 50 million illegal immigrants live in United States
","
A Texas group urging congressional action on immigration also says the number of illegal U.S. residents might vary more than five-fold.

The Texas Federation of Republican Women, which describes itself as the state’s most powerful women’s political group, said in its Jan. 17, 2013, resolution: ""Within the United States, there currently reside between nine (9) and fifty (50) million undocumented residents from all cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and nationalities.""

That’s some range. The 9 million figure undershoots a widely bandied estimate of 11 million, most recently included in December 2012 news accounts from USA Today and the Associated Press. The 50 million figure seems off the charts.

And the full statement indicates that 3 percent to 16 percent of more than 315 million U.S. residents are here illegally.

To our inquiries, a federation spokeswoman, Laura Sorrell of Austin, said the group drew its figures from different sources. She said by email that the group had no source to provide for the 9 million figure, while the 50 million figure was provided by a former fellow with Rice University’s James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, Joan Neuhaus Schaan.

 The 50 million methodology

By phone, Schaan told us she reached her estimate, which she said she has not laid out in a research presentation, by assuming that annual apprehensions of border crossers represent about 10 percent of actual crossers, an assumption she said she based on years of speaking engagements, including many in the Texas-Mexico border region.

Border region ""landowners, local law enforcement, those living the reality of human migration, would say that maybe 3 percent of those people that crossed were being apprehended,"" Schaan said. ""In some cases, thousands of people a week are crossing properties with virtually no apprehensions.""

Schaan was referring to apprehensions by the Border Patrol, part of the Department of Homeland Security, which reported in July 2011 that the number of apprehensions declined 61 percent from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 463,000 in 2010, with the vast majority of them occurring along the southwest border near Mexico. The 2010 total was the lowest level since 1972; peaks in apprehensions, of early 1.7 million, were reached in 1986 and 2000, it says.

Yet the report cautions against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. ""Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals,"" it says. ""The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown.""

Other estimates

To take our own look, we turned to several oft-quoted sources, each one lately suggesting there are 11 million to 13 million illegal U.S. residents.

According to a March 2012 Department of Homeland Security report, there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, about the same number as in 2010, and a little more than half of the 22 million legal foreign-born residents in the country.

Some history: The United States was home to up to 4 million illegal residents in 1980, the report says, with the number peaking at 11.8 million in 2007.

The report, drawing from U.S. Census Bureau household surveys and Homeland Security figures, says some 55 percent of the unauthorized residents entered the country between 1995 and 2004, with entrants since 2005 accounting for 14 percent of the illegal 2011 residents.

""It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007,"" the report says, ""given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement.""

The report says 59 percent of the country’s unauthorized immigrants in 2011, some 6.8 million, were from Mexico, with 2.8 million living in California, 1.8 million in Texas.

More recently, the Pew Hispanic Center said in December 2012 that 11.1 million unauthorized residents lived in the country as of March 2011, ""unchanged from the previous two years and a continuation of the sharp decline in this population since its peak in 2007,"" the center said, when the number of illegal immigrants in the United States peaked at 12 million.

Both Homeland Security and the Pew center devised their estimates by drawing on the census surveys and applying a ""residual"" method of calculation. ""Under this methodology,"" Pew wrote, ""a demographic estimate of the legal foreign-born population — naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, temporary legal residents and refugees — is subtracted from the total foreign-born population. The remainder, or residual, is the source of population estimates and characteristics of unauthorized immigrants.""

The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said it took a similar approach to conclude in an August 2012 report that there were 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010, though it said that after adjustments of undercounting of the population by the U.S, Census Bureau the total could have been 11.5 million or more.

Most ""research indicates that roughly 10 percent of illegals are not counted in Census Bureau surveys,"" the report says, meaning the ""true size of the illegal population could be 11.5 million. If the undercount is larger, then the total illegal alien population is larger.""

By email, the center’s research director, Steve Camarota, said there could be 13 million illegal residents in the country. He said, though, that he doesn’t see how administrative records such as births or school enrollments would justify any conclusion that such estimates are off by huge margins.

""There is uncertainty in the numbers,"" Camarota said. ""But not that big.""

We also touched base with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says its mission is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. A spokesman, Jack Martin, said by phone that the group has taken up the estimates by Homeland Security, the Pew Hispanic Center and the Center for Immigration Studies and made adjustments for what it believes to be some untallied residents. He said FAIR believes there are 11.9 million illegal residents.

Weaknesses in 50 million figure

We asked Martin for his thoughts on the topmost figure in the Texas group’s resolution, 50 million.

He said there is no logical basis for such an elevated estimate, though similar errors were made in the past when observers incorrectly counted each government apprehension of an illegal immigrant as an immigrant — even if the same person was apprehended by authorities a dozen times in a matter of weeks or over a year. Worse, he said, some observers erred by adding each year’s apprehensions to the tally for each subsequent year, inaccurately describing the ballooning total as a count of illegal immigrants in the country at that time.

Similarly, Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, said it’s a mistake to convert the number of Border Patrol apprehensions into a count of individuals living in the country.

Aside from noting the same weakness identified by Martin, Passel said by phone that given that most apprehensions involve men, relating total apprehensions to the number of illegal residents in the country would erroneously signal that Mexico is overrun with women alone. Also not factored in, Passel said, is the fact that many illegal residents travel, staying in the U.S. for a few months at a time or less.

Schaan’s methodology ""has no validity,"" Passel said.

Finally, Martin also sounded a general cautionary note about pinning down the number of illegal residents. ""Any estimate is simply an estimate,"" he said.

Schaan stuck by her figure, emailing: ""Clearly we have a difference of opinion on the approximate number, and any research group will be compelled to support their own positions and downplay anything different. There is no question in my mind the 11 million to 13 million figure is low, but there is no way to prove it one way or the other.""

Sorrell, of the federation, told us by email that the point of its resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are.

Our ruling

The federation said there are 9 million to 50 million illegal U.S. residents.

At a glance, that’s almost certainly right, though one could similarly say there are zero to 100 million. Too vast a range is misleading.

It’s also fair to concede that no one knows the precise number of illegal residents. However, accepted estimates, tied to household surveys and other research, suggest that the likely range tops out at 12 million or so, only one quarter of the federation’s unsupported top-end 50 million figure.

"['Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says $56 car registration fee in Virginia would still be ""equal or lower"" than most states
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell’s plan to expand revenues for transportation includes a $15 increase in the state’s car registration fee.

""Right now, $41 is our average registration. This will change it to $56,"" McDonnell said at a Jan. 8 news conference.  ""This registration fee, even at an average $56, still puts us at a rate equal to or lower than most states in the country.""

We asked the governor’s office to back up McDonnell’s claim that, even with the 37 percent increase, Virginia’s registration fee would compare equally or favorably to most states.

Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said it’s difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison of how Virginia’s registration fee measures up to other states, because of differences among the states in how the those fees are assessed.

""However, when looking at the common vehicle fees that most states use, such as vehicle license fees (registration), title fees and title taxes (sales tax), Virginia is clearly one of the lowest in our region of the country even with the proposed $15 increase,"" Caldwell said in an e-mail.

When comparing just registration fees, Caldwell said, Virginia’s proposed new fee would still be lower than states such as Maryland, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oklahoma and Vermont.

We note that McDonnell’s statement compared registration fees to ""most states"" in the U.S. -- not one region or group of states. The governor’s statement also specifically focused on the $41 average registration fee for a passenger car -- a standard registration cost that doesn’t include the expense of getting a title or paying the sales tax.

Given the narrow focus of McDonnell’s statement, we looked at how Virginia’s basic registration fee -- assessed annually at $40.75 for vehicles up to 4,000 pounds -- would compare to other states if it were increased by $15.

As Caldwell wrote, it is difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison among all 50 states. While Virginia and 25 other states levy a uniform registration fee for cars up to a certain weight, other states use an assortment of calculations that consider factors such as a vehicle’s horsepower, selling price, weight and the year it was first registered.

We examined a list of registration fees from the National Conference of State Legislatures and one compiled by the American Automobile Association.

The lists show 28 other states have registration fees that are lower than the $56 annual charge McDonnell seeks for Virginia. These states either had a set rate that is lower than the proposed new fee in Virginia, or a formula that put the maximum charge for a 4,000-pound vehicles below $56.

By contrast, only seven states would have higher registration fees than Virginia -- the six Caldwell mentioned in his email and Hawaii.

We couldn’t come to a conclusion on how Virginia’s proposed new fee would compare to 14 other states because of variables in their formulas for computing registration costs. For example, New Jersey’s fee ranges from $35.50 to $84 based on the age and weight of the car. South Dakota’s fees range from $30 to $92, again based on how old the car is and how much it weighs while Louisiana’s registration ranges from $20 to $82 based on a vehicle’s selling price.

Our ruling

McDonnell said that if his proposed $56 car registration fee is approved, Virginia’s annual registration costs would still be ""equal to or lower than"" most states. The governor’s office, when asked, offers no proof to this claim.

Information from AAA and the National Conference of State Legislatures shows the governor is wrong. Under McDonnell’s plan, Virginia’s registration would be higher than 28 states and lower than seven. The 14 other states have variables in their formulas for computing car registration fees that could result in charges that are higher or lower than the $56 McDonnell has proposed.

The bottom line is that Virginia would have a higher car registration fee than most states. McDonnell’s claim has no basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants of Fire.",/factchecks/2013/feb/01/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-56-car-registration-fee-virginia-wo/
"['National', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Wayne LaPierre']","
Wayne LaPierre of NRA says “fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years”
","
During a closely watched Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun policy on Jan. 31, 2013, National Rifle Association executive director Wayne LaPierre offered several statistics designed to bolster his group’s position against gun control.
   
Here’s one claim that caught our eye:
   
""Teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works, and the NRA has a long and proud history of doing exactly that,"" LaPierre said. ""Our Eddie Eagle Child Safety Program has taught 25 million young people that if they see a gun, they should do four things: stop, don't touch it, leave the area, and call an adult. As a result of this and other private-sector programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years.""
       
Let’s take a look at two parts of LaPierre’s comment -- the numerical claim that accidental shooting deaths have declined, and the question of whether NRA safety programs made a difference.

Are ""fatal firearms accidents … at the lowest level in 100 years""?

To check this part of the claim, we turned to a massive compendium of data produced annually by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit, congressionally chartered organization. The group issues an annual report that includes a category called ""unintentional injury deaths"" -- with data going all the way back to 1903.
   
The most recent version of the ""Injury Facts"" report available on the Internet is the 2011 edition, with data up to 2009. But we were able to obtain draft data from the council that offers preliminary data for as recently as 2011 (numbers that the group says are subject to refinement).
   
According to council data, the total number of unintentional deaths from firearms sank to 554 in 2009 -- easily the lowest of any year back to 1903.
   
In fact, it took from 1903 all the way until 1997 for the number of unintentional gunfire deaths to drop below 1,000. The all-time highs came in 1929 and 1930, when the number of such deaths reached 3,200 for two consecutive years.
   
This decline is all the more striking considering the increase in population over this period. In 1904, there were 3.4 unintentional firearm deaths per 100,000 people. By 2009, that rate had fallen to 0.2 deaths per 100,000 in people.
   
However, the data for unintentional gun deaths ticked up modestly in 2010, to 606, and then fell slightly to 600 in 2011.
   
So LaPierre was very close to correct -- 2009 represented a record low, but the number was slightly higher in both 2010 and 2011, at least according to preliminary data.
   
Did safety education programs by the National Rifle Association and other groups help reduce accidental gun deaths?

In a 2004 paper in the journal Pediatrics, researchers studied two child-safety programs, including the NRA’s Eddie Eagle. They concluded that Eddie Eagle was ""effective for teaching children to reproduce verbally the gun-safety message … but the skills were not used when the children were assessed via real-life"" situations. (Separately, gun-control advocates have complained that the Eddie Eagle program, whatever its safety benefits, helps recruit new generations of children into the NRA’s approach to guns.)

However, the study should be taken with a grain of salt: Pediatrics is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group that, at the time the paper was published, was on record supporting ""regulation of the manufacture, sale, purchase, ownership, and use of firearms; a ban on handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons; and expanded regulations of handguns for civilian use."" (The group reaffirmed that position in 2012.)

We did not hear back from the NRA for this story, but several independent experts said they feel the NRA programs and others like it probably did help contribute to the decline in accidental gun deaths.

""I taught my children these same principles when they were very young so they had a way to evaluate the situation,"" said Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. ""If the gun safety course teaches those principles, then it has to have had an effect.""

Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida, agreed that such programs probably made a difference.

""Overall, I believe the NRA should be commended for its firearm safety programs,"" Corzine said. ""It is a certain that they have prevented some accidental shootings and deaths.""

That said, Corzine cautioned against giving Eddie Eagle too much credit for the drop. Corzine pointed to a 2002 study in the journal Homicide Studies that suggested an entirely different rationale for the drop: improved medical care, particularly for trauma victims. The authors of that study wrote that ""we have garnered considerable support for the hypothesis that advances in emergency medical care have greatly and increasingly reduced the lethality of violent assaults.""

In an interview, Billie Weiss, an epidemiologist at the UCLA School of Public Health, pointed to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., as an example of the advances in medical treatment. Giffords was shot in the head at a public gathering in January 2011. While she still faces a difficult road to recovery, Giffords survived the shooting. ""Ten years ago, she most certainly would not have lived after her injury,"" Weiss said.

To factor out improvements in trauma care, Corzine said it’s better to use a different data set than the one LaPierre used. Rather than focusing on accidental deaths from gunfire, Corzine said, look at accidental injuries from gunfire instead.

The National Safety Council’s annual report doesn’t include such data, but the CDC makes it available. We found that unintentional gunfire injuries have also been declining -- by about 20 percent between 2001 and 2010. That’s somewhat slower than the decline in unintentional gunfire deaths over the same period, which was 24 percent. But it’s not dramatically different. (As with the figures for unintentional gunfire deaths, the number for unintentional gunfire injuries ticked up slightly in 2011.)

What may be more relevant is that the incidents LaPierre cited -- unintentional deaths from gunfire -- only amounted to about 600 cases in 2010, compared to 14,161 cases of unintentional gunshot injuries that didn’t lead to death. In addition, there were 53,738 gunshot injuries caused by intentional assault in that year and another 4,643 non-fatal gunshot injuries caused by suicide attempts.

In other words, the roughly 600 unintentional gunshot deaths LaPierre cited in his testimony accounts for only a tiny proportion of all gun-related deaths and injuries -- less than half of one percent, to be precise.

Indeed, just looking at gunfire deaths, the trend lines for unintentional and intentional fatalities have been moving in opposite directions. Back in 1968, intentional gunfire deaths outpaced unintentional deaths by a ratio of 10 to 1. By 2009, that gap had expanded significantly, with intentional deaths exceeding unintentional deaths by a factor of more than 50 to 1.
   
So while LaPierre worded his statistic carefully and in a way that was very close to accurate, he chose to focus on a tiny subset of gun-related harm while ignoring the vast majority of gun-related deaths.
   
Our ruling
   
LaPierre was very close to being right about his carefully framed statistic: Despite significant population growth, unintentional firearms deaths fell to a 106-year low in 2009 before tracking up slightly in 2010. But while LaPierre is probably right that NRA-sponsored safety programs played a role in this decline, improvements in trauma care -- something LaPierre didn’t cite -- likely played as big a role as well, if not a bigger role. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/feb/01/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-nra-says-fatal-firearms-accidents-a/

Rep. Marcy Kaptur says states have slashed funding for mental health services
","
As funerals proceeded for the 20 first-graders and six school employees massacred on Dec. 14, by a gunman at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, members of Congress including Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur took to the House of Representatives floor to decry the violence.

Kaptur’s speech highlighted cuts in mental health funding during the recession, while urging a ""more constructive federal role in assuring proper and early diagnosis and intervention of affected youth and appropriate treatment.""

During her speech, Kaptur said that ""states have cumultatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century.""

PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the numbers.

Kaptur specifically cited the National Alliance on Mental Illness during her speech as a source of information. Her spokesman said she was citing data from a report the mental health advocacy group released in March 2011, after a paranoid schizophrenic gunman shot then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others in a supermarket parking lot outside Tucson, Ariz. The report observed that ""the public often focuses on mental illness only when high visibility tragedies of the magnitude of Tucson or Virginia Tech occur.""

""Between 2009 and 2011, states cumulatively cut more than $1.8 billion from their budgets for services for children and adults living with mental illness,"" it continued. The report said that cuts during that period kept thousands of Ohioans with serious mental illness from accessing care in their communities, resulting in their living on the streets, or ending up in more expensive settings like jails and hospitals.

The NAMI report stressed that people living with mental illness are, on the whole, no more violent than the rest of the population and are more frequently the victims of violence than perpetrators of violent acts. But it said the ""risks of violence among a small subset of individuals may increase when appropriate treatment and supports are not available.""

In an email, NAMI spokesman Bob Carolla noted the 2011 report that Kaptur cited was based on funding information available from states at the time the report was issued. The National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors subsequently determined that total cuts were much higher than the figures cited in the NAMI report - $4.35 billion between 2009 and 2012.

""The economic downturn has forced state budgets to cut approximately $4.35 billion in public mental health spending over the 2009-2012 period – the largest combined reduction since de-institutionalization,"" says a March 2012 report from the mental health program directors group.

A year-by-year breakdown in that report says that $1.22 billion in was cut in FY 2009 in the 39 states that provided statistics to the organization; that $1.02 billion was cut in FY 2010 by 38 states, that $1.27 billion was cut in FY 2011 by 36 states, and $842 million was cut in FY 2012 by 31 states.

Carolla said his organization accepts the accuracy of the mental health program directors group’s figures. He noted that de-institutionalization, which shifted mental health care from institutions like mental hospitals to community-based settings, ""is generally considered to have begun with the passage of legislation under President Kennedy in 1963 - 50 years ago."" That coincides with the half-century timeline cited in Kaptur’s speech.

When asked for details on the comparison of current cuts with those that happened when de-institutionalization occurred, representatives of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors said their funding statistics go back only 30 years. While they believe the statement about the cuts’ scope is probably correct, they can’t precisely compare the deinstitutionalization era’s budgetary cuts with today’s numbers.

""It is by far the biggest cut in 30 years, but before that, the data doesn’t exist in a format where I can look at it and say it is apples to apples,"" says Ted Lutterman, the director of research analysis for the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. He said he did not provide the information on deinstitutionalization that Kaptur cited, and said that someone else must have inserted that tidbit into the group’s report.

Robert Glover, who heads the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research, also could not provide details on the half-century figure that Kaptur cited, though he said the recent budget cuts are the largest he’s seen during his 40 years in the profession. He calls the $4.35 billion statistic that his group uses  ""very conservative"" because it omits numbers from several states that didn’t provide the group with their budget figures. He observed that mental health needs rise when financial problems fester in a sour economy and that mental health service cuts make it harder for those with difficulties to get the help they need.

Glover says Ohio has provided a bright spot amid the cuts, developing programs designed to integrate mental health care with physical health care.

""There are pockets of restoration in some states,"" Glover said.

Ohio Department of Mental Health Communications Director Trudy Sharp said her organization’s general revenue budget went down by $67 million between the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, then increased by $20 million in the 2011 fiscal year. She said her department trimmed its central office staff by 20 percent since 2008, and also shuttered three of the state’s nine psychiatric hospitals. Facilities in Cambridge, Cleveland and Dayton were closed and their beds absorbed by other hospitals, she said. Additionally, she said Ohio is consolidating its Department of Mental Health with its Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction services, and trying to stretch its mental health dollars by encouraging regional planning approaches between counties.

So where does all this leave Kaptur’s statement?

Kaptur accurately cited statistics about mental health budget cuts from a National Alliance on Mental Illness report. Those numbers appear to have downplayed the extent of cuts. But, her claim that ""over $1.8 billion"" was cut between 2009 and 2011 is accurate because the cuts surely exceeded $1.8 billion.

Her contention that the cuts mark the ""largest reduction in state mental health services in half a century,"" is harder to prove.

She based her statement on information in a report produced by an often-cited authority on state mental health funding. While representatives of the group said they believe that statement is accurate, they acknowledged they didn’t have state funding numbers going back 50 years to document that assertion.

That’s a point of clarification.

Common Core opponents say its goal is for the federal government to instill religious and political beliefs
","If reading about how Common Core aims to establish the same standards across states in reading and math makes you yawn, consider some of the more controversial subjects in which the feds want to tell your children what to think, say Common Core opponents. ""The Common Core standards, along with the aligned curriculum and the mining of nearly 400 data points reveal that the goal of the standards is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs,"" states a report on the website of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition. Here, we will fact-check whether Common Core includes the federal government dictating what students should think about politics and religion. Report that makes claims about Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts. President Barack Obama's administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks  -- though local school districts can still choose to do so. Common Core is about standards: the knowledge and skills students are required to have in each grade, from kindergarten through high school, not the curriculum schools use to teach those standards.   Florida’s Next Generation Sunshine State Standards include general information about the U.S. political system. It also includes the world's major religions in the World History section. All curriculum decisions are made locally by schools boards, schools and teachers, according to the state Department of Education. We read nothing in the standards that suggested that any level of government was telling students what political or religious beliefs they should personally hold. So what evidence do the critics have for saying the Common Core will instill political and religious beliefs? The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition cited a report written by Education Liberty Watch. The co-authors were Dr. Karen Effrem, President of Education Liberty Watch in Minnesota and a co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, and Randy Osborne, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of several conservative candidates and causes, including the Florida marriage amendment. The report zeroes in on something called the National Education Data Model, which lists hundreds of data elements. The report linked to a screen grab it created of those data elements. The list shown includes ""voting status"" and ""religious consideration"" and ""religious affiliation."" (It also includes far more mundane elements such as a student’s birthdate, address and race.) These are elements that districts could choose to collect on any individual in the district: students, parents or teachers. We could not find the same list of attributes on the NEDM website, but we shared it with officials involved with NEDM and they didn’t dispute it. But there are some major caveats about this list of data elements. First, this is not a required list of data for all states or school districts to collect. Instead, it is a voluntary model that states can use to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. That means states or districts could choose to use some of the data elements and not others, or ignore the data model entirely. Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said. Buckley said that federal officials did not come up with these potential elements out of thin air -- they were chosen because certain school districts or states had sought that particular data element in the past. ""Remember this is all voluntary,"" Buckley said. ""If your state already collects this, or has a reason why it collects it, (then we tell them) ‘here is how we recommend you code it’ so everyone doesn’t invent their own code for religions.’"" We interviewed Alexander Jackl, chief architect Choice Solutions, Inc., an education data software company and one of the original authors of the National Education Data Model. Jackl is also a member of a working group about the newer version -- the Common Education Data Standards, or CEDS. The data fields for religion in particular are useful for private, religious schools, he said. Those fields ""are in the NEDM conceptual model as possible attributes,"" Jackl told PolitiFact in an email. ""This makes sense as parochial schools and religious universities might make use of NEDM as well and those elements would be useful for them. It looks, though, like they were not carried forward into CEDS."" We contacted a few school districts in Florida to ask if they collect data on voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliations, or if they plan to start doing that with Common Core. Here’s the response we received from a spokesman for Miami-Dade schools: ""No. No. No. And no."" Broward, Hillsborough and Pasco schools also don’t collect that data. ""I can’t think of any useful or legitimate educational reason to know that information,"" said Linda Cobbe, Pasco schools spokeswoman. The Florida Department of Education does not require school districts to ask about voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliation and has no plan to do so under Common Core, department spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said. Fears have become widespread Claims that Common Core will lead to collecting data about students religious or political beliefs have been repeated by conservative pundits. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order in May to prohibit the state from collecting certain information about students and their families, including religious and political affiliation and voting history. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Michigan house. In response to questions from parents, the Arizona state superintendent of public instruction distributed a fact-sheet that states: ""Will the system track a family's political affiliations or firearms ownership? Absolutely not."" Also, there is a clear difference between a state or a school district choosing to ask students about their voting status or religious affiliation and, as the report suggests, and using Common Core as a way to ""instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs."" Effrem sent us an email arguing that the Common Core standards are intended ""to teach and instill non-cognitive/psychological/socioemotional attitudes."" She cited an example of a lesson in Utah in which ""students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about"" and a middle school in Florida that apparently took a Junior Scholastic quiz called ""what kind of party animal are you?"" But nothing we saw in Effrem’s email proved that as a result of Common Core the federal government is trying to instill particular religious or political beliefs in students. Additionally, we found nothing in either of the data models to suggest that the federal government is telling students what political or religious beliefs they should hold. For public schools, it wouldn’t be constitutional, anyway. Our ruling The goal of Common Core ""is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs,"" said an anti-Common Core group. Their evidence, though, is flimsy at best: A computer model that has a data field for voting status or religion, which would typically be used by a private school. We could find no public schools that kept such data, and Florida Department of Education has no plans to require that they do. That’s a far cry from attempting to instill particular religious or political beliefs.

Teachers were not involved in developing the Common Core State Standards, say Common Core opponents
","As Florida surges toward full implementation of the Common Core State Standards, the din is rising from some fronts to pull back. Gov. Rick Scott, whose tea party base offers perhaps the most strident opposition, is listening. In public forums that Scott requested, several critics stepped forward to denounce the Common Core, offering a variety of reasons that range from ""federal intrusion"" to ""data collection."" One oft-repeated claim was that ""teachers were not involved"" in creating the standards that they will have to use in their classrooms. Karen Effrem, co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, pointed to an article from the libertarian Heartland Institute that detailed how the Common Core writers were not classroom teachers. The initial work groups did not include many K-12 educators, either, according to lists provided. ""Although teachers were allowed to submit comments as the standards were developed, there is no indication that these comments were actually reviewed and incorporated into the final product because only a summary was released to the public,"" Effrem’s group stated in its Common Core analysis. The criticism had become so prevalent that the Common Core State Standards Initiative, the official organization that organizes the standards, has included it in its ""Myths v. Facts"" document. The organization flatly rejects that teachers played no meaningful role: ""The Common Core State Standards drafting process relied on teachers and standards experts from across the country."" There’s plenty of evidence to back that claim. Just ask the participants. Both major national teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, note on their websites and in other communications that they joined the Common Core partnership and had teacher members on several review panels. The AFT provided dozens of teachers to the development and review effort, president Randi Weingarten said. The organizing groups, including the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, ""came to us … and asked for teachers to review this,"" Weingarten said. ""In some instances we had extensive revisions and said, if you don’t do these revisions, teachers will not support this."" Their involvement started before even the earliest drafts, she said, and continues today with the development of lessons and curriculum resources. ""Teachers were involved,"" Weingarten said. Becky Pittard, a Volusia County elementary math teacher, served on the K-5 math work team of the standards development group. She said she was puzzled by any suggestion that teachers had no voice in the process. ""If they say we were not involved, that is not telling the truth,"" said Pittard, a 22-year veteran educator who has taken a leave from her classroom to help train Florida teachers for the transition to the new standards. Pittard related how she and other teachers worked closely with the primary writers, corresponding via email and working online to improve and correct the draft proposals. ""I can tell you the equal sign standard is there because I insisted,"" she said, referring to a first-grade guideline on understanding the meaning of the symbol. ""That was my ‘you have to have that’ standard. There was impact."" University of Arizona professor William McCallum, one of the math standards writers, confirmed Pittard’s recollection. Organizers also brought teams of practicing teachers by grade levels to meet with the writers. He called their feedback ""detailed, intensive, and influential."" ""The standards went out for two or three rounds of review to the 48 states who had signed on to the initiative. These states were really our clients, and we paid close attention to their comments,"" McCallum said via email. ""Many states assembled teams of teachers to review our work."" Florida did. Deputy chancellor Mary Jane Tappen sent a confidential email to selected teachers in November 2009 expressly for that purpose. ""You are receiving this email because you are a trusted and respected expert in your field,"" Tappen wrote. ""Florida must provide input on this very first drafty draft of the Common Core National Standards by December 4. … I will be collecting and compiling all our work into one Florida response."" When seeking additional input in March 2010, Achieve -- the group helping to organize the Common Core effort -- received comments from 223 teachers, as well as 69 parents. Our ruling Common Core opponents claimed at a public hearing that teachers were not involved in the creation and development of the standards, or that their comments and feedback weren’t used.

Claim doesn't pass examination
","CNN host Don Lemon and commentator Larry Elder made for some entertaining television recently when they sparred over how small-business owners feel about the health care law. ""Seventy-four percent of small-business people believe that Obamacare is a bad idea,"" Elder, a prominent Los Angeles-based conservative talk show host, said during a segment on CNN. ""Larry, that’s not true,"" Lemon replied. ""That’s not true."" ""What’s not true?"" Elder asked. ""Many people wanted it to be stronger when it came to single-payer,"" Lemon said. ""It all depends on the way you ask the question."" The two men talked over each other for a few seconds before Elder repeated his initial point. ""I said 74 percent of the small-business people don’t like Obamacare,"" Elder said. So, we wondered, do nearly three-quarters of small-business owners dislike the health care law? We wondered whether Elder’s statement is correct because the host debated the accuracy of Elder’s claim. Elder’s executive producer sent us a Washington Examiner article that he used to base his claim. The article’s headline said ""74 percent of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare."" The article was based on a survey done this past summer by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The survey was done online, with 1,304 respondents who had an executive-level position in a company with less than 500 employees and annual revenue less than $25 million. About one-third of the respondents were U.S. Chamber of Commerce members. The survey, done by Harris Interactive, was said to be weighted to represent the nation’s small-business population. Most of the survey’s respondents were worried about the health care law’s employer mandate that businesses with 50 or more employees must provide insurance for those workers or face a fine. The Obama administration announced July 2 that it was delaying the mandate until 2015. Still, those who answered the survey were overwhelmingly concerned about the impact of the mandate on their businesses. Twenty-seven percent of them said they would cut hours to reduce the number of full-time employees on their payrolls, 24 percent would reduce hiring and 23 percent plan to replace full-time employees (30 hours per week or more) with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. Combined, that’s 74 percent who said they would find ways to avoid the employer mandate. That’s not exactly the same as saying they believe the entire health care law is a bad idea, as Elder said on CNN. This is not the first time someone has used this report to criticize the health care law. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., repeatedly claimed ""75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours"" because of the controversial law. PolitiFact and The Washington Post found some flaws with the survey. First, while the survey was said to have a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, it was not a random survey and such margins of error apply only to random samples from a population. Second, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been highly critical of the health care law and has called for it to be repealed, so an online survey in which one-third of the respondents are members may not have been the most scientific approach. Third, and most disturbing, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce acknowledged that only a small percentage of the businesses surveyed said they would be affected by the employer mandate. ""A Chamber spokeswoman, who declined to be identified, acknowledged that only 17 percent of the businesses surveyed said they would be affected by the employer mandate,"" the Post reported. ""Put another way, the poll found that 83 percent of small businesses surveyed said they would not be affected by an employer mandate that the Chamber of Commerce has said is a burden on small businesses. Harris and the Chamber highlighted the answers of only those affected by the employer mandate."" PolitiFact rated Rubio’s claim a Pants On Fire! Elder said he was unaware of the criticism of the poll. ""I read the methodology, the period of time when the poll was conducted, how it was conducted. Seemed legit,"" Elder said via email. Elder said he still believes the poll accurately reflects the feelings of small-business owners concerning the health care law. ""When collectively 74 percent -- I know this number is in dispute -- say it will negatively affect hiring decisions, it is not a stretch to conclude that they deem the law a ‘bad’ one,"" Elder said. PolitiFact Georgia looked for additional independent polling of small-business owners concerning the health care law. We found there isn’t much out there. In May, a Gallup poll found 48 percent of respondents believe the law will be bad for business, 9 percent said it would be good for their company and 39 percent said it will have no impact. Gallup conducted telephone interviews with 603 people whose businesses had less than $20 million in annual revenue. A poll by Rasmussen Reports done in October found this breakdown among people who describe themselves as entrepreneurs concerning their impressions of the health care law: Very Unfavorable:        49 percent Somewhat Unfavorable:    6 percent Very Favorable:        16 percent Somewhat Favorable:     27 percent Not Sure:            1 percent We note that the poll does not provide more details about these entrepreneurs, such as whether they are self-employed or how many employees they have. To sum up, Elder claimed ""74 percent of small-business people believe that Obamacare is a bad idea."" There is no independent polling that supports his argument. The numbers that Elder used to base his claim were in response to a different question. Also, the poll that Elder relied on to make his claim is deeply flawed. Still, Elder believes the combined 74 percent of respondents in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce poll who say the health care law may impact future hiring reflects their feelings about Obamacare. Elder may have a point, but there is no concrete evidence that supports his argument. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/21/larry-elder/claim-doesnt-pass-examination/

Common Core means the government is collecting 300 data elements about students, says anti-Common Core activist
","Tapping into concerns about privacy, some opponents of Common Core have portrayed the new educational standards as a tool by the government to spy on children and store data on them. And they aren’t talking about a few test scores here -- but a big ol’ heap of data on every student. ""There are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you,"" said Tim Curtis, an activist with the tea party group 9/12, at a meeting in Tampa about Common Core on Oct. 15. That sounds like a massive amount of data for the government to collect on every child and their families. We decided to engage in a little data mining of our own: what type and amount of information will the government collect on students and their families, and is because of Common Core? Data collection with or without Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Obama administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks -- though local school districts can still choose to do so. Curtis told us that when he said the ""government"" will collect data he meant the school district as well as the state and federal education departments. ""In order for Common Core to work its supposed magic, all of this information is going to have to be consolidated at the federal level,"" Curtis told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. ""Only then will they be able to compare state-to-state across the board."" Many Common Core opponents, including in Florida, point to the National Education Data Model to argue that Common Core will lead the government to collect hundreds of data elements on students. But that data model is just that -- a voluntary model that states can use for guidance about how to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said. Buckley said he never counted the data elements in the National Education Data Model but that 400 is probably accurate. Since 2011, the focus has been on a different model called Common Education Data Standards which has over 1,000 elements, Buckley said. (Florida does not even use the National Education Data Model and has its own version called PK20 data warehouse.) ""For whatever reason a lot of Common Core opponents seized upon this as if it has anything to do with Common Core, which it doesn’t,"" he said. We contacted a few school districts in Florida, including Broward and Hillsborough counties, to ask about their plans for data collection. Officials told us no additional data would be collected because of Common Core. We also found multiple education experts who disagreed with Curtis’ claim, including from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Foundation. The bottom line: States have been collecting data on students -- and sharing it in aggregate with the U.S. Education Department -- long before Common Core. And that doesn’t change because of Common Core. School districts collect students’ names, the classes in which they are enrolled, their reading and math proficiency and whether they graduated on time, said Paige Kowalski, director of state policy and advocacy for the Data Quality Campaign, a national advocacy organization. States collect the data to help them make decisions -- for example about tests. The U.S. Education Department can only access aggregate data -- for example, what percentage of third-graders in Florida are proficient in reading -- not the test scores of a particular third-grader. That means school districts don’t send student names and other personal details to the federal government. In fact, laws predating Common Core prohibit a federal database of personally identifiable information on students. ""Absolutely nothing has changed in terms of what the state is collecting from districts as a result of adopting Common Core standards and implementing them,"" Kowalski said. Here’s what is different under Common Core: If Florida and another state both adopt the same standards and assessments, then the tests will provide an apples-to-apples comparison between two states. For decades, Florida has required school districts to implement a system that contains student information. And today that list of data is long -- some of it is required by the state, while other elements are optional, or only kept at the local level such as bus stop number. That list of data includes students’ race, whether they are homeless, test scores, attendance and many more factors. However, ""There is no increased data collection specifically linked to Common Core,"" said Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, a point repeated in the state’s fact sheet. ""Florida has no plans to change the data it collects that is linked to Common Core."" Iris scans and Common Core We told Curtis that educational experts said that Common Core doesn’t require new data collection. ""I can shoot that claim down with a single explanation,"" Curtis said. ""The Polk County school district began to do iris screening on school children and they did so without notifying their parents. They did so as a result of the beginning of the implementation of Common Core."" According to the Florida Department of Education, the screening was intended to route children onto the proper bus. It didn’t have anything to do with Common Core. ""Polk County was piloting a new school bus safety program for students that involved eye scanning, which had nothing to do with the new standards. Permission slips were mistakenly not sent out,"" the department said. Our ruling Tim Curtis, an activist against Common Core, said that thanks to Common Core, ""There are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you."" Common Core State Standards do not include new requirements for the government to collect data on school children. It’s true that school districts and the state of Florida already collect a long list of data on students.

In Obamacare, Congress must buy insurance from marketplaces but president and his administration keep ""gold-plated"" coverage, Rep. Sean Duffy says
","U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) flashed what appeared to be a self-satisfied smile after his televised quarrel with longtime Washington journalist Andrea Mitchell over the government shutdown and Obamacare. The MSNBC interview on Oct. 8, 2013 occurred one week after health insurance exchanges, now known as marketplaces, opened under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Those marketplaces were created to offer health insurance to individuals who don’t have coverage from employers and who may be eligible for government subsidies to help pay for the coverage. Duffy’s tussle with Mitchell earned him kudos from conservatives and sparked coverage by news outlets in Wisconsin, as well as by Politico, the Huffington Post, Rush Limbaugh and other national media. He argued that if the health care law is so good, Obama and members his administration should have to buy their insurance from the marketplaces just like members of Congress. ""Why won't he join us in Obamacare?"" Duffy said of the president, before making a reference to the first lady and the president's press secretary. ""Why wasn't Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for Obamacare, or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan."" ""So do you,"" Mitchell interjected. ""No. I’m not.  I'm in Obamacare, I’m in Obamacare, Andrea; all members of Congress are, and my family,"" Duffy replied. ""The president should join us in Obamacare and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should be all be treated equally under the law. Why should members of Congress be in Obamacare and not the president? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair? Can you defend that? Can you defend why the president shouldn’t be in Obamacare like members of Congress and their staffs?"" Duffy essentially repeated his claim Oct. 16, 2013 on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" show. Is Duffy right that members of Congress are required to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, while Obama and his staff can keep their ""their own gold-plated health care plan""? Congress So many people have said Congress is exempt from Obamacare that in September 2013, PolitiFact National made the claim, rated False, one of its top 16 myths about the health care law. For many years, members of Congress chose from a variety of insurance plans offered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which serves 8 million federal and retired workers and their dependents. So, members of Congress were like most Americans, covered through their employer with the employer picking up most of the tab. That will end in January 2014, when lawmakers and some of their staff will be required under the health care law to pick from plans in the health care law’s new marketplaces. They are the only Americans facing this requirement, although Uncle Sam will still continue to pick up most of the cost. (Factcheck.org and The Washington Post Fact Checker have also debunked the Congress-is-exempt claim.) The requirement for Congress became part of the law after Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in 2009 offered an amendment that required lawmakers to get their health care through the marketplaces. A version of the amendment was adopted. So, Duffy is correct on the first part of his claim, that members of Congress must, under the Affordable Care Act, purchase insurance through the law's marketplaces. President Obama and members of his administration and their families will continue to get their health insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. But it's not ""their own"" plan, as Duffy claimed; it's the same plan that covers millions of other federal employees. In other words, they will be like most Americans who get their health insurance through an employer -- nothing will change. In fact, despite Duffy's reference to ""the rest of America"" joining Congress in the marketplace, the vast majority of Americans will continue to be covered through employers, not purchasing insurance from the marketplaces. Rather than being ""gold-plated,"" the federal health insurance is roughly comparable to what members of Congress will be able to buy in the marketplaces, according to three health care reform experts we consulted: Timothy Jost, law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.; professor Sabrina Corlette of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms; and Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""It’s a good plan,"" Tanner said of the federal health insurance, ""but it’s roughly the equivalent"" of choices available in the marketplaces. Plans available in the marketplace range from ""bronze,"" which has the lowest premiums and pays 60 percent of the total medical costs of everyone in the plan, to ""platinum,"" which has the highest premiums and pays 90 percent. (A fifth category, ""catastrophic,"" is available to people under 30 years old and to some people with very low incomes.) Members of Congress, however, are required under the health care law to choose from among 112 ""gold-level"" plans, which pay 80 percent of the total costs. By way of comparison, the most common plan chosen in the program offered to all other federal employees is a Blue Cross plan, which pays closer to 90 percent. Our rating Duffy said: All members of Congress are required to be in Obamacare, but Obama and members of his administration ""have their own gold-plated health care plans that they're in."" Members of Congress will have to buy their health insurance from marketplaces created as part of the health reform law, while the president and members of his administration can keep the coverage they get from the federal government. But the federal offerings are roughly comparable to what Congress can buy in the marketplaces, not vastly superior. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, Duffy gets a Half True.

"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Milly Silva']","
Milly Silva claims property taxes have climbed 20 percent under Chris Christie
","Chris Christie can cite numerous accomplishments during his time as New Jersey’s governor, but it’s one achievement in particular that has caught Milly Silva’s attention. Silva, the lieutenant governor candidate on the Democratic slate challenging Christie in the Nov. 5 election, cited the Republican governor’s ‘achievement’ on Oct. 7 while speaking at an American Legion in Little Ferry. ""Property taxes have increased 20 percent under four years of Chris Christie,"" Silva said. That’s some hike, and while Silva is correct that property taxes have gone up under Christie, it’s not quite as much as she claims. To begin, let’s review how action in Trenton can impact property tax bills. Although a governor is not directly responsible for increasing a community’s property taxes, what he does to a state budget can impact what property owners pay. In Christie’s case, he has cut aid in numerous areas to help balance the state budget. As the governor has noted on numerous occasions, he came into office in 2010 and had to deal quickly with a multibillion-dollar deficit. The gap was the result of factors from steep drops in state revenue during the recession (December 2007 to June 2009) to spending by previous administrations, experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey. To deal with the deficit, Christie cut education funding and numerous other line items in the budget, skipped a pension contribution and overhauled tax relief programs -- such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. Some New Jersey lawmakers -- including Assemblyman John McKeon, an Essex County Democrat -- have said the reduction in rebates led to a 20 percent increase in property taxes. Officials with the state Department of Community Affairs have rejected the idea that property taxes have climbed 20 percent. In the case of the EITC, for example, taxpayers now get a credit directly on their tax bill instead of the old practice, when the state sent rebate checks to taxpayers. Still, the original purpose of that check was for tax relief. Earlier this year the online news site NJ Spotlight released a study showing that the net property tax increase during Christie’s first three years in office was approximately 18.5 percent. The net increase is the actual cost of property taxes for the average New Jerseyan after rebates are deducted. Citing data from the state Department of Community Affairs, NJ Spotlight noted that net property taxes in New Jersey rose from $6,244 in 2009 to $7,405 in 2012. Other organizations have cited similar figures. But a DCA spokeswoman told us that property taxes have not climbed 20 percent under Christie. She also pointed to the results of a cap the governor implemented in July 2010 that limits property tax growth to 2 percent annually, unless local voters approve exceeding the cap. ""Actually, average increases were less in the last three years than in the thirty years prior averaging approximately 2% each year and nothing close to 20%,"" spokeswoman Tammori Petty said in an e-mail. ""Some communities even saw tax decreases depending on local leadership. These record low increases are far less than 20% real increase that did exist in previous administrations."" An Associated Press report last month reviewed DCA figures, tax levies and tax relief programs, finding that the actual property tax burden during Christie’s first three years in office increased 13 percent -- not 20 percent. The AP said it used records from 2006 to 2012 on statewide property tax levies and all the state's property tax relief programs to calculate the average net property tax bill. It also noted that some of the numbers used in the calculations came from 2012 estimates provided by the state Treasury Department rather than final numbers. David Turner, spokesman for Buono’s campaign, cited the NJ Spotlight report as well as a Star-Ledger editorial that agreed with the study’s figures. ""It is undeniable that when property owners look at their bills they have seen a 20 percent increase under Governor Christie,"" Turner said in an e-mail. ""His talk is cheap but tax policies are expensive for working and middle class families."" Kevin Roberts, spokesman for Christie’s gubernatorial campaign, said Silva should instead review the fiscal actions of her running mate, noting that state Sen. Barbara Buono has voted for 154 tax and fee increases. The Truth-O-Meter in May rated that claim True. Our ruling Silva said, ""Property taxes have increased 20 percent under four years of Chris Christie."" The state DCA points to Christie’s property tax cap as reining in taxes during his tenure, without mentioning the impact of tax relief programs that have been reduced greatly in the past few years. But reduced or eliminated tax rebates means taxpayers generally have to pony up more money to pay their tax burdens. But a number of organizations have pointed to previous DCA figures showing a net property tax increase of nearly 20 percent. An Associated Press report said the actual increase for the first three years of Christie’s gubernatorial tenure has been 13 percent, considering a variety of factors -- including estimates, rather than final numbers, for 2012. Given the disparity between NJ Spotlight’s and the AP’s figures, and factoring in past Truth-O-Meter fact-checks on this topic, it’s clear the increase isn’t as high as 20 percent, but it doesn’t appear to be as low as 13 percent. Silva is right that property taxes have increased under Christie, but it’s not as much as she said. As a result, we rate her claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Mary Burke says Wisconsin second to last in business formation
","In her first extended TV interview, gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke downplayed the notion that Wisconsin’s tax climate is a roadblock to job growth that has lagged behind the national average. ""We have to make sure we’re competitive with other states, but I’m not sure that’s a major factor,"" the Madison Democrat said Oct. 13, 2013 on WISN-TV’s Upfront with Mike Gousha show. ""Companies look at qualified work force, being able to attract people to Wisconsin, the quality of life, the schools."" One key to job growth, the former Trek Bicycle executive said, is to boost Wisconsin’s track record of developing new businesses. ""Entrepreneurship is incredibly important to growing economies, and we’re 49th in the United States in new businesses created,"" Burke said. ""So we have to make sure we’re supporting people starting their businesses, growing them and having the capital to do that."" Is Wisconsin that close to scraping the bottom on business startups? It’s a particularly interesting question since Republican Gov. Scott Walker is emphasizing that more than 11,000 new business entities have formed since he took office in January 2011. That increase in net new formations, a 3 percent rise, is a positive economic sign but doesn’t say much about startups and new job creation because many of the new businesses are limited partnerships set up for legal or liability reasons and don’t employ anyone. That’s what we found in our recent Walk-O-Meter evaluation  of Walker’s promise to create 10,000 new jobs. Digging into Burke’s numbers To back up her claim, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to a study conducted annually by the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation. The foundation’s study, which is widely cited and known as the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, uses U.S. Census data to capture the number of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. The 2013 study, based on 2012 data, found that Wisconsin had the third-lowest number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people. It was ahead of only Nebraska and Minnesota, equivalent to a ranking of 48th. So Burke was very close to the mark based on the study. And Wisconsin’s recent history shows a similar performance -- rankings of 40, 49, 28 and 48 in the Kauffman Index from 2011 to 2008. Notably, back in 2000, only two states had better numbers than Wisconsin. ""Entrepreneurial activity rates follow strong geographical patterns,"" the 2013 study said. ""Entrepreneurial activity generally is highest in Western and Southern states and lowest in Midwestern and Northeastern states."" We should note that the Kauffman Foundation warns that its study isn’t meant to provide a precise ranking of states. But its report in effect does that by reporting precise ratings and singling out states in the top five highest and lowest groups. To expand the picture, we spoke to Kauffman spokeswoman Barb Pruitt and two academic experts with deep experience in researching the rate of business startups. All agreed that the Kauffman index is just one way to measure entrepreneurship, and has some significant limitations. For instance, it counts a lot of part-time self-employed people who by definition don’t employ anyone else. Kauffman, it turns out, funds the U.S. Census Bureau program that produces a separate set of statistics that tally openings and closings at businesses with paid employees. The data is collected from business-registry statistics and employer payrolls. This data sheds more light on entrepreneurial activity, we were told by two leading researchers in this area, Scott Shane, professor of entrepreneurial studies and economics at Case Western Reserve University, and Zoltan Acs, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy at George Mason University. Ian Hathaway, an economic advisor to Engine, a research and policy group for technology startups, analyzed 2011 data on openings and closings. He pointed us to a number that illustrates new business formation rate in each state. The results were identical to the Kauffman index report: Wisconsin was ahead of only two states. The same was true in 2010. An important note: Because of a time lag in Census reporting, the March 2011 snapshot is the latest available. That only covers a few months of Walker’s term. We asked Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, about Wisconsin’s track record on startups. ""It’s an imperfect science but most indicators would confirm that Wisconsin ranks among the bottom 10 states for net company creation,"" Still said. ""That may be explained, in part, because the recession started later in Wisconsin and ended later here, as well."" Still said he’s optimistic the climate here is changing, but he added that future economic trends and public policy decisions on helping foster growth in startup-firms will play a big role. Finally, we found that Wisconsin looks better on a third measure: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on the net number of ""business establishments"" in each state. In 2011, Wisconsin ranked 19th on its percentage increase over the year before, according to research by Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a private firm that tracks labor-market trends. But EMSI and other experts say the BLS figures don’t reflect just new businesses; establishments can refer to new outlets or locations that existing businesses open up, for instance. Our rating In a discussion of how she would be different than Walker, Burke’s claim was that Wisconsin is ""49th in the United States in new businesses created."" Both the study she cited, as well as data seen as a better indicator of startup activity, put Wisconsin at 48th, not 49th. The data is somewhat dated, covering only part of Walker’s time, but is the latest available. With those clarifications, we rate her claim Mostly True.

Activist says local police will have access to Obamacare database with private medical records and financial information
","Part of the campaign to thwart the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, has involved discouraging people from signing up for health insurance, available for small businesses and individuals through federal and state marketplaces. One group behind the push is Generation Opportunity, which created the ads showing ""Creepy Uncle Sam"" poised to play doctor. Its president, Evan Feinberg, warned in an Oct. 1 commentary in The Providence Journal that people who sign up will become part of the Federal Data Services Hub, ""an enormous database of every participant’s private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information."" ""Local law enforcement, insurance companies, and innumerable federal agencies and low-level bureaucrats will have access to the Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info,"" he said. It's not surprising that some of these people would have access to the data. After all, low-level bureaucrats are processing the application and you are, after all, buying insurance from an insurance company. But the part about local law enforcement caught our eye. Would signing up for Obamacare really give our local police the ability to know how much money we make, the terms of our divorce and when our Viagra prescription is due for refill? PolitiFact National examined an element of the question last May when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., received a Pants On Fire for saying the IRS is going to be ""in charge"" of ""a huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans’ ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest secrets."" PolitiFact found that the IRS isn't in charge and it's not a health care database. The hub pulls limited data from other agencies to verify eligibility and determine how much an individual will actually pay for an insurance plan on the exchanges. For example, the Social Security Administration is asked to verify a person's Social Security number. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is asked to verify immigration status. The IRS confirms financial data to see if a person is eligible for a subsidy. It's the same system that allows Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program ""to query the government databases used today in the eligibility processes for many state and federal programs,"" said Brian Cook, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. What kind of data does it collect? Rhode Island's marketplace, HealthSource RI, sent us a copy of the application form. It asks for a lot of financial information that, one would think, the data hub should be able to simply get from the IRS, such as how much money applicants have earned from investments, a pension or Social Security, or how much they are paying in alimony or student loans. (A shorter application is available for people who are not seeking a tax break to pay for their coverage.) The system doesn't ask for -- and the database doesn't collect -- a person's medical records. The only medical information sought is whether an applicant is blind, disabled and, if pregnant, the due date. The only legal history information is a question about whether applicants are in jail and, if so, when they expect to be released. So the ""treasure trove"" of information isn't as rich as Feinberg asserts. (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services even insists that it's not a database, but we'll leave that for another fact check.) But the key question is whether local law enforcement would have access to the information. When we contacted Feinberg's office to ask for the source of that claim, spokesman David Pasch sent us to a section of the Federal Register that gives the government the right to release information to ""any state or local governmental agency ... that has the authority to investigate potential fraud, waste or abuse"" so such cases can be prosecuted. The federal rules do not give local law enforcement unfettered access to the database. When we raised the issue with Pasch, he acknowledged that the regulations didn't say that local police would have free access to the database and argued that Feinberg ""did not say all contractors could look at whatever they want, whenever they want."" We disagree. Saying that law enforcement will have access to a ""treasure trove"" of personal information suggests that police would have broad access to that information, not just basic facts that the government would give to law enforcement to conduct a fraud investigation. Patti Unruh, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said, ""Local law enforcement would only receive access to personally identifiable information after submitting a specific request for such information to CMS and after CMS rigorously evaluated the request for information to ensure that it is legally permissible and is reasonably necessary to investigate, prosecute or combat fraud, waste or abuse."" Our ruling Evan Feinberg of Generation Opportunity said,  ""Local law enforcement ... will have access to the Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info"" in a database with ""private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information."" Not only is he making a huge stretch when he says the treasure trove includes private medical records and legal history -- with financial data, not so much -- he is stretching further to suggest that local police will have anything close to routine access to the data in the Hub. Thus, the contention that signing up for Obamacare will allow a prying police chief to view your latest mammogram is False.

Louie Gohmert says deficit ballooned from $160 billion to $1.6 trillion in just one year
","One day before the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate acted to end a 16-day government shutdown, Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, appeared on Fox News to discuss the gridlock in Washington over spending and debt. Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Gohmert whether he thought the effort to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law -- even to the point of closing the government and risking a default -- was ""nonetheless worth pushing for."" Gohmert answered by referencing a group of children who had appeared at an earlier event with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""We have stolen from those children,"" Gohmert said in the Oct. 15, 2013, interview. ""We went from $160 billion deficit spending in (President George W.) Bush's last year to $1.6 trillion the following year."" When we checked Gohmert’s math, we found some problems. (His office did not respond to an inquiry.) • Using the historical federal budget figures provided by the Office of Management and Budget, we found a year in which the deficit was a little over $160 billion -- but it was fiscal year 2007, which ran from Oct. 1, 2006, to Sept. 30, 2007. That was a year and four months before Bush left office, so it’s not correct to call this the deficit from ""Bush’s last year."" Using the 2007 figure makes Bush’s record less profligate, since 2008 was the first full year of the Great Recession, and the weak economy helped push the deficit for fiscal year 2008 quite a bit higher, to $459 billion. • The annual deficit never actually hit the $1.6 trillion level Gohmert cited. It topped out at $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009. Responsibility for that fiscal year was split between Bush and Obama, though the exact parceling of responsibility is knotty due to a number of unusual expenditures that were made to combat the financial crisis and which owe a portion of their existence to actions by both presidents. (See a full discussion of this debate here and here.) • Gohmert was also incorrect when he said the big increase in the deficit occurred within the span of one year. The rise from $160 billion to $1.4 trillion took place over two years -- fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2009. This is not to say Gohmert doesn’t have a point. The deficit did go up significantly between the end of Bush’s tenure and the beginning of Obama’s. However, it’s worth remembering that the increase had a lot to do with the timing of when the Great Recession hit, and the contrast in ""blame"" for the deficit isn’t as clear. It’s a stretch to suggest Bush had little role and give all the responsibility all to Obama. In addition, the scale of the increase isn’t as big as Gohmert said it was. His claim on Fox News suggested that the deficit had increased tenfold in the space of just one year. The actual increase was about threefold over the course of one year -- a major bump, but one-third of what Gohmert suggested. Our ruling Gohmert said, ""We went from $160 billion deficit spending in (President George W.) Bush's last year to $1.6 trillion the following year."" It’s true that the deficit did go up significantly between the end of Bush’s presidency and Obama’s, but Gohmert erred in most of the key numbers of his talking point, and he oversimplified the question of which president is at fault for the rising deficits.

Rep. Mulvaney says Obama gave 1,100 special waivers to Obamacare to his friends
","On the last morning of the government shutdown and debt ceiling standoff, the conservative lawmakers who took the hardest line in the showdown stood firm even as they faced defeat. One of them, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said it was all worthwhile given the principle at stake. Asked on CBS News what that principle was, Mulvaney said it was about fairness under Obamacare. ""Our question, for the last three weeks, has been, ‘Why is it not evenly applied across all the citizens?’ "" Mulvaney said. The president, he said, ""has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends. Now he gave it most recently to large corporations. All we have been asking for the last two and a half weeks is that those same exemptions apply to our families."" Here, we’ll examine whether President Barack Obama ""has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends."" This is a claim that Mulvaney’s political allies have made several times. Groups such as the Christian Coalition have circulated it, although the exact number sometimes varies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said ""almost 1,100 waivers."" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said it was over 1,200. We reached out to Mulvaney’s office to get the details but didn’t hear back. Our research took us (as well as our fact checking colleagues at the Washington Post) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The waivers in question have to do with private insurance plans that cost very little but cap the total amount they will pay at less than $1.25 million in a single year. The limits can be considerably less. There are plans that don’t pay more than $2,000 and even one that stops at $300. That threshold matters because one big thing the Affordable Care Act does is set minimum standards for health insurance -- including the elimination of annual caps by 2014. The law says there can be no limits, but it left it to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set rules for how to transition to that goal. Those rules said that as of 2011, every plan had to pay at least $1.25 million, and as of 2014, with very few exceptions, there could be no annual limits at all. But even putting the transition on a glide path created a potential dilemma, especially for large firms that hire many low-wage workers. Faced with having to improve their coverage quickly, there was a chance that many employers would instead drop the insurance altogether. To avoid leaving those workers with no insurance at all, HHS set up a way for companies and insurance plans to apply for waivers. Who got a waiver? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tallies who has been granted a waiver, and who applied but was denied. At last count, the total number of waivers was 1,231. So Mulvaney’s has actually undercounted somewhat. However, his use of the term ""friends"" is more questionable. Here is a sample of some of the recipients: Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina. Pepsi. The Wyoming Lodging and Restaurant Association. Goodwill Industries of Kentucky. Wendy’s. McDonald’s. The common denominator seems to be who these firms hire -- low-wage workers. If ""friendship"" played a role, it’s hard to discern. And it’s not clear that these are major political allies of the president, either. On the other hand, some unions -- which usually lean Democratic -- were on the list as well. We found about 450 plans that serve union workers -- roughly a third of the total. That said, 144 groups were denied a waiver, and union plans were included on that list as well. Plans could reapply and some did. In general, if a plan reapplied, it then got a waiver. Unions show up a lot in this group, but some ultimately were turned down. We should also note that Mulvaney called these ""special waivers."" But by and large, whoever applied tended to get approved. That doesn’t seem particularly special to us. All of these waivers expire as of Jan. 1, 2014. Our ruling Mulvaney said that under Obamacare, the president ""has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends."" He’s close on the number, but it’s wrong to say that all (or even most) went to his ""friends"" or political allies. It’s also doubtful that any of these were ""special,"" since the option was widely publicized and mostly granted when applied for.

Damascus' disincorporation would produce ""NO significant tax savings?""
","For much of its nearly decade-long existence as a city, Damascus has been at war with itself. Even before voters in 2004 made Damascus Oregon’s first new city in 22 years, battle lines were being drawn. On one side were those who contended that incorporation would be the best way to ensure a strong local voice given the Metro regional government’s 2002 decision to bring thousands of acres around Damascus inside the region’s urban growth boundary. On the other were those who liked the area’s rural nature and wanted it to be left alone. Infighting has continued ever since. Lawsuits, threatened recall campaigns, mass resignations from citizen advisory panels and simmering feuds among City Council members remain commonplace. Now, Damascus’ chances of thriving as a city may be dissolving. Voters on Nov. 5 will cast ballots on Measure 3-433. If more than half of the city’s registered voters say yes, the city of 10,700 will disincorporate. Passions are running high on both sides, with lawn signs favoring one camp or the other dotting the Clackamas County countryside. Mayor Steve Spinnett opposes disincorporation. He sides with property owners, such as himself, who think maintaining the city is the best way to ensure development of their land. Among the claims he made in a Voters’ Pamphlet statement against pulling the plug is that disincorporation will produce ""NO significant tax savings!"" Given that pocketbook issues such as property taxes and other fees typically play critical roles in local government decisions, PolitiFact Oregon decided to see whether that’s true. The county put out a fact sheet answering some of the many technical questions arising from Measure 3-433. On the question of what happens to property taxes if Damascus incorporates, the sheet states, ""There would be a net decrease."" That’s because, starting with next year’s tax statements, the city’s current rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of assessed value would disappear. Damascus residents now also pay an additional $2.40 per $1,000 of assessed value to cover the services they receive from Clackamas County. That brings their current total property tax rate to $5.50. With the median Clackamas County residence valued at just over $224,000, according to the assessor’s office, that equates to an annual property tax bill of $1,232. From there, things get a bit more complicated. Subtract the $3.10 from $5.50, and you get a tax rate of $2.40. Under disincorporation, that would rise by 24 percent to $2.98 per $1,000 of assessed value since the county has a higher base tax rate in unincorporated areas. But even at the $2.98 figure, ""former"" Damascus residents would still end up paying 46 percent less in property taxes than they would if they continue as a municipality. That $1,232 tax bill on the median house would drop to $667. Spinnett, in a telephone interview, acknowledged that property taxes will drop at least some if voters opt for disincorporation. ""Maybe it depends on your definition of the word significant,"" he said, referring to his Voters’ Pamphlet statement. ""But, yes, when city taxes go away, you’ll see a reduction in your property taxes."" But the analysis shouldn’t stop there, he said. Scrapping the city also means scrapping the handful of government-limiting features he and others fought to add to the City Charter. Those include a spending cap, no-new-tax provisions and a prohibition on city collection of the fees most cities charge to cover the cost of new development. Another 72 cents per $1,000 of assessed value could end up being tacked on, he said, if residents request annexation to the sheriff’s enhanced law enforcement district. Absent that, the County Board of Commissioners and the sheriff would need to evaluate how to respond to the loss of the $1 million a year the county now receives from Damascus for law enforcement services. Finally, he said, disincorporation would require the city to transfer its remaining cash and fixed assets to the county. Spinnett put those figures at $5.5 million and $2 million, respectively. ""You add all those together, and whatever savings people might see on their property taxes is going to be largely wiped out,"" Spinnett said. ""It’s a mixed bag, at best."" Spinnett is probably correct that Clackamas County may start imposing fees for some new development in the area, but those so-called system development charges -- paid by developers -- have nothing to do with property tax collections. And while remaining city assets would, by law, be turned over to the county, ""those are completely divorced from the tax rate,"" said Dan Chandler, the county strategic policy adviser who wrote the fact sheet. Last, although voters countywide may cast ballots sometime late next year on an increased vehicle registration fee for road maintenance, Clackamas County has shown considerable reluctance in recent years to approve anything resembling a new tax. Thus, it seems unlikely that a flood of countywide bonds, levies and local improvement districts would materialize. Simple math shows that if Damascus voters follow up their 2004 historic vote to incorporate with another historic vote to disincorporate, homeowners will see their property tax bills fall -- by 46 percent at the median level. That is a significant savings.",/factchecks/2013/oct/18/steve-spinnett/damascus-disincorporation-would-produce-no-signifi/

Cuccinelli says most new jobs have been part-time since Obamacare became law
","Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Obamacare has eroded the quality of jobs in the United States. ""Since the president signed it into law, in Virginia and around the country, most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs limited to less than 30 hours a week so employers can avoid the high cost of federally imposed health care bills,"" Cuccinelli said in a Sept. 19 speech.   Cuccinelli has sought to make his opposition of Obamacare and Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe’s support of the law a major issue in the gubernatorial race. Cuccinelli’s statement referred to an Obamacare mandate  -- scheduled to take effect in 2015 -- that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health care coverage to those working 30 hours or more a week or pay a fine. Obamacare became law in March 2010. We asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof that most of the jobs created since then have been part-time. Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, pointed us to a Sept. 2, 2013 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that said the number of temporary U.S. workers had risen by 2.7 million -- a 50 percent jump -- since the recession ended in June 2009. Those figures, however, don’t verify Cuccinelli’s claim that the majority of new jobs during the last 4-1/2 years have been part time. So we dug deeper. The Bureau of Labor Statistics each month reports the number of people who usually work full time and the number who usually work part time. It defines part-time employees as people who usually work less than 35 hours a week -- an even broader definition of part time than Cuccinelli cited. In March 2010, seasonally adjusted BLS figures show the U.S. had 111.2 million full-time workers. That rose to 116.2 million in  August 2013, the latest month for which figures were available when Cuccinelli made his statement. That’s an increase of about 5 million. The number of part-time jobs went from 27.5 million in March 2010 to just under 28 million in August 2013, an increase of about 500,000.   So, contrary to Cuccinelli’s claim, full-time jobs have grown 10 times faster than part-time employment since Obamacare was signed into law. Cuccinelli would have been on more solid ground if he had confined his statement to this year. From January through August, there were increases of 290,000 full-time jobs and 532,000 part-time positions. In other words, nearly two out of three new jobs this year have been part time. Many analysts think there’s a connection between Obamacare and the surge in part-time jobs this year, although they also say the sluggish economy has a role in the increase. The employer insurance mandate originally was scheduled to begin next year, causing hundreds of businesses to announce they are hiring only part-time workers or scaling back hours to avoid the cost of providing benefits required by Obamacare. The White House announced in July it would push back the employer mandate to 2015. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote in an Aug. 26 memo that the trend of part-time hiring might slacken now that the insurance requirement has been delayed. The Fed researchers wrote that Obamacare’s impact on part-time employment so far and in the future is ""likely to be small."" About 19 percent of U.S. jobs are now part time. The researchers said once Obamacare is fully implemented, the proportion of part-time jobs is likely to increase by 1 to 2 percent ""or less."" Mark Perry, a economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, recently cautioned against giving too much meaning to this year’s part-time employment numbers, writing that the data is ""extremely volatile"" in the short term and needs to be considered over time. A final note: Cuccinelli claimed that since the signing of Obamacare, most of the new jobs have been part time not only across the nation, but in Virginia as well. We spoke to several analysts while trying to research the state numbers. But there’s no set of monthly numbers that shows the increase in full-time and part-time jobs between the signing of the Affordable Care Act and the time when Cuccinelli made his statement. Our ruling Cuccinelli says that since President Barack Obama signed the health care law, most of the new jobs created in the country have been part time. He’s flat out wrong. BLS figures show that since the signing in March 2010, there are 5 million more full-time workers and 500,000 more part-time employees. Cuccinelli would have been on the putting for par if he’d aimed his statement at the first eight months of this year, when 65 percent of new jobs were part time, although analysts differ on Obamacare’s blame for that trend. But his shot at Obamacare since its inception wound up in the woods. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/18/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-most-new-jobs-have-been-part-time-/

Cats have holes drilled into their heads, undergo other procedures in UW-Madison experiments, PETA says
","Using a robo-call and a video, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned experiments on cats that are done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in an effort to improve hearing in humans. Yes, felines, as in your pet Fluffy. It turns out the UW has used domestic cats in such experiments for more than 30 years. PETA’s automated call, which doubles as the soundtrack for the video, was recorded by comedian and PETA activist Bill Maher. According to the animal rights group, the call went to more than 100,000 phone numbers on and near the UW-Madison campus on Oct. 8, 2013. That was several days before Maher did comedy shows in Madison and Milwaukee. On the call and in the video, which shows graphic images of cats being used in experiments at the UW, Maher says: ""On this very campus, dozens of live cats have holes drilled into their skulls, steel posts screwed to their heads and metal coils implanted in their eyes. Some cats have had their ears cut off. Others are intentionally deafened. Most of us find it hard to miss a single meal, but these cats are starved for up to six days straight for experimental sessions lasting for hours."" Stark allegations. UW-Madison responded the same day with a statement saying ""there is no factual basis"" for them. And yet, ""Many of the individual facts are true,"" veterinary school professor Eric Sandgren, director of the Research Animal Resources Center at UW-Madison, told us two days later. ""But the implication"" that the experiments amount to cruelty ""is not,"" he said. Let’s do some research of our own on the various parts of PETA’s claim. Why cats This item is not about whether researchers should use cats to try to improve hearing in humans; PETA opposes all use of animals in experiments. But here’s some of UW’s rationale for doing so: The design and improvement of hearing aids, as well as cochlear implants, which are surgically implanted devices that can help people with severe hearing loss, rely on the work of the UW cat research, Sandgren wrote on the UW website. The work is ""well-respected across the world and widely cited in the literature, with nearly 5,000 citations over the years. Thus, any medical advances in this area will use (the) work as a starting point."" The cat research is aimed at trying to understand how the brain works. It requires recording and studying a real functioning brain, which can't be ethically done in humans, according to UW. Cats are used because they have nervous system and auditory systems very similar to those in humans. The experiments help researchers understand how the brain integrates information from the two ears, UW says. This circuitry plays a major role in humans' ability to detect signals in the presence of background noise, which is the major symptom of elderly people with hearing loss. That in turn helps improve the design of hearing aids and cochlear implants. PETA’s Jeremy Beckham, who manages the group’s investigations of labs, told us that despite more than three decades of experiments on cats, UW ""has absolutely nothing to show for it"" and that experiments on humans are more ethical and have more potential to help improve hearing. PETA’s targeting of the cat experiments made news in February 2013. A staff member of the group and actor James Cromwell (Oscar nomination for ""Babe"") were arrested after bursting into a University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents meeting in Madison and shouting that the research is torture, not science. Seven months later, in September 2013, the federal Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, a part of the National Institutes of Health, filed a report after investigating allegations by PETA that the UW-Madison cat experiments violated policy on the humane care of lab animals. The office found no such violations, although it said UW needed to improve procedures for controlling infections. For this fact-check, we received information from PETA, including an internal protocol form completed by UW researchers outlining their cat experiments, which the group obtained through an open records request. We also obtained information from UW through an interview with professor Sandgren and an article he wrote; and responses the university made to the federal investigation. We’ll break the claim by PETA into its various parts, using some of the script Maher read from. ""Dozens of live cats have holes drilled into their skulls, steel posts screwed to their heads and metal coils implanted in their eyes"" PETA noted that in the protocol form, filed in 2008, UW said it had been using a total of about 30 cats per year. However, Sandgren said the form lists 30 as only the maximum of cats that might be used in experiments. As for the drill, post and coils procedure, it has been performed on 18 cats over the past 10 years. He said he believes 18 is the total number since the experiments began. In the procedure, according to UW, cats are ""deeply anesthetized"" for surgery, then a hole is drilled in the head in order to implant an electrode in the brain. A head-holding stainless steel post is implanted on the skull with 10 to 15 small titanium screws. Extremely thin Teflon-coated coils are implanted around the eyeball. The head posts are ""nearly identical to part of the ‘halo apparatus’ used in humans to keep the head from moving after a spine injury,"" Sandgren said in the article he wrote. The surgery is done to ""stabilize the head during experiments and monitor eye movements to measure the cats’ ability to localize sounds."" Because the coils are not placed in the eye or cornea, ""they are not likely painful to the animals. The procedure and technique has been utilized for many years in different species in labs around the world.""   So, PETA overstates the number of cats that have undergone the procedure but describes the procedure accurately. ""Some cats have had their ears cut off. Others are intentionally deafened."" Unlike the current experiments, in which cats can remain in the UW lab for a period of years, until roughly 2005 some experiments were done in which cats were euthanized before the experiments ended, Sandgren said. In those cases, the outer ears were removed so that more precise recordings could be done. PETA's Beckham told us contended that some of those cats lived for a few days after the procedure before being euthanized. As for intentional deafening, around 2008 or 2009, UW did a pilot study in which two cats were intentionally deafened with an antibiotic in order to explore whether bilateral cochlear implants provide more effective sound localization, and therefore better hearing, than single implants. The study did not produce significant results so it was not repeated, Sandgren said. Again, PETA is partially accurate on this part of its claim. In the past, parts of ears were cut off of cats who were then euthanized. But the deafening procedure is no longer done. ""These cats are starved for up to six days straight for experimental sessions lasting for  hours."" PETA cited a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in October 2012 by a former UW veterinarian who was involved in the cat experiments. He said that one reason cats were getting infections is their overall health suffered because of ""sporadic calorie deprivation."" Beckham, citing the UW’s protocol document, claimed some cats were completely deprived of food for up to six days. Sandgren told us cats would likely be unable to perform tasks for experiments and could die if they were completely denied food for up to six days. He said the cats are in fact given less food than they want, in an attempt to get them to perform tasks for their experiments -- which can last for several hours -- for which they are rewarded with food. He said the cats are regularly weighed and examined to ensure they are in good health. The federal investigation found that the seven cats being used in experiments at the time were in ""excellent clinical condition."" So, this part of PETA’s claim is overstated. Cats are given limited amounts of food during experiments, not starved for up to six days. Our rating PETA said: ""Live cats have holes drilled into their skulls,"" posts put into their heads and coils put into their eyes, and some have had their ears cut off or are intentionally deafened or starved at UW-Madison labs that do research to improve hearing in humans. Overall, some of the various parts of the statement were partially accurate, others were not. We rate the statement Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.  ",/factchecks/2013/oct/18/people-ethical-treatment-animals/cats-have-holes-drilled-their-heads-undergo-other-/

Johnson on target about health, productivity cost link
","A Georgia congressman’s defense of the hotly debated health care law brought some skepticism from one PolitiFact reader. ""By reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs,"" Johnson, a Democrat from DeKalb County, wrote in a letter to Daniel Patterson. Patterson forwarded the letter to PolitiFact Georgia. We hadn’t heard this claim before and decided to do some research. Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan said the numbers came from a study done by the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan, economic think tank with offices in Southern California and Washington, D.C. In October 2007, the institute released a widely reported study called ""An Unhealthy America: The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease."" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the study. The study’s first sentence highlighted the trouble. ""More than half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases,"" it read. The seven diseases the 240-page study focused on were cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, mental disorder, pulmonary conditions and strokes. In 2003, there were 162.2 million Americans who suffered from one or more of those conditions, the study found. The productivity losses associated with those seven diseases were about $1.1 trillion. In Georgia, the Milken Institute researchers wrote in their study that the economic impact was $32.8 billion, as Johnson said. The researchers found about 5 million cases of those conditions were reported by Georgians in 2003. Pulmonary conditions and hypertension were easily the highest number of diseases reported. The researchers created an index and determined Georgia had the 31st healthiest population in the country. The healthiest states were largely along or west of the Rocky Mountains. The least healthiest states were along the Eastern Seaboard and the South. Utah was the healthiest state, and West Virginia was the least healthy state. The researchers calculated the number of lost workdays by using data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey and matching all individuals who had a particular illness with the number of lost workdays in the last 12 months due to illness or injury. The next step they took was to multiply those days lost times wages per employee. Georgia’s total was 3 percent of the national cost. Georgia has about 3 percent of the nation’s population. We wondered since the study was based on 2003 figures how much the numbers have changed since then. Ross DeVol, the lead researcher, said no subsequent work had been done to determine what the total would be, but he guessed it would be greater today. ""I can say with great certainty that the number is much higher today,"" DeVol told PolitiFact Georgia via email.     Another report released in May, though, found lost productivity from various health problems was much less than the Milken Institute’s estimate. The report by Gallup-Healthways calculated the total at $84 billion a year. The conditions the Gallup-Healthways study described as chronic included asthma, cancer, depression, diabetes, heart attacks, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and various physical pains. The estimated cost for each worker per day was $341. The Gallup-Healthways report based its findings on interviews with 94,000 adults nationwide who worked more than 30 hours a week, asking them how many workdays they missed each month due to poor health. Phone interviews were conducted from January through September 2012. The majority responded they missed about one day every three months. Phelan, the congressman’s spokesman, said he had not seen the Gallup-Healthways report beforehand. Phelan said he would reference the Milken report in future correspondence with constituents. ""While both studies looked at lost productivity due to illnesses and disease, the Gallup study looks at it from the perspective of 14 job types for the entire nation while the Milken study looked at it from the standpoint of the illnesses and diseases people suffer and specifically at each state, including Georgia,"" Phelan said via email. There’s little additional research on this topic. The CDC looked at the economic impact of some conditions. ""In 2009, the economic costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke were estimated at $475.3 billion, including $313.8 billion in direct medical expenses and $161.5 billion in indirect costs ($39.1 billion in lost productivity due to sickness or disability and $122.4 billion in lost productivity due to premature death),"" the CDC found. The $122.4 billion in lost productivity is more than the Gallup-Healthways conclusion, and that estimate was for just strokes and cardiovascular diseases. A 2001 report from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found 2.5 billion workdays were lost a year due to chronic diseases ranging from cancer to arthritis to substance abuse. To sum up, Rep. Johnson said in a letter that ""by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs."" The congressman’s claim was based on accurate numbers from a Milken Institute study that appeared well-researched. We did find other research that differs from the Milken study. Johnson’s claim is based on accurate information, but there is a little context necessary to fully examine his statement. Under our rating system, Johnson gets a Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/18/hank-johnson/johnson-target-about-health-productivity-cost-link/

Sen. Ted Cruz says premiums have gone 'up and up and up' for 'virtually every person'
","A few hours before the Senate voted to end a 16-day government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, the lawmaker who played a leading role in precipitating the crisis, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke to reporters. Cruz’s mission had been to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law and, as he has from the start, Cruz listed the failings of the health care program. ""President Obama promised the American people Obamacare would lower your health insurance premiums,"" Cruz said. ""I would venture to say virtually every person across this country has seen exactly the opposite happen, has seen premiums going up and up and up."" We received many requests to check this statement and so we’ll examine whether Obamacare meant that ""virtually every person across this country ... has seen premiums going up and up and up."" Not for the entire insurance market The new health care law takes a private market system and gives it an overlay of government rules. The private market has two major sectors -- the group market and the non-group, often called the individual market. About 60 percent of Americans under the age of 65 get their insurance through their employers.That’s the group market, where insurance companies write policies that cover a lot of workers all at once. One critic of the new law, Robert Laszewski, a health insurance consultant and head of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, says the new health care law has had little impact on people who currently get their insurance through their work. ""In the large employer market where most under-65 folks are, the Obamacare increase is a very few percentage points, like 2 points,"" Laszewski said. Other experts we talked to echoed that point, without necessarily agreeing to Laszewski’s specific estimate of a 2 percent increase. The former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George W. Bush, Gail Wilensky, noted the health reform law has touched group coverage in certain ways, such as allowing children to stay on their parents' plan. ""Some portion — albeit probably a very small portion — of all premiums probably have gone up as a result of these requirements,"" Wilensky said. So Cruz’s claim about what ""virtually every person"" has seen runs up against the realities of the marketplace. About two-thirds of Americans buy their insurance in the part of the market where Obamacare has had the least effect. Evidence of premium hikes Where Obamacare has been most active is on the individual side, which accounts for less than 10 percent of Americans with insurance. The health insurance marketplaces that opened with fits and starts this month are all about people buying coverage on their own. Obamacare requires most everyone to have insurance, says no one can be denied coverage for a pre-existing health problem and sets minimum standards for the services that policies must cover. It also offers subsidies to defray the cost of insurance for many people. For some, those changes can translate into higher premiums. From the earliest days of the debate over Obamacare, there has been general agreement that young people in the individual market would see the largest hit on their wallets. If they never had insurance, they would now need to pay for it. If they did have individual coverage, it would be more expensive. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank strongly opposed to Obamacare, did an analysis of the premiums offered through the health care marketplaces that opened this month. It found ""the insurance on health exchanges will cost more than existing insurance."" According to the Heritage computer simulation, young people in their late 20s and 30s will see the greatest increases. The study cited Vermont where it estimated that rates for a 27-year-old will go up 144 percent, but older adults would also see a hefty increase. This is just one study from a group that advocates conservative policies. Analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that enjoys broad credibility, have declined to compare rates before and after Obamacare on the grounds that good data is lacking. They said we don’t know what people in the individual market pay today and we don’t know what they will choose in the Marketplaces. However, the general idea that young people will pay more comes as no surprise to Sabrina Corlette, program director for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. ""Young, healthy individuals who buy coverage on their own might see their rates rise, because they'll now be pooled with older sicker individuals,"" Corelette said. ""But remember, these folks' premiums pre-ACA were kept low because plans were able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. We're now moving to a system that doesn't discriminate and that means that yes, some people might have to pay more."" Also, there are early signs that some people who already buy on the individual market are vulnerable to the minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare. If their plans fell below that standard, some of them would get letters from their insurance companies telling them that higher premiums are in store. ""I am hearing the actuaries talk about baseline increases of 30 percent to 40 percent,"" said Laszewski. These are the sort of trends that Cruz’s office pointed to when we asked them about his claim. Another important note is that health care premiums generally have been rising for years, regardless of the health care law. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average family premium for employer-sponsored plans rose by an average of 5.8 percent per year from 2008 to 2013. Before that, premiums actually were rising faster. From 1999 to 2008, premiums rose by an average of 13.2 percent a year, Kaiser found. Our ruling Cruz said Obamacare has led to premiums going up and up and up for virtually every person. Cruz was most inaccurate when he spoke sweepingly about most Americans. The fact is, the majority of Americans already have insurance and Obamacare has had little impact on their premiums. The people first in line to see the law’s effects are in the individual market. There, it is true that young adults, along with some older adults, are vulnerable to hefty premiums hikes, but as painful as that might be, their numbers hardly amount to ""virtually every person."" One final point: Cruz's comments don't take into account the many people who will get subsidies as they shop on the health care marketplaces. People making less than 400 percent of the poverty level will be eligible for subsidies. If these people have been able to afford to buy their own insurance before the law, then they should see substantial decreases in their premiums thanks to the new regulations and subsidies. Cruz is using inflated rhetoric. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2013/oct/17/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-premiums-have-gone-virtually-eve/

More than 40,000 vets’ income would qualify for Medicaid if Texas adopted Obamacare expansion
","Discussing the chances that state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, might run for lieutenant governor, state Democratic chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said she has support among veterans who haven’t been part of his party’s base in the past. ""(I)n the state of Texas, especially with Republicans, with Rick Perry refusing to accept the hundred billion dollars in expanded Medicaid, there's 40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of that decision,"" Hinojosa said in a Sept. 25, 2013, interview on the YNN cable news channel’s ""Capital Tonight"" show. Gov. Rick Perry told the federal government that Texas would not expand its Medicaid eligibility to cover more low-income residents, a key Obamacare initiative, in a letter July 19, 2012. It’s not clear that federal reimbursements for those new Medicaid enrollees would have reached $100 billion over 10 years; in an April 2013 fact-check, we found a $90 billion estimate wrongly included $11.6 billion that Texas would get whether it expanded Medicaid or not. Since then, Perry has altered his stance: In a Sept. 16, 2013, letter, he directed the state health commission to ask for a lump sum of money (instead of getting federal dollars for each patient) plus the flexibility to use Texas’ own criteria to determine who qualifies. We wondered how Hinojosa concluded that rejecting expansion would deprive 40,000 Texas veterans of health care. Democratic Party spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that Hinojosa’s claim was based on a March 2013 study by the Washington-based Urban Institute that analyzed Census Bureau data to estimate how many U.S. military veterans aged 19 to 64 in the U.S. don’t have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) ""According to the analysis,"" Allison said, ""the 48,900 uninsured veterans in Texas whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level could qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act if the governor of Texas expands Medicaid."" On Aug. 6, 2013, our PolitiFact Georgia colleagues checked a statement based on the same study from the institute, which they said described itself as a nonpartisan research center although its leadership includes several former Clinton administration officials. That PolitiFact story rated as True a claim that by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the Obamacare law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage. Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government, aimed at reimbursing doctors who care for patients in low-income groups such as elderly and disabled people, children and pregnant women. Obamacare included a provision that federal money would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. In Texas, about 1 million adults were on Medicaid in January 2013, according to the website of the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Most were eligible because they were pregnant, disabled, older than 65 or raising children on a household income that was below the federal poverty line. If Texas went along with Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion provisions, the state commission’s most recent estimates, from 2012, predict another 341,000 Texas adults would get on Medicaid in 2014 -- reflecting people who earn less than $15,800 a year (for a one-person household) but weren’t already qualified to get Medicaid for another reason. In a May 2012 report, the Urban Institute said 130,000 non-elderly veterans in Texas have no health insurance -- about 8 percent of the state’s veterans and 13.1 percent of its non-elderly veterans. The institute based its estimate on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 and 2010 American Community Surveys, adjusted to correct for suspected errors such as high reports of private coverage among low-income families. To describe income groups, the researchers used modified adjusted gross income, the measure that will be used under the Obamacare law. Of those 130,000 non-elderly Texas veterans, the institute’s March 2013 study said, 48,900 earned less than 138 percent of the federal poverty guideline. State health commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman emailed us a lower number: 42,771, based on the 2011 American Community Survey. So it looks like more than 40,000 non-elderly veterans would be eligible, total, if Texas expanded Medicaid to all adults earning less than 138 percent of the poverty guideline. Hinojosa said those veterans ""are not going to receive health care."" Experts told us, however, that some might already be eligible for Medicaid or for health care through the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. Under Texas’ current Medicaid rules, Goodman said, some of the veterans could be eligible because they are pregnant, have a disability or are raising children on a below-poverty income. ""But we don't have a good way to estimate what that number would be,"" she said. Jennifer Haley, an author of the Urban Institute study, told us by email, ""It's definitely the case that some of these veterans are eligible for VA care ... While our data can't tell us which of these uninsured veterans could qualify, many low-income veterans likely would."" Nationwide, about 40 percent of veterans get health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its network of VA hospitals, clinics and other facilities, according to a September 2012 report from the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families at the University of Southern California. According to the VA’s website, its full health care plan is generally available free to veterans who have an injury or condition related to their military combat service, to veterans coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan for the first five years after they return and to veterans below certain income thresholds. Others may qualify for part or all of the services at varying costs. Jessica Jacobsen, a spokeswoman at the VA’s Dallas office, told us that as of August 2013, 665,000 Texas veterans were enrolled in VA care and 440,000 were eligible but unenrolled. Many of those unenrolled, however, could have private or other government coverage, as more than half of veterans nationwide do according to the veterans center report. Among Texas’ low-income veterans, Haley said, ""There are a number of factors that could keep these eligible veterans from enrolling"" in VA care — lack of information about VA coverage, for example. ""It's also possible that some may live too far from VA facilities and they are therefore not convenient options."" Our ruling Hinojosa said there are ""40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of"" the decision to reject expanding Medicaid. Two calculations based on Census data suggest 42,771 or 48,900 uninsured Texas veterans earn less than what would be the poverty threshold for adults qualifying for Medicaid if Texas had embraced that part of the Obamacare law. That’s not the same thing as saying they won’t ""receive health care""; in fact, some likely qualify now for Medicaid or VA care, but aren’t signed up. Hinojosa had a reasonable basis for his figure, but his statement lacked this clarification. We rate it as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Bill Foster says St. Petersburg's unemployment rate is lower than state average
","Candidates for St. Petersburg mayor painted two very different portraits of the city’s economy during the recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral debate. Mayor Bill Foster touted the city’s unemployment rate. ""We've added 5,000 new residents to the city of St. Petersburg,"" Foster said. ""Unemployment in the city of St. Petersburg is below the state average."" Challenger Rick Kriseman’s response included claims about how there are fewer small businesses and fewer overall workers than before Foster took office in 2010. We decided to put each candidate’s economic talk on the Truth-O-Meter. (We checked Kriseman's statements here and here.) In this fact-check, we’re looking at Foster’s claim about the unemployment rate. Comparing the city’s unemployment rate with the state average is tricky. The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out monthly reports with unemployment data for the country, state and metro areas. Using this data to compare cities with their home states is a little bit like analyzing apples and oranges. Why? The national and state data is adjusted for the season, but the metro data is not. The distinction between adjusted data and unadjusted data is important in Florida, where the economy is hugely susceptible to seasonal swings, economists told us. Think of the snowbirds who come to our state during the cooler months each year. They seek out services, pack restaurants, buy goods and visit the beach -- an annual economic stimulus. ""That doesn’t just affect tourism jobs,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. ""That affects everything."" That factor and others, such as teachers taking off for the summer, contribute to the state’s unadjusted employment rate typically ticking up in the summer months. When seasonal forces are factored in, the unemployment rate is smoothed out. Cities do not get the same treatment, left only with the less precise, unadjusted figure. With that disclaimer, we’ll move ahead with the check using labor data mostly from BLS. * From state Department of Economic Opportunity. NSA = Not seasonally adjusted, SA = Seasonally adjusted So the state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for August, the most recent month available, was 7 percent and the unadjusted rate is 7.1 percent. The BLS did not release unemployment data for metro areas and cities as scheduled on Oct. 2 due to the government shutdown. The bureau’s most recent, public estimate for St. Petersburg’s unemployment rate is for July 2013, when the (unadjusted) rate was 7.4 percent. That’s even with Florida’s unadjusted rate for July and larger than its adjusted rate. We checked in with the state’s Department of Economic Opportunity, which feeds some economic data to the BLS, before calling Foster’s claim inaccurate. According to DEO, the city’s unemployment rate for August was 6.9 percent -- a smidgen lower than the state’s unadjusted and adjusted rates for that month. The city’s unemployment rate was actually lower than the state’s, by either measure, for most of 2013. We asked our experts to point to better data, but they said this home survey-based data is the best we have. Residents are asked if they are working and, if not, whether they are looking for work. The government uses the data to crank out assessments for the national, state and local levels. ""At the state level, they’re estimates,"" said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. ""So when you get down to the smaller and smaller geographies, the availability and timeliness of data both begin to wane."" A declining unemployment rate is not necessarily a completely positive measure of the economy, PolitiFact Florida has found. Florida has a problem with discouraged workers being out of the workforce for a long time and eventually dropping out of the labor force. These workers are no longer reflected in the unemployment rate, which is a ratio of the number of workers versus the number of available workers. For example, Florida’s unemployment rate fell steeply from December 2011 to July 2013, from 9.4 percent to 7.1 percent. If the labor force had remained the same in July as it was a year and a half earlier, the real unemployment rate would have been 8.2 percent, according to an August 2013 report by the Legislature’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. The report found that about half of the reason for the drop is due to people leaving the labor force or putting off joining it. A similar analysis has not been completed at the city level. Foster did not return our call seeking comment. Our ruling St. Petersburg’s unemployment rate is a little bit better than the state average, according to the most recent data we have from the state and federal government. It’s been the case for most of the year. Is it substantially better? No. And experts cautioned that the numbers we have are not the best. Still, they’re the best we have. We rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/oct/17/bill-foster/bill-foster-says-st-petersburgs-unemployment-rate-/
