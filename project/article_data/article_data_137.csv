Herman Cain quotes Thomas Jefferson -- sort of
","We’ve noticed that pundits like to quote the words of leaders from the past. The practice is so common, that PunditFact has decided, from time to time, to check for accuracy. There seems to be a cottage industry in misquoting Thomas Jefferson. He didn’t say, ""The price of liberty is eternal vigilance."" Nor, ""My reading of history convinces me that most bad government has grown out of too much government,"" nor any variations of those or dozens of other pithy phrases wrongly attributed to our illustrious third president. But one-time Republican presidential candidate and former pizza franchise executive Herman Cain was at least in the ballpark when he cited Jefferson recently. Cain was explaining the reasons Obamacare was failing on a recent Web video broadcast. ""As Thomas Jefferson said, 'You might be able to fool the people for a while, and they may go astray, but sooner or later the American people are going to wake up and they will correct the course’,"" Cain said. Peter Onuf, historian at the University of Virginia and author of Jefferson’s Empire: The Language of American Nationhood, recognizes Jefferson's spirit in Cain’s rendition. But not Jefferson's words. ""It's a Jeffersonian sentiment, but I can pretty confidently say those are not his words,"" Onuf said. Other Jefferson historians, Jan Ellen Lewis at Rutgers and Annette Gordon-Reed at Harvard, also drew a blank on Cain’s’ paraphrasing. Jefferson is misquoted so often, the Jefferson Foundation at Monticello has assembled a page called Spurious Quotations. We emailed Cain TV and they told us that the original line from Jefferson was, ""The good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves."" We will sort out in a moment the differences between what Jefferson said and what Cain said that he said, but first we should confirm the accuracy of the original text Cain provided us. At Princeton University, the Papers of Thomas Jefferson has been compiling and cataloguing Jefferson’s words for 70 years. Editorial assistant Linda Monaco searched the digital files of the project’s ""Main Series,"" ""Retirement Series,"" ""the Jeffersonian Cyclopedia"" and the unpublished documents of Jefferson’s presidential years. Result? The quote Cain provided us (not the one he said in his Web video) is indeed Jefferson. ""This is a Thomas Jefferson quote,"" Monaco said. ""It is from Jefferson to Edward Carrington, 16 January 1787."" So the question is, if Cain did not quote Jefferson word for word, how close did he come? Well, he captured the key words 'the people,' 'astray' and 'correct.' He tacked on the part about fooling the people; that might have come from Lincoln’s line about fooling all of the people some of the time. He also added a phrase about waking up. In sum, he captured Jefferson’s meaning and some of the key words but embellished freely. It is telling that none of the experts recognized Cain’s version, nor could the researchers at the Letters of Thomas Jefferson find the source based on what he originally said. Our ruling Cain said that Thomas Jefferson said, ""You might be able to fool the people for a while, and they may go astray, but sooner or later the American people are going to wake up and they will correct the course."" Jefferson did write a line that resembles that in some important ways, but Cain put a fair number of words into Jefferson’s mouth. At PunditFact, we believe quotations should be relatively word-for-word accurate. If someone went to the trouble to leave their thoughts for posterity, the least we should do is honor what they actually said. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF5A40>],/factchecks/2013/nov/19/herman-cain/herman-cain-changes-jefferson-quotation/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'Voting Record', 'Jim Rubens']","
Jim Rubens claims U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare
","With glitches continuing to hamper the federal health care website that went live in October 2013, a group of Senate Democrats is asking the White House to extend the open enrollment period for people to buy coverage. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and nine others say individuals shouldn’t be penalized for lack of coverage if they can’t get health insurance through the new website, healthcare.gov. They want to push back the March 31, 2014 enrollment deadline to compensate for the technical problems. ""Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them,"" the senators wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. With Shaheen emerging as a leading voice in favor of extending the enrollment period, her opponents in New Hampshire are seizing the opportunity to remind voters that Shaheen was one of the Democrats who helped usher in the president’s health reform law in 2010. ""In Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire has a Senator who was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare,"" wrote Republican Jim Rubens, who plans to challenge Shaheen next year, in a Nov. 4, 2013 email. New Hampshire GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn offered the same criticism. She said Shaheen’s call to extend the enrollment period is ""too little, too late"" and does nothing to address the ""burdensome tax increases that Granite Staters will face as a result of the individual mandate."" ""Senator Jeanne Shaheen was the deciding vote in favor of ObamaCare, and she is the reason why New Hampshire families are dealing with disastrous consequences of this awful law,"" Horn said. It’s true that Shaheen voted to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. But was she really the ""deciding vote"" in favor of the law? PolitiFact has seen numerous politicians called ""the deciding vote"" for Obamacare in the past. In Florida, a campaign ad from the 60 Plus Association attacked Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for being ""the deciding vote"" for Obamacare. It was ruled Mostly False. PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at campaign literature from Republican Senate candidate Ron Johnson that claimed Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold ""cast the deciding vote"" for the health care bill in 2009. The claim earned a rating of Mostly False. In Michigan, a Republican committee said it was Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill have also been credited with casting the ""deciding vote."" The claims reflect the gamesmanship that every incumbent faces when opponents take a look at the voting record. Rather than just say the senator voted for a bill, the attackers up the ante by declaring it was the single vote that made the difference. In the case of the health care law, there’s a sliver of truth. All of the Democratic senators were needed to pass the bill. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 58 Democrats and two independents voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters; otherwise the final vote couldn’t happen and the bill would have been blocked.) ""Any one of those 60 Democrats who voted for it in the U.S. Senate, had they voted no, it would not have passed,"" Rubens said in an interview. ""So any one of those 60 would have been the deciding vote."" However, PolitiFact has been unsympathetic to that argument in the past, since calling someone ""the deciding vote"" implies he or she played a pivotal role, such as withholding support until the last moment. When it comes to the health care law, Shaheen wasn’t a holdout. If any Democratic senator deserves the distinction of clearing the way for the health reform law, it was then-Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. As was widely reported at the time, Nelson delivered the 60th vote needed to send the bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote. Shaheen’s staff provided a few examples of her public comments in support of health care reform before the vote. ""The status quo is simply not sustainable,"" Shaheen said on Sept. 23, 2009. ""Now is the time to act."" She repeated her call for health reform in floor speeches on Oct. 1, Dec. 7 and Dec. 14, 2009, saying the bill will begin to address soaring health care costs. Shaheen said years of ""perverse incentives"" have encouraged doctors to do more procedures rather than practice better medicine, and that the bill will shift the industry away from the fee-for-service model. ""The many programs supported in the bill before us move us in the direction of delivery system reform, which is so important to our effort,"" Shaheen said on Dec. 15. ""By promoting innovative practices like accountable care organizations, payment reform and medical homes, we can move away from the current fee-for-service system that rewards volume over value."" As the horse-trading that produced the final Senate bill was underway, there was one brief period of tension between Shaheen and some members of the Democratic leadership. Shaheen signed a Dec. 11 letter to Senate President Harry Reid imploring him to reject a proposal to allow people to buy into Medicare at age 55. That notion was floated while negotiations were underway about including a public option in the health reform plan. But Shaheen and 11 other Senate Democrats said expanding the Medicare pool without changing reimbursement rates would exacerbate existing funding inequities in their states. The provision was dropped from the final health reform bill that passed the Senate at the end of 2009. Our ruling Rubens said Shaheen was ""the deciding vote to pass Obamacare."" It’s true that all 60 Democratic votes -- including Shaheen’s -- were needed to pass the measure through the Senate. However, Shaheen, unlike Ben Nelson, was hardly a holdout until the last minute; she gave indications early on that she supported the president’s reform plan. We rate Rubens’ claim Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280F3EF66C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/19/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-us-senator-jeanne-shaheen-d-nh-w/
"['Elections', 'Texas', 'Greg Abbott']","
There were a few problems with voter ID law during early voting in Texas
","On the eve of the 2013 general election, a Republican candidate for governor of Texas in 2014 suggested the state’s mandate requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls was proving no big squeeze. Critics including Democrats had said the requirement, implemented for the first time in the November elections, would deter voters lacking an accepted ID, especially the elderly, minorities and the indigent. But a Nov. 4, 2013, Associated Press news story quoted Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has defended the 2011 law in court, as saying critics failed to make their case. ""I haven't ever seen anything that was overhyped as much as some partisan efforts to overhype concerns about this,"" Abbott said, ""when, in reality, there has been no problems whatsoever."" Not a one? Speaker Wright's ID Hector Nieto, a spokesman for the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project, disputed Abbott’s statement after bringing it to our attention. By email, Nieto noted news reports indicating the ID hurdle affected Sandra Watts, a Nueces County state district judge, and Jim Wright, the former U.S. House speaker. According to an Oct. 22, 2013, news account by KIII-TV, Channel 3 in Corpus Christi, Watts said she had to check a box swearing she was who she said she was when her name on her ID did not match her name on voting records. (Abbott and Wendy Davis, the Democratic state senator running for governor, similarly reported having to do the same, according to subsequent news reports.) Wright, 90, saying his driver’s license had expired, said he had to dig up a copy of his birth certificate before the Department of Public Safety would grant him a free personal identification card enabling him to vote on Election Day, Nov. 5, according to a Nov. 4, 2013, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story. Under the law, whose implementation was delayed by legal challenges, voters going to the polls are expected to present a photo ID issued by the DPS (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). News accounts generally upbeat Mindful that Abbott piped up before Election Day, we considered solely news stories completed by that time. This means that, like Abbott, we were limited to considering how the ID mandate affected voters in the state’s ""early voting"" period, which ran from Oct. 21 through Nov. 1. By email, Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland pointed out news stories indicating no problems with the ID law. Among them, a Nov. 4, 2013, Waco Tribune-Herald story quoted Kathy Van Wolfe, the McClennan County elections administrator, as saying: ""I haven’t had any of my polling places call me because there was a problem."" Similarly, other newspapers mostly reported smooth sailing, though officials also cautioned against sweeping conclusions by suggesting the 2013 ballot was unlikely to drive high turnout, meaning casual voters (including those less likely to carry appropriate IDs) were not expected at the polls. Statewide, voters were mostly considering proposed constitutional amendments and local propositions, though Houston had a mayoral election. In a Nov. 2, 2013, news story, the Houston Chronicle said that according to officials in Harris County and elsewhere, the ID mandate had not prevented anyone from voting. The Chronicle noted ""minor instances of confusion"" around the state and quoted the Harris County clerk, Stan Stanart, as saying the ID law caused no real problems; seven voters had to cast provisional ballots, which wouldn't be counted unless the voters proved their identities and were registerd to vote in the county. ""Two of the seven showed up without a photo ID, two had out-of-state IDs, and the other four had IDs that were long expired,"" Stanart told the paper. ""In the big picture, that's not much when you consider more than 80,000 people voted"" locally. Steve Raborn, elections administrator for Tarrant County, told the Star-Telegram for an Oct. 28, 2013, news story: ""We’ve really had no complaints, concerns or issues. But it’s only a small test given the low turnout,"" Raborn said. ""Voters who turn out for these constitutional amendment and bond elections are frequent voters. They know the drill."" The 2014 ballot will feature races for a range of offices topped by the U.S. Senate. An Oct. 27, 2013, news story in the Dallas Morning News reported ""hiccups"" at the polls, otherwise quoting Toni Pippins-Poole, the Dallas County elections administrator, as saying that many voters had to sign affidavits, swearing they were who they said they were, but no voter had been deterred from casting a ballot. On Oct. 29, 2013, the Dallas newspaper said on its Trailblazers blog that at least one in seven of more than 6,800 early voters had cast ballots after signing affidavits. The blog post said: ""Election officials are taking pains to minimize the hassle. At polling locations in Dallas County, voters also have the option of updating their information in the voter registration database so it matches their photo identification going forward. But at the least, there’s an extra minute or two of inconvenience for some voters."" In an Oct. 31, 2013, news story, the San Antonio Express-News quoted the Bexar County elections administrator, Jacque Callanen, as saying that local voting had been mostly uneventful. The story also said: ""That's not to say there haven't been some disgruntled voters -- three, to be exact. Callanen said they had voter registration certificates but no photo IDs and grew irate when asked to take additional steps to vote."" A couple days earlier, an Express-News news story quoted a Rice University political scientist, Mark Jones, as saying that the requests that voters affirm their identities wasn’t overly complicated. Jones said: ""If no one is denied the right to vote, and the sole impact is they have to check a box ... that's unlikely to resonate outside of the (Democratic Party) faithful. For me, the voter ID law's principal impact is the impact you can't see: the person who does not turn out because they lack documentation."" An Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Oct. 28, 2013, quoted election officials in Travis, Hays and Williamson counties as saying the ID law wasn’t keeping women from voting. The story quoted Jason Barnett, Williamson County’s elections administrator, as saying he taught election workers to look at the ""totality of circumstances"" to determine voters' identities when names weren’t identical on IDs and voter registration cards. ""It's not a complicated process,"" Barnett said. Joyce Cowan, the Hays County elections administrator, said the law hadn't brought troubles. ""We have not had major problems,"" Cowan said. An Oct. 26, 2013, El Paso Times news story reported no local problems with the ID law, also quoting an early voter, Jose Rodriguez, as saying the law didn't inconvenience him. Challenges for the elderly Informed of the tenor of these news stories, Nieto emailed us links to an Oct. 22, 2013, news report by KLTV-TV, Channel 7 in Tyler, stating that Elizabeth Pottinger, 96, would have to vote by mail--which does not require an ID to be presented--because she lacked the documents needed to obtain an ID that would be accepted at the polls. Nieto also pointed out a Sept. 21, 2013, news story by KTRK-TV, Channel 13 in Houston, stating that Dorothy Card, 84, of Lufkin, had failed to present the documents needed to get a DPS ID card. State law permitted her to vote by mail, the story said, but Card said voting at the courthouse had been her Election Day routine for years. Ultimately, the story said a DPS spokesperson, not identified, had assured the station that Card would be issued an ID card without more difficulties. Turnout and provisional ballots on rise Next, we wondered if there was an effect on turnout or the prevalence of provisional ballots--the kind that an adult can submit with the understanding that it won’t be counted unless they soon resolve the issue that prevented them casting a regular ballot. Turnout in the early-voting period was up from 2011, the last time the state had a comparable low-key general election. In 2013, nearly 284,000 Texans voted early in person, as opposed to by mail, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office, accounting for 3.3 percent of the state’s more than 8.5 million registered voters. In contrast, the office says, 156,317 voters, or 2 percent of 8 million registered voters, voted early in 2011. The number of provisional ballots cast also was up compared to 2011, according to information emailed to us by Jeff Hillery, a spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State’s office. According to the state, 131 provisional ballots were cast in the 2011 early-voting period. In the 2013 early-voting period, 398 provisional ballots--or 200 percent more than in 2011--were submitted. As in 2011, most counties fielded no provisional ballots, according to this information, while Medina County had the state’s most provisional ballots: 92. But that county didn’t have voter ID troubles, according to its elections administrator, Patricia Barton. Only two of the provisional ballots cast during early voting came from individuals lacking proper IDs, Barton told us by phone, and both were ""cured""--meaning the voters returned with proofs of identity that meant their ballots would be counted. Barton said the remaining provisional ballots came from individuals who were not registered to vote or not registered in the county. In Austin and Travis County, four of 31 provisional ballots collected during early voting involved individuals lacking an accepted ID, Dana DeBouviers, the county clerk, said by telephone. State official: Provisional ballots not problems Hillery suggested by email that provisional ballots aren’t ""problems"" at the polls. ""A problem would be if the correct process wasn’t followed during the election,"" Hillery said, adding that the agency ""had very few reports of any confusion or issues on what the acceptable forms of ID were."" Hillery stressed, too, that provisional ballots were an option mandated by the federal Help American Vote Act of 2002. ""All voters who show up at the polls are offered at least the opportunity to vote provisionally,"" Hillery said, which ""means that no voter is turned away from the polls because of the need for an acceptable form of photo ID. Here in Texas, if a voter shows up at the polls with an expired driver’s license or without any of the seven acceptable forms of ID, they will at least get a provisional ballot—meaning that they can still exercise their right to vote under the available circumstances. The voter then has a reasonable amount of time (six days; seven in this last election) to cure their vote and have it counted after going to the county registrar’s office and showing an acceptable form of photo ID to prove who they are. It’s also important to note that not every provisional ballot is necessarily the result of the photo ID requirement."" Our ruling Abbott said there were ""no problems whatsoever"" with the voter ID law leading up to the 2013 Texas elections. As Speaker Wright and some fellow Texans could attest, none is not correct. News stories reveal various if rare experiences that could be construed as problems, such as voters having to scramble to get the proper ID. There also was a surge in provisional (largely uncounted) ballots, though we did not determine whether the ID law was key to that. This claim has an element of truth but overlooks the overriding reality that there were some problems. Mark the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Mary Burke']","
Mary Burke says Wisconsin has gone from $700 million surplus to a $750 million deficit
","In modern politics, Republican strategist Karl Rove is often credited with popularizing the strategy of attacking an opponent’s strength to neutralize a perceived advantage for the other side. Madison Democrat Mary Burke has trotted out the tactic early in her bid to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in November 2014. She’s labeled Walker a big spender. Asked by a Madison Capital Times reporter if she supported the $650 million income tax cut signed by Walker in 2013, the former state Commerce secretary said she would have wanted to see whether it put the state budget in a strong position going forward. But she suggested strongly that it didn’t. ""You've seen where we're now going from a $700 million surplus to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit,"" Burke said in the interview published Nov. 6, 2013. ""I'd love to be able to do tax cuts, but they have to be done in a way that is benefiting the state and is setting us up for fiscal responsibility in the long term."" Walker frequently touts his frugal budgeting ways and emphasis on tax cuts. Did he really turn a state surplus red? Yes and no. We’ve tested one of Burke’s numbers before: Walker’s first budget (covering July 2011- June 2013) ended with a cash balance of $759 million, according to an accounting prepared in October 2013 by the nonpartisan budget scorekeeping agency, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is considered the gold standard for independent budget scorekeeping. It is also what Burke cited when we asked her for backup. Many readers may not be familiar with the second number she cites, the $750 million ""deficit."" The Fiscal Bureau came up with that figure, too, so Burke mentions two credible figures. But the negative number she mentions is not a concrete figure that compares easily to the hard-cash surplus Burke cites. It’s a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need in mid-2015 to balance the next two-year budget, covering 2015-’17. Legislators use it as an exercise and a benchmarking tool. During budget deliberations, they’ll call Bob Lang, Fiscal Bureau director, and ask how a tax cut -- or a spending increase for a certain program -- would affect the potential size of this budget gap down the road. The estimate is officially known as the ""structural deficit,"" which Burke shorthands as ""deficit."" It’s rough because Lang doesn’t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs, for example. But, in part due to the tax cuts Burke discussed, it’s true that the structural deficit heading into Walker’s third budget is now estimated at that $725 million figure Burke mentioned. So there’s truth in her overall point. But we won’t have a hard number to compare to the 2013 Walker surplus until 2015. For the record, Walker’s two budgets have recorded the lowest ""structural deficits"" since Lang started keeping track in 1997. It’s not even close; they ranged from $1.5 billion to $2.9 billion before Walker. His first budget actually wiped out the structural deficit entirely heading into his second budget. We’ve dealt with similar mismatched numbers on the Truth-O-Meter before. We rated Half True a Walker claim that,""The $3.6 billion deficit we inherited has turned into more than a half-billion-dollar surplus."" His numbers also checked out individually, and his overall point on the big turnaround from red to black in his first budget is correct. But he mixed different ways to define the size of the turnaround, throwing the numbers off a bit. Our rating Burke said the state is going from a $700 million surplus ""to getting into the next biennium with almost a $750 million deficit."" Her numbers check out, and she properly identifies a big swing in Walker’s budgeting, but -- like Walker’s similar claim -- there’s a problem because the two numbers aren’t easily compared. We rate her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AEA180>],/factchecks/2013/nov/19/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-has-gone-700-million-sur/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Saxby Chambliss']","
Senator questions some areas of Defense budget
","Remember the classic U.S. Army slogan? ""We do more by 9 a.m. than most people do all day,"" a voice said in the famous commercial. What you may not know is that the military is doing some significant multitasking. In addition to chasing down terrorists and conducting humanitarian rescue missions in places such as the Philippines, the Defense Department is also working to prevent and cure some of the deadliest diseases known to mankind. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., recently said the medical research may not be the best use of Defense Department resources. ""What I don’t understand is why the … military is spending $80 million a year on prostate cancer research, why we’re spending $25 million a year on ovarian cancer research and $150 million on breast cancer research. We’re also doing lung cancer research,"" Chambliss said during a Nov. 7 meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Chambliss wants additional money for the Defense Department, but he says it should be spent wisely. ""Now if there are particular needs that the military has regarding military research and there are some, particularly because of the casualties we’ve suffered recently, I can understand it,"" the senator continued. ""But these are types of research that simply have no place in my opinion in (the Defense Department). They ought to be done in (the National Institutes of Health)."" Chambliss complained there is little coordination between the research done by the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health. PolitiFact Georgia was unaware that the Defense Department was doing that kind of research. We’re not early-risers like the Army. We embarked on a mission to determine whether the senator was correct that the military was conducting research on these serious conditions and whether his math was correct about how much in taxpayer dollars it was spending on such work. In late 1992, Congress began to set aside annual funding toward research of various illnesses and diseases to be done by the Defense Department. Some of the research is for conditions that appeared directly related to the battlefield, such as Gulf War Illness and traumatic brain injuries. Other research is for conditions faced by Americans that are not necessarily military-related. The list of conditions includes, as Chambliss noted, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. As Chambliss told it, the now-deceased Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaskan Republican, asked for some prostate cancer research dollars to be allocated to the Defense Department. Chambliss said Stevens later realized those funds should be allocated to the NIH. We looked up the most recent funding totals for the various forms of research. The Defense Department Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs website said $80 million was spent in fiscal year 2013 on prostate cancer research, but the totals were slightly less for the other forms of cancer Chambliss mentioned. The website said $20 million was spent on ovarian cancer research and $120 million on breast cancer research in FY 2013. The 2013 federal fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2012, and ended Sept. 30. Lauren Claffey, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, said he was using numbers for fiscal year 2010. To sum up, Chambliss said the federal government gives the U.S. Department of Defense $80 million a year for prostate cancer research, $25 million a year for ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year for breast cancer research. The senator is correct that there is such a program. The numbers are slightly off for two of the three forms of research. Chambliss used numbers three years older than the most recent material. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C23EEC0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/19/saxby-chambliss/senator-questions-some-areas-defense-budget/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Jan Schakowsky']","
Schakowsky said based on GDP per capita, the United States 'has never been richer'
","As congressional Democrats and Republicans sit down for high-stakes budget talks, the rhetoric has flown furiously to familiar territory. Republicans want cuts and reforms to entitlement programs, while Democrats insist that revenue must be on the table, too. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., made the case for the latter in an interview on MSNBC on Nov. 12, 2013. ""This country has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP,"" she said. ""It doesn't feel that way when you hear about austerity and we have to cut this and we have to cut that. It's because the income inequality is greater than it has ever been."" We wondered if she was correct. The numbers don’t lie Schakowsky’s office sent us figures from the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to those numbers, the GDP per capita, when adjusted for inflation, hit $45,633 this year, which surpassed the previous high of $45,360, which was set in 2007 prior to the most recent recession. It was barely higher, but higher all the same. (The government defines the GDP — gross domestic product — as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.) We were curious how the data was calculated, so we contacted Mathew Shane, an economist with the USDA who put the figures together. He told us that the 2013 number was partially based on a projection, since the year is not yet completed. But if that projection is borne out, he said, then GDP per capita will be at its highest level ever. ""It’s close,"" Shane said. ""We hit a peak in 2007 when the crisis hit. There’s been no income growth in real terms since 2007. The difference between (2007 and 2013) is a very modest difference. We, essentially, finally regained what we were in 2007. I guess we could say we’re projected to be slightly better than we were in 2007."" If ""I guess"" doesn’t sound definitive enough, we also sought out another source: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government agency that calculates the nation’s GDP. The bureau’s analysis also backs up Shane’s findings. By the second quarter of this year, GDP per capita had surpassed 2007 levels. ""The third quarter of 2013 is the highest on record,"" said Thomas Dail, spokesman for the bureau. Finally, GDP per capita, even when adjusted for inflation, has gone up and up for more than a century. In other words, Schakowsky could have said what she said at virtually any given point during the last 150 years and had a pretty good chance of being right. Our ruling Schakowsky said, ""This country has never been richer, if you look at per capita GDP."" We found that GDP has trended upward throughout much of America's history and the current level is only slightly higher than pre-recession levels. But the numbers show Schakowsky is right.

Obamacare law was ‘funded’ and expected to save billions; not so for Medicare Part D

Bush making a face, the caption reads, ""Bush’s Medicare D was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act, and, unlike the ACA, was never budgeted."" The Facebook-shared image is unattributed, but its caption tracks word-for-word with an Oct. 18, 2013, tweet and blog post by writer and pundit Andrew Sullivan. Sullivan’s post doesn’t elaborate on Part D -- Medicare’s prescription drug program, created in 2003. But others have made similar comparisons. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in a Dec. 29, 2009, New York Times blog entry about ""the trouble Republicans have been having as they try to explain why, if they consider the fully-funded, deficit-reducing Democratic health care reform unaffordable, they voted for the completely unfunded Medicare drug benefit six years ago."" Did Congress ""budget"" enough for the promises made under the Obamacare law but not those in Medicare Part D -- and was Part D ""far more expensive""? ‘Budgeted’ Via email, Krugman told us, ""Not sure about what ‘never budgeted’ means, or exactly how ‘more expensive’ is defined. But the ACA designated cost savings and revenues to pay for the outlays; Part D just specified outlays with no offset."" Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization), told us by email, ""It's certainly true that the ACA was funded while Medicare Part D was not."" Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for senior citizens on Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. Obamacare requires Americans to buy health insurance, extends Medicare to cover more people and makes numerous other changes. Auerbach said, ""The ACA was funded in the sense that taxes were increased to pay for the estimated expenditure cost. Medicare Part D provided a new benefit with a substantial long-run cost... and did not raise any taxes."" Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us by email, ""Medicare Part D was always coming out of general revenues (unlike most of the rest of Medicare),"" because the federal deficit was a less prominent concern at the time, ""whereas ACA/Obamacare was drafted in a more deficit-conscious era."" Ellis’ group, based in Washington, D.C., describes itself as a nonpartisan watchdog advocating more transparency and less waste in government spending. In a Nov. 3, 2013, fact-check, PolitiFact summed up tax increases in the Obamacare law, aside from the penalty Americans will pay if they don’t have approved health insurance: Medicare payroll taxes for the wealthy, investment income taxes and others on insurance companies, the health care industry and more are included. Other provisions are intended to push Medicare costs down. Medicare Part D wasn’t ""funded"" in that a source of money was not created or dedicated to offset all its costs -- say, a tax increase or other funding mechanism. Medicare trustees’ March 23, 2004, report explained Part D would be financed with general revenue (mostly federal income taxes) plus the enrollees’ premium payments and some money from the states. Because the premium amounts and the amount of general revenue would be reset each year, they could be adjusted to cover anticipated costs, the report said: ""Thus, Part D income will automatically track Part D expenditures fairly closely."" Which cost(s) more? Part D and Obamacare are intended to extend into the future. How does one measure the cost of such efforts? One way is to look at projected costs over a 10-year span, as PolitiFact Virginia did in a Dec. 7, 2010, fact-check. Which 10-year span? The photo-quotation that touched off this story gave no context. First we looked at the cost estimates available to members of Congress when they voted. On Nov. 20, 2003, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Part D’s gross cost would total $409.8 billion from 2004 through 2013. The net cost of the entire Medicare Modernization Act, including Part D and expected revenue increases, was given as $394.3 billion ($501 billion in today’s dollars). On March 18, 2010, the CBO and Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Obamacare law’s net effect would be to save the government -- that is, reduce the federal deficit -- $138 billion from 2010 through 2019 ($148 billion in today’s dollars). Later estimates have varied, and realities are also kicking in. PolitiFact found in a June 15, 2011, fact-check that Medicare Part D costs were coming in 28 percent to 40 percent lower than projected by the CBO in 2003. Among the reasons: Fewer people than expected used the program and expiring patents made some name-brand drugs cheaper. The Obamacare law isn’t fully implemented yet, but Ellis said, ""The tricky thing about the ACA/Obamacare is that it counts on a lot of moving parts and a lot of assumptions to get to the savings number. If things don’t work out as planned, it won’t be a deficit reducer… whereas after nearly a decade we know what Medicare Part D cost."" Bob Moffit, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Center for Health Policy Studies, pointed out by phone that the Medicare trustees have expressed doubt that Congress will leave its cost-reducing measures in place -- particularly the ""sustainable growth rate"" formula meant to lower Medicare payments to doctors. The Medicare trustees’ May 31, 2013, report said, ""At a minimum, readers should not assume that the SGR-related payment rate reductions will take place."" That report’s forecasts included a prediction that Part D’s general revenue outlays from 2013 through 2022 could total $852 billion but, the trustees wrote, ""Medicare’s actual future costs are highly uncertain and are likely to exceed those shown by the current-law projections in this report."" As for the Obamacare law, the CBO said in a May 14, 2013, blog post that its most recent prediction of the act’s total budget impact was a July 24, 2012, estimate that repealing the law could raise the federal deficit by $109 billion ($111 billion in 2013 dollars) from 2013 through 2022. But ""projections of the effects of the ACA"" are ""highly uncertain,"" the CBO warned, with other factors including the law’s overall effect on the nation’s health systems and the Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of expanding Medicaid eligibility. The law had required states to widen Medicaid access.   Krugman gives a different measure in his late-2009 blog entry: ""According to the Medicare trustees, Part D created a $9.4 trillion unfunded liability over the next 75 years."" The trustees’ 2013 report updated that estimate to $9.2 trillion for 2013-2087. A June 17, 2013, PolitiFact Virginia fact-check showed that January 2013 Government Accountability Office estimates of the Obamacare law’s cost over 75 years could result in two scenarios: It could raise the national debt $6.2 trillion if its cost containment measures were phased out, or it could save the government $13.3 trillion if it works as intended. A GAO analyst said the report did not say whether one outcome or the other is more likely. Our ruling The image shared on Facebook said, ""Bush’s Medicare D was far more expensive than the Affordable Care Act, and, unlike the ACA, was never budgeted."" It’s a vague claim without context. Looking for a reasonable way to evaluate it, we found the Obamacare law was ""funded"" and Part D ""unfunded"" and that, using estimated 10-year costs at inception, the former was projected to save $148 billion and the latter to cost something under $501 billion (in 2013 dollars). We rate the claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Kelly Ayotte compares size of federal deficit, baseball salaries
","Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., talked debt and deficit with Granite Staters at a town hall meeting last month, trying to put the enormous numbers into context for the average person. The deficit could buy a large Dunkin’ Donuts coffee for every American every day for the next four years, she said. It also could pay for new iPhones for half of the people on Earth. And to really hit home the size of billions of dollars of deficit, Ayotte compared the figure with the salaries of Major League Baseball players. The deficit, she said, could pay ""all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years."" It was fitting timing for the comparison. Ayotte donned a Boston Red Sox hat during the town hall, held on the day of Game 2 of the 2013 World Series. It’s also an interesting statistic to cite. Could the deficit actually fund America’s favorite pastime for the next two-and-a-half centuries? We did the math. Tracking down the federal deficit was the easy part. At the time of the town hall event, the Congressional Budget Office’s most recent deficit estimate was $753 billion, from the monthly report  published in September. The baseball numbers are a bit trickier to calculate. Each December, Major League Baseball calculates the total payroll of all baseball clubs to see which teams have to pay a luxury tax, incurred by those who have a payroll over the threshold set by MLB. The 2012 spending was $3.15 billion But what about 2013 figures? We struck out with both Major League Baseball and the players’ union, the Major League Baseball Players Association. The communications office said the official 2013 data is currently being calculated. So, we relied on Opening Day numbers reported by media organizations, which they attributed to a combination of the players association, club officials and Major League Baseball’s central office. According to ESPN, the sum of all the team payrolls on opening day was $3,059,073,869. USA Today and CBS Sports have similar but slightly different numbers -- $3,100,746,107 for USA Today and $3,098,746,107 for CBS Sports. The differences are generally explained by how signing bonuses and deferred money in contracts are counted, and whether injured players are included, said Jeff Euston, a baseball fan who runs a website called Cot’s Contracts at Baseball Prospectus. Ayotte’s math is accurate using the ESPN data -- the source her staff said she used. They said she used numbers reported by ESPN and divided that by the federal deficit estimated by the Office of Management and Budget in July. That’s $759 billion divided by $3,059,073,869, or 248 years. Using numbers from other media organizations, the deficit instead can pay baseball salaries for 238 years or 244 years. Meanwhile, using the CBO’s estimate from September brings the years to 236 or 242. Our Ruling: Ayotte said the deficit this year could pay ""all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years."" Given that she had a couple different options for data, the senator looked to ESPN for sports statistics, which seemed to us like a reasonable choice. The ESPN data produces a result of 248 years. Even if the answer is 236 years or 244 years -- the answer you get if you use different data sources -- it’s a long time. We rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D85200>],/factchecks/2013/nov/18/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-compares-size-federal-deficit-baseball-sala/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Health Care', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi says about same number of Democrats have been supporting GOP changes to health law
","David Gregory opened NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday with a pointed question for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi about a ""crisis of confidence"" among Democrats in President Barack Obama. ""Has it reached a point where Democrats don’t believe the president can pull this off and can make Obamacare work?"" Gregory asked. Two days before the show, 39 House Democrats joined Republicans to pass the Keep Your Health Plan Act, which would allow insurers to continue to offer individual market health insurance policies that do not meet the standards of the health care law through 2014. It would also allow insurance companies to sell the plans to new customers. The bill passed 261-157. Obama announced a narrower ""fix"" a day earlier, letting insurers offer plans to existing policyholders through 2014 if state insurance regulators allow it. The White House said Obama would veto the House proposal. Pelosi said the Democratic defections on that bill weren’t as remarkable as D.C. watchers made them out to be. ""No, I remind you that 39 voted for this resolution the other day. The number has been in the 30s when it was to agree with them on the mandate for businesses, the mandate for individuals,"" Pelosi said, ""so this is approximately the same number."" It’s clear from Pelosi’s statement she was not talking about the more than 40 House votes to repeal or gut Obamacare, which have not attracted sizable Democratic support. She isolated two votes on two measures: one to delay the health care law’s employer mandate, and another to delay the individual mandate. We wanted to know if she was right that the number of Democratic votes on those measures was about the same as the Friday, Nov. 15 vote. Back in July, the Obama administration announced it would postpone until 2015 the part of the law requiring larger employers to offer health insurance coverage to employees or face fines. A Treasury Department blog post cited ""concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively."" House Republicans, some peeved Obama did this without going through Congress, eyed a new, populist anti-Obamacare strategy. They figured they could earn more Democratic votes by tying a bill that would codify the delay for big employers, since Obama already okayed it. They also scheduled a vote to delay the individual mandate for everyday Americans. ""Is it fair for the president of the United States to give American businesses an exemption from his health care law’s mandates without giving the same exemption to the rest of America? Hell no, it’s not fair,"" the New York Times quoted House Speaker John Boehner as telling House Republicans behind closed doors. On July 17, the House took two votes. The first, on the delay for the employer mandate, passed 264-161, with 35 Democratic yeas. The second vote on delaying the individual mandate was not as close to the vote on policy renewals. It passed 251-174, with 22 Democrats joining the Republican majority. We created a Google spreadsheet outlining which Democrats voted for the two July proposals and the proposal they just considered. Twenty-one House Democrats voted for all three measures: Ron Barrow (Ariz.), John Barrow (Ga.), Julia Brownley (Calif.), Cheri Bustos (Ill.), Bill Enyart (Ill.), Elizabeth Esty (Conn.), Pete Gallego (Texas), Joe Garcia (Fla.), Daniel Maffei (N.Y.), Sean Maloney (N.Y.), James Matheson (Utah), Mike McIntyre (N.C.), Patrick Murphy (Fla.), Williams Owens (N.Y.), Gary Peters (Mich.), Scott Peters (Calif.), Collin Peterson (Minn.), Nick Rahall (W.V.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Paul Schneider (Ill.), and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) When we noted the disparity to Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill, he said, ""She was making the point that people have made these votes on this before."" Pelosi does have a point about the Democratic votes on the employer mandate being close to the recent roll call on insurance policies, but she’s off on the vote to delay the individual mandate. That attracted only about half as much support from Democrats (22 versus 39). Her statement is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C419440>],/factchecks/2013/nov/17/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-39-democrats-who-joined-gop-bill/

Nancy Pelosi: Health care law doesn't demand insurance companies cancel policies
","President Barack Obama’s apology and administrative pivot to stop a wave of insurance plan cancellations has hardly quieted accusations that he misled millions of Americans when he said ""If you like your plan, you can keep it."" Facing these criticisms, the Democratic leadership has rallied around the president. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said he actually took more blame for what happened than he might deserve. ""The law does not demand that all of these cancellations go out,"" Pelosi said on NBC’s Meet the Press. We have looked at variations of this claim before, most recently when former Obama adviser Ezekiel Emanuel said, ""The insurance companies are making that choice (to cancel or change policies), not the president."" Our conclusions remain the same. While there’s an element of truth to the statement, it ignores the ways that the Affordable Care Act pushes insurance companies to change the plans they offer. The Affordable Care Act sets certain standards for the services pretty much every plan must cover. There are 10 ""essential health benefits"" and the list includes emergency services, maternity care and mental health care. If policyholders bought plans before Obama signed his reform into law on March 23, 2010, they’re considered ""grandfathered."" They can keep their plans, so long as those plans don’t change much. We don’t have good information on how many cancellation notices are for plans that could continue if the insurance company wanted. But we do know two things. First, it doesn’t take much for a plan to lose its grandfathered status. A hike in a co-pay of $5 plus the rate of medical inflation could tip a plan over the edge. Second, once a plan is poised to lose its grandfathered status, it’s on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policyholders 90 days notice as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders have been getting in the mail these days. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, told PolitiFact that insurance companies have options. ""Except for these ‘grandfathered plans’ health insurers in the individual market have to adopt new consumer protections,"" Hammill said. ""In some instances, insurers are doing this by cancelling current plans rather than simply upgrading them. Nothing in the law requires the cancellation of plans as the leader said today."" Some health policy experts told us that yes, in a technical sense, insurers are pulling the plug on these old, grandfathered policies. Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor, said that ""if a grandfathered plan is being terminated, it is the insurer’s decision -- nothing in the law requires it."" But other experts said that while this is technically true, it gives a distorted view of what’s going on. The law places grandfathered plans in such a straitjacket -- unable to attract new individual policyholders and unable to adjust terms to market conditions -- that it’s only a matter of time before companies are driven to pull the plug. To ignore the government’s role in establishing the parameters for this highly regulated and highly competitive industry, they say, is substantially misleading. ""Insurance companies cannot continue to sell individual policies that don’t meet the requirements of the essential benefit package, either to individuals or to small businesses, as of Jan. 1,"" said Gail Wilensky, the head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""But since the insurance companies are not allowed to continue to sell these plans that the person previously had bought and may have liked, they are effectively being forced to change their plan."" By all accounts, even the employers who are offering grandfathered plans to their employees are dwindling over time. The annual study of health insurance by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust found that the percentage of workers enrolled in grandfathered plans has decreased from 56 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2013. Another study, by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, found that of the one-quarter of organizations that still have a grandfathered plan, less than half expect to keep their grandfathered status beyond the next two years. In other words, the grandfathered plan is slowly but steadily becoming a dinosaur. Our ruling Pelosi said the Affordable Care Act doesn’t require insurance companies to send out the cancellation notices that people have been getting. While there’s some element of truth to this statement, one of the major thrusts of the law is it sets minimum standards. The law intentionally makes it difficult for companies to avoid these minimums and the industry has responded by moving away from sub-par plans. Pelosi’s statement ignores the factors in the law that push companies in a certain direction. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF8200>],/factchecks/2013/nov/17/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-health-care-law-doesnt-require-insurance-co/
"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims state's gained 143,000 new private-sector jobs
","The state and national economies might not exactly be robust since the recession ended four years ago, but Chris Christie claims New Jersey has been seeing steady and sustained job growth in that time. Christie touted that growth during his four appearances Nov. 10 on the major Sunday morning news programs including Face The Nation, ABC News This Week, Fox News Sunday and Meet The Press. In fact, The Colbert Report, a faux news program on Comedy Central, poked fun at the governor’s appearances during a tightly edited clips sequence shown Nov. 11. The sequence starts by Christie downplaying on each show claims of a presidential run in 2016 and instead focusing on his being New Jersey’s governor. To illustrate that point, the clips then lead into Christie saying the state has gained ""143,000 new  private-sector jobs."" Christie’s number is generally accurate, but the methodology used to measure the jobs gains isn’t exactly ideal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, the numbers. Christie’s timeframe for measuring jobs was February 2010 -- his first full month in office -- to August 2013, the most recent month for which preliminary employment data is available. New Jersey had 3,192,000 private-sector jobs in February 2010, BLS data shows. By August 2013 that figure was 3,334,400. The difference? 142,400 jobs. So Christie rounded up a bit when he cited a gain of 143,000 jobs, but his number is generally solid. Those numbers also match employment data on the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development website. Next, the methodology. The timeframe cited by Christie isn’t even. Experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey on numerous occasions that the best way to evaluate employment trends is to measure seasonally adjusted, year-over-year data. Seasonally adjusted data is best for review because it takes into account jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns. So when looking at annual data, we often review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period. But in Christie’s case, we’re evaluating February 2010 over preliminary data for August 2013. Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed that it’s best to review seasonally adjusted data within the context of a year. He reviewed the BLS numbers from August 2012 to August 2013 and then looked at how New Jersey’s job growth compares with neighboring states. Seneca’s analysis found that nearly half the state’s private-sector job growth came during the year that he reviewed: 60,300 private-sector jobs. In addition, New Jersey’s job growth rate of 1.8 percent exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had a growth rate of 0.9 percent. ""The latest year-over-year data indicate that New Jersey is right in the middle of the pack in terms of the rate of private-sector job growth,"" Seneca said in an e-mail, adding that much of the growth has been in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities. Our ruling A recent segment on The Colbert Report shows Christie emphasizing his work as governor by saying New Jersey has gained ""143,000 new private-sector jobs."" BLS data and an analysis by a Rutgers economics professor back up Christie’s figure, which is rounded up a bit from the actual figure of 142,400 new private-sector jobs created. The governor’s overall point is that private-sector employment in New Jersey is increasing, and he’s right. We rate the statement True.

Ken Block says Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system is the most expensive in the U.S.
","With every candidate promising more jobs, lower taxes, better education, and an end to fraud and abuse, voters face a daunting task when they try to figure out whether a candidate actually has specific proposals for tackling such problems. When Ken Block, a Republican candidate for governor, was asked about saving money during a Nov. 8, 2013, appearance on Rhode Island Public Radio, he said one potential source of savings was the state's unemployment system, financed by a tax companies pay to cover benefits for workers who lose their jobs. ""When we attack our unemployment insurance system, which is the most expensive such system in the country, and we bring those costs into line with how other states run their program and what it costs for those other programs, I believe we should be able to save somewhere between another $50 [million] and $80 million annually year over year over year, which could be another third of a billion over four years,"" he said. PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions. But Block’s claim that Rhode Island has the most expensive unemployment system in the country -- a claim he has made repeatedly, including in a Nov. 13, 2013, Providence Journal commentary -- is a checkable statement. We emailed his campaign and asked for its evidence. Block’s policy director, Matthew Schweich, sent us a link to the ""2014 State Business Tax Climate Index,"" published by The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. It ranks Rhode Island as 46 out of the 50 states, based on a complicated scale that assesses how well a state's tax system enhances or harms the competitiveness of the state’s business environment. In a category that compares unemployment insurance systems, Rhode Island ranks the worst. But Block didn't say the state has the worst system. He said it has the most expensive. The report doesn't have a state-by-state comparison of expense. In fact, Rhode Island was not ranked worst in any of the measures quantified in the report. The state has the sixth-highest minimum tax rate charged to employers and the 10th-highest maximum tax rate. Its taxable wage base -- the income level beyond which employers don't have to pay additional tax -- is higher in 14 other states, according to The Tax Foundation report. When we raised this issue with Block's office, Schweich argued in an email that, ""You can’t measure the overall cost of a program by evaluating just a single metric. So, even if Rhode Island isn’t ranked absolute bottom in any individual category, the cumulative effect of being ranked near the bottom across many categories can demonstrate that, overall, RI’s system is the most expensive."" He also argued that there are many ways to define ""expensive."" ""Does it mean the cost to the state? The cost to employers? The economic and reputational cost to Rhode Island of being ranked bottom?"" he wrote. ""The Tax Foundation has produced the most detailed ranking of [unemployment insurance] programs, so we used it as a basis for this statement. We were satisfied with the methodology."" Then we called The Tax Foundation and spoke to Joseph Henchman, coauthor of the study. He said a ranking of 50 out of 50 didn't necessarily make Rhode Island's program the most expensive. Other factors are considered as well. ""We're measuring both expense and compliance and administrative costs,"" he said, explaining that the foundation would prefer to characterize Rhode Island's system as the most burdensome or the most complex. For example, one reason Rhode Island scored low in the rankings was because a local business has to be in operation three years before its actual track record for hiring and firing employees is used to set its unemployment insurance tax rate. Until then, the business is simply assigned a rate, which can be unfair to a company with a steady employee base. In most states, a business' experience rating is set after one year. Instead, Henchman sent us a 2011 report he authored that focused solely on state unemployment insurance programs. In a comparison of the average unemployment tax rates, Rhode Island ranked third highest behind Idaho and Oregon for 2010, and in a comparison of the average weekly unemployment insurance benefits, the state ranked fourth highest, behind Hawaii, New Jersey and Massachusetts. And that was before Rhode Island implemented a series of changes, still being phased in, that will decrease the average weekly benefit over time, according to Henchman's study. Finally, we looked at a recent report from the U.S. Department of Labor. The state-by-state ranking of tax rates that employers paid on total wages in the second quarter of 2012 shows Rhode Island ranked as the fifth highest, behind Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho and Oregon, all of which taxed more. In the ranking of the average weekly benefit paid to the unemployed in the second quarter of 2013, Rhode Island came in 10th behind Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wyoming, all of which paid more. Our ruling Ken Block said Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system ""is the most expensive such system in the country."" If he had said we were AMONG the most expensive, he would be on solid ground. But he has repeatedly insisted that Rhode Island's program is THE most expensive. The  only evidence he supplied was a Tax Foundation report that doesn't directly evaluate the expense of the system. And other measures, from the foundation itself and U.S. Department of Labor, say it's not the most expensive. Because Block was unequivocal, we will be as well. We rate his statement as False.

"['Oregon', 'Karl King']","
Were there “$2 billion in earmarks in fiscal year 2012?
","Political controversies come and go faster than fashion trends. While government shutdowns, sequestration and the debt ceiling are hogging the political catwalk right now, it seems like only yesterday that battles over budgetary earmarks were all the rage. You remember earmarks: provisions in spending bills that let individual members of Congress direct money to specific projects or entities in their districts. The zenith of attention for earmarks came in 2010. That’s when Republican opposition to the practice helped the GOP retake control of the House of Representatives. Leaders quickly won approval of a moratorium on earmarks. Not to be outdone, Senate Democrats approved a moratorium in that chamber, too. Then, like wide ties, earmarks faded from public view. So it caught our attention recently when Karl King, who is mounting an independent bid to unseat Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, homed in on earmarks on the ""issues"" page of his website. King, a licensed massage therapist from Redmond, singled out two issues he wants to focus on. The first involves individual privacy rights. The second addresses the federal budget, which he said should be cut. Among the areas that should be sheared, King said, are ""the 2 billion dollars in earmarks in fiscal year 2012."" Did that year’s federal budget, despite moratoriums approved by both chambers of Congress really contain $2 billion in earmarks? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed King and asked where he got the $2 billion figure. He responded quickly, saying a review of his notes didn’t include any source for the number. He then said in a followup email he would change the figure on his website to $3.3 billion, a number he got from the Pig Book, a publication put out since 1991 by Citizens Against Government Waste, a private, nonpartisan Washington, D.C., budget watchdog group. We called Leslie Paige, Citizens Against Government Waste’s vice president for policy and communications. She defended the $3.3 billion figure but said no Pig Book charting annual pork-barrel spending has been issued since 2012 because the moratoriums have made it so difficult to trace what went where. ""The process is now very opaque and the money going through the system is almost impossible to track,"" Paige said. ""Simply put, we lack the manpower to check it all out."" Paige’s group arrived at the $3.3 billion figure by matching appropriations in ""earmark-free"" bills to spending clearly identified as earmarks in bills passed before the ban. A $50 million earmark for the National Guard Counterdrug Program in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012, she said, corresponds to nine earmarks totaling $22.9 million in the same act approved two years before. She acknowledged that ""the vast majority of earmarks have dried up"" since Congress banned the practice but added that, according to her group’s definition, some earmarks continue. So what qualifies as an earmark? Anything satisfying at least two of the follow criteria, she said: Requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president’s budget request; not subject to congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest. The bottom line, Paige said, is that Congress has figured out ways to stuff earmarks into spending by calling them different names. ""We ended up creating our own proprietary definition,"" she said. ""We got sick and tired of the idea that one man’s pork is another’s constituent services."" The federal Office of Management and Budget, meanwhile, defines earmarks as ""funds provided by Congress for projects or programs where the congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents Executive Branch merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the Executive Branch to manage critical aspects of the funds allocation process."" OMB’s website lists all appropriation earmarks up to 2010. It stops there with a note that the earmark ban effectively halted the practice. But the benchmark is the definition used by the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ public policy research arm. Its definition is the most widely used and acknowledged, according to Oregon congressional representatives of both parties contacted by PolitiFact Oregon. According to the agency’s website, earmarks are ""Provisions associated with legislation (appropriations or general legislation) that specify certain congressional spending priorities or in revenue bills that apply to a very limited number of individuals or entities. Earmarks may appear in either the legislative text or report language (committee reports accompanying reported bills and joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report)."" That matches parts of Paige’s group’s definition, but doesn’t mesh with others. It says nothing about ""greatly exceeding the president’s budget request,"" ""not being requested by the president,"" or requests ""by only one chamber of Congress."" Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, another D.C.-based watchdog group, agreed that different groups have varying definitions for what constitutes an earmark. ""But on balance,"" he said, ""there is a moratorium. That’s not a false statement."" All agree that the moratorium is having an effect. Before the ban, Washington County could count on getting about $2 million in federal money every two years for targeted projects, said Dennis Mulvihill, who recently retired after a long stint as the county’s government relations manager. ""But since those bans were put in place, it’s been pretty dry,"" he said. ""Maybe other states are squeezing something out, but nothing’s coming to Oregon."" So what about King’s claim that Congress chalked up $2 billion in earmarks in 2012? Andrew Malcolm, a spokesman for Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, said it didn’t happen. ""After winning the majority in 2010, House Republicans kept their promise and adopted a ban on all earmarks,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""That earmark ban remains in place today."" Of course, as a member of the party that pressed for the earmark moratorium in the House, Walden has a vested interest in saying earmarks are no longer used. But he gets support in his statement from Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon. DeFazio, who said earmarks can be a useful way for Congress to give direction in how federal money is spent, said in an emailed statement, ""The so-called earmarks ban has shifted a tremendous amount of discretion to the executive branch and its political appointees."" He notes a shift in spending authority, in other words, but acknowledges the earmark ban is in effect and working. News outlets have tackled the question of earmarks and whether, in varying forms, they continue to exist even after the congressional ban. If a large appropriations bill ultimately directs millions to a dam and locks project in Kentucky, for instance, is that an earmark? It may not fit the definitions of the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional Research Service, but groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste might say yes. Because of that, if we were strictly rating the figure in the Pig Book, we might find an element of truth. But because King cited ""2 billion dollars in earmarks in fiscal year 2012"" -- not the $3.3 billion -- and because he offered with no sourcing for his figure, we find his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973B8E80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/15/karl-king/were-there-2-billion-earmarks-fiscal-year-2012-pol/

No evidence that so-called Satanic leader sacrificed 600 children
","A viral video shows a masked man who claims he sacrificed 675 people, many of them children, to maintain his demonic powers. The confession, which originally aired on a Ghanaian talk show, and its translations have been shared across the discredited Neon Nettle, as well as the Daily Mail. ""Satanic leader confesses to sacrificing 675 children ‘gifted’ to him by doctors,"" read the Neon Nettle headline on July 19. We decided to investigate the so-called confession. Is it real, or another online hoax? The story features screenshots from a video clip from a Ghanaian television show aired on Royal Television Ghana, also known as RTV. The man claiming to be a Satanic leader speaks with a deep voice, and hides his face with a children’s mask of Bumblebee from the Transformers movie franchise. The interviewer, a well-known television and radio presenter known as Otwinoko, does not identify the man. The original interview with the so-called Satanic leader is nearly 30 minutes long, and is part two of a series entitled ""DARKNESS IN CHURCHES."" The interview is conducted in Akan, a language native to Ghana. It has been summarized in English by Ghanaian news site Yen. According to the translation, the man claimed he lived with Satan for 17 years, and would conduct routine sacrifices to sustain his power. Evil doctors gave him these sacrifices, he said, many of whom were children. He also said that he was in control of over 600 demonic spirits. While there have been multiple local reports about the show itself, none have mentioned any police investigation into the issue. More widely, there have been no news reports of human sacrifice or doctors kidnapping children in Ghana. Otwinoko, whose real name is Kwabena Asare, specializes in spiritual outrage. He vigorously questions his guests, supposed anti-Christian magicians, but doesn’t release their identities. He has dozens of other videos online, many of which follow a similar style to the interview with this Satanic leader. In one video, titled ""PASTOR’S EVIL DEEDS EXPOSED,"" the thumbnail is a fiery 666. In another, he discusses the signs of the Antichrist. Debunking false prophets appears to be a routine feature on the show. As an individual, Otwinoko maintains a mystical persona. He is visually impaired, and he claims that jealous fellow journalists used voodoo to cause his blindness. The article by Neon Nettle claimed that ""a Satanic cult leader has confessed to carrying out more than 600 child sacrifices."" A man did confess this on a Ghanaian television show. The article does acknowledge that there have been no reports of mass child killings in Ghana, Satanic or otherwise. But, Neon Nettle fails to mention that this show has a long sensationalist history of interviewing supposed spiritual deviants and granting them anonymity. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A29D080>],/factchecks/2018/aug/01/blog-posting/no-evidence-so-called-satanic-leader-sacrificed-60/

Mahlon Mitchell has a point, but mostly misses in his attack on Scott Walker over school funding
","After Republican Scott Walker dubbed himself the ""education governor,"" many Democrats, figuratively speaking, started baying for blood. To them, Walker slashed and burned school funding in 2011 with his first state budget. They are galled by the notion of ""education governor,"" even if Walker has since been adding back funding. So, let’s sort out the Republican governor’s record on school funding. We’ll use a claim by state firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell, one of the eight Democrats hoping to win the Aug. 14, 2018, primary to run against Walker. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The claim Mitchell made his claim June 19, 2018, on the ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. He declared that Walker ""has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million, and he's calling that progress.""
  It’s a claim Mitchell has made repeatedly, in one form or another, and one we’re likely to hear again before the primary and the Nov. 6, 2018, general election. Based on previous fact checks we’ve done, there is an element of truth in Mitchell’s claim. But he gets into trouble, partly by mixing apples and oranges in the two figures he uses. ‘Cut’ $1.6 billion -- not really a cut Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On saying Walker cut $1.6 billion, Mitchell’s campaign cited a 2013 report by the Forward Institute, a Madison-based think tank that operated for several years. The report doesn’t state, though, that Walker made a $1.6 billion cut in education funding. Rather, it says he reduced by that amount the maximum that school districts could increase their property tax levies. The report’s author, Scott Wittkopf, who is advising the campaign of another Democrat for governor, Mike McCabe, told us Mitchell has a point but his statement reflects a common misunderstanding of the complexities of school funding. To flesh this out, here’s what we found in a 2011 fact check on a similar claim  — that Walker’s 2011-’13 budget ""cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion."" We rated it Mostly False. The 2009-’11 state budget, the one just prior to Walker’s first budget, cut state aid to schools and slowed the growth in how much school districts could raise from property taxes. That 2009-’11 budget, approved by a Democratic governor and Democratic-run Legislature, also directed the next Legislature to reset the property tax limit in the 2011-’13 budget (Walker’s first) to what it was before it was reduced. But Walker and the Legislature, which had turned Republican, did not abide by that directive. Instead, the 2011-’13 budget imposed a lower limit on how much school districts could increase their property taxes than what the 2009-’11 budget called for. In sum, some Democrats argue that by not abiding by the 2009-’11 budget directive, school districts were prevented from levying $1.6 billion more in property taxes. But that figure assumes that all school districts levy the maximum allowed in property taxes, which never occurs. And that calculation doesn’t take into account some school districts’ ability, under Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining legislation, to save money by requiring employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits. Bottom line: The $1.6 billion refers to a limit on school districts’ ability to increase how much they collect in property tax revenue, but it is not an actual funding cut. As we found in April 2018, in a fact checking a claim by another of the Democratic candidates, Tony Evers, the actual reduction in state funding of schools over the two-year period of Walker’s 2011-’13 state was $784 million. ‘Put back’ $630 million -- no, more than that The other part of Mitchell’s claim is meant to convey that, even though Walker touts recent increases he’s made in school funding, those increases don’t come close to making up what was cut. But Mitchell gets into trouble because, while the first part of his claim refers to the ability of school districts to raise taxes, the second part of his claim refers to actual cash that the state gives to school districts. Moreover, in saying that only $630 million has been put back, Mitchell’s campaign cites only Walker’s 2017-’19 state budget, which increases state funding to schools by $639 million. It provides for an additional $200 per student in the first year and additional $204 in the second year, as Walker now touts in his re-election campaign. But that wasn’t the first time Walker has increased state funding to schools. In fact, in each budget since the 2011 budget that reduced school funding, he has increased state funds to schools. The total restored is about $1 billion. That being said, as we found in the Evers fact check, during Walker’s tenure school districts have collected about $183.6 million less in state money than they would have had funding levels remained where they were when Walker took office. Our rating Mitchell says Walker ""has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million and he's calling that progress."" Walker’s first state budget in 2011 did reduce by $1.6 billion the maximum amount that school districts had expected they would be allowed to increase their property tax levies. So, that was not a cut, but it did curtail how much additional money school districts could raise on their own. On actual state funding of schools, Walker did cut about $784 million with his first state budget. But he has been adding back funding with each of his subsequent budgets, to the tune of about $1 billion in total. 
Mitchell’s statement contains an element of truth, but mixes apples and oranges and ignores facts that would give a different impression. Our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BE7A40>],/factchecks/2018/aug/01/mahlon-mitchell/mahlon-mitchell-has-point-mostly-misses-his-attack/

Jeff Sessions says 1 out of 30 in Greater Boston is in the country illegally
","Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to Boston to announce a law enforcement operation against ""crimes committed predominantly by illegal aliens,"" offering as context the number of immigrants in the country illegally who live in Boston and surrounding areas. He said identity theft was a ""very common"" offense committed by immigrants in the country illegally and gave an example of a defendant accused of stealing the identity of an American citizen displaced by recent hurricanes in Puerto Rico. ""Just imagine if you lost your home and your possessions and then you found out that an illegal alien had stolen your identity,"" Sessions said. The Greater Boston area, Sessions said, is one of the country's top 12 metro areas that's home to immigrants here illegally. ""According to these estimates, one out of every 30 people in the Greater Boston area is an illegal alien,"" Sessions said. We wondered if Sessions’ claim was correct. We found that nonpartisan data supports his claim. The Justice Department linked us to a February 2017 report from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center on the metro areas with the most immigrants living there without legal permission, based on 2014 estimates. Unauthorized immigrants accounted for 3.5 percent of the national population in 2014, Pew found. The Boston metro area — encompassing parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire — in 2014 had an estimated 180,000 unauthorized immigrants, or 3.7 percent of the area’s total population. (Margin of error was plus or minus 20,000 people.) The Boston metro area had more than 4.7 million people in 2014, according to the Census Bureau. Calculations of the Census’ 2014 population estimates and Pew’s estimates of the unauthorized population in 2014 (including with the margin of error) show Sessions’ claim was largely on target, if not underestimated. Dividing the Boston metro area’s current population of more than 4.8 million, by the lowest 2014 estimate of unauthorized immigrants, 160,000 (using Pew’s margin of error), leads to exactly ""one out of every 30,"" as Sessions said. ""We have a very immigrant-rich and diverse population, especially in Boston and adjacent cities, and a fraction of those immigrants are undocumented,"" said Marion Davis, Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition spokeswoman. ""In (the city of) Boston, more than 27 percent of the population is foreign-born,"" Davis said. In nearby Chelsea, 45 percent of the population is foreign-born, she noted. Sessions said, ""One out of every 30 people in the Greater Boston area is an illegal alien."" Sessions’ claim is supported by estimates from Pew Research Center and U.S. Census Bureau data. Factoring in a margin of error in Pew’s study would make Sessions’ claim a conservative estimate.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That's not right.
","President Donald Trump has consistently denied that any collusion took place between his campaign and Russia. Now, Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani are putting new emphasis on the question of whether collusion itself is a crime in the first place. ""Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn’t matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats),"" Trump tweeted July 31. Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn’t matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)! Giuliani made the same point a day before, telling CNN, ""I don't even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians."" This isn’t the first time Trump has dismissed collusion on legal grounds. In a December interview with the New York Times, he noted the views of Harvard emeritus law professor Alan Dershowitz. ""I watched Alan Dershowitz the other day,"" Trump said. ""He said, No. 1, there is no collusion, No. 2, collusion is not a crime."" For this fact-check, we’ll sort out how collusion overlaps with the law. The press uses the term collusion to describe a range of activities that might have taken place involving the Trump campaign and Russian representatives. Collusion is part of antitrust law (but those statutes are irrelevant in this situation). While the special counsel investigation has produced indictments and guilty pleas, it’s too early to say whether the Trump campaign broke any laws. Legal opinions vary, but people who know the law say that certain statutes could have been violated. The common use of the word collusion includes potentially illegal behavior. If Trump were talking about the purely legal use of the word collusion, he would be wrong. Collusion falls under federal antitrust law, and it involves competing companies that cut secret deals to boost each other’s profits. Trump isn’t using the word that way, and nor is anyone else. The issue is whether people in the Trump campaign knowingly boosted Russian efforts to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to the benefit of candidate Trump. Russia’s intentions are not disputed, at least not among U.S. intelligence agencies and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The focus is on what the Trump campaign did and whether that was illegal, regardless whether the relevant statute contains the word ""collusion."" Harvard legal scholar Dershowitz found it hard to see what law the Trump campaign might have broken, even if it knew in advance about emails that Russian operatives allegedly stole from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta. ""Obviously, if anyone conspired in advance with another to commit a crime, such as hacking the Democratic National Committee, that would be criminal,"" Dershowitz wrote in 2017. ""But merely seeking to obtain the work product of a prior hack would be no more criminal than a newspaper publishing the work products of thefts such as the Pentagon Papers and the material stolen by Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning."" Defense attorney William Jeffress told Politico that ""collusion with the Russians in attempting to affect the outcome of the presidential election is a serious political scandal, but I must say it is not clear that it provides a basis for criminal prosecution."" But other legal experts say that the Trump campaign could have run afoul of various laws. If Russia deployed its people, as Mueller described in his indictment of a dozen Russians, then it spent money and that could be a legal hazard for the Trump campaign. Nathaniel Persily at Stanford University Law School said one relevant statute is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. ""A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime,"" Persily told us in 2017. ""And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime."" Persily pointed to a 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on the 2002 law. The judges said that the law bans foreign nationals ""from making expenditures to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate."" Another election law specialist, John Coates at Harvard University Law School, said if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure. ""The related funds could also be viewed as an illegal contribution to any candidate who coordinates (colludes) with the foreign speaker,"" Coates said. University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said that in addition to possible violations of campaign finance laws, the Trump campaign could be open to another charge. ""If others participated in the scheme to do this, it could be a conspiracy,"" Hasen said. ""Whether you want to call that ‘collusion’ or not seems besides the point."" The Lawfare Blog, a project with ties to the Brookings Institution, explored whether the Trump campaign was as safe as Dershowitz said when it came to the stolen emails. There is room in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for people to be punished for helping distribute hacked materials. The hacking itself might be only a misdemeanor, but publishing the emails could turn into a felony under state and federal laws. If people in the Trump campaign knew that a release was in the cards, they could be accused of aiding and abetting that transgression. ""A defendant wouldn’t have to have been involved from the outset, but he or she would have needed to be aware of the larger scheme before deciding to participate in the second element—the part that made it a felony—for accomplice liability to attach,"" the Lawfare authors wrote. Josh Douglas at the University of Kentucky Law School offered two other possible relevant statutes. ""Collusion in a federal election with a foreign entity could potentially fall under other crimes, such as against public corruption,"" Douglas said. ""There's also a general anti-coercion federal election law."" And as always in an investigation, if people lie to federal agents or otherwise try to cover their tracks, that is a felony as well. However, that could be seen as a separate act from any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump said that collusion is not a crime. If he means that in a strictly legal sense, he is wrong because collusion is part of antitrust legislation. If he means it in the only way that fits with Russian interference in the 2016 election, then a broader definition applies. Some legal experts don’t see how coordinating with the Russians violates the criminal code. But others can name specific statutes that could be triggered. Those laws don’t include the word ""collusion,"" but they do cover the sort of actions under investigation by the special counsel. Activities by the Trump campaign might have broken laws that deal with elections, public corruption or computer fraud. We don’t say that anyone in the Trump campaign violated these laws. The point is that coordination with Russian representatives potentially could violate them. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971027C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-collusion-no-crime-right/

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown votes with Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, Renacci says
","Ohio Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci says his Democratic opponent Sen. Sherrod Brown votes in step with Democratic leadership and liberals. Renacci held a July 10 press conference in Cincinnati to call for term limits. ""People start voting not for their state anymore but they start voting for their leadership,"" Renacci said. ""And we have seen that with our Sen. Sherrod Brown who votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren."" Renacci was referring to the voting records of Schumer, who is the Democratic Senate leader and represents New York, as well as Warren, who represents Massachusetts and is a potential 2020 presidential contender to challenge President Donald Trump. We found that Renacci is largely correct on the numbers but we will add some context. In recent years, the average senator voted with his or her party about 90 percent of the time when a majority of Democrats took a position different from a majority of Republicans, said Steven S. Smith, Washington University political science professor. ""In this context, a serious look at a senator’s record requires more digging. On what issues did the senator introduce legislation, offer amendments, address in public statements, or pursue on committee or in conference?"" Renacci’s campaign pointed to vote data compiled by Congressional Quarterly, which showed that Brown voted with Schumer 96 percent of the time between 2007 and 2018. For the comparison with Warren, who joined the Senate in 2013, the Renacci campaign pulled CQ data showing Brown voted the same as Warren about 94 percent of the time.   We used ProPublica’s public database which provides head-to-head comparisons, and found similar results. So the numbers aren’t in dispute. We have fact-checked several previous claims that Democrats voted with former President Barack Obama or their party the vast majority of the time and generally rated them Mostly True if the numbers were on target. Most Democrats and Republicans largely vote with their respective party, but using only the statistic doesn’t tell the full story about a senator’s record. The straight-up vote comparisons here between three Democratic senators don’t tell the full story about Brown’s voting record, either. Brown’s campaign spokesman Preston Maddock pointed to some key votes on which Brown opposed Warren. For example, in 2014, Brown voted to adopt the conference report on the farm bill and was tapped by leadership to reconcile differences between the House and the Senate. Warren was among Senate Democrats who opposed any cuts to food stamps and voted against the legislation. In 2015, Brown voted to adopt the conference report to reauthorize federal transportation programs and renew the charter of the Export-Import bank. Under the bill, Brown said Ohio was set to receive an increase in money for highway and transit projects. Warren opposed the legislation because she said it rolled back rules that protect consumers and our financial system. In 2016, Brown voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which authorized $1 bill to states to combat the opioid crisis. Warren said the bill was ""hijacked"" by the pharmaceutical industry and opposed it. Brown also voted for some of Trump’s nominees in 2017 whom Warren opposed, including Ben Carson to head up Housing and Urban Development and Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary. Brown supported U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's confirmation, while Schumer opposed him. While Brown has criticized Trump on several fronts, Maddock pointed to some examples on which the Democratic senator has been in agreement with the president. For example, Brown supported the Interdict Act to make it easier for customs officials to block fentanyl from getting into the U.S. The law passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Trump signed the House version into law, while Brown was a cosponsor of the Senate version. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio’s Republican senator, also backed the bill, and both Portman and Brown attended a signing ceremony for the new law at the White House.   Brown and Trump also share some views on trade. Brown has said Trump’s order on raising imported steel will help stabilize steel jobs in Ohio. Experts told us that it’s no surprise that senators from the same party often vote the same. ""Democrats tend to vote with fellow Democrats, just as Republicans tend to vote with their party. The existence of parties and winner-take-all congressional primaries incentivizes party-line voting,"" University of Akron political science professor David Cohen said. The vote comparison among Democrats omits that the Senate reaches bipartisan consensus on some issues, for example, the recent unanimous vote in the Senate to express opposition to allowing the Russians to interrogate American diplomats, said University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger. ""There may be a lot of issues on which Brown disagrees with Schumer and/or Warren that do not come to the Senate floor, so their roll call voting record may overstate their actual policy agreement,"" Koger said. Using the ProPublica database of votes, we found that Renacci voted the same as House Majority Leader Paul Ryan about 89 percent of the time. Renacci said Brown ""votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren."" The numbers are largely correct and not in dispute. But it’s not unusual for members of the same party to vote together, and it doesn’t tell the full story about their voting record.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Larry Kudlow']","
Trump economic chief Larry Kudlow wrong about CBO report on tax cuts
","With the economy growing at 4.1 percent in the last quarter, the White House sees vindication of its policies ahead of the midterm elections. Larry Kudlow, top economic adviser to President Donald Trump, pressed a point about the Republican tax cuts in the closing seconds of a CBS interview Sunday. ""Even the CBO numbers show now that the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP,"" Kudlow told Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan on July 29. ""These are all good things, Margaret."" In light of the Congressional Budget Office’s forecast that deficits will continue to grow, Kudlow’s statement that CBO now projects that the tax cuts will pay for themselves bears a closer look. When the CBO looked at the impacts of the tax cut law, it found that it increased the deficit by a total of $1.8 trillion between 2018 and 2028. That included the economic growth effects of the tax cuts. The CBO’s latest long-range forecast predicted lower revenues than it had before passage of the tax cut law. In the 2018-28 period, the government would collect $884 billion less than the CBO previously forecast. Economists, including a member of CBO’s Board of Economic Advisers, could not identify the source in CBO reports that supported Kudlow’s claim. The central argument for tax cuts is that with lower rates, companies will invest more in plants and equipment, which will make workers more productive. And individuals will have more incentive to work because Uncle Sam will get a smaller slice of their paychecks. A growing economy will, the argument goes, make up for the money the government would have collected through higher tax rates. It would be a big deal if the CBO agreed with this argument. The agency is the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress. The problem for Kudlow is that the CBO hasn’t. ""I am quite familiar with the CBO analysis and have no clue what Larry Kudlow is talking about,"" said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley and a member of CBO's board of economic advisers. The CBO pointed to its April 2018 report. It devoted an appendix to the tax law alone. In this key table below, the section on ""macroeconomic feedback"" is where the CBO puts its estimate of how higher economic growth from the tax cuts is expected to increase revenues.  Tax analyst Nicole Kaeding at the conservative Tax Foundation said Kudlow had exaggerated. Citing the table, she said the CBO expects the tax cuts to reduce deficits by a total of $461 billion over 11 years. ""This is well below the $1.5 trillion in static cost of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,"" Kaeding said. The foundation ran its own analysis that assumed the economic impact would be greater than the CBO predicted. It still came up short. ""We estimated a net cost of approximately $450 billion,"" Kaeding said. Overall, the CBO estimated that the tax cuts would add $1.8 trillion to the nation’s debt. Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw, former chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, told us, ""I do not know what numbers Larry (Kudlow) is referring to."" ""A reasonable rule of thumb, in my judgment, is that about one-third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth,"" Mankiw told PolitiFact in 2017. That is pretty much what the CBO estimated. It’s not as though the tax cuts don’t juice the economy. The CBO said they would boost growth by 0.3 percent in 2018 and by 2022,  the level of GDP would be a full 1 percent higher than it would have been. The trouble is, the growth alone doesn’t close the revenue gap, and with deficits higher than they would have been, interest rates would also edge up as government borrowing rose. Higher interest rates means Washington will pay more for its borrowed money. That further undercuts the ability of tax cuts to pay for themselves. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Kudlow said the CBO agreed that ""the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP."" The CBO reports do not reach that conclusion. The CBO pointed to its analysis showing the growth impact of the tax cuts reducing deficits by a bit less than a third of the cost of the tax cuts themselves. Economists who know the CBO’s work told us the congressional budget forecasters did not say what Kudlow asserted. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9B1C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/31/larry-kudlow/wh-economic-chief-kudlow-wrongly-says-cbo-agrees-t/

Matt Flynn's claims that Foxconn is under investigation in China for fraud fall short
","Ever since Gov. Scott Walker signed a $3 billion agreement with Taiwan-based Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, the deal has been an object of controversy in Wisconsin politics. The complaints from Democratic gubernatorial candidates have ranged from the size of the deal to the cost per new job to the environmental impact of the plant. Matt Flynn, one of eight remaining hopefuls, offered a different one in an April 12, 2018, interview with Green Bay’s WFRV-TV. In the interview, Flynn claimed Foxconn ""is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, environmental fraud and labor fraud."" That's quite a lot of fraud. But is the claim itself fraudulent or on target? When we asked Flynn's campaign to provide backup for the claims, it cited several news articles detailing various investigations into Foxconn's activities. We made our own checks as well. All the articles cited refer to past investigations rather than ongoing ones, as claimed by Flynn, and they did not necessarily discover any instances of fraud. Additionally, most of the investigations cited were not official governmental reviews, as implied by Flynn’s statement. Rather, they were conducted by advocacy groups and media organizations. Let’s take a look at each of the areas Flynn cited. The environment Flynn said Foxconn is under investigation for environmental fraud. When asked for backup, his campaign cited a 2013 investigation by Chinese regulators  after allegations the electronics supplier had dumped heavy toxic metals into canals that lead to a nearby river. The campaign also cited another investigation, though this one was not government-led: Pressured by environmental groups, Apple in 2012 agreed to conduct independent environmental reviews of some of its suppliers, including Foxconn. Steph Tai, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, framed it this way: An environmental violation is noncompliance with environmental law, whereas environmental fraud is concealing the fact of that noncompliance. They are different legal categories. But the boundary between the two categories is often hazy. Last year, a firm owned by Foxconn subsidiary FIH mobile in Hebei province’s Langfang city tried to stop the Chinese environment ministry's pollution inspectors from making checks during a nationwide investigation of more than 3,000 companies. Does this constitute violating environmental laws or environmental fraud? According to Tai, it could be both, because most operating permits require a company to allow inspectors inside. Preventing inspectors from making checks would thus violate the dictates of the permit. ""If this sounds like such claims could overlap a lot, don't worry,"" said Tai. ""They often do in these kinds of cases."" Flynn’s campaign disputed Tai’s definition of fraud, arguing that fraud encompasses a broader range of illegal activities than concealment. Labor A similar absence of government-led inquiries and legal ambiguities plague Flynn's claim on the subject of labor fraud. It is true that Foxconn has been investigated multiple times for alleged labor abuses, though none of the investigations were government-led. More importantly, none of the investigations are ongoing. Most recently, between August 2017 and April 2018, the U.S.-based advocacy group China Labor Watch investigated the Hengyang Foxconn plant in Hunan province, which primarily manufactures Amazon Echo Dot and Kindle devices. The group identified numerous labor violations, including excessive hours, low wages, and inadequate training. Peak production season saw employees putting in more than 100 overtime hours per month, far beyond the 36 hours allowed under Chinese law. In some instances, employees worked 14 consecutive days. About 40 percent of the workforce was comprised of ""dispatch"" workers (temporary, low-cost, agency-recruited staffers) -- far in excess of the 10 percent limit under Chinese law. Dispatch workers had limited pre-job safety training, underpaid overtime hours and unpaid sick leave. Still, China Labor Watch declined to identify these labor violations as labor fraud. ""I cannot say for certain whether our findings would constitute as labor fraud,"" said Winnie Shen, a program assistant at China Labor Watch, in an email. In 2012, the New York Times published an investigation into labor violations at Foxconn, including extended overtime and crowded living conditions for workers. It also documented multiple factory explosions caused by combustible aluminum dust, which had amassed in high concentrations due to poor ventilation. Later that year, an audit of three of Foxconn's Apple facilities and over 35,000 workers by the Fair Labor Association, a collaborative initiative between universities and businesses that promotes workers’ rights, unearthed labor abuses not dissimilar from those recently found by China Labor Watch. During peak production, employees worked an average number of hours that exceeded Chinese legal limits. The Fair Labor Association also found that 14 percent of workers potentially didn't receive fair compensation for unscheduled overtime. Later that year, Foxconn reached an agreement with Apple to improve conditions for millions of workers assembling iPhones and iPads. The FLA later confirmed Foxconn had improved working conditions ahead of schedule, though employees still described these measures as insufficient. The FLA’s report has also been subject to criticism.  Some other examples of Foxconn’s labor violations: In 2006, the British newspaper The Mail reported on extensive hours, low wages, crowded dorms and military-style drills. In 2010, a rash of workers committed suicide to raise awareness of poor labor conditions. Foxconn responded by pledging to improve working conditions and installing netting around dormitories to catch falling workers. In 2012, 150 employees at the company's Wuhan production facility threatened to commit suicide over a wage dispute. Whether the company's persistent violations of Chinese labor law constitutes fraud is the question. ""To me, fraud does not seem like the right word,"" said Mary Gallagher, director of the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. She noted that an example of fraud would be ""keeping two sets of working time reports, so that it appears to be no violations of overtime."" Again, however, the Flynn campaign argued that fraud encompasses a broader range of illegal activities than concealment. Securities In this case, the Flynn campaign did cite an official government investigation: an initial public offering (IPO) review of the company conducted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which scrutinized all of Foxconn’s present and past transactions. Such reviews are part of the standard procedure for being granted an IPO. As such, Flynn’s statement is misleading because it implies that Foxconn was investigated for a specific legal breach rather than as part of a standard procedure. The first statement suggests malice, the second suggests nothing. Moreso, the Chinese securities regulatory investigation concluded on March 8, 2018. Flynn made his claim on April 12. As such, Foxconn would not have been under investigation for securities fraud at the time he made his statement, as he implied. Although not cited by the Flynn campaign, reports show Foxconn has been investigated for bribery. In 2013, authorities in Taiwan investigated allegations that Foxconn Technology employees had accepted bribes from the company's supply-chain partners. They eventually detained several former executives. According to Foxconn, it had requested an investigation from authorities after an internal audit uncovered a few violations -- though the company insisted these violations were limited in scope. So while Chinese authorities did briefly look into Foxconn for alleged bribery, the scope of the investigation was extremely limited, and it is not clear that it found any instances of securities violations, let alone securities fraud. The Flynn campaign also cited two blog posts that described questionable business practices at Foxconn. But neither related to a formal investigation, let alone an ongoing one. As for Foxconn, the company issued a statement to us that read: ""Foxconn can state that there is no truth to the claim made by Mr. Flynn regarding our company’s operations in China. Foxconn is committed to fulfilling our responsibilities as a global industry leader and good corporate citizen.  As part of that commitment, Foxconn works hard to ensure we comply with all relevant laws and regulations in all markets where we operate."" Our rating Flynn claimed that Foxconn ""is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, labor fraud and environmental fraud."" 
But all of the investigations cited by Flynn are old. The violations uncovered by some do not necessarily constitute fraud, while a few others did not find any violations at all. Much of the evidence cited comes from outside groups, including advocacy groups and even media companies, rather than the government. We rate Flynn’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9BE80>],/factchecks/2018/jul/31/matt-flynn/flynns-claims-against-foxconn-fall-short-actual-fr/

No, Donald Trump's poll numbers do not beat Lincoln, all other GOP presidents
","President Donald Trump is known for tooting his own horn. In recent weeks, one of the accomplishments he’s been trumpeting is his standing with Republican voters. In a July 29 tweet, Trump wrote, ""Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!"" Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll! It wasn’t the first time he’d said something similar. On July 10, he said in a tweet, ""New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in history of the Party."" And three days later, in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, Trump said, ""You know, a poll just came out that I am the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party. Beating Lincoln. I beat our Honest Abe."" Trump has reason to crow about his popularity among Republicans: His approval rating within his own party has ranged from 84 percent to 90 percent since mid April 2018. The ratings for approval among Republicans ""are moving in a narrow range,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. ""They are very high and pretty stable."" And the media has taken note. Around Trump’s 500th day in office on June 4, there were a flurry of articles that noted how Trump’s approval ratings at that point in their tenure were higher than those of most previous Republican presidents, at least among respondents in their own party. For instance, the Daily Mail cited Gallup — the longest-running source for presidential approval ratings – to report that Republicans’ support for Trump, then at 87 percent, was higher on his 500th day than any post-war president except for George W. Bush, who was at 96 percent with Republicans after the 9/11 attacks. (For that matter, no Democrat had a higher rating with Democrats than Trump did with Republicans.) But the way Trump phrased his tweet was problematic. One concern involves polling at the time of Honest Abe — to be precise, the lack thereof. The other involves higher approval ratings of recent Republican presidents. Unscientific straw polls date to at least 1824, with ""informal trial heat tallies"" ""taken in scattered taverns, militia offices, and public meetings,"" D. Sunshine Hillygus, a Duke University political scientist, has written. But the polls of Lincoln’s time are not considered scientific. The idea of scientific polling came into its own after a disastrous 1936 poll by Literary Digest, a popular magazine. The magazine’s poll was based on responses from millions of Americans, but the data it gathered had a significantly different demographic balance than the electorate as a whole. This lack of scientific rigor led the poll to incorrectly call the 1936 presidential election, opening the door to survey methods championed by George Gallup and others. Gallup began polling in 1935 using a method that's different from today's but rigorous for its time. Early polls by Gallup determined the demographic makeup of the electorate, then assigned survey-takers to visit far-flung locales in order to personally interview respondents with certain demographic characteristics. Today, reputable pollsters use a better system: random sampling to choose phone numbers from across the country, which they then call to ask standardized, carefully worded questions. The assumption is that a truly random sample will reproduce the whole nation in microcosm to within a few percentage points of accuracy (the familiar ""margin of error""). Modern polling has its critics, and the industry has had to adapt its methods to account for factors such as the growing use of cell phones. One newer type of poll is based on online ""panels"" of voters designed to mirror the demographics of the electorate. Despite its imperfections, scientific polling remains the best tool available. And Lincoln never faced it. Now let’s look at the only Republican presidents for whom scientific polling data exists. The most recent publicly available data from Gallup’s weekly tracking poll at the time of Trump’s tweet showed him with 85 percent approval from Republicans. So how does that 85 percent rating compare with his Republican predecessors? We looked at Gallup historical data for Republican presidents going back to Eisenhower. We looked for the closest polling data for July 29 of their second year in office (the day of Trump’s claim). We used the equivalent period after the inauguration of Gerald Ford, who unlike the others was not sworn in on Jan. 20. President Approval rating among Republicans, near July 29 of second year Donald Trump 85 percent George W. Bush 96 percent George H.W. Bush* 79 percent or 91 percent Ronald Reagan 74 percent Gerald Ford 67 percent Richard Nixon 81 percent Dwight Eisenhower 92 percent *For the elder Bush, Gallup polling around the relevant date was less frequent; we’re showing the closest results on either side of that date, one of which is higher than Trump and the other of which is lower. So, as of the point of Trump’s tweet, not only did George W. Bush have a higher approval rating among Republicans, but so did Dwight Eisenhower and, arguably, George H.W. Bush. Two other points of comparison make Trump’s achievement less impressive. One is to compare Trump’s highest approval rating of his tenure so far — 90 percent as recently as mid-July — to the record-high rating for his predecessors through July 29 of their second year in office. President Highest approval rating among Republicans through July 29 of second year Donald Trump 90 percent George W. Bush 99 percent George H.W. Bush 94 percent Ronald Reagan 92 percent Gerald Ford 77 percent Richard Nixon 90 percent Dwight Eisenhower 92 percent By this measure, Trump actually ties for the second-worst of any post-World War II Republican president, surpassing only Ford. Another approach is to compare each president on the highest approval rating of their tenure. (Trump has only been in office for a year and a half, but he opened the door to this analysis by claiming the ""highest poll numbers in the history of the Republican Party."") President Highest approval rating among Republicans, entire time in office Donald Trump 90 percent George W. Bush 99 percent George H.W. Bush 97 percent Ronald Reagan 94 percent Gerald Ford 80 percent Richard Nixon 91 percent Dwight Eisenhower 95 percent Once again, by this measure, Trump fares the second worst of any post-war Republican president, only surpassing Ford. By historical standards, Trump has had ""solid, but not extraordinary in-party approval,"" said Kathleen Joyce Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. Worth noting: The differences in some cases are small and would be within the margin of error. While Trump remains popular among Republicans, it’s worth noting that his approval rating among Americans as a whole is quite a bit lower. (Trump’s 40 percent approval rating, per Gallup, was exceeded by all of his predecessors at that point in their presidencies.) In the meantime, a smaller proportion of Americans are identifying themselves as Republicans, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. According to Gallup, the share of Americans who call themselves Republicans was 31 percent from Feb. 1-5, 2017, the first measure after Trump was inaugurated. But between March and July 2018, that number has ranged between 23 percent and 27 percent. While the shift is small, Smith said, it may be a sign that some critics of Trump within the Republican Party are simply leaving the party for now, rather than registering a negative assessment to pollsters as a Republican. Trump said, ""Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan."" Credit where credit is due: Trump is very popular among Republicans, and at one point, his approval rating within his own party trailed only George W. Bush among postwar Republican presidents. However, no pre-1936 president served in an era with scientific polling, so Trump’s comparison of himself to Lincoln is spurious. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating at the time of the tweet ranked in the middle of the post-World War II Republican presidents, and measured in other ways, his support among Republicans was actually worse than every post-war Republican president except for Gerald Ford.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Wisconsin', 'Doug La Follette']","
Doug La Follette says he's been Wisconsin secretary of state about 25 years, but it's been nearly 40
","The first question posed to Doug La Follette in a July 18, 2018 interview on WisconsinEye, the public affairs television network, was simple enough. ""Now, you have been secretary of state for how long, total?"" host Steven Walters asked. ""Well, I think around 25 years. I’d have to look it up,"" La Follette replied. Um. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Perhaps La Follette couldn’t recall. Or perhaps he wanted to downplay how long he has held the job. Counting the years La Follette’s opponent in the Aug. 14, 2018 Democratic primary, Madison Ald. Arvina Martin, told the Capital Times when launching her campaign ""it may be time for some new ideas, new blood and someone with a different point of view."" So, just how long has La Follette held the secretary of state’s job? Nearly 40 years. From the official Wisconsin Blue Book’s list of secretaries of state: Doug La Follette 1975-1979 Vel Phillips 1979-1983 Doug La Follette 1983-present So, La Follette served four years before being replaced by Phillips, the only black person ever elected to statewide office in Wisconsin. That was when he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor. After reclaiming the office by defeating Phillips in the 1982 election, La Follette has since served in the job for another 35.5 years and counting. (La Follette is more accurate about his time in office on his campaign website. He notes that he served as a state legislator for two years until 1974, and ""was then elected secretary of state and has been re-elected every four years for the past 30 years."") All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Over the years, the Legislature has gradually reduced the duties of the secretary of state. La Follette said in the interview his office once had 50 employees and now it’s just him and one other full-time employee. The winner of the La Follette-Martin race will face the winner of the two-way Republican primary in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. Spencer Zimmerman of Janesville is campaigning to make the secretary of state’s position Wisconsin’s ""chief protocol officer for international relations,"" while Jay Schroeder of Neenah is campaigning to eliminate the office altogether. When we contacted La Follette about his statement, by the way, he said he would have to ""do a little calculation."" Then later he emailed us, saying: ""Wow, I did some math.

"['Education', 'Illinois', 'Dorothy Brown']","
No, Chicago’s pre-K program is not in decline
","Mayor Rahm Emanuel has long made improving early-childhood education a cornerstone of his agenda. In 2013, his administration made universal full-day kindergarten a reality. Since then, he has pushed to expand access to pre-kindergarten as well. And this spring, he announced plans for achieving free, full-day pre-K for all four-year-olds by 2021. So it caught our attention when Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown, one of a large crop of potential candidates looking to challenge the mayor in next year’s city election, declared preschool in Chicago has slipped under Emanuel’s watch. ""We need to have a funded pre-K,"" Brown said during a WGN radio interview. ""Pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office. By the time children get to the first grade, they’re already behind if they have not had pre-K."" Brown’s provocative statement offered little by way of context and left a number of questions hanging. Did she mean preschool funding had decreased? That enrollment had fallen? Or was she suggesting the program overall was spiraling? We decided to check. A spokeswoman for Brown’s campaign said Brown was referring to overall pre-K enrollment figures and pointed us to a Chicago Teachers Union press release published in May following Emanuel’s announcement that he plans to roll out universal full-day preschool for all four-year-olds. The CTU, a longtime adversary of the mayor’s, blasted Emanuel for allowing enrollment to slip by 18 percent since taking office. Indeed, there were 19,441 preschoolers enrolled at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year—4,264 fewer than there were in the 2010-11 school year at the tail end of which Emanuel became mayor. But while the CTU—and Brown by extension—are correct about the pre-K enrollment decrease, that decline alone doesn’t necessarily prove her broader point that CPS’ preschool program is headed in the wrong direction under Emanuel. For one thing, enrollment throughout the district has declined overall in recent years, meaning some drop in the number of preschool students isn’t surprising. More importantly, though, focusing on that enrollment decrease alone doesn’t account for a significant—and positive—change in Chicago’s preschool landscape that has occurred since Emanuel took office in 2011. Back then, full-day pre-K programs run by the district were virtually nonexistent, according to Arthur Reynolds, an early-education expert at the University of Minnesota who has studied full-day preschool in Chicago. The increase in the number of spaces available inside full-day preschool classrooms since 2012 is ""enormous,"" Reynolds wrote in an email. ""Now this is the model for the city."" Indeed, full-day public pre-K slots have risen by roughly 75 percent since Emanuel took office, according to the city. A spokeswoman for the mayor’s office also noted that spots in such programs are now in greater demand than those in part-day programs. ""Under Mayor Emanuel’s leadership, Chicago has shifted its approach to offer as many full-day opportunities as possible, because research shows that they provide a stronger academic foundation for children and better meet the needs of working families,"" spokeswoman Lauren Markowitz wrote in an email. In pursuing that goal, Markowitz said, CPS has increased the total number of full-day seats in Chicago's public pre-K programs from about 10,000 in 2011 to more than 17,500 today. Those figures include approximately 10,000 full-day seats available annually at district-authorized community-based organizations. Prior to Emanuel’s first term, full-day programs run directly by CPS were almost nonexistent. So what’s with the decrease? In order to ramp up the number of full-day spots, Markowitz explained, CPS has converted some classrooms that served two half-day sessions into full-day ones, which reduces the number of kids served at those locations by half. They’ve been adding new full-day classes too, though not at a rate fast enough to counteract the overall decline in capacity at CPS-operated programs, which pencils out to about 14 percent. Loading... But many education experts agree, as the mayor’s office contends, that the benefits of high-quality, full-day preschool programs are worth investing in, even though overall enrollment may fall in the process. In a 2014 study of children attending preschool at child-parent centers that serve low-income communities in Chicago, for instance, Reynolds and his colleagues found full-day preschool was associated with higher levels of school readiness and better attendance than half-day programs. In light of the research guiding the mayor’s plan, we followed up with Brown to clarify her stance on full-day preschool expansion. Her spokeswoman sent a statement from the candidate that attempted to have it both ways. ""Any decrease in the numbers of our children able to access high-quality early educational options is unacceptable,"" Brown’s statement said. ""I am supportive of full-day preschool because it will set the bar for their entire educational experience."" While knocking Emanuel’s education record, Brown said ""pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office."" When we sought clarity, her campaign pointed to a decline in preschool enrollment during Emanuel’s tenure. Brown’s correct on that count, but the number of enrolled preschoolers isn’t the best way to assess the overall health of Chicago’s pre-K programming. First, the district’s population as a whole has dropped during that period, likely contributing to that decrease. Second, available spots in full-day preschool programs have increased by 75 percent under Emanuel, and many parents are snapping them up. As part of that expansion process, some part-day classrooms have been converted to full-day ones, cutting the total number of students those rooms can serve. But research supports investing in full-day preschool programming, especially for lower-income children, because it helps better prepare them for school. Brown’s campaign pointed us to numbers that are technically accurate but don’t tell the full story. We rate her claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708D2C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/29/dorothy-brown/no-chicagos-pre-k-program-not-decline/

Sununu says nabbing drug traffickers at border patrol checkpoints is federal government's job
","As the country was debating a federal policy of separating children and parents when they illegally enter the country, New Hampshire has been home to its own immigration debate. For almost a year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have set up shop on Interstate 93 in Woodstock, conducting a mandatory checkpoint for southbound vehicles on summer weekends. Motorists passing through are lined up, stopped and questioned by agents on their citizenship. Some applauded the checkpoints as a useful front in northern border control, but civil libertarians bristled at what they see as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. Recently, Gov. Chris Sununu defended the use of the checkpoints, invoking a well-publicized side effect of the stops: drug enforcement. ""Every time they’ve done those border patrols, they’ve taken out people who have trafficked drugs,"" Sununu said on June 26. ""That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job."" PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to explore whether arresting people for drug offenses is part of the federal government’s role at immigration checkpoints within the Granite State. Backing up the statement, Sununu’s spokesman pointed to the Customs and Border Patrol mission statement relating to the drug checks, which is two fold: ""Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to (1) detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border and (2) to detect illegal narcotics,"" the agency states on its website.  And Sununu is correct that the federal government has used the checkpoints in the recent past to facilitate drug arrests, according to Customs and Border Patrol and widespread media coverage of the stops. But a series of court decisions indicate that Sununu’s characterization is at odds with state and federal law. To start, the drug arrests were carried out by local law enforcement, not by federal agents directly. Over two multi-day stops in 2017, federal agents netted 984 grams (2.2 pounds) of marijuana and other drugs in narcotics, news releases said. But the 18 arrests for drug possession were handed over to the town of Woodstock Police Department, according to a CBP spokeswoman and Ryan Oleson, Woodstock Police Chief. In other words, the federal agents aren’t the ones making drug arrests. Local police are. During the same checkpoint, federal agents said they arrested eight people who did not have a valid immigration status, two of whom had overstayed their visa. The individuals were from Bulgaria, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala. In total, 55 undocumented people have been detained and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the four checkpoints set up since August 2017, according to CBP. Four more are planned this summer. Still, regardless of which agency brought out the handcuffs, Sununu’s comment raises a more basic question: Do drug arrests conducted at checkpoints fall under ""the federal government’s role"" - specifically Customs and Border Protection’s role? And Sununu’s comment about the ""federal government's role"" raises a larger question about the purpose of the checkpoints -- are they to catch illegal immigrants or drug offenders?    On this, the U.S. Supreme Court and state Supreme Court are clear: The checkpoints must be intended for immigration enforcement, not drug searches. The federal precedent  Inland border checkpoints -- those positioned up to 100 miles of the physical border -- have been in use since at least 1953, when a U.S. Department of Justice rule was passed authorizing the practice. They cleared their first major legal test in 1976, in the Supreme Court case U.S. vs. Martinez-Fuerte. In that case, three people arrested at a checkpoint at an interstate between San Diego and Los Angeles were appealing their immigration charges on constitutional grounds. The court held that immigration checkpoints did not constitute a violation on the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure -- even without specific probable cause. The decision gave the green light to inland CBP checkpoints in dozens of other states, including New Hampshire. But Martinez-Fuerte did not uphold the use of those checkpoints for searches of vehicles. The majority opinion made clear that the role of the checkpoints was to into citizenship status and papers, and expressly forbade automatic searches. ""Neither the vehicle nor its occupants are searched, and visual inspection of the vehicle is limited to what can be seen without a search,"" wrote Justice Lewis Powell, Jr. for the majority. That distinction was made even more clear in Indianapolis v. Edmond, a 2000 decision that centered on a targeted drug enforcement initiative. In 1998, Indianapolis operated a series of vehicle checkpoints specifically designed to interdict drugs. But the Supreme Court took issue, finding the practice of mandatory vehicle searches without probable clause a clear Fourth Amendment violation. In that decision, the court drew a line between the drug searches and other forms of stops. Immigration checkpoints near the border were established by Martinez-Fuerte, the court held. And the court had already separately held that sobriety checkpoints — directly connected to the act and dangers of driving — were not overly-intrusive. But the drug possession checkpoints were inappropriate, the justices decided. Today, Customs and Border Patrol officials are careful to characterize any drug arrests as ancillary to the primary purpose of the checkpoints: immigration checks. Shortly after the second New Hampshire checkpoint of 2017 — held in September — Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman Stephanie Malin made clear the boundaries of permitted behavior in a statement to the Monitor. ""At a Border Patrol checkpoint, an agent may question a vehicle’s occupants about their citizenship, place of birth, and request document proof of immigration status, how legal status was obtained and make quick observations of what is in plain view in the interior of the vehicle,"" she said. However, she added: ""While running immigration checkpoints agents will sometimes encounter subjects with illegal contraband. In these instances, we will work with our state and local partners to mitigate the case accordingly."" The ‘Live Free or Die’ exception Even though the Supreme Court has made clear what the primary purpose of the checkpoints should be, it hasn’t prevented the drug arrests that sometimes accompany them. In fact, courts in several states have held that those arrests are valid, even when done using drug sniffing dogs and a lack of specific probable cause. That’s where New Hampshire differs. In a May 1 state circuit court decision, Judge Thomas Rappa, Jr. moved to suppress drug evidence collected during the 2017 checkpoints. Federal officers walked drug sniffing dogs between the cars and those vehicles that the dogs ""alerted"" were pulled aside and searched. The evidence collected in this manner was used to support possession charges against 18  people charged with drug offenses, all U.S. citizens. ""The CBP (border patrol) and the WPD (Woodstock Police Department) were working in collaboration with each other with the understanding that the WPD would take possession of any drugs seized below the federal guidelines for prosecution in federal court and bring charges in this court based on that evidence,"" Rappa wrote. ""The evidence was seized in violation of constitutional rights recognized by the New Hampshire Supreme Court."" Rappa indicated that the underpinning reasons have more to do with the state constitution than the federal constitution. While courts have allowed such drug arrests to stand in neighboring states like Vermont and Maine, New Hampshire’s Supreme Court has long established stringent search and seizure limits, rooted in Part I, Article 19 of the state constitution. A 1990 decision in State v Pellici, a New Hampshire case, established that the arbitrary use of drug sniffing dogs by state police would violate that article. Rappa said that precedent would apply to federal officers as well. ""This Court finds that given that the defendants in this matter are facing prosecution in the State court for violations of State laws the constitutional protections of the New Hampshire Constitution should apply,"" Rappa wrote.    As to the first part of Sununu’s statement that Border Patrol agents have ""taken out people who have trafficked drugs"" every time they’ve held a checkpoint, that’s not the case if he’s referring to arrests. Since that circuit court ruling, the Woodstock Police Department has ended its involvement with the the checkpoints, Sgt. Kevin Millar said earlier this year. And while drugs have been seized by CBP agents, no drug-related arrests have been made since the decision. Our ruling Gov. Chris Sununu said federal border checkpoints in New Hampshire help ""take out"" drug traffickers and were a key tool in the opioid crisis. ""That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job,"" he said. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that drug interdictions and arrests cannot be the intended role of Customs and Border Patrol agents, but rather ancillary actions taken if the situation arises. So, border patrol agents may seize drugs during checkpoints, but they turn over drug cases to local police. Meanwhile, state courts have ruled that New Hampshire’s constitution prevents drugs found at vehicle checkpoints by drug sniffing dogs from being used as evidence in court. In fact, local-federal cooperation on drug cases has stopped, and no drug-related arrests have been made since the decision. While drug detection is not the primary purpose of the checkpoints, it is a secondary aim, according to the Border Patrol. Sununu’s defense of the checkpoints leaves out important details.

Roland Gutierrez errs saying Pete Gallego canceled meeting with Sandy Hook parents
","In a fundraising appeal, San Antonio state Rep. Roland Gutierrez portrayed fellow Democrat Pete Gallego of Alpine as a ""career politician"" whose ""cozy relationship"" with the National Rifle Association prompted him to scrap a meeting with the parents of Sandy Hook children. As a U.S. House member, we confirmed, Gallego fielded a donation from the NRA, which graded his record highly. But he also met with the parents concerned about gun issues though not at the originally scheduled time, interviews and photos show. Gutierrez and Gallego, who won a term in Congress after spending more than 20 years in the Texas House, appear to be the highest-profile hopefuls among eight contenders to serve out more than two years left in convicted felon Carlos Uresti’s term representing Texas Senate District 19, which sprawls southwest from San Antonio to the border and west past Alpine and Pecos. The election is July 31, 2018. Gutierrez declared in a July 18, 2018, campaign email blast that Gallego ""in a moment of political cowardice, cancelled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims,"" referring to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and six staff members dead. The Dec. 14, 2012, massacre occurred 20 days before Gallego began what proved to be one term representing Texas’ 23rd Congressional District. But a group of victims’ family members met with individual lawmakers in June 2013, about six months into Gallego’s term. So, did Gallego cancel his meeting with shooting victims’ families? Postponed by hours? A web link in Gutierrez’s email led us to a June 15, 2013, Huffington Post news article recapping efforts by victims’ families and friends to seek a change in law requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Federal law requires such checks for purchases from licensed gun dealers but not in private transactions including gun shows. The Post story indeed says Gallego canceled his meeting with Newtown Action Alliance, a group that describes itself as a ""Newtown-based, national grassroots organization"" whose mission is to ""achieve the steady and continuous reduction of gun violence through legislative and cultural changes."" Also, the story says, Gallego’s office did not immediately respond to the Post’s request for comment. But hold on: An update affixed at the end of the story quotes Erin Nikitchyuk, a mother whose son survived the rampage, saying that Gallego rescheduled and then held his meeting with the group, during which he was ""conscientious"" and ""welcoming,"" Nikitchyuk was quoted saying. For our part, we asked Nikitchyuk about the described meeting through Facebook messages. She replied: ""I absolutely remember meeting with him. In fact, his is the most memorable meeting I had."" Nikitchyuk subsequently messaged us the group’s itinerary from its trip to Washington, D.C., June 12 and 13, 2013 and showing that family members initially expected to meet Gallego at 9:45 a.m. on Thursday, June 13. Nikitchyuk also connected us with another Alliance member, Kari Hulgaard, who posted to Facebook photos of Gallego in the Alliance-coordinated meeting:     Photos courtesy of Kari Hulgaard’s Facebook page (album titled ""2013 June Newtown Action Alliance"") Hulgaard posted the photos on Facebook June 14, 2013 and made the photos viewable to anyone after we made our inquiries. By text, she told us she wasn’t sure if the meeting took place that day or simply later than the originally scheduled  9:45 a.m. June 13. Hulgaard wrote: ""Our group was able to spend a generous amount of time with Gallego. He was most endearing and helpful in gaining perspective about how politics work in Texas when it comes to gun violence and gun laws."" Nikitchyuk separately told us that among the meeting attendees were ""the brother of one teacher who lost her life and at least one survivor sibling."" Gallego, asked for his account, said by phone that the meeting singled out by Gutierrez wasn’t canceled; it was slightly postponed, he said. Gallego said he ultimately met with ""eight to 10"" members of the Alliance for ""an hour, hour and a half,"" he estimated. Gallego on changes to gun laws So, did Gallego commit, after meeting family members, to supporting universal gun-purchase background checks? He did not, according to the Post story, which quotes Nikitchyuk saying, ""we clearly do not have his vote on supporting background checks at this time."" In 2018, she told us by phone that alliance members asked Gallego ""where he stands."" According to Nikitchyuk, Gallego responded, ""Do you want to know where I stand or how I’ll vote? Because they’re not necessarily the same thing."" He went on to tell the Alliance they ""would need to change the hearts and minds of his constituents,"" Nikitchyuk said. By phone, Gallego said he didn’t remember saying he wouldn’t support a bill mandating universal background checks, but did recall talking to the group about restoring a federal assault weapons ban. Nonetheless, Gallego said by text that he now believes ""if you’re buying a weapon--whether at a store or at a gun show or through most private transactions, you should pass a background check."" We alerted Colin Strother, a political consultant to Gutierrez, of the indications that Gallego met with the alliance members; Strother stood by Gutierrez’s claim that Gallego had canceled such a meeting. By phone, Strother also noted that Gallego in Congress had an A-level rating from the National Rifle Association, which donated $1,000 to Gallego’s congressional campaign in 2014, federal filings show. Strother also told us Gutierrez supports universal background checks and a federal ban on assault weapons. Our ruling Gutierrez said Gallego as a U.S. House member ""canceled a planned meeting with the families of Sandy Hook victims."" This claim proved factually incomplete. Interviews and photographs demonstrate that Gallego postponed yet held the meeting at issue. The gathering took place a few hours or possibly a day after it was originally penciled in.

Misleading Putnam ad twists DeSantis stance on taxes
","With just a month left before the Florida primaries, Republican candidate for governor Adam Putnam accused rival Ron DeSantis of backing a massive tax increase that would hurt Florida’s economy. Set to suspenseful bluegrass music, the ad from Putnam’s Florida Grown political committee warns that a DeSantis-backed sales tax hike of 23 percent would touch everything from the market to the beach. ""What would a 23 percent sales tax do to Florida’s economy? If Congressman DeSantis had his way, everything would cost 23 percent more — groceries, gas, home purchases,"" the ad says. ""Congressman DeSantis sponsored legislation to increase sales taxes by 23 percent, hurting families, destroying jobs, devastating tourism."" DeSantis did support a bill that proposed introducing a 23 percent federal sales tax, but the ad fails to mention an essential component of the plan: all other federal taxes, including income tax, would be eliminated. The ad shows a copy of HR 25, a bill known as the Fair Tax Act. A version of the bill has been introduced in Congress 10 times since 1999, earning support from prominent Republicans Mike Pence and Mike Huckabee. In 2013, 2015 and 2017, DeSantis, representing Florida’s 6th District, co-sponsored the bill. The idea behind the Fair Tax Act is to introduce a 23 percent federal sales tax that would replace other federal taxes. The bill eliminates income, estate, payroll and gift taxes, as well as the Internal Revenue Service itself. Supporters of the tax argue that even though purchasing items would be more expensive, consumers would be able to keep more of their income, and therefore have enough purchasing power to maintain the same lifestyle. Businesses would also save money, which would ideally lead to lower prices and more jobs. Libertarian radio host Neal Boortz, who co-wrote ""The FairTax Book,"" responded to Putnam's ad with a tweet: ""If you are having trouble understanding the FairTax, perhaps you ought to comment me. I wrote the book."" He followed up, ""The Adam Putnam campaign is LYING THROUGH ITS TEETH … and they know it."" Critics of the bill say that this would be a regressive tax plan, where poor and middle-class families pay more than wealthy households. The sales tax would apply to every purchase, even essentials like food and shelter, which comprise a larger portion of a low-income earner’s budget. There’s a lot of debate about the best-case and doomsday scenarios that could go down were the Fair Tax to become a reality. The bill might, for example, have a major impact on vacation destinations like Florida, which leans on tourism and its state sales tax. According to Jon Hamilton, finance professor at the University of Florida, higher sales prices would incentivize foreign tourists to visit cheaper destinations instead, like Cuba or the Bahamas. Steve Hayes, Americans for Fair Taxation president, says that the Fair Tax might actually cause prices to go down; because businesses would no longer have to pay payroll taxes, they could afford to cut prices overall. Because the ad is so skimpy on details, viewers could guess that DeSantis will push for the changes of the Fair Tax Act to be applied at a state level. Florida’s sales tax is 6 percent. DeSantis has not pushed for this as a candidate for governor. The plan does not appear in DeSantis’s campaign materials. Spokesman David Vasquez said, ""The Fair Tax plan is a federal proposal. He’s running on low taxes and limited regulation in Florida."" The ad said, ""Congressman DeSantis sponsored legislation to increase sales taxes by 23 percent."" The ad distorts what DeSantis sponsored in a few ways. It completely leaves out that the same plan would have eliminated almost all other federal taxes.  And by only mentioning ""sales taxes"" in the context of Florida’s economy, the ad creates a misleading impression that DeSantis wants the state’s 6 percent sales tax to skyrocket by that amount. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts, leaving voters with the wrong impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F71500>],/factchecks/2018/jul/27/adam-putnam/misleading-putnam-ad-twists-desantis-stance-taxes/
"['Environment', 'Regulation', 'Science', 'Wisconsin', 'Kelda Helen Roys']","
On the environment, is Scott Walker 'gagging' scientists and letting 'polluters' write permits?
","Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made headlines for years with his initiatives to ease regulatory burdens in the state after declaring during his Jan 3, 2011, inaugural address that ""Wisconsin is open for business."" But has the Walker administration gone so far as to prevent Department of Natural Resources scientists from commenting on proposed legislation, and letting corporations draft their own permits? That was the claim from former state Rep. Kelda Roys, one of eight Democrats hoping to face Walker in the November 2018 election. In a May 2, 2018, interview with journalist Steve Walters of WisconsinEye, Roys claimed ""political interference"" from Walker’s administration has led to ""gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation."" And, ""We're letting polluters write their own permits."" Let’s take a look at both parts of Roys’ claim. The changing role of DNR in legislation When asked for backup on the ""gagging"" part of the claim, the Roys campaign provided three news articles. Two (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Isthmus) reported a case in which DNR testimony was absent from a legislative hearing regarding chronic wasting disease and the baiting/feeding of white-tailed deer. The other, from Scientific American, carried this headline: ""How Scott Walker dismantled Wisconsin's environmental legacy."" In the March 23, 2017, Isthmus article, DNR Deputy Secretary Kurt Thiede is quoted as saying: ""The department does not take positions for or against legislation. When requested, the department appears at the public hearing for informational purposes when requested by either a committee chairman or a bill’s primary author. This has been administration policy since 2011."" When asked to comment, the Walker campaign referred us to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited numerous instances where the department was asked to testify -- for information only -- at legislative hearings during Walker’s administration: Assembly Bills 160, 203, and 668, and Senate Bills 228 and 368 among them. DNR communications director Jim Dick said since February 15, 2017, DNR staff have given informational testimony on 30 different topics during legislative hearings, met with legislators and/or their staff about once a week, and have fielded about 40 calls or emails a week to answer questions from lawmakers on various topics. ""In a three-year period (2014-2017),"" said Dick, ""we received and responded to more than 6,000 legislative inquiries. DNR staff does communicate with legislators and legislative staff frequently. But it is not our role to offer our opinion on whether a particular piece of legislation is right or wrong, good or bad."" Still, the policy marks a change from the pre-Walker era. Tom Hauge, who retired in 2016 after serving 25 years as wildlife director for the department, said staffers had more latitude in the past. At any and every relevant hearing, he said, experts from the department would testify alongside the department’s legislative liaison, taking a stand on whether the agency supported, opposed, or was neutral toward the proposed legislation. If they found that the legislation would have negative impact — ""I don’t just mean trivial,"" he added — they would take an official position in opposition at the hearings. Shifting DNR’s role to an invite-only, information-only basis hasn’t necessarily reduced its  participation in legislative hearings, as the earlier numbers show. But there’s no guarantee that they will be asked to attend. For instance, the DNR was noticeably uninvited to the March 2017 hearing on Assembly Bill 61 which would lighten rules that prohibit baiting/feeding deer in counties with documented chronic wasting disease. Hauge, then retired, attended as a private citizen; reports said he fielded questions from interested lawmakers for nearly half an hour after giving his testimony. So, DNR staffers have not been ""gagged,"" in that they continue to testify at hearings and provide information to lawmakers. But under Walker administration policy they cannot go beyond ""providing information"" in their statements and can’t even do that unless explicitly invited. The role of permitted entities in their own permitting On the issue of ""polluters writing their own permits,"" the Roys campaign sent two Wisconsin State Journal articles, but only one was on point. And in that article, the DNR explicitly denied accusations that ""polluters"" (in this case, dairy producers) will be allowed to write their own permits under Walker-administration initiatives aimed at moving the burden of permit-related paperwork to credentialed contractors. After our own digging, we found that desires to ""streamline"" permitting were among many changes included in DNR’s ""strategic alignment plan,"" which was announced in November 2016 by then-DNR secretary Cathy Stepp. A Nov 30, 2016, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel covered the announcement, saying: ""The DNR will develop a program to turn over some time-consuming tasks of permit writing to experts in the private sector who are hired by a property owner or business seeking the permit. The agency plans to set benchmarks so that officials reviewing the permits can be assured that information they get from the consultants is accurate."" The article also said: ""The DNR will still write final permits, but will develop so-called ‘assurance programs’ so they can rely more on the accuracy of information provided by private parties. The new approach on permits is part of a series of organizational changes officials say will make the agency more efficient at a time when its workforce has shrunk to a 30-year low."" Did these plans become a reality? Changes to wetland permits were the first major change under Walker, with the introduction of the ""assured delineator"" program. This initiative encourages project planners to hire consultants to mark wetlands for which construction would be prohibited or require mitigation, prior to applying for a permit. Dick, the department spokesman, told us the DNR announced plans in 2016 for similar ""assurance programs"" that would allow large dairy producers to hire private contractors to work on their pollution permit applications. But, he noted, the program hasn’t been implemented yet. And the DNR is now in discussions about moving the entire program to the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, so ""the plan is not likely to be implemented anytime soon, if at all."" Sarah Geers, staff attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, works to watchdog DNR’s implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. Her take on permitting matched Dick’s. So, various changes were proposed that would have allowed permit applicants to hire contractors to complete major parts of the permit applications. But saying the plan allows polluters to write their own permits goes too far -- especially since the programs have not been implemented. Our rating Roys said ""political interference"" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to ""gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation"" and ""we’re letting polluters write their own permits."" As for the Walker administration, DNR scientists are permitted to share their expertise regarding proposed legislation -- without declaring a position or commenting on the legislation itself -- by invitation only. The evidence suggests this still happens frequently, though pre-Walker staffers had more latitude in what they could say. As for the second half of Roys’ statement, Walker has taken steps to change permit-writing processes so that businesses are more involved (and DNR officials less involved). But the plans have not come to fruition, and even if they did, responsibility would shift to ""assured contractors"" and would not occur in-house with those Roys labeled the ""polluters."" On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280F3F29DC0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/27/kelda-helen-roys/governor-hopeful-kelda-roys-says-walker-administra/

Roger Williams says he's never voted ""present"" in U.S. House action--the 'chicken way'
","U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, who represents the 25th Congressional District running north and west from Austin to just south of Tarrant County, declared that he always commits to a position on issues before the House--never voting ""present"" the ""chicken way."" A reader asked us to fact-check Williams's tout. Williams, a former Texas secretary of state who faces Democratic nominee Julie Oliver on the November 2018 ballot, was asked by Maria Bartiromo, who hosts the Fox Business Network’s ""Mornings with Maria,"" why some Democratic colleagues had voted ""present"" instead of ""yes"" or ""no"" on a House-approved resolution. The measure expressed support for officers who carry out the mission of Immigration & Customs Enforcement, the agency that some Democrats lately say should be disbanded. The House vote on the resolution was 244-35 with 18 Democrats joining Republicans favoring the proposal and 34 voting against it, The Hill reported--with another 133 Democrats voting ""present"" as urged by Democratic leaders. The leadership ""strategy was aimed at both protecting vulnerable Democrats from a contentious vote,"" The Hill said, ""and protesting what most Democrats deemed a political stunt designed to distract the media and the public from Congress’s failure to enact immigration reforms, including efforts to address the separation of migrant families on the U.S.-Mexico border,"" its story said. The morning after the House action, Bartiromo asked Williams: ""How do you justify voting ‘present?’"" Williams replied: ""Well, I never voted ‘present.’ So I don’t know that I can justify it. It’s the chicken way out is the only way I know we can put it."" Checking vote histories We didn’t divine a way to plumb a government website to determine if Williams, who joined the House in 2013, had never voted ""present."" But to our inquiry, Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us, a site that compiles congressional votes, confirmed Williams’s statement. Tauberer said by email that Williams, who as of late July 2018 had been eligible to vote in 3,604 roll-call votes, ""has never voted ‘present,’ except in quorum calls where ‘present’ is the only vote one can make."" Tauberer told us he reached his conclusion by querying the site’s internal database of votes, which he described as built in part from member votes posted by the House clerk. We were curious too about other Texas members voting ""present."" On that front, Tauberer emailed us a spreadsheet showing more than 1,900 ""present"" votes by Texans since 1990, though most weren’t substantive, we found. We sifted the provided information to find that 26 Texas members, from both parties, accounted for more than 680 non-procedural votes of ""present"" since 1990 with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, leading the delegation with 84 votes of ""present""  followed by Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Houston, with 61. According to our sort, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis placed third with 59 ""present"" votes; he was trailed by GOP Reps. Sam Johnson of Plano and Lamar Smith of San Antonio, with 57 ""present"" votes each, and Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, who voted ""present"" 50 times. We sifted the information even more to find that since Williams joined the House in 2013, 11 House Democrats had voted ""present"" 20 times across nine issues -- topped by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, doing so five times. Most recently, the results show, Reps. Green and Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen each voted ""present"" on the ICE resolution that Williams supported. Since 2013, the information indicates, no Texas Republicans in the House voted ""present"" on non-procedural issues. Outside analyst Finally, we asked an expert on Congress generally about the prevalence and significance of ""present"" votes. Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said by email that party strategy or an individual’s political calculation often underlie the semi-rare ""present"" votes. ""At times, a legislator may want to avoid committing to the ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ position without reducing his or her rate of voting participation,"" Smith wrote. ""The legislator will be counted as having voted but without having committed to either side. This probably can be rationalized as having unacceptable alternatives, but it avoids adding a vote for or against a cause, group or constituency,"" Smith said. Our ruling Williams said he’s never voted ""present"" instead of taking a position on issues before the House. That’s backed up by research we elicited from the founder of the GovTrack.us website.

Bill Nelson claims detained immigrant parents charged $8/minute to call their children. Is it true?
","Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said the Trump administration reached a new low by charging detained immigrant parents high fees to call the children they were separated from at the border. ""The Trump administration has been charging detained parents, get this, as much as $8 a minute to call their children,"" Nelson, of Florida, said July 23 on the Senate floor. ""And the children were separated from the parents because the administration separated them; $8 a minute if you want to talk to your child. That is a new low."" Nelson faces a tough re-election challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott. More than 2,300 children were separated from the adults they were traveling with as a result of President Donald Trump’s ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy, which directed the prosecution of all immigrants who crossed into the United States illegally. As adults were referred for prosecution, children traveling with them were placed into the custody. The Trump administration has reunified more than 1,000 children with their parents. But not all can be easily reunified, in part because some parents have already been deported. Overall, exact government figures on separations and reunifications have been inconsistent and limited. We wondered about Nelson’s claim that parents in detention were being charged as much as $8 a minute to call their children. Nelson’s office pointed to media reports saying parents had to pay for phone calls. But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rebuked those claims. Some advocates for immigrants said they couldn’t confirm the $8 a minute claim, or had heard lower rates. About 150 lawmakers, including Nelson, sent a letter July 20 to ICE’s acting director, Ronald D. Vitiello, expressing concerns over ""apparent misinterpretation"" of ICE’s telephone access policies. ""Reports and first-hand accounts have indicated that many of these detained parents have been forced to endure weeks without any information as to the location of their children,"" the letter said. ""Once their children are finally located, moreover, reports indicate that their parents are forced to pay as much as $8 per minute to speak with them by telephone, and that their access to this service can be limited to as little as one call per week."" The letter cites a June 21 NPR interview of Jenny Hixon, outreach director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. Hixon told NPR that some parents at a detention center in Pearsall, Texas, ""had not been able to speak to their children yet because in order to be able to speak to their children, they needed to pay $25 to get a commissary account. And then the phone calls are about $8 a minute."" PolitiFact emailed Hixon for more information but received an automated message saying she was no longer employed by the legal services group. We asked the group’s communications director to confirm the figure, but did not receive the confirmation by deadline. Nelson’s office also referred us to a July 3 article from the Texas Tribune reporting that immigrants in detention faced ""usurious phone rates and bureaucratic hassles to contact their family members."" The story said advocates were worried that ""the cost and complexity of using detention facility phones could hamper family reunification efforts that have already been plagued by chaos and confusion."" But the Texas Tribune story didn’t cite an $8 a minute rate. It said the cost ""can top 20 cents per minute and has been criticized as exorbitant."" The story mentioned comments made in a June 22 court filing by a mother detained in Texas who was separated from her children. ""The calls are very expensive so I am only able to call when I have money, but when I do not have money, I am not able to communicate with my children. In one month I only received one free call from the center,"" the woman said. The story added: ""Lawyers and advocates working with immigrants detained since the ‘zero tolerance’ policy went into effect say costs and procedures vary from facility to facility, but they have heard that charges range from 10 to 25 cents per minute for domestic calls."" It did not say if those calls were made to children. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea told PolitiFact calls are facilitated ""at no charge"" to detained parents whether their children are in HHS custody or with sponsors. But Buzzfeed, in a July 23 story about the lawmakers’ letter, reported that ""when asked about reports detailing high, per-minute fees for phone calls to children,"" a different spokeswoman ""agreed it was ‘possible’ that occurred when parents were trying to call children who were no longer in federal custody."" Children in HHS custody don’t have 24-hour access to phones, but calls are being arranged at least twice a week, sometimes more frequently, Elzea told PolitiFact. In some cases, detained parents are able to talk to their children through video-conferencing, she said. ICE detention standards say detainees shall be able to make free calls to an ICE-provided list of free legal service providers, to consular officials and to certain government offices. ""Indigent detainees, who are representing themselves pro se, shall be permitted free calls on an as-needed basis to family or other individuals assisting with the detainee’s immigration proceedings,"" standards say. HHS said that children in its shelters don’t pay for calls to their families or sponsors. The agency said it pays for those calls. Two legal services groups representing immigrant families were unable to confirm to PolitiFact if parents were charged as much as $8 a minute to call their children. Some parents detained at Port Isabel detention center in Texas told lawyers that they were charged about $3 a minute to call their children, said Megan McKenna, spokeswoman for Kids in Need of Defense. The group represents unaccompanied immigrant and refugee children in deportation proceedings. ""It’s possible that there was a free call number, but the detainees our team spoke to did not know about it, if there was,"" McKenna said. Efren Olivares, a program director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said he couldn’t confirm the $8 a minute figure. But when detainees at the Port Isabel detention center call Texas Civil Rights Project lawyers, they get a recording saying the call is 20 cents a minute, Olivares said. Nelson said detained immigrant parents separated from their children at the border are being charged ""as much as $8 a minute to call their children."" ICE told us that parents should not be charged to talk to their children. But lawyers working with parents have heard that they were charged. One legal services group told PolitiFact that there may be a free number to call, but its clients did not know about it and had been charged. Having said that, we were only able to find one instance of anyone claiming that parents had to pay as much as $8 per minute. Most of the accounts we found mentioned amounts ranging from $3 a minute to 20 cents a minute.  There is some anecdotal evidence to back Nelson's claim, but not enough to establish that $8 a minute as standard practice. Nelson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B09880>],/factchecks/2018/jul/26/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-claims-detained-immigrant-parents-char/

If his lawsuit succeeds, nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage—raising premiums for families across the state. #MOSen."" Instead of defending vulnerable Missourians, @HawleyMO is putting them at risk. If his lawsuit succeeds, nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their healthcare coverage—raising premiums for families across the state. #MOSen https://t.co/S6cTqrxzOV The lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Texas on Feb. 26, 2018, was signed by 18 attorneys general and two governors, all of them Republicans. The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that ""the ACA is unlawful"" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation. If the plaintiffs’ wishes are granted by the courts, then insurance companies would be able to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. So the tweet raises a genuine issue. However, we wondered whether the state party’s estimate of ""nearly 2.5 million Missourians"" was accurate. Could that many Missouri residents really ""lose their health care coverage"" if the lawsuit succeeds? Not really. The tweet relied on one estimate. However, it’s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower. Buckle up for a wonky ride! When we checked with the Missouri Democratic Party, they pointed to a report published in April 2017 by the liberal Center for American Progress. The group found that 2,495,800 Missourians are living with a pre-existing condition. This estimate leveraged the data in a broader study released by the Department of Health and Human Services in the waning days of the Obama administration. That study found that nationally up to 51 percent of non-elderly Americans have a pre-existing condition. (Americans age 65 and over are covered by Medicare, so they were excluded from the count.) Using Census data, the Center for American Progress took the HHS numbers and devised estimates for every state and congressional district. So the tweet used a real number, and one that experts said was legitimate. However, it’s not the only estimate out there -- and the other ones are lower. For starters, the HHS study itself offered two definitions for ""pre-existing condition,"" and of those, the Center for American Progress chose the broader estimate. HHS’s broader estimate tallied ""common health conditions … that could have resulted in denial of coverage, exclusion of the condition, or higher premiums for individuals seeking individual market coverage"" before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. By contrast, the narrower definition used by HHS only included conditions that would cause an applicant to be ""outright rejected for coverage by private insurers."" The difference between the two estimates is not trivial. Under the narrow definition, HHS found, 23 percent of non-elderly Americans nationally have a pre-existing condition, while under the broad definition, 51 percent of non-elderly Americans do. That’s more than double. Meanwhile, another independent estimate, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, mirrored HHS’ narrower definition. The Kaiser estimate produced a figure for Missouri of about 1.1 million people. Emily Gee, the Center for American Progress health economist who worked on the report, said her group chose to highlight the broad definition ""because without the ACA’s protections, people with pre-existing conditions may not be able to obtain comprehensive coverage if they ever needed to turn to the individual market because they could be rejected, be offered plans that exclude essential benefits, or be priced out of the market."" Outside experts we contacted said that the Center for American Progress estimate has value. But they added that the tweet is a bit misleading in how it describes the group’s numbers. First, while the tweet said that 2.5 million Missourians ""could lose their health care coverage,"" it would be more accurate to say that 2.5 million Missourians could either lose their health care coverage, or be forced into an exclusion (which would eliminate coverage for that condition, but not all coverage entirely), or see a rise in premiums. Each of these is a problematic outcome for patients, but they are not all identical to losing health care entirely, as the tweet framed it. Second, a large fraction of people with pre-existing conditions are insured through an employer or through Medicaid, meaning that they could not be denied coverage immediately after the lawsuit became successful and changed the law, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist specializing in health policy with the Rand Corp. Someone who currently has employer coverage or Medicaid would have to lose their existing coverage first even to be considered at risk for losing out due to the lawsuit. If they lost their current coverage and couldn’t find other employer or government coverage, they would have to turn to the individual market. Only then could the lawsuit potentially have an impact on their insurance options. And that could play out over years, not immediately. The percentage of Missourians facing a more immediate risk to their coverage -- those who are already in the individual market for health insurance -- is about one-fifth as large as the figure cited in the tweet. According to the most recent figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 467,500 people in Missouri were insured on the non-group market -- the market that the Affordable Care Act opened access to, and, where the possibility of being denied or facing higher premiums for pre-existing conditions is the most acute. That’s only 8 percent of Missouri’s population. ""It’s not right to say that the change leads to an immediate loss of coverage for 2.5 million people,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow with the Urban Institute. ""As with all these sound bites, they are a little loose with their wording for a wonk’s taste."" The Missouri Democratic Party said that if a lawsuit backed by Hawley succeeds, ""nearly 2.5 million Missourians with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care coverage."" That figure represents the larger of two credible estimates. The alternative estimate is sizable -- 1.1 million people -- but it’s less than half as large as the figure cited in the tweet. In addition, the tweet’s description is incomplete. In reality, the 2.5 million figure includes people who would face premium increases and coverage exclusions, not just those who would lose coverage outright. It also encompasses many people who currently have employer-based coverage or Medicaid -- people who would not be at immediate risk of fallout from a successful lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.
