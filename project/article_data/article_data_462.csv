Facebook post rehashes false claim that Hillary Clinton was found guilty of spying on Trump
","While developments about Russia’s war in Ukraine have overtaken the news cycle in the last three weeks, one Facebook post urges folks to remember another headline.  ""Just a reminder that right before Ukraine was invaded, Hillary was found to be guilty of spying on a sitting U.S. president,"" read a March 14 Facebook post. No, she wasn’t. And the post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post appears to be alluding to a Feb. 11 court filing that attracted widespread attention from Republicans and right-leaning media, who frequently mischaracterized its findings.  The filing, part of an ongoing federal probe by special counsel John Durham, did not implicate Clinton or her campaign in engaging in an elaborate scheme to gather information on the former president.  Durham’s 13-page document addressed a potential conflict of interest regarding the legal representation of Michael Sussmann, an attorney for a law firm that represented Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Sussmann was charged with making a false statement to the FBI during a meeting in 2016, where he provided the agency with data that may have demonstrated evidence of a communications channel between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank.   The indictment alleged that Sussmann told the FBI that he was not acting on behalf of clients, when the indictment claimed, he was secretly acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Clinton has not been indicted on any charges stemming from the matter, nor has she been found guilty of alleged spying. We found no credible evidence to support the Facebook post. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB65680>],/factchecks/2022/mar/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-rehashes-false-claim-hillary-clinton/

Kaine correctly describes Virginia's pay gap between women and men
","March 15 was Equal Pay Day and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was tweeting. ""Virginia women are paid 80 cents for every dollar paid to Virginia men,"" he wrote. ""We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to close the gender gap."" Kaine’s office said his figure comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues an annual report comparing the pay of women to men who work at least 35 hours a week at a principal job. The latest report found that in 2020, Virginia women received a median weekly pay of  $1,002 compared to $1,260 for men. In other words, women made 79.5% as much as men which, rounded up, matches Kaine’s figure. It’s important to know that the 80% figure is not an apples-to-apples pay comparison of men and women performing the same work. Instead, it refers to median pay for all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women.   Nationally, women were paid 82.3% as much as men in 2020. That means that the pay gap in Virginia was 2.8 percentage points larger than the nation’s. The bureau, however, cautions that its 2020 figures were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused deep drops in employment, particularly among low-wage workers. BLS reports from 2015 to 2019 show the wage gap in Virginia was typically about 1% larger than the nation’s. Since 2015, there’s been little movement in Virginia or nationally in how much women make compared to men. It’s hovered at 80% in Virginia and 81% across the U.S. Kaine’s tweet calls for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would combat ""pay discrimination"" against women and LGBTQ workers. It would require employers to prove that pay disparities between men and women are job related and would make it easier to file class-action suits alleging pay discrimination.  The Democratic bill narrowly passed the House in April 2021 but has been stalled in the Senate, unable to get the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster.   As PolitiFact has written before, many researchers have concluded the causes of gender pay disparity go far beyond discrimination. ""The most important source of the gender wage gap is that women assume greater responsibility for child-rearing than men,"" June O’Neill, an economist at Baruch College, wrote in a 2010 op-ed for the The Wall Street Journal. ""That influences women's extent and continuity of work, which affects women's skills and therefore wages. In addition, women often seek flexible work schedules, less stressful work environments, and other conditions compatible with meeting the demands of family responsibilities. Those come at a price—namely, lower wages."" A 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages, they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men and they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care. CONSAD said these factors, when considered, reduced the pay gap to between 4 and 7%, which could be result of discrimination. A 2013 study by the American Association of University Women tried to even out the child-rearing effect on women’s pay. It found a 7% wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college and a 12% gap 10 years out - even after accounting for other factors. Kaine tweeted, ""Virginia women are paid 80 cents for every dollar paid to Virginia men."" His comment comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest report comparing the pay of men and women working full-time jobs. In 2020, Virginia women earned 79.5% as much as men. Rounded up, that matches Kaine’s figure. The 80% figure is not a pay comparison of men and women doing the same work. It refers to the median pay of all jobs held by men and all jobs held by women.   Kaine cited the statistic correctly. We rate his tweet True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCF7480>],/factchecks/2022/mar/18/tim-kaine/kaine-correctly-describes-virginias-pay-gap-betwee/

News and other programs are broadcast live on Russian television, despite claims otherwise
","A producer working for Channel One, a Russian-owned news channel, recently made headlines for staging a protest against her country’s invasion of Ukraine on the station’s evening live newscast. Marina Ovsyannikova walked out behind a news anchor on the show Vremya on March 14, shouting, ""Stop the war. No to war,"" according to the Guardian. She held a sign with words written in English and Russian. It was signed, ""Russians against the war.""  Ovsyannikova was hailed as a hero by many for her open display of opposition to the war less than two weeks after Russia enacted a new law that could punish anyone deemed to be spreading ""false information"" about the invasion to 15 years in prison.  Ovsyannikova so far has avoided a harsh sentence. She was interrogated for 14 hours, she said, and fined about $270, not for her on-air protest, but for a prerecorded video she filmed where she apologized for helping spread Russian propaganda on the network, according to The New York Times. But some on social media are saying Ovsyannikova’s protest was staged and amounted to just another propaganda effort in the battle for public opinion over the war. It couldn’t have been real, they say, because there are no live TV broadcasts in Russia. But that isn’t true, experts told PolitiFact. ""There are no live on air television broadcasts in Russia. None. Ever,"" read a March 15 Facebook post. Because there are no live broadcasts, the post said, Russia staged the protest to distract attention and to get people talking about the ""good Russians."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several experts we spoke with said there are regular live news and other broadcasts on Russian television.  Farida Rustamova, an independent journalist who writes about Russian issues on her substack page, said many broadcasts, including news shows, sports, speeches by Russian President Vladimir Putin and other events are shown live. Rustamova is one of many Russian journalists who have recently fled the country after the government’s crackdown on free speech. She said her sources who work for state TV told her that the news is still being broadcast live, but in response to Ovsyannikova’s protest, there now may be a delay of 30 seconds to a minute. Julia Davis, a journalist and Russian media analyst who created the website Russian Media Monitor, also said that Russian television shows are broadcast live on a regular basis. ""On various shows on their top channels, I've seen some of the hosts stumble (one fell),"" she wrote to PolitiFact in an email. ""Sometimes there are curse words they have no time to bleep. All of the above would have been removed if the shows weren't actually streaming live."" Davis said on one live show she watched, producers forgot to cut the cameras during a commercial break. ""I could see the hosts interacting with guests,"" Davis said. ""Again, that would have been removed if the show wasn’t streaming live. In fact, later uploads did not contain those mishaps."" Roman Badanin, a journalist from Russia who recently wrote for CNN about his experience leaving the country in 2021 due to the threat of arrest, also told PolitiFact that ""most of the news shows,"" including on Channel One, ""are broadcast live"" in the country. Badanin is now a student at Stanford University. One reason the news is broadcast live in Russia is that the country has so many time zones due to its large size, Rustamova said.  ""This is why recording news in advance is pointless. Evening news in Vladivostok, the capital of the Far East, goes on the air at 9 p.m., when it is 1 p.m. in Moscow. It is impossible to repeat this issue in 8 hours to Moscow, as the news will become outdated. Therefore, the news is broadcast live to the Far East, Siberia and Moscow."" She said Ovsyannikova’s protest was only seen by viewers in Moscow and Central Russia. Rustamova pointed us to an article on the news site DW that included an interview with Elena Afanasyeva, the former planning director of Channel One. Afanasyeva told DW that ""All Channel One news is broadcast live,"" according to an English translation. A Facebook post said that a Russian journalist’s protest during a state TV broadcast couldn’t be real because ""there are no live on air television broadcasts in Russia. None. Ever."" But experts we spoke with, including journalists who have worked in Russia, said that is not true. There are many live broadcasts, including the news show that was interrupted by an employee’s protest. There has been no evidence presented that shows her actions were staged as part of a Russian propaganda effort. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA555C0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/17/facebook-posts/news-and-other-programs-are-broadcast-live-russian/

Video said to show ‘heavy war’ in Ukraine is not current
","Real images showing violence and horror from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have been hard to avoid as they stream across news stations, social media and more. The truth of the destruction makes it even more perplexing when we see claims about the war that rely on unrelated video or images. One recent Facebook video claimed to contain ""leaked footage of heavy war between Russia vs Ukraine"" but consists of clips taken from videos made more than five years ago.

Some of it is from a 2015 video created by a Turkish company about the Ukrainian army, and some is from a 2014 video filmed in the Donbass region of Ukraine. Beginning at the 27-second mark in the Facebook video, we see two vehicles, one firing missiles. Identical footage appears at the 1:02 mark in the 2015 video by Turkish company Haci Productions about the Ukrainian army. The company created the video as thanks for a different video made by Ukrainian volunteers about the Turkish Air Force. That footage also is repeated in the Facebook video, appearing again at the 1:30 mark. At the 41-second mark in the Facebook video, men are firing rifles, and a tank with the marking ""132"" on the front drives down a street. The exact same footage is also found in a 2014 video called ""Battle of Ilovaisk,"" starting at the 3:06 mark. The battle took place in August 2014 and resulted in ""the biggest loss of life in Ukraine's war against Russian-backed separatists,"" according to a 2019 BBC News report. Finally, at the 3:35 mark in the Facebook video, the image of tanks that is shown is from a 2014 Ukrainian news story.

Herschel Walker misconstrues evolution of humans, apes
","Herschel Walker, the former Georgia football star vying to join the U.S. Senate, questioned evolution during a recent church appearance. ""At one time science said, man came from apes. Did it not?"" Walker said at Sugar Hill Church in Northern Gwinnett County, outside of Atlanta, Ga., on March 13. ""If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it."" Walker, a former NFL player, is seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the November election. Walker’s skepticism misconstrued how evolution theory works, so we wanted to talk to experts who could break it down. Humans and modern-day apes both evolved from ancient apes, who are now extinct. Anthropologists using genetic and fossil evidence pinpoint it between 6-8 million years ago. Humans and the apes seen today evolved differently over time. Jessica Thompson, an assistant professor of anthropology at Yale University, said to think of evolution not as something linear, but rather as a series of splits. ""Just as how one person can have many children, and those children can have many children, none of those people will be exactly the same as the others, but they will all still be closely related. As the generations pass, they become less and less closely related in terms of shared genetic material. And also, they will start to look more and more different from one another,"" Thompson said. For example, if a person had brown hair, some of their descendants would also likely have brown hair. But it's unlikely every one of their descendants would have brown hair; some may have blonde hair or red hair. ""You would not ask, ‘If all these red-haired people descended from a brown-haired person, then how is it possible to still have brown-haired people around today?’"" Thompson said. The apes alive today are not the same kinds of apes that were alive millions of years ago. As apes evolved, they followed their own trajectories and did not develop the same characteristics as humans, such as walking upright. It’s a misconception that every animal is evolving with the goal of becoming human or more human-like. ""Walking upright would not have been the best solution for every animal. In fact, humans are rare for evolving this particular adaptation at all,"" Thompson said. In 2016, PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. While discussing the incident of a boy falling into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo, Limbaugh questioned why Harambe, the gorilla that was shot and killed during the incident, had not evolved into a human. The presence of gorillas doesn’t negate the concept of evolution. Modern-day gorillas and modern-day humans both evolved from a common ape ancestor. PolitiFact rated Limbaugh’s claim False. Evolution is often called into question in a religious context, but evolution does not necessarily contradict Christianity. A number of influential Christian scholars and leaders believed in both the science of evolution and God. ""The Big Bang, which nowadays is posited as the origin of the world, does not contradict the divine act of creating, but rather requires it. The evolution of nature does not contrast with the notion of creation, as evolution presupposes the creation of beings that evolve,"" Pope Francis said in 2014. Walker’s campaign declined to comment specifically on his remarks about evolution. Walker talked about the presence of apes to question the concept of evolution. Genetic and fossil evidence show that humans and apes both exist today because they evolved 6-8 million years ago from a common ape ancestor. Over time, humans and apes followed separate evolutionary trajectories to develop their unique characteristics known today. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA6C180>],/factchecks/2022/mar/17/herschel-walker/yes-evolution-proves-humans-and-apes-can-coexist/

Persistent high gas prices don’t prove price gouging — and neither do comparisons to 2008 gas prices
","In early March, the price of oil shot up rapidly in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the United States’ decision to ban imports of Russian energy. Coupled with inflation, increased labor costs and other factors that had already raised the price of gasoline, drivers in the U.S. quickly saw much higher prices at the pump. By March 14, the price of oil started to drop, but gasoline prices have been slow to follow, prompting some social media users to make comparisons to 2008 and accuse oil and gas companies of ""price gouging."" The term is generally used when businesses take advantage of rising demand during a crisis and charge exorbitant prices for necessities. One Facebook post claimed that the price of oil was $141.71 per barrel in June 2008 while gas cost $4.10 per gallon on average. In March 2022, the post said oil cost $99.76 per barrel, while the average price of gas was $4.32 per gallon. ""If you’re blaming anyone but greedy oil companies for their price gouging, you’ve bought into propaganda that hurts you more than anyone else,"" the March 14 post said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Other posts similarly claimed that because oil prices fell and gas prices didn’t, companies must be exploiting consumers.  Posts with misleading claims about the relationship between the price of oil and the price of gasoline. Experts who study the price of oil and gas told PolitiFact that it takes more time for gas prices to respond to changes in crude oil costs — and noted that there are factors in 2022 that weren’t at play in 2008, which make direct comparisons misleading. The numbers are also cherry-picked, and the difference in pricing between 2008 and 2022 isn’t as large as the post suggests.  Crude oil prices are set in the global market. And the price of crude oil has the biggest impact on the price of gasoline — that’s been the case for nearly all changes in retail gasoline prices in the past 35 years, said Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. When Russia — the world’s third-largest oil producer — attacked Ukraine at the end of February, the uncertainty, fear of further conflict and international efforts to reduce reliance on Russian oil drove up crude oil prices. High oil prices can quickly drive up prices at gas stations nationwide, experts said. After oil prices fall, it typically takes a while for gas prices to decrease and consumers ""often assume foul play"" even when there isn’t any, said Nicole Petersen, a GasBuddy spokesperson. Gas stations lose profit when oil prices increase sharply because they cannot drastically lift gas prices due to local competition, Petersen said. Then, when oil prices fall, gas stations try to recoup any losses before lowering their prices, she said. Unique factors in each state’s gasoline market also affect gas prices, said Devin Gladden, a AAA spokesperson. Locally, gas stations might have contracts with gasoline dealers that lock in prices at a certain rate for set periods of time — sometimes weeks or months, he said. The March 14 Facebook post correctly cited the average price of a gallon of gas that day: $4.32. But it cherry-picked its $99.76 figure for the price of crude oil. West Texas Intermediate crude oil is traditionally used as a U.S. benchmark when discussing and comparing oil prices. On March 14, WTI crude oil hit a low of $99.76, but the closing price was $103.01.  Gas rose to $4.32 per gallon on March 14 as a result of oil prices being around $130 per barrel at times in the first half of March, Gladden said.  The Facebook post was wrong about prices in June 2008. The monthly average price of a gallon of gasoline was $4.05, and the average price of WTI crude oil was $133.88 per barrel, less than what the post claimed. ""The data set in this posting is misleading because it gives people this impression that crude prices are more stationary than they are,"" Gladden said. ""In all actuality, they are highly volatile."" Posts comparing June 2008 prices to current prices also mislead because they compare a full month of data to half a month in 2022, experts said.  Different global conditions are also at play. In 2008, the spike in oil and gas prices was tied to the financial crisis. The recession caused a drop in demand for gasoline, and as the economic recovery began, there was an ""immediate ramp-up"" in production to meet growing supply needs. That ""supply crunch,"" caused prices to spike, Gladden said. In March, the Russia-Ukraine conflict caused ""panic and speculation"" that contributed to the rapid price rises, Gladden said. But it’s also normal for prices to rise this time of year due to the demand from the spring and summer driving season, he said. In part, that will ""keep prices elevated even though oil prices have declined,"" Gladden said. Also, an ongoing truck driver shortage, increased labor costs and high inflation in the U.S. have caused gas prices to rise. On top of that, Gladden said the oil industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which decreased gas prices due to decreased demand. State-level taxes on gasoline are also about 7 cents higher per gallon now than they were in 2008, Finley said. A Facebook post claimed that comparing the price of oil and gas in June 2008 to March 2022 shows that oil companies are ""price gouging."" Experts said it takes time for gas prices to respond to drops in crude oil costs, and that’s not necessarily indicative of price gouging. The post’s numbers are cherry-picked; the difference in prices isn’t as great as it suggests.  The current situation differs from 2008 because increased labor costs, the pandemic, additional taxes and inflation were all already contributing to rising gasoline prices before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Direct comparisons lack important context, experts said. We rate these posts False. RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Why are gas prices going up?

No, New York does not receive half of every dollar motorists spend on gas
","Since October, State Sen. Pam Helming, R-Canandaigua, has been calling for the temporary suspension of New York State’s gas tax because of rising gas prices. During a recent radio interview, Helming told Fingerlakes1.com that the state’s gas tax is about 50 cents per gallon.  ""Almost half of every dollar that we spend on gas, it goes to New York State,"" she said. A few minutes later, she repeated the claim: ""Again, almost half of every single dollar that each person spends on gas goes to New York State."" She also made the claim in a Facebook post, though the post was edited after we contacted her office for this fact-check.  Really? Half of every dollar that New Yorkers spend to fill their tanks goes to state government?  We checked with the state Department of Taxation and Finance. Spokesman James Gazzale sent us a breakdown of all the state taxes that are collected on a gallon of motor fuel. The total state tax is 33.35 cents per gallon. The state taxes are generally fixed and do not change with the price per gallon. The components of the state tax, per gallon are:  The petroleum business tax is set every year. The state sales tax rate has been fixed at 8 cents per gallon since 2006.  In addition to the state taxes, motorists also pay a local sales tax, which varies by county but is around 4 percent of the price per gallon, as well as a federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon. For a New Yorker filling up in a county where the local sales tax is 4 percent, they can expect to pay a total of 67.75 cents in all taxes per gallon.       Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, said that the percentage of money that consumers pay to the state government for gas taxes falls when gas prices rise. That is because much of New York's taxes are set on a cents-per-gallon rate, not a percentage of the price per gallon.  Not including the federal excise tax, the gas tax in New York was 48.22 cents per gallon, as of Jan. 1, Walczak said.  If fuel costs $4.33 per gallon, the gas tax in New York would be 11 cents on the dollar, he said.   When we reached out to Helming’s office, spokeswoman Krista Gleason told us that a staff person incorrectly briefed Helming. The staff has since removed references to her incorrect claim to avoid promoting the error.  Helming correctly said during the interview that the gas tax in New York is about 50 cents per gallon. Helming’s office relied on gas tax information from the American Petroleum Institute when making that claim.  Our ruling Helming said almost half of every dollar that motorists spend on gas goes to New York State. The gas tax in New York is about 50 cents per gallon, not including the federal excise tax, but a gallon of gas now costs more than $4, meaning that the tax is far lower than half the cost of gas.  Helming said the money ""goes to New York State,"" which is also wrong. Part of the gas tax is levied by counties and stays local.  We rate her claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC67D4C0>],/factchecks/2022/mar/17/pam-helming/no-new-yorkers-are-not-taxed-almost-half-every-dol/

News video of shot up car was filmed in Ukraine, not West Virginia
","As news networks report on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one particular video clip prompted conspiracy claims about the authenticity of the reports. Social media users on Facebook questioned if a shot up car was really in Ukraine, pointing to video that showed it had a window decal that looked like a West Virginia inspection sticker. ""I don't care what side you are on, because it is happening on both sides. This is why America has no trust in the media. A West Virginia inspection sticker on an Uber in ‘Ukraine’"", said a March 13 Facebook post. ""How did a car from WV end up in Ukraine on NBC News,"" another post said. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Captain R.A. Maddy of the West Virginia State Police confirmed that the sticker was an inspection decal that expired in September 2021. But that doesn’t mean that the car itself wasn’t in Ukraine. Here’s the evidence. The video of the car can be traced back to a March 13 NBC Nightly News report about the shooting of journalist and documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud, who was in Ukraine with colleague Juan Arrendondo to cover the war. As the report described the danger in Ukraine, it showed several vehicles that had been burned or shot up, including the car in question. The report gave a larger picture of the vehicle, showing that it was an Uber vehicle with what appeared to be Ukrainian text along the side.    It’s not clear if the car in the Facebook posts was the one that Renaud and Arrendondo were attacked in. We reached out to Uber, but did not receive a response.   An NBC spokesperson verified that the video was indeed real, and that it was licensed from Reuters. A spokesperson at Reuters confirmed that the video was taken in Irpin, Ukraine, which is right next to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. NBC has since taken down their report, due to fair usage rights. ""We shared the video during the allotted time period that is customary for some fair usage videos,"" the NBC spokesperson said.  Other news sites, including Fox News, have also aired the clip with the Uber car. It’s feasible for the car to have been moved from the U.S. to Ukraine, said Robin Grove, CEO of Classic Automotive Relocation Services (CARS) USA, a company that ships classic and high-end vehicles across the globe.  ""U.S. rules and laws are that U.S. cars with titles may be exported as long as they are not stolen,"" Grove said, pointing to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s rules on exporting a motor vehicle. ""They are allowed to ship to any country that is not on the sanction list as long as governmental protocols are adhered to."" Ukraine doesn’t fall on that list of sanctions, so it’s possible for a vehicle to have been shipped there.  The United Nations reported in an October 2020 study that between 2015-2018, the U.S. ""exported a significant number of used vehicles to Europe, specifically Eastern Europe."" In 2018, the U.S. shipped 34,871 cars to Ukraine.  A Facebook post claimed that ""a West Virginia inspection sticker on an Uber"" proves the car was not in Ukraine. A West Virginia State Police Captain confirmed that the decal on the car was an expired sticker from the state. However, this doesn’t mean that the car wasn’t in Ukraine — a spokesperson for Reuters, which owns the video, confirmed that the video was filmed there.  It's not uncommon for cars to be exported from the U.S. to other countries, including Ukraine.  We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDCF6C00>],/factchecks/2022/mar/17/facebook-posts/news-video-shot-car-was-filmed-ukraine-not-west-vi/

Bill O’Reilly’s misleading statement on Biden and fossil-fuel subsidies
","On his web show, conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly took President Joe Biden to task for policies he said have encouraged higher gasoline prices. One of the reasons that gas prices have recently reached record levels in raw dollars, O’Reilly said on March 15, is that ""as soon as Biden took office, he eliminated all subsidies for fossil fuels."" Days after entering office, Biden did issue an executive order telling federal agencies to curtail certain subsidies for fossil fuels over which the executive branch had control. However, these changes only affected a modest slice of all fossil fuel subsidies. The bulk of such subsidies can only be overturned by congressional action, not unilaterally by Biden. O’Reilly did not respond to questions submitted through his website for this article. Biden announced his executive order on Jan. 27, 2021. It addressed a range of policies related to climate change, including efforts to curb fossil fuel subsidies.  Specifically on subsidies, the executive order said that federal agencies needed to ""take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels."" Various analyses of the executive order have pointed to at least two types of subsidies that would be at risk under Biden’s order. One involves a tax deduction for payments of environmental penalties by fossil fuel companies. Another involves federal funding for the construction and maintenance of shipping infrastructure typically used by fossil fuel producers. However, in his remarks at the event to unveil the executive order, Biden indicated that the order would not, by itself, end all fossil fuel subsidies. ""Unlike previous administrations, I don't think the federal government should give handouts to big oil to the tune of $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies,"" Biden said. ""And I'm going to be going to the Congress asking them to eliminate those subsidies."" There is no clear figure totaling up the annual cost of fossil fuel subsidies, because the industry and environmentalists have long disagreed on what qualifies as a subsidy. However, the lower end of published estimates suggests an annual figure of $20 billion, roughly two-thirds of which comes from federal policies and one-third of which comes from state policies. Despite Biden’s executive order, ""the lion’s share of federal subsidies remain in place,"" said Sujatha Bergen, director of health campaigns at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. In the White House’s proposed fiscal year 2022 budget, Biden urged Congress to end a number of subsidies, including tax deductions, that benefit the industry. He put these in his proposed budget because tax law cannot be rewritten by executive order, only by an act of Congress. One of the items Biden’s budget targeted was the foreign oil and gas exemption. This allows companies to shield themselves from taxation for the refining and transport of fossil fuels generated overseas. Backers of ending this exemption say that denying this tax break would save $85 billion in lost revenue over 10 years. Another subsidy is a tax deduction for ""intangible drilling costs."" This century-old provision allows independent fossil-fuel companies to immediately deduct the costs associated with exploration and development  from drilling a new well. This is estimated to cost taxpayers $13 billion over 10 years. A third tax break is known as ""percentage depletion."" It allows independent fossil-fuel companies to deduct 15% of their gross income from production. This break costs an estimated $13 billion over 10 years. Biden’s proposed budget would also reinstate expired Superfund excise taxes on crude oil, petroleum products and untaxed crude oil, potentially generating $38 billion in federal revenue over 10 years. Other proposed cuts in the Biden budget addressed tax breaks for ""enhanced oil recovery"" and for ""oil and gas produced from marginal wells."" However, proposals like these to curb fossil-fuel subsidies have not advanced in Congress, even to the point of formal consideration by committees. A Senate bill sponsored by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has attracted only seven co-sponsors. A House bill sponsored by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has 41 co-sponsors. And a House bill sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has 11 co-sponsors. In the Build Back Better Act, Biden and his allies proposed more than $100 billion in cuts over 10 years, Bergen said. But that bill has languished in the Senate. ""Congress tried to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies this session but oil and gas industry allies blocked progress,"" Bergen said. ""We are hoping that Congress will move forward with those in the next iteration of legislation."" O’Reilly said, ""As soon as Biden took office, he eliminated all subsidies for fossil fuels."" Biden did sign an executive order just days after taking office that required federal agencies to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies they had unilateral control over.  However, a large majority of subsidies can only be undone with the assent of Congress, and while Biden and congressional Democrats have urged Congress to do that, they have not been successful yet. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA72E40>],/factchecks/2022/mar/17/bill-oreilly/bill-oreillys-misleading-statement-biden-and-fossi/

Arizona GOP candidate Kari Lake wrongly says Jan. 6 defendants are in prison without charges
","Kari Lake, a TV journalist turned Republican candidate for Arizona governor, is running with Donald Trump’s endorsement on a platform of rehashing falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election.  Lake disputes that President Joe Biden received 81 million votes even though the results were certified and accepted by Congress. Lake has spoken favorably of ""decertification"" of the vote in Arizona, a process that does not exist. She predicted a review of ballots in Maricopa County would show Trump as ""the real winner of Arizona,"" but  that review, orchestrated by state Senate Republicans, confirmed the official results that Biden won. Falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. Lake downplayed the cases of the defendants in an interview with 60 Minutes Australia. Lake was asked if she thinks the defendants should be pardoned, an idea floated by Trump. Lake said she would have no say in that as a candidate for governor, then added, ""What I don’t like is that people are being held in prison without being charged. That’s un-American.""  Lake posted a longer version of the interview on Rumble. ""We don’t take kindly on Americans being locked up for months on end without being charged. So charge them, or get off the pot,"" she added.  We contacted Lake’s campaign to ask for her evidence and did not get a response. So has the government imprisoned people associated with Jan. 6 without showing any evidence of alleged crimes? No. Court records show charges filed against hundreds of people who assaulted or resisted police and disrupted Congress in an effort to overturn the election results in favor of Donald Trump.  Lake is one of many Republicans running in Arizona’s Aug. 2 Republican primary, while the best known Democrat running is Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Gov. Doug Ducey is term limited.  Lake said defendants were being held in ""prison"" without being charged, but defendants are held pre-trial in jails. The majority of defendants awaiting trial have been released from jail pending the outcome of their case. The number of defendants detained pretrial is between 75 and 85 at any given time, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. As of March 6, more than 775 defendants had been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., summarized the charges in a recent update. More than 245 individuals have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding police officers or employees, with over 80 of those charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Approximately 224 individuals have pleaded guilty to federal charges, including 29 for felonies. More than 110 defendants have been sentenced. Typically the cases begin with a complaint signed by a judge that states the charges faced by the defendant. The complaint is accompanied by a statement of facts by a law enforcement officer detailing the alleged crimes.  The complaint is usually followed by another type of charging document, an indictment from a grand jury, or what’s called an ""information"" filed by a prosecutor.  The complaint itself includes criminal charges, but it’s filed earlier in the court process without a grand jury agreeing on charges. Daniel Richman, a Columbia law school professor and former federal prosecutor, said it’s wrong to suggest that Jan. 6 defendants are ""sitting in there not knowing what they are in for."" ""The complaint is a charge, (even if) it’s not a charge for certain formal purposes,"" Richman said. ""They have a piece of paper by government officials alleging certain crimes they committed."" A defendant can be held in jail on a complaint, but would be tried on the indictment filed by the grand jury, or the information filed by the prosecutor, said Bruce Green, a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Fordham University. The U.S. Attorney’s Office said that all defendants who have been detained by the court are charged in complaints or indictments with criminal offenses. There has been one defendant, Texas resident Lucas Denney, whose attorneys filed a motion for release due to lack of a formal indictment by a grand jury. Prosecutors said it was an unintentional procedural error, however. Denney’s attorneys said he intended to plead guilty rather than face additional charges.    Lake said Jan. 6 defendants ""are being held in prison without being charged."" Lake did not cite any particular defendants during her interview, and her campaign didn’t respond to our request for evidence. The U.S. Attorney’s Office publicly shows online the charges filed against more than 775 defendants, including violent offenses such as using deadly weapons or assaulting police officers. Many of the defendants have pleaded guilty. We found no evidence of defendants being imprisoned without being charged.  We rate her claim False.

Video clip of Beto O’Rourke misleads viewers by removing context of comments
","An excerpt from a longer interview with Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke was taken out of context and misconstrued by a conservative pundit. ""Beto O'Rourke's Plan to Take 'Trans' Children from Parents,"" read the headline on the March 13 video. The 44-second clip was posted by The Charlie Kirk Show. The video, which was posted on Rumble, was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in the clip, O’Rourke was not describing his own plan — he was referring to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s February order to state officials to investigate parents for child abuse for providing gender-affirming care for transgender children. The video excerpt omitted that context.  The footage was taken from an hour-long interview with O’Rourke on March 13 during the South by Southwest festival. At the 14:26 mark, interviewer Evan Smith — chief executive of The Texas Tribune — asked O’Rourke to ""make the case against the governor."" O’Rourke called Abbott a thug and listed what he considers to be the governor’s mistakes, including February 2021 statewide blackouts.  Two minutes into his lengthy answer, O’Rourke also said, ""He’s targeting transgender kids and turning in their parents, and if these investigations are succesful, not only is that transgender child taken from the custody of that parent, but so is every other kid in the household. That’s what this guy is doing.""  The clip on Facebook begins after O’Rourke has been answering the question for more than a minute and does not include the fact that he is referencing Abbott.   Abbot’s order to Texas state health agencies claimed that it is illegal to provide treatments such as gender reassignment surgery and puberty-blocking drugs for transgender children. Abbott based the order on a nonbinding legal opinion from the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, who is running for reelection.  The order ""stipulated that doctors, nurses and teachers are legally now required to report parents who aid their child in receiving such care to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services,"" the Washington Post reported. A Texas judge ""temporarily halted the investigations until a trial can be held in July, calling Abbott's actions ‘beyond the scope of his duty and unconstitutional,’"" according to The Texas Tribune. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also issued a statement that said denying health care based on gender identity is illegal.  Though O’Rourke said that a successful investigation could lead to transgender children and their siblings being removed from their home, ""most families that (Department of Family and Protective Services) investigates do not end up having their children removed from their custody or placed in foster care, which requires a judicial order,"" The Texas Tribune reported.  The headline on a 44-second video clip says, ""Beto O'Rourke's Plan to Take 'Trans' Children from Parents."" In the clip, O’Rourke was not describing his own plan. The footage was taken from an hour-long interview and omitted the fact that O’Rourke was referring to Abbott.  O’Rourke was referencing Abbott’s order to state child welfare officials to investigate parents for child abuse if they provide gender-affirming care for transgender children.

No proof for Dr. Oz’s claim that Pa. GOP Senate rival Dave McCormick ‘paid for attacks’ on Trump
","The major Republican candidates for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania have touted their support of former President Donald Trump ahead of the state’s May 17 primary election. That includes physician and talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick, the former chief executive of the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund. An Oz TV ad painted McCormick as anti-Trump, declaring:  ""Wall Street insider David McCormick paid for attacks on Donald Trump.""  We found no evidence of that. Oz’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back its claim. When the narrator in the ad makes the attack on McCormick, a reference to ""FEC Records"" appears on the screen.  Federal Election Commission records show that when Trump first ran for president, McCormick in 2015 gave $2,700 to the campaign of one of Trump’s competitors for the Republican nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and $5,000 to Bush’s leadership PAC.  The records indicate McCormick didn’t donate to Trump’s 2016 or 2020 campaigns. McCormick was a Treasury Department official in the administration of President George W. Bush, Jeb Bush’s brother. An Associated Press news story published March 15, five days after Oz’s campaign posted its ad on YouTube, suggested that the ad’s claim alludes to McCormick’s support of Bush. ""In 2015, McCormick held a fundraiser for Jeb Bush, once a contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination eventually won by Trump,"" the story said. ""Oz's campaign pounced, saying in an ad, ‘Wall Street insider David McCormick paid for attacks on Donald Trump.’"" McCormick eventually came into Trump’s favor. ""I wasn't particularly involved with the Trump camp — I wasn't a Trump supporter,"" he said in March 2017.  But McCormick’s wife, Dina Powell McCormick, served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser. And in November 2017, McCormick, a former Army officer, was named to the advisory Defense Policy Board by James Mattes, Trump’s defense secretary.  In November 2020, Trump removed McCormick and 10 other members of the board, including former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright. Foreign Policy, which revealed the moves, said they appeared to be ""the outgoing Trump administration’s parting shot at scions of the foreign-policy establishment."" The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and who decided not to seek re-election.  The other GOP candidates include conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos and Carla Sands, Trump's ambassador to Denmark. The Democratic candidates include U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. The race is rated as a tossup and as ""battleground Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Oz said McCormick ""paid for attacks"" on Trump. McCormick gave money to the campaign of one of Trump’s rivals for the 2016 Republican nomination for president, but that doesn’t amount to financing attacks on Trump. Without evidence for the claim, we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB97140>],/factchecks/2022/mar/16/mehmet-oz/no-proof-dr-ozs-claim-pa-gop-senate-rival-dave-mcc/

It begins with footage of a Javelin missile being fired and soaring past a landscape of snow-covered trees, then shows an explosion in the distance. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The Facebook video shows footage of the explosion right away, while the National Guard video first includes comments from the trainee, then shows the explosion at the 20-second mark.

It’s an image that was first published in an Oct. 17, 2021, story about the Donbass region of Ukraine. The rest of the Facebook video appears to be a mishmash of footage from other sources. For example, at the 2:31 mark, the image that’s used also appeared in a March 8 video about Ukraine by NBC News, at the 29-second mark.

Brat says entitlement and debt payments will consume all taxes in 2032
","The day of financial reckoning is near, says U.S. Rep. Dave Brat.   ""In just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care and interest on the debt will exceed ALL tax revenue!"" Brat, R-7th, wrote in a May 29 Facebook post.   That would mean no money for defense or domestic programs unless Uncle Sam wanted to put these items on his already overburdened credit card.   ""Continuing down this path of rampant federal spending and debt expansion is not an option,"" Brat wrote. ""It will push us ever closer to fiscal crisis. Getting our spending under control and working to balance our budget must begin now.""   We wondered whether the 17-year warning -- also being sounded by the Republican leadership on the House Budget Committee, on which Brat serves -- is accurate.   Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Brat, said the claim is based on figures published by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in its ""2014 Long-Term Budget Outlook,"" issued last July. It contains two scenarios that could happen if Congress doesn’t take strong action to reduce deficits.   The first one assumes that all the major U.S. budget laws in July 2014 will remain in effect. That means Congress will continue sequestration which sets limits on defense and domestic spending, allows a buffet of popular tax cuts to expire as scheduled and doesn’t adjust tax brackets to soften inflationary increases in workers’ earnings.   Under these assumptions, the CBO says spending on Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and debt interest will top tax revenues in 2044.   As bleak as that might seem, there’s an alternative scenario that’s even gloomier. This is the one Brat embraces. It essentially assumes that Congress will lack the courage to continue unpopular budget policies and, as a result, spending will go up and many taxes will do down.   The alternative scenario supposes that Congress will abandon sequestration and continue to extend tax cuts that are scheduled to expire -- most notably tax breaks on research and development, first-year capital investments costs and income gained through foreign corporations in nations with high tax rates.   Under these assumptions, the CBO says spending on Social Security, federal health care and debt interest would exceed taxes in 2031. That’s 16 years from now.   Is it fair for Brat to focus on the worst scenario? Two analysts told us yes, noting Congress already has a history of relenting on deficit-reducing policies. For example, Congress voted in 2013 to permanently extend the bulk of income tax cuts that were approved during the presidency of George W. Bush. The cuts were originally slated to expire in 2010.   ""The alternative fiscal scenario understands how some of the tough choices Congress needs to make conflict with promises members have made to their constituents,"" said Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute. ""Most people who would have to pick between the two scenarios would say Congress would most likely use the alternative one.""   Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, called Brat’s statement ""credible.""   A major point in the CBO report is that the day of reckoning is avoidable if Congress can break its standoff between Republicans, including Brat, who oppose tax increases, and Democrats who oppose cuts to entitlement programs.   The report says, ""To put the federal budget on a sustainable path for the long term, lawmakers would have to make significant changes to tax and spending policies: reducing spending for large benefit programs below the projected levels, letting revenues rise more than they would under current law, or adopting some combination of those approaches.""   Our ruling   Brat says that under the current U.S. path, ""In just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care and interest on the federal debt will exceed all tax revenue.""   A CBO report concludes that, in a worst-case scenario in which Congress resumes its old habits of cutting taxes and raising spending, this could happen in 2031 -- 16 years from now. Under a somewhat rosier scenario, in which current budget policies are kept in effect, the U.S. would hit bottom in 2044. Brat’s focus on the bleaker outlook is defensible because Congress this century has not shown great fiscal discipline.   We’re dealing with scenarios, however, and Brat’s statement would have been more accurate if he acknowledged from the outset that the U.S. ""could"" run out of tax money for many major programs instead of saying it ""will.""   No doubt, however, the U.S. is on a risky fiscal path. We rate Brat’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6B6580>],/factchecks/2015/jun/16/dave-brat/brat-says-entitlement-and-debt-payments-will-consu/

Meme says Bill Clinton, George W. Bush had basically the same policy on Iraq
","As Hillary Clinton makes a second bid for the presidency, the record of her husband -- former President Bill Clinton -- is being revived on social media. Recently, a meme has been circulating that makes a little fun of the former president’s ""teflon"" nature -- failings didn‘t stick to him the way they stuck to other politicians. The meme features a photograph of Clinton with an impish grin and a twinkle in his eye, along with the following caption: ""I gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs (weapons of mass destruction) and stuff. I said we needed a regime change for the security of our nation and to free the Iraqi people from an evil dictator. In 1998 I signed the Iraq Liberation Act. Ya’ll blamed it on Bush. Thanks for that!"" The meme argues that Clinton essentially escaped the opprobrium that plagued his successor, President George W. Bush, even though they said similar things about Saddam Hussein-era Iraq and the geopolitical threat it posed. By extension, the meme suggests that Democratic supporters of Clinton are hypocritical by celebrating Clinton but excoriating Bush. We looked back at the speeches in question and found that the meme’s pairing of Clinton’s views with Bush’s is misleading on several fronts. Clinton ‘gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs’ Clinton did indeed give a weekly radio address on Sept. 7, 1996, in which he said, ""We must redouble our efforts to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, such as those that Iraq and other rogue nations have developed."" However, it’s important to note that Clinton focused on chemical weapons and did not bring up nuclear weapons, as Bush would later do. ""The Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention,"" Clinton said. ""By voting for this treaty, the Senate can help to banish poison gas from the earth, and make America's citizens and soldiers much more secure. … The treaty will increase the safety of our citizens at home, as well as our troops in the field. The destruction of current stockpiles, including at least 40,000 tons of poison gas in Russia alone, will put the largest potential sources of chemical weapons out of the reach of terrorists, and the trade controls will deny terrorists easy access to the ingredients they seek."" Bush, by contrast, would later make much more sweeping claims. For instance, in a weekly radio address on Sept. 14, 2002, Bush said of Hussein-era Iraq, ""Today this regime likely maintains stockpiles of chemical and biological agents, and is improving and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical and biological weapons. Today Saddam Hussein has the scientists and infrastructure for a nuclear weapons program, and has illicitly sought to purchase the equipment needed to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. Should his regime acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year."" Then, during his State of the Union address on Jan. 28, 2003 -- on the eve of the war -- Bush said, ""The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production."" So while it’s true that both Clinton and Bush mentioned weapons of mass destruction in relation to Iraq, Bush’s claim was much more expansive. Clinton ‘said we needed a regime change’ Clinton was hardly friendly toward Hussein, but he did not take actions to use military might to oust the Iraqi leader from power. For instance, on Sept. 3, 1996, Clinton gave a speech responding to attacks by Iraqi forces on the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil in northern Iraq. ""Hussein's objectives may change, but his methods are always the same: violence and aggression -- against the Kurds, against other ethnic minorities, against Iraq's neighbors,"" Clinton said. ""Our answer to that recklessness must be strong and immediate, as President Bush demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm, as we showed two years ago when Iraq amassed its forces on Kuwait's border. … We must make it clear that reckless acts have consequences, or those acts will increase. We must reduce Iraq's ability to strike out at its neighbors, and we must increase America's ability to contain Iraq over the long run."" This approach was about containing Hussein, not about ousting him. Containment was also the mission of the years-long no-fly zones over Iraq that were enforced by George H.W. Bush, Clinton and, before the war began, George W. Bush. The meme cites the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act. Clinton did sign that law, which passed with just 38 dissenters in the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate. The law said it ""should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime."" However, the methods of regime change mentioned in the law are U.S. support for home-grown anti-Hussein movements, including humanitarian aid, broadcasting assistance and military goods and training. The recipients of such aid would need to include ""a broad spectrum of Iraqi individuals, groups, or both, opposed to the Saddam Hussein regime"" and be ""committed to democratic values, to respect for human rights, to peaceful relations with Iraq's neighbors, to maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity, and to fostering cooperation among democratic opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime."" That’s a big difference from Bush’s decision to use military force to attack and enter Iraq and topple Hussein by force. ""There's a difference between what Clinton did and said and George W. Bush's decision to overtly invade and topple the Hussein regime with force,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""We'll never know if Clinton would have done that. We know, however, that Bush did, and he and his supporters have to live with that alone. They don't get to cravenly try to share responsibility with a man who was long out of office when we invaded."" Our ruling The meme says Clinton ""gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs"" and ""said we needed a regime change,"" even though everyone blamed those things on George W. Bush. Clinton did cite weapons of mass destruction in a speech about Iraq that year, but it was much more limited -- it focused on Hussein’s holdings of chemical weapons, not the alleged nuclear or biological stockpiles that Bush later used as a justification for the Iraq War. Meanwhile, Clinton did sign a law backing regime change in Iraq, but it was limited to assistance to homegrown opposition groups, not to a ground war aimed at toppling Hussein, as Bush later pursued. The meme contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDE8380>],/factchecks/2015/jun/16/facebook-posts/meme-says-bill-clinton-george-w-bush-had-basically/

Group says Scott Walker bans employees from talking about climate change
","If a website from a progressive group is to be believed, state workers in Wisconsin cannot even say the words ""climate change."" So the scottaway.com website, developed by an operation called Forecast the Facts, allows readers to click a red button on the screen and get alternative words to use, like ""weather roulette"" and ""extended Popsicle season."" One tongue-in-cheek offering: ""In the U.S., FREE OUTDOOR HEATING is predicted to cause more heat waves, flooding, wildfires, sea level rise and drought."" Forecast the Facts, a project of the progressive Citizen Engagement Laboratory, says it developed the website in response to government denial of climate change. ""Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both run state governments that ban employees from talking about climate change,"" the group said on the site. Scott’s administration is reported to have an unofficial policy banning employees at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other agencies, from using ""climate change"" or ""global warming"" in official communications. But we are interested here in Wisconsin and Walker, who is a top GOP presidential contender. Are state government employees in Wisconsin banned from talking about climate change? The genesis of the claim  In April, we rated True a claim by the group NextGen Climate that Tia Nelson, executive secretary of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, was prohibited from talking about global warming while on state time. The board manages state lands and a trust that funds school libraries and makes loans to school districts. The board employs 10 full-time staff members. On April 7, the board voted 2-1 to approve a resolution that banned its staff from ""engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time."" The resolution grew out of concerns that Nelson had spent time advocating for climate change policies as part of her role as co-chair of Gov. Jim Doyle’s now disbanded task force on global warming. The board is to vote Tuesday June 16, 2015, on a measure that would change the ban from ""engaging in global warming or climate change work"" to engaging in ""policy advocacy"" on the board’s time. About the board  But Walker is not on the board. Its members, as defined by the state constitution, are three other statewide elected officials -- Attorney General Brad Schimel and state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Doug LaFollette, a Democrat. Thus, the board is not even part of the executive branch. Its 10 employees represent about .0003 percent of the state’s about 30,000 total employees. Cullen Werwie, communications director for the state Department of Administration, said no cabinet agency under Walker had such a ban. And we could not find any such evidence either. On the flip side, we did find examples of government engaging in conversation about climate change -- such as on the Department of Natural Resources’ web page, which talks about climate change and the Great Lakes, and the Department of Transportation documents related to its long-term transportation plan. A search for the terms ""climate change"" or ""global warming"" on wisconsin.gov sites yielded more than 1,000 results. A tenuous connection When we asked Forecast the Facts for back up to its claim, it sent an audio recording of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting and vote. But that board, of course, is separate from Walker. And the group’s claim was broader, referring generally to state government employees, not just those in one department. Brant Olson, the campaign director for the group, could not name any other part of state government with such as ban in place. Instead, the group cited a quote from Laurel Patrick, the governor’s spokeswoman, in a New York Times article about the board’s ban: ""Generally, Governor Walker does not think it is unreasonable to enact policies requiring board staff to focus on board-related activities."" Olson said the quote showed the climate change ban was ""clearly a decision he endorses."" While we were reporting this item, though, the group swapped in some new words. The language on the web site was changed to read: ""Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both support state agencies that reportedly ban employees from talking about climate change."" Even that could be outdated if the public lands board passes the measure to amend its rule. Our rating  Forecast the Facts said Walker runs a state government that bans ""employees from talking about climate change."" But the group could only name one obscure agency, outside of the governor's jurisdiction, that has such a rule in place. The rule was aimed at barring its workers from doing climate-change work while on state time. And that rule is poised to be amended. Meanwhile, we found plenty of examples where state agencies were discussing climate change. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA0CD80>],/factchecks/2015/jun/16/forecast-facts/group-says-scott-walker-bans-employees-talking-abo/

Hillary Clinton: Top hedge fund managers make more than all kindergarten teachers combined
","At her presidential campaign kick-off rally June 13, Hillary Clinton said the rich are getting richer, while many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Case in point: the disparity between Wall Street hedge fund managers and kindergarten teachers. ""While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet,"" she said, ""you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America’s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate."" Is the salary gap between kindergarten teachers and hedge fund managers really so wide? We decided to check it out. (We previously looked into a Clinton claim about taxes among the working class and the ultra-wealthy.) Kindergarten teachers The best data we could find on kindergarten teachers comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other statistical sources, such as the National Center for Education Statistics, don’t separate out kindergarten teachers specifically. According to a 2014 BLS report, there are about 158,000 kindergarten teachers in the United States. The figure includes teachers from both public and private schools, though it excludes special education instructors. The average annual pay for a kindergarten teacher is $53,480 -- ranging from less than $34,000 to more than $78,000. This is higher than what the average preschool teacher makes, but slightly lower than that of elementary, middle and high school teachers. So the aggregate pay for kindergarten teachers is about $8.5 billion. For some historical context, Susan Moore Johnson, an education professor at Harvard University, said kindergarten teachers have traditionally been paid less than teachers at higher grade levels. But the implementation of district-wide pay scales has made pay mostly uniform across all grades within a district -- with exact salary varying based on experience and education, rather than the grade level. However, this is not the case in all districts. Johnson added that, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, private school elementary teachers get paid, on average, several thousand dollars less than their public school counterparts. So how does the $8.5 billion collective salary of America’s kindergarten teachers compare to the top-25 hedge fund managers’ take-home pay? This number is a little bit more elusive. Hedge fund managers In its 2015 ranking of the top-earning hedge fund managers, Institutional Investor’s Alpha magazine said the group of 25 collectively earned $11.62 billion in compensation. At the top of the list is Citadel founder and CEO Kenneth Griffin, who earned an estimated $1.3 billion off his fund.   Lest your jaw remain fully hinged, 2014 was a bad year. The magazine called the total $11.62 billion bounty ""paltry"" compared to what it was in 2013, when the top-25 hedge managers made about twice as much -- $21.15 billion. There are, however, some issues with measuring hedge manager salaries, though the experts we polled couldn’t name a source that would necessarily be more accurate than Alpha magazine’s list. The magazine’s report is just an estimate -- based on the manager’s capital gains in the fund, as well as his (the top 25 are all men) estimated share in the firm’s management and performance fees charged to clients.   These numbers are hard to verify because no one really knows for certain a manager’s stake in his or her firm, said Nicole Boyson, a finance professor at Northeastern University. Additionally, funds charged to clients vary drastically among and within the different firms, and one would also have to account for how much of these fees go toward running the business, rather than the salary, Boyson said. ""If you could get comfortable with the ‘right’ number for a hedge fund manager, which I am not sure is possible, then you could compare it directly to the gross pay of teachers ... with the caveat that these two groups are likely subject to different tax rates, etc.,"" Boyson said. In any case, the best information we have shows 25 hedge managers making about $3 billion more than the country’s 158,000 kindergarten teachers combined -- and that’s in a bad year for the hedge managers. The data here isn't perfect, but the gap between the two professions is so wide that it seems a safe bet that hedge fund managers make more.  Our ruling Clinton said, ""The top-25 hedge fund managers (are) making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined."" Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that America’s 158,000 kindergarten teachers together make $8.5 billion a year. There are a few possible problems with the data for hedge fund managers’ earnings, but there’s no denying it’s significantly higher than a kindergarten teacher’s compensation. A rough estimate for the top-25 hedge fund managers shows they collectively earned $11.62 billion in 2014, and that was a bad year. In 2013, they earned approximately $21.15 billion. So using the smaller number, kindergarten teachers come up shy of hedge fund managers by about $3 billion, a huge margin. We rate Clinton’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE3FB40>],/factchecks/2015/jun/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-top-hedge-fund-managers-make-more-/

Bernie Sanders says a black male baby born today has 1-in-3 chance of prison
","Several 2016 presidential candidates in both parties have discussed how the criminal justice system might be improved. The latest to address this issue was Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during a June 11, 2015, interview on PBS. ""A black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail. This is (an) unspeakable tragedy."" When we took a closer look, we found that the statistic may not be far off -- but it’s hard to know for sure, because the data Sanders relies on is so old. As with other dramatic talking points we’ve seen over the years, this one has been repeated and repeated over a decade and a half without being updated, despite evidence that the underlying trends have changed direction. The statistic dates back to a 2003 paper published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the U.S. Justice Department. The Bureau of Justice Statistics paper includes the line, ""About 1 in 3 black males ... are expected to go to prison during their lifetime, if current incarceration rates remain unchanged."" By contrast, the paper said, one of every six Hispanic males and one of every 17 white males can be expected to go to prison during their lifetime. (For this fact-check, we’ll ignore Sanders’ imprecise use of ""jail,"" where people are held temporarily, rather than ""prison,"" where inmates are typically serving substantial sentences.) Not only was this data published 12 years ago, but the paper is based on data from 2001 -- a full 14 years ago. Despite its age, the statistic has been cited repeatedly -- notably in 2013 with the publication of a report by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform and promotes alternatives to incarceration. That report’s claim -- that ""if current trends continue, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime"" -- was footnoted to a 2011 paper by Marc Mauer, the Sentencing Project’s executive director. When we contacted Mauer, he said he doesn’t know of any updated research that would shed light on the percentage today. ""It's a very complex analysis to produce, so that's at least part of the reason that it hasn't been replicated in recent years,"" Mauer said. We did, however, find reason to believe that the trend line that had been assumed in the 2003 paper has changed course. According to annual Justice Department reports, in 2001 there were 3,535 sentenced black male prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction for every 100,000 black male residents. By 2013, the equivalent number was 2,805. So black incarceration rates were 21 percent lower in 2013 than they were in 2001. That said, there’s little doubt that black men have disproportionately higher incarceration rates. For instance, a study published in the journal Crime & Delinquency found that nearly half of black males and almost 40 percent of white males in the United States have been arrested by the age of 23. But because of the complexities of modeling the statistics, Mauer said, it’s hard to know how much the decline in incarceration rates would specifically change the one-in-three statistic Sanders used. ""We can't necessarily say that the one-in-three figure should be reduced by 21 percent, although if we did, it would bring it down to about 1 in 4, which is still quite dramatic,"" Mauer said. Our ruling Sanders said that ""a black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail."" This calculation, while it’s the most recent one available, is 14 years old, and changes in the underlying data suggest that the actual odds of incarceration may be somewhat smaller today. Still, other evidence suggests that blacks have a disproportionate likelihood of ending up in prison. On balance we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8DC440>],/factchecks/2015/jun/15/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-black-male-baby-born-today-has/

Mark Pocan says 25 percent of Americans have changed email, phone habits due to surveillance issues
","When former government contractor Edward Snowden leaked information about federal data collection in 2013, he drew attention to the extent the federal government is gathering information about U.S. citizens. Much of that data collection grew out of the Patriot Act, which was signed by President George W. Bush shortly after the 9/11 attacks, allowing government to monitor communication activity to prevent further acts of terrorism. The act set many provisions to expire in 2005 but the sunset was renewed and extended to June 1, 2015. The following day, a new act passed to again extend surveillance, but with some limitations placed on phone data collection. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan would have gone further. He voted against the extension and in March 2015 introduced a measure that would repeal the Patriot Act. Pocan tried to illustrate the effect of government surveillance on everyday Americans during an appearance on Devil's Advocates radio in Madison. In the May 20, 2015 interview, he said: ""The Pew Foundation did a poll and what's interesting and I think a chilling effect -- 25 percent of people in the country have said they changed their email and phone habits because of this kind of collection.""   Is Pocan right? Polling results When asked for backup, Pocan's people directed us to the survey conducted by the Pew Research Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, about technology use post-Snowden.   The survey asked American adults for their thoughts on government surveillance programs and whether they have changed their communication technology habits since learning details about the surveillance. Pocan claimed the poll showed 25 percent of Americans changed their email and phone habits because of the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act. But that’s not exactly what was found by the survey. And Pocan overstated the breadth of the changes. The survey asked if respondents had heard of government surveillance programs. Then, the poll offered readers a list of technologies, such as email and cell phones, and asked how --  if at all -- their use of the technologies had changed. The percentages below represent how many said they had changed their use of an individual technology ""a great deal"" or ""somewhat.""   Email accounts 18 percent Search engines 17 percent Social media sites 15 percent Cell phones 15 percent Mobile apps 13 percent Text messages 13 percent Landline phones 9 percent At least one of the above 25 percent   So, the 25 percent is not for any single category, or even from combining cell phones and email. Rather, it comes from tallying how many people listed at least one of the examples. Behind the numbers That is the number Pocan cited, but in doing so he missed some important nuances. First, the question about changing technology habits wasn't asked of everyone in the sample. An earlier question asked how much respondents had heard about government collecting information about  ""telephone calls, emails and other online communications as part of efforts to monitor terrorist activity."" The 87 percent of respondents who said they had heard ""a little"" or ""a lot"" were then asked about changing technology habits.   So that means, in the end, 22 percent -- not 25 percent -- of all of those surveyed said they had made such a change. Pocan also said the 25 percent of people ""changed their email and phone habits."" But, as noted, the list had seven categories and did not pair any two of them together. Pocan also suggested a cause-and-effect relationship between government surveillance programs and  people changing their technology habits. But the poll only asked whether respondents had changed their technology use ""since learning about U.S. phone and Internet monitoring."" For instance, someone may have dropped their landline phone service to save money, but did so some time after they heard of government surveillance. Research methodology Beyond Pocan's fumbling with the survey data, some aspects of how the survey was done could have affected the results. Pew used GfK Group’s national KnowledgePanel survey of 475 adults conducted between November 2014 and January 2015 for the analysis. KnowledgePanel is a national research sample, weighted to represent the country's demographics. Respondents were invited to participate in a series of three surveys in the course of a year, all of which would be about current events technology issues. Participants were told the survey questions would be about technology, which could draw people more interested in technology than the general public. And since the questions about technology use came in the third survey, the previous surveys could have sensitized respondents to pay more attention to technology issues and increase their concern. Those who are more interested and concerned about technology would be more likely to stick around, said Robert Griffin, professor at Marquette University’s Center for Mass Media Research. One in 5 dropped out between the first and third surveys. GfK did try to account for participants who drop out of the survey by adding in new participants and weighting their responses. Overall, experts said the methodology followed industry standards and wouldn’t have had a great affect on the results. Our rating Pocan said 25 percent of Americans changed their phone and email habits in response to federal data collection. He pointed to a Pew Research study as evidence, which our experts said checked out, but he misrepresented and overstated the statistic on the radio show.   For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6E9BC0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/15/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-says-25-percent-americans-have-changed-/

Scott correct: majority don't receive premium subsidies
","(Editor's note: An earlier version of this fact-check included an incorrect number for the $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits potentially at risk for 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states in the lawsuit King v. Burwell.)   The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule later this month in a lawsuit that could wipe out premium subsidies for millions of Americans under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law.   About 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states who use the federal marketplace could be at risk of losing a total of $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits and face net premium increases of 287 percent, according to a state-by-state analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.   Many in the GOP, particularly Tea Party Republicans, are likely to resist extending the subsidies, even temporarily, The Washington Times reported June 5.   Those Republicans are much more worried about angering their base by appearing to concede on Obamacare than they are about having a handful of constituents lose their subsidies, the newspaper said..   ""Ninety-seven percent of Americans aren't receiving those subsidies,"" Georgia Congressman Austin Scott told reporters.   That statistic caught the eye of a PolitiFact reader who asked us to do some checking. ""Is that claim accurate?"" the reader wrote. . We promised to do some checking.   First a little background about the closely watched lawsuit, King v. Burwell.    The plaintiff, King, argues that because the health care law refers to ""an exchange established by the state,"" individuals in states with federally run exchanges are not eligible for subsidies.    Others contend that the clear intent of the ACA  -- the most significant overhaul of U.S.healthcare since passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 --  is to allow individuals to obtain subsidized insurance regardless of whether they obtain it through a state or federal exchange.   Currently, 34 states rely on the federal exchange and could lose subsidies if the Supreme Court rules in favor of King.    Florida could be the most affected, with 1.3 million residents losing monthly subsidies worth a combined $206 million a month, according to forecasts.   In Georgia, 412,385 people could lose subsidies, with a total monthly value of $113 million, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis showed.   States such California and New York, which set up their own exchanges, would be untouched by the ruling.   So what about Scott’s statement that 97 percent of Americans aren’t receiving ACA insurance subsidies. We reached out to Ryann DuRant, Scott’s communications director.   She told us Scott’s statement was based on calculations that were done using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and population information from the U.S. Census.   This includes: about 6.4 million people who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance;, estimates of all insurance subsidies, state and federal combined,totalling about nine million; the national  population estimate of about 318 million. (We calculated 2.83 percent or just shy or 3 percent with subsidies, leaving about 97 percent of Americans without subsidies)   We asked the Kaiser Family Foundation in D.C.to independently run the numbers for us.   Chris Lee, a communications officer with the foundation, said about 2.7 percent of Americans receive ACA tax credits.    His calculation is based on information that slightly more than 8.6 million of the nation’s 321 million residents have received advance premium tax credits, or subsidies, to buy their insurance, Lee said.   That would mean about 97.3 percent of Americans aren’t receiving subsidies to buy insurance.   DuRant told us Scott is co-sponsoring a bill, introduced June 4, to repeal ObamaCare and ""address healthcare for all Americans.   ""So in no way was this to discount the 3 percent or the 97 percent,"" she said. ‘We are concerned with 100 percent of Americans and with lowering health insurance premiums for 100 percent of Americans.""   The GOP-controlled Congress has repeatedly expressed interest in passing legislation to fully repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Scott’s bill is one of several options that is available.   .Our ruling U.S. Rep. Austin Scott said 97 percent of Americans don’t receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. His numbers are close.   We rate his statement True.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA08640>],/factchecks/2015/jun/15/austin-scott/scott-correct-majority-dont-receive-premium-subsid/

Warner says millennials will have 75 percent of jobs in 2025
","The dominance of millennial workers -- the generation born from the early 1980s to the late 1990s -- is fast emerging in the United States, according to Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.   ""Millennials are now 80 million strong. They pushed folks like me, the baby boomers, off the stage in terms of the percentage of the workforce. They’ll be 75 percent of the workforce in the next 10 years,"" Warner said during a June 4 interview on CNBC.   Warner repeated the figure in a speech the same day to the New America Foundation in Washington. In both instances, he used it to illustrate what he said is a need to address the economic security of millennials who are coming of age in a ""gig economy"" where they earn a living doing short term projects rather than relying on a steady job with retirement benefits.   We wondered whether Warner’s figure is correct.   Rachel Cohen, the senator’s spokeswoman, sent us links to articles in The Washington Post, National Journal, Wired and other publications that used the 75 percent statistic. A quick Google search of our own found many other citations. But there were problems: None of the materials identified the original source of the figures and we couldn’t find it on our own.   On the other hand, we came across an article last November in The Wall Street Journal that crunched projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found the 75 the percent claim is a sham.   We came to the same conclusion after examining the BLS data. The Pew Research Center defines millennials as those who are now aged 18-34.     Using that age definition for millennials means the generation, in 2025, will be 28 to 44 years old. The BLS projects that 10 years from now, there will be 73.9 million people aged  25-44 in the U.S. workforce. They’ll make up 44 percent of a total labor force of 168.7 million.   The Journal noted in its analysis that even if younger people in the generation after millennials -- unofficially dubbed generation z -- are included, the proportion still wouldn’t hit the three-quarters mark. The millennials and generation z workers would comprise 56 percent of the workforce in 2025.   That said, there’s no doubt that the millennials are coming of age. Pew recently reported that during the first three months of this year, they became the largest group in the labor force, with 53.5 million workers, or 34 percent. Generation X has 52.7 million workers, also 34 percent, and 44.6 million baby boomers were working, or 29 percent of the workforce.   Our ruling   Warner says millennials will make up 75 percent of the workforce a decade from now. Projections show that they’re on track to make up about 44 percent of the workforce in 10 years.   Clearly, the millennials are rising, but nowhere near the pace Warner describes. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA08D00>],/factchecks/2015/jun/15/mark-warner/warner-says-millennials-will-have-75-percent-jobs-/

Jeb Bush and majority of Republican voters actually agree on immigration, George Will says
","As Jeb Bush readies his push to win the Republican nomination, one of the charges he has to fend off is that he lacks conservative zeal. The issue popped up June 14, 2015, on Fox News Sunday, when a viewer suggested in a note to the show that Bush seems like more of a Democrat than a Republican. Conservative columnist George Will sprang to Bush’s defense. On cutting taxes and government as governor of Florida, and on social issues, Will said Bush was every bit a conservative as President Ronald Reagan, and maybe more. Will downplayed Bush’s electoral challenge even on the hot button issue of immigration. ""He happens to be where a majority of Republicans are,"" Will said. ""His (position) is a pathway to legal status."" For the record, Bush’s position on immigration has been complicated. But Bush’s most recent comments suggest a pathway to legal status, so we think Will’s point is fair. The question is: Do most Republicans favor a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants like Bush now does? We looked at what the polls say. The latest report from the Pew Research Center bolsters Will’s claim. Pew’s survey found that 56 percent of Republicans favor a path to legal status, not to be confused with citizenship. Legal status would allow undocumented adults to work and pay taxes, but they would not be able to vote. However, George Hawley, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, cautions that the Pew survey also shows a complicated set of attitudes. ""A majority of Republicans also felt that giving people who came to the United States illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong,"" Hawley said. ""Further, 42 percent of Republicans felt legal immigration should be decreased, compared to 21 percent who think it should be increased. Also, far more Republicans view immigrants as a burden, 63 percent, than view them as an asset for the country, 27 percent."" At the end of the day, Hawley said he wouldn’t call Will’s statement inaccurate, but it might be misleading. ""I would describe Republicans as ambivalent on questions relating to immigration policy,"" Hawley said. Timing matters Republican support for a path toward legal status has held a slim majority, but there’s been an ebb and flow in the margin depending on the news of the day. When President Barack Obama announced last December that he would hold off deportation for a larger number of undocumented immigrants, feelings among Republicans hardened. A December 2014 poll by Pew saw an 11 percentage point drop in support between the beginning and the end of the year. A majority of Republicans still supported legalized status, 53 percent, but it had been as high as 64 percent. The drop put support within the 5 percent margin of error. Still, older surveys even show that Republicans could get behind the more contentious goal of citizenship. A 2013 Fox News poll found that 56 percent of GOP voters endorsed a path to citizenship with various conditions such as paying back taxes and learning English. Stephen Nuno is a political scientist at Northern Arizona University. ""Republicans generally see mass deportation to be unrealistic, so the strength of their support is usually conditional on the terms of legality, whether it be penalties, stronger border security, and so on,"" Nuno said. Nuno also said that when Republicans feel better about the economy, they tend to take a more pragmatic view on undocumented immigrants, and support for legalized status goes up. Primary voters There is however the question of views among Republican primary voters who generally take a tougher position. One indication of where they stand comes from the 2014 election. According to exit polls reported by National Journal, 57 percent of Republican voters felt that undocumented immigrants should be deported, while just 38 percent favored legal status. More recently, an NBC/Marist poll of likely Republican voters in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina probed whether voters could support a candidate who endorsed a path to citizenship. In Iowa, Republicans were evenly split, while in New Hampshire and South Carolina, a slim majority said such a candidate would be unacceptable. It’s important to note that the question was about citizenship, not legal status. Our ruling Will said that a majority of Republicans support Bush’s stance to craft a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Polls show that more than half of Republicans do hold that view. Republican positions have shifted over time and Republican primary voters might take a harder line than the typical Republican voter. With those caveats in mind, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA701C0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/14/george-will/jeb-bush-and-majority-republicans-actually-agree-i/

Hillary Clinton has 'been very clear' on trade, campaign chair says
","One might expect that as a former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would have well-defined views on the ongoing fight over President Barack Obama’s trade agenda. But critics of the Democratic presidential candidate -- even within her own party -- have chastised Clinton for taking a vague position on the debate over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. Democrats are deeply divided over the deal, primarily over whether Congress should accept legislative procedures that would make it easier to approve a deal amid concerns regarding American workers and the environment. ""Surely, a person who was secretary of state understands something about American leadership,"" said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Fox News Sunday June 14. ""And to refuse to even take a position (on TPP) is just sort of mystifying to me."" Clinton’s supporters, meanwhile, say there’s nothing mystifying about Clinton’s position. Here’s how Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta explained it to Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd. ""She’s been very clear on where she stands on trade,"" Podesta said, noting that Clinton has said a trade agreement must protect workers and national security. ""But the agreement’s not final, so when it is final, she’ll render a judgement on that. She’s stated her concerns, but she’s got a clear standard that it’s got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it."" We decided to take a look at Clinton’s comments on trade from the campaign so far and see if she has expressed a ""very clear"" stance -- a sentiment echoed by Clinton campaign hands Robby Mook and Karen Finney, also on the June 14 political talk shows. Recent comments To a certain extent, Clinton has laid out where she stands on trade in general in recent months, but she has avoided saying whether she definitively supports the pending deal and the fast-track trade authority many believe is necessary to make the deal happen. Here’s a selection of her recent comments, starting with the most recent: June 14 at an Iowa rally: Just a few hours after the morning shows, Clinton said Obama should ""work with his allies in Congress"" to ensure better protection for workers and ""to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible."" Even though she urged them to make some changes to the deal, she didn’t specify the exact changes, nor did explicitly express overall support or disapproval. May 22 at a New Hampshire press conference: Clinton said she has some questions about the TPP, regarding the potential for currency manipulation and the controversial investor-settlement-dispute mechanism, as well as health and environmental concerns. ""I've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards,"" she said. May 19 at a small business lending roundtable: ""I've said over and over again any trade deal that I will support must increase jobs, must increase wages, must give us more economic competitive power around the world to sell our products and must be good for our national security."" April 17 statement: A campaign spokesman said Clinton would be watching the TPP ""closely"" to make sure it meets her standards. He said, ""Hillary Clinton believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests: First, it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen our national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls short of these tests. The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade’s sake."" So Clinton has said she supports trade under certain conditions, though she hasn’t really said anything that shows how she would vote if she was still a member of the Senate today. Namely, she hasn’t said whether or not she would vote to grant Obama fast-track trade promotion authority, the legislative maneuver that would make it easier to pass a trade deal -- currently the main source of Democrat infighting over trade. Speaking about TPP in a 2014 Council on Foreign Relations interview, Clinton briefly talked about fast track, saying only that she thought it was ""not likely"" that Congress would grant Obama the authority. But she said that she hoped the administration would be able to convince Congress and the American people that it’s critical for the American economy to address ""border barriers to our products"" so that the deal could pass even without fast track. Before the campaign Before Clinton’s 2016 campaign officially launched -- and also before the trade fight heated up -- Clinton made statements that showed general support for TPP, even saying that the deal as it stood then satisfied many of her concerns. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that she didn’t want to definitively give support for the trade deal before the details are all hammered out -- but she still called it the ""signature economic pillar of our strategy in Asia."" She said the deal lowered ""trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. ... It was also important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia."" Speaking in Australia in 2012, she said the ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment."" It’s also interesting to note Clinton’s 2008 campaign position on pending trade deals -- much more defined than her current position on TPP -- and how they changed when she joined the Obama administration.   For example, in an April 2008 speech where she discussed a proposed trade agreement with Colombia, she said, ""As I have said for months, I oppose the deal. I have spoken out against the deal, I will vote against the deal, and I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement."" But as secretary of state in 2010, she said of the same deal: ""First, let me underscore President Obama's and my commitment to the Free Trade Agreement. We are going to continue to work to obtain the votes in the Congress to be able to pass it. We think it's strongly in the interests of both Colombia and the United States."" Our ruling Podesta said Hillary Clinton has been ""very clear on where she stands on trade."" While you can argue that clear is a bit of a subjective term, it’s hard for any neutral person to say Clinton has been clear about trade, particularly in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton has avoided answering whether she supports grants Obama fast-track trade promotion authority, which is seen as the linchpin to cutting a trade deal in Asia. Clinton has said what she would like in an ideal trade deal in terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But she has yet to say definitively whether or not Obama’s pending trade deal meets her standards -- though she has admitted some provisions could use improvement. This is a change from just a couple years ago, when she seemed more supportive than not of the pending trade deal. Does any of this sound ""very clear"" to you? We’ll concede a little wiggle room based on Podesta’s wording. But that’s about it. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC653A40>],/factchecks/2015/jun/14/john-podesta/hillary-clinton-has-been-very-clear-trade-campaign/

ACLU says profits from traffic cameras go to private companies -- not government
","When is a loss not a loss? When it comes to traffic cameras in Providence. That's one lesson we learned when we tried to fact-check a claim about the cameras that flag cars that run red lights in certain intersections. The assertion arose during a hearing on proposed legislation to expand the use of automated cameras to police speeding in school zones. Legislation authorizing the practice was the subject of a May 6, 2015, hearing by the House Judiciary Committee. The sponsor of House bill 6075, Rep. Robert Craven, D-North Kingstown, told the committee, ""This is a bill that not only comes with no cost to those municipalities that choose to use it, but it actually creates a profit center."" Not so fast, said Hillary Davis, a policy analyst for the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. These cameras have been a money-losing proposition for Providence. ""The profit is going to the private corporations, not to the city or the state,"" she said. ""In fact, the City of Providence was so behind and lost so much money on the red light camera program that last year the General Assembly had to change the law to say that the City of Providence no longer owed the state the several hundred thousand dollars that it had not paid in the several years of the red light camera program."" Because she focused on Providence, we wondered if the red light camera system is, in fact, a money-losing proposition with all the profit going to the vendor. First, some background. Providence's cameras, installed in 2006 and 2007, were meant in part to discourage people from running red lights. By that gauge, they appear to have been successful. The number of tickets issued has decreased in monitored intersections from 15,531 in 2008 to 4,149 in 2014, although some of the decline may be due to the fact some of the cameras have been broken. A police officer reviews the video and decides whether to issue a ticket. The person to whom the car is registered gets the ticket in the mail. If the registrant challenges the ticket, the video is shown in court so the judge can make a ruling. On paper, the revenue from the fines were supposed to be shared by the city, the state and Affiliated Computer Services Government Solutions (ACS), which bought, installed and maintained the cameras. But in practice, things haven't worked out that way. When we contacted Davis, she said that most of her testimony on the economics of the cameras was based on an ACLU report, released in June 2008. She said she later tried to follow up with the city, but didn’t get the information she wanted. The 2008 report itself concluded that since installing the cameras, ""the city is actually paying out much more than it is taking in."" ""Providence’s expenses have exceeded revenue received from the tickets by $749,431, much of which has gone to the private company maintaining the cameras. Including [the] equipment replacement costs adds $223,472 to the City’s expenses over the [first] two years, bringing the City’s total net losses to $972,903 – nearly one million dollars!"" the report said. But, it turns out, there were a lot of things the ACLU didn't know at the time and didn't find out until PolitiFact started investigating. Since her testimony, Davis and the ACLU have reviewed some of the additional documents. She now calls the saga of Providence’s traffic cameras a ""crazy rabbit hole.""   That's because, as we now know, while the city was nabbing red-light runners, it wasn't exactly following the legal rules of the road. The explanation has more curves than Route 95 in Pawtucket. So fasten your seat belt. Things are going to get ""curiouser and curiouser."" Under the city's initial 2004 contract with ACS, the traffic camera company, the city was supposed to pay the company $4,550 per month for each approach to an intersection that was monitored by cameras. The plan was to pay the bill with revenue collected from each ticket. In addition, under state law, the first $35 of each $85 ticket was supposed to have gone to the state. That meant that there had to be 91 paid tickets at each approach before the city could earn enough money to pay ACS. (An approach is any street leading to an intersection with a camera. An intersection could have more than one approach.) Most approaches didn't generate enough tickets to pay the vendor’s full bill. Even in 2008, when lots of citations were being issued, we calculated that only 6 of the 25 approaches were catching enough red light runners to give ACS its full contracted payment.   Nonetheless, the city couldn't lose money on the deal because, under the terms of the contract, if there weren't enough offenders to pay the bill for each approach, the city could indefinitely defer its payments to ACS. And if, at the end of the contract, the city still owed ACS, that debt would be automatically forgiven. So contrary to what the ACLU said, the vendor wasn’t getting all of the money. What actually happened was that the city wasn't paying ACS anything at all, at least not initially. The city's 2010 report on the camera system, prepared by ACS, says that the private company was paid nothing in 2006 and 2007, the first two years when the cameras were operating. The report didn’t explain why. When ACS renegotiated its contract with the city in 2008, the city acknowledged that, as of June 30, 2008, it owed ACS $2.05 million.  But ACS agreed to take $500,000 and forgive $1.55 million. Even with the $500,000 payment, the 2010 city report says, the city made $1 million over the first five years of the program. But that doesn't reflect reality either. In that 2010 report, submitted to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, the city reports  that it had paid the state more than $1.6 million between 2006 and 2010. But it hadn't. It kept the money. By 2013, the amount the city owed the state exceeded $2.2 million, or the equivalent of 62,857 red light tickets, according to city records and spokesman Evan England. What happened next was something the Mad Hatter might have appreciated: A deal was cut. Tucked away in Article 9 of the state's 2013 budget bill was a provision saying that, ""no city or town shall be required to make payments to the state in implementing any provision of [the automated traffic violation monitoring systems law] . . . until July 1, 2013."" The General Assembly passed it, Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed it and -- Poof! -- the debt was gone. Nonetheless, the city was still on the hook from that day forward. But not for long. The following year, the General Assembly passed legislation, sponsored by five Providence Democrats in the Senate and four Providence Democrats in the House eliminating the requirement that the state get a $35 cut for each ticket issued using an automated camera system, effective July 1, 2015. Meanwhile, the city signed another renewal with ACS (now known as Xerox State & Local Solutions). That new deal,  in effect since June 26, 2014, calls for upgrading five existing approaches, installing cameras at 15 new approaches and decommissioning 20 others. It also restructures the payment system. In recent years, with Xerox getting its money and ticket volume down, the camera system hasn't been quite so lucrative for Providence. But that situation is expected to turn around July 1 when the state stops taking its cut. In fact, the city says it expects to get $955,000 in revenue from the cameras during the 2016 fiscal year. We'll see. Our ruling Hillary Davis said, ""The profit [from automated traffic enforcement cameras] is going to the private corporations, not to the city or state."" In the case of Providence's camera system, which was the focus of Davis' comments, the private corporation has certainly gotten paid something, although it ended up forgiving $1.55 million in debt that Providence owed. The state has also made some money, although only a fraction of what it was entitled to. Remember, the state waived more than $2.2 million it was supposed to get from the city. Providence, the third party in this deal, did very well for itself. Davis and the ACLU have plenty of reasons to question the camera system. But it's clear that all the revenue is not going to the traffic camera company. We rate her statement False -- although she was right about the rabbit hole.

John Oliver says Florida is a model for pretrial services
","Poking fun at Florida is oh-so-easy. So HBO host and news-comedian John Oliver surprised us, and maybe even himself, on Last Week Tonight when he hailed Florida as a model for the country for a component of its judicial system — and not for, say, assaults with a slice of pizza, or something like that. Oliver criticized the money-bail system that exists throughout most of the country in his June 7 episode, saying it leaves people who are too poor to make bail for non-violent offenses behind bars, which drives up jail costs and destroys livelihoods. As an alternative, Oliver made the case for pretrial service programs. With these services, he said, a person who is arrested would be interviewed by a specialist to see if he or she poses a flight risk or is dangerous. The specialist makes a recommendation to a judge, and the judge decides whether to send the person home, where he or she may be monitored with drug tests, ankle monitors and phone calls about court dates. ""And pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country in places ranging from Oregon to Florida,"" Oliver said. ""And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change."" He added, ""Did you know by the way that under Florida law, if you possess over 5 grams of meth, you can marry it. That’s a fact. That’s a legal fact. That’s an actual photo that ran in a newspaper’s wedding section in Florida. And yet even counties in Florida recognize that our money bail system is broken."" As he described that ""fact,"" this image appeared:  For the record, it is not a ""legal fact"" that you can marry meth in Florida. That was a joke. However, we did want to unpack his more serious claim that Florida is a ""model for progressive change"" for its successful pretrial release programs. That wasn’t meant to be a joke. Oliver’s staff did not comment for this fact-check. Pretrial justice experts we consulted said while Florida has some positive things going for it, calling it a nationwide model is a bit of a stretch. Cherise Fanno Burdeen is executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, which supports alternatives to money bail. (The institute is also petitioning Gov. Andrew Cuomo to end New York’s money bail system after the suicide of Kalief Browder, who was kept in Rikers Island prison for three years without trial in part because he could not make bail after being accused of stealing a backpack). Burdeen, who said she spoke to Oliver’s team before the show, said she would not have hailed Florida as a progressive pretrial services model. Washington, D.C., and Kentucky, yes. Oregon and Colorado, sure. But Florida? ""That’s probably not a statement I would make,"" Burdeen said. ""It’s definitely more nuanced."" In the mid 1970s, amid national reforms, some Florida counties started pretrial service programs — mainly because of jail overcrowding. Programs exist today in 29 of 67 counties. Not all states have done that, Burdeen said. But Florida does not offer pretrial services statewide, and ""it certainly has a long way to go in terms of other needed components of reform,"" she said. One example: Only a few counties use accredited standards for assessing an arrested person’s flight risk and danger to the community before trial. The counties that are accredited by the Florida Corrections Accreditation Commission are Alachua, Broward, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange and Volusia, which combined are home to 7.2 million residents, or 36 percent of the state's estimated population. Florida could be considered loosely ""progressive,"" Burdeen said, because pretrial programs exist in most counties where the vast majority of criminal case filings happen. In 2013, Miami-Dade County served more than 10,500 people, Broward County served more than 6,000, and Palm Beach, Polk and Pinellas counties served more than 5,000, according to the annual report of pretrial service programs in the state by the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. The point of the bail system is to ensure a defendant showed up for court, and sometimes the only way to do it is to keep him or her in jail, said Bob Dekle, University of Florida College of Law legal skills professor. ""Florida’s model for pretrial detention and release is a fair, equitable model,"" he said. ""I don’t know that it’s on the outer fringes of the avant garde in turning people loose from jail, and I rather doubt it, but I don’t believe that it is regressive. It’s just there and that’s what it is."" For virtually all crimes except capital offenses, Florida law says the presumption of release should be on nonmonetary conditions. Still, Burdeen said most counties rely on a bond schedule for crimes. ""If you can pay it out, you get out, if not you go to first appearance,"" she said. ""Almost without a doubt the judge continues that amount from the schedule; if not, you back to your cell."" Experts also pointed out that ""pretrial services"" means something different depending on the jurisdiction. In Florida’s Monroe County, home of the Florida Keys, pretrial services workers interview defendants, review their criminal histories and develop recommendations for a judge based on a point-scoring system that helps determine if they should be released on their own recognizance or released under supervision of the pretrial services agency. The judge can also choose to set a money bond amount. In Pinellas County, pretrial services are not run by a court or a county agency — they're run through the sheriff's office. When someone is arrested, booking deputies have the option of setting a recommended bond for an offense or a higher or lower bond depending on the circumstances. Often the low bond is to release the defendant at the jail on his or her own recognizance, known as ROR. If a defendant remains in jail until the first appearance, the judge could still decide to change the booking deputy's bond or recommend unsupervised or supervised ROR, which could include check-ins or electronic monitoring. When a judge is unsure, pretrial services staffers can conduct their own investigation into a defendant's background and advise the judge accordingly. ""It's a very, very useful tool to manage the jail population,"" said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri. Spurgeon Kennedy, National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies vice president, said the vast majority of American counties do not have pretrial programs, so the fact that Florida has some is a positive in his group’s view. That said, the money-bail system remains prevalent and powerful throughout the state. ""Unfortunately, Florida uses money primarily, and that’s the reason why we would hesitate to say what is happening in Florida is a model,"" Kennedy said. ""But you do have these programs."" Kennedy would look elsewhere for states closer to pretrial service utopia. In Washington, D.C., as Oliver also highlighted, the Pretrial Services Agency helps judges in the D.C. Superior Court and U.S. District Court by recommending release conditions for defendants that are based on their circumstances and are usually non-financial. And Kentucky abolished its commercial bail system in 1976, relying instead on a single statewide agency employing pretrial officers who interview people in jail and facilitate their release. Our ruling Oliver said ""pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country,"" namely Florida, adding, ""And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change."" Experts in pretrial justice, several of whom talked with Oliver’s staff, said certain counties within Florida have demonstrated success with pretrial services as a way to reduce jail costs and eliminate overcrowding in jails. But they said he went a bit too far in leaving his viewers with the idea that Florida is among states that go above and beyond for defendants. There are pockets of progress, advocates said, but the commercial bail bonding industry is also strong in the state, and not every county has pretrial services. Oliver’s claim rates claim Half True. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7B3A80>],/factchecks/2015/jun/12/john-oliver/john-oliver-hails-pretrial-services-florida-progre/

Citing collective bargaining law, Scott Walker says Wisconsin's rank on ACT test has risen to second
","Gov. Scott Walker is a contender for president largely because of the collective bargaining reforms -- affecting teachers and most other public employees -- that he signed into law following massive protests in Madison. On June 2, 2015, at a Florida gathering of announced and likely Republican candidates for the White House, Walker credited the March 2011 law for what he said was Wisconsin's improved ranking on the ACT college preparation test. ""A lot of protesters at the time claimed that public education was going to fail,"" Walker said, then went on to list changes made by what is known as Act 10. ""I’m proud to tell you that today, we no longer have seniority or tenure. That means we can hire and fire based on merit, we can pay based on performance. That means we can put the best and the brightest in our classrooms and we can pay them to be there. ""I said the proof is in the pudding; the facts don’t lie. Four years later, graduation rates are up, third-grade reading scores are up, ACT scores are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam."" Saying Wisconsin's ACT scores are now second-best suggests Wisconsin's ranking on the test has improved since Act 10 and that the law played a role. Let's see. Where we've been Two previous fact checks help set the table for evaluating Walker's claim. 1. In February 2011, with the protests being carried out daily, the Wisconsin Democratic Party claimed that the five states that outlaw collective bargaining for teachers all ranked below 44th in the nation in test scores, while Wisconsin ranked second. PolitiFact National rated the claim False, partly because the data cited for both major college preparation tests -- the ACT and the SAT -- was a decade old. More importantly, in terms of evaluating Walker's claim, our colleagues concluded after talking with experts that ""it’s impossible to know whether collective bargaining has any role in causing test scores to rise. That’s because countless other demographic, economic and cultural factors play a role in shaping a state’s test scores."" 2. In June 2014, we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that graduation rates and third-grade reading scores in Wisconsin were higher than when he took office in January 2011. Both numbers were up compared with the year before Walker took office. But we found that some credit may be owed to prior elected officials, because the trend lines hadn’t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era. We also noted in that item that Wisconsin students’ longstanding high-achievement scores on the ACT are well known. But let's flesh them out. Here are Wisconsin’s average composite scores on the ACT, and where Wisconsin ranked among the states where more than half the students take the exam. Those are the ones Walker specifically cited in making the claim. We took a look at the three years before and the three years after 2011, when Act 10 was adopted.   Year Score Rank 2008 22.3 3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2009 22.3 3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2010 22.2 3rd -- tied with Nebraska -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2011 (Act 10 OK’d in March) 22.2 3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2012 22.1 2nd -- tied with Iowa -- behind Minnesota 2013 22.1 2nd -- tied with Iowa -- behind Minnesota 2014 22.2 2nd -- behind Minnesota 
So, Wisconsin's rank moved from third to second in 2012, the year after Act 10 was adopted, and has remained there. But that's not because Wisconsin's long-stable composite score has improved. Indeed, the score is virtually unchanged since Act 10. Moreover, as we noted previously, there is no evidence to show how any one factor affects ACT scores -- particularly an indirect factor such as a personnel policy like Act 10. Matthew Di Carlo, senior research fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which studies education policy, reiterated that it would be ""enormously complicated"" to determine how any one factor  such as socioeconomic status affects ACT scores. That's all the more true for changes in collective bargaining -- a policy that affects personnel rather than one, such as tutoring, that directly affects student learning, he said. And while Act 10 could have some indirect effects on ACT scores -- such as through the retention of teachers -- those effects couldn't be gauged for some period of years, Di Carlo said. Our rating Walker said that four years after his collective bargaining law took effect, ACT scores in Wisconsin ""are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam."" There is an element of truth in Walker’s statement, in that Wisconsin's rank moved from third to second in 2012, the year after the Act 10 collective bargaining reforms were adopted. But the rank didn’t improve because of an improvement in Wisconsin’s score. And there is no evidence that Act 10 affected the ranking. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False.

Federal data mostly back claim about movie and TV jobs
","Georgia’s lucrative tax credits for movie and TV production generate more than just the chance to spot Betty White and Chris Evans noshing in restaurants around Atlanta. The industry also supports more than 24,000 jobs and pays more than $1.68 billion in wages to those workers, according to a press release this week from the Motion Picture Association of America. That’s the equivalent of the entire population of the city of Decatur working in an industry that in 2013 saw $261 million spent on location in shoots in Georgia, according to a 2013 report from a nonprofit that tracks English-language film production worldwide. So, PolitiFact Georgia thought those numbers seemed high but plausible – especially if you count the hordes of zombies needed every week in ""The Walking Dead."" We decided to check it out. First, it’s worth knowing that the MPAA released its data for Georgia and other states as part of a hard push of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), in which Congress defines negotiating priorities for trade agreements. In this case, the Senate has approved but the House has yet to vote on providing ""fast track"" authority for President Obama to speed a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (TPP) through Congress. In other words, the deal would expand trade and access for Atlanta’s zombies – not to mention ""The Hunger Games"" franchise and the Evans’ now-filming ""Captain America: Civil War"" – to much of the Asia-Pacific region, said MPAA spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. ""The movies made in Georgia are reaching a global audience, and it’s important we can access those markets with as little friction as possible,"" Bedingfield said. ""The jobs grown in Georgia are dependent on being able to market those products easily overseas."" Georgia has heavily incentivized the industry in recent years to lure projects. Production companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000. Another 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits. The MPAA used the federal government’s own data, compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, in calculating the total job and wage estimates. The BLS data broad categories of motion pictures and broadcasting show an annual average of 20,869 employees and total annual wages of $1.55 billion in 2013. But the MPAA drills down deeper into those broad categories and others, excluding the recording artists covered in the broad category but captures jobs from other categories – such as payroll workers and electricians – it can show work in the film or TV industry, said Julia Jenks, the vice president of research for the MPAA. In some of those more specific groups, such as cable TV production, all of the jobs and pay count toward the MPAA tally. Others, such as costume rental and wardrobe, are counted based on U.S. Census or research calculations that tell what proportion of those jobs work in the industry. The MPAA calls that its adjustment factor on the government figures. ""It’s our best estimate, and a very conservative estimate,"" Jenks said. Using those parameters, the BLS counts 48,539 jobs but the MPAA tally for Georgia is 24,162: Job Code Description BLS total Adjustment MPAA total 334614 Audio/Video Reproduction 152 68.7% 104 512110 Motion Picture Video & Production 3,864 100% 3,864 512120 Motion Picture & Video Distribution 22 100% 22 512191 Teleproduction, Other Post Production 148 42% 62 512199 Other Motion Picture & Video 59 100% 59 532220 Formal Wear/Costume Rental 623 3% 19 532490 Other Machinery Rental, Leasing 1,349 6% 81 541214 Payroll 15,739 30% 4,722 561311 Employment Placement 6,198 1% 62 711510 Independent artists, writers 1,291 23% 297 423990 Prerecorded Video Wholesale 1,738 12% 209 512131 Movie Theaters (except drive-ins) 3,348 100% 3,348 512132 Drive-in Theaters 45 100% 45 515120 Television Broadcasting 7,138 100% 7,138 515210 Cable & Subscription Programming 3,670 100% 3,670 519130 Internet Publishing & Broadcasting 2,778 3% 83 532230 Video & Disk Rental 377 100% 377 Using the BLS tables, PolitiFact Georgia was able to replicate all of the job figures, except in three categories. The 2013 quarterly census shows 303 jobs in audio/video reproduction – exactly double the MPAA’s count. And, the official BLS data does not have an annual average for jobs in the one category few think of as a movie industry gig: working in movie and drive-in theaters, economist Timothy Ewing said. A nine-month average is available for those jobs, which have high turnover. But that means they are comparable to the yearly figures in other categories. Ewing could not comment on the adjustments the MPAA made in categories, other than to note it would create more conservative estimates. So, using the BLS-confirmed data, and the MPAA’s own adjustments, the total number of jobs drops to 20,873. But the MPAA is conservative in other ways. It does not include at all freelance workers common in production, who provide contract work in, say, makeup or construction. PolitiFact Georgia recently showed that Tyler Perry’s new studio planned for Fort McPherson will alone create between 2,000 to 6,000 of those jobs. It is reasonable to think the MPAA could easily reach its 24,000 jobs figure if it counted contract work on the 23 movies or 39 TV series filmed in Georgia in 2013. The question remains if those jobs, and their pay, are truly Georgia jobs. The state incentive allows movie companies to get credits on what they pay stars, and accountants, for the time they work in the state. Our ruling The MPAA released data this week to bolster its lobbying to fast-track a trade deal that would open more of Asia to its content. It claimed the industry supported 24,000 direct jobs and paid workers more than $1.68 billion in the Peach State in 2013. Federal data confirms nearly all of the job figures and payroll, many of which have been reduced from the official headcount. The MPAA overreaches in deciding movie theater workers such as ushers are industry workers, versus retail employees. But those jobs would likely be outweighed by freelance workers on production sets, which the MPAA did not count in its tally. We rate the group’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9B2900>],/factchecks/2015/jun/12/motion-picture-association-america/federal-data-backs-claim-about-movie-and-tv-jobs/

Anti-Muslim activist Pam Geller says under Sharia law, penalty for blasphemy is death
","In a recent interview on CNN, Chris Cuomo invited Pamela Geller to speak on his show about the recent threats against her life after Geller hosted a cartoon drawing contest depicting the prophet Muhammad. Geller said she decided to hold the contest as a response to the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in France. ""They’re just cartoons,"" Geller said about the contest. ""We’re holding this exhibit and cartoon contest to show how insane the world has become — with people in the free world tiptoeing in terror around supremacist thugs who actually commit murder over cartoons. If we can’t stand up for the freedom of speech, we will lose it."" The topic of free speech was revisited during Geller’s segment with Cuomo, during which Geller pointed out that free speech is often curtailed in Muslim countries: ""In Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad."" Is that true? Well, yes and no. First, a bit of background on what Sharia law actually entails. The Sharia is tied in to Islamic law as derived from both the Quran and Mohammad’s teachings. Essentially, it translates to the ""right path"" or ""the way."" However, as Professor Khaleel Mohammed at San Diego State University pointed out, ""that way is not always defined (and can) be considered similar to Jesus saying ‘I am the way, the truth and the life...’ In Islam, the Sharia is this abstract."" Stemming from the Sharia are multiple interpretations of this ""way,"" and they are embodied in the fiqh. Geller said that ""in Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad."" In an email interview with PunditFact, Geller elaborated on her statement: ""The death penalty can result from blasphemy charges in majority-Muslim countries including Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan (where the death penalty is often enforced against ‘blasphemers’ by lynch mobs), Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. Kuwait and the UAE recognize Sharia rules for blasphemers, and that can lead to death (too)."" To assess Geller’s claim, we turned to the ""Compendium of Blasphemy Laws"" compiled by the Human Rights First organization, the Library of Congress’ ""Laws Criminalizing Apostasy,"" as well as other sources. We compiled a chart to see how different countries handle blasphemy. Out of 50 countries listed with a Muslim majority, we only found five with definitive state laws stating that in cases of blasphemy against Islam, Allah, or Mohammad, the punishment was death - Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Brunei. (Brunei’s death penalty against blasphemy will not go into effect until this October.) In addition, another six countries have laws in which death is the punishment for apostasy, or the denouncement of one’s religion. (Since blasphemy may fall under the category of apostasy in some instances, these laws are also included.) These countries are Morocco, Mauritania, Yemen, the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. That’s 11 out of 50 countries. And even in these instances, laws are not absolute. Take Qatar. Under its penal code, apostasy is to be judged according to the Sharia, which states that the punishment is death. Blasphemy could also fall under this category. Yet, ""Qatar has not imposed any penalty for this offense since its independence in 1971,"" according to the Library of Congress’ ""Laws Criminalizing Apostasy."" Other countries are even more clear. In Tajikistan, with a Muslim population of 96.7 percent, the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and speech. While not many countries on the list go so far as to guarantee these rights, the majority do not have capital punishment officially listed for either blasphemy or apostasy. In many instances, when individuals are killed for either of those crimes, it is through extrajudicial means. Private citizens, and not the state, kill people they believe committed blasphemy or apostasy. ""Remember, (when we hear) about ‘Islamic law,’ it often has little to do with actual Islamic law... in fact (these ‘laws’) are on-the-spot creations of warlords,"" Mohammed said. The majority of countries who have laws detailing punishment against blasphemy or apostasy have either imprisonment or a fine, and not death, as the worst outcome. Our ruling Geller said that ""in Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad."" At best, that is an overgeneralization. Yes, there are countries who prescribe the death penalty, and they often do cite the Sharia as the cause for it. But out of 50 countries with Muslim majorities, there are only 11 where this is in some way sanctioned by state law. In addition, not all countries with the death penalty use it. The death penalty is not applied universally, and can be mitigated in cases when the accused repents. Geller’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate her statement is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA7CA80>],/factchecks/2015/jun/11/pamela-geller/anti-muslim-activist-pam-geller-says/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says he cut Florida taxes by $19 billion, but did he really?
","Jeb Bush keeps promoting his record during the runup to announcing his presidential campaign, telling a crowd at a Republican event he cut taxes as Florida’s governor. ""In Florida, for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion, creating a much better business climate,"" Bush told the crowd at Gov. Rick Scott's Economic Growth Summit in Orlando on June 2, 2015. Florida’s budget went from $48.6 billion to $73.9 billion during Bush’s tenure, thanks in part to an influx of some 3.5 million people. The state also pocketed $10 billion in cash reserves and won a top bond rating. But was he able to help cut taxes by $19 billion at the same time? We cracked open the state’s books to take a look for ourselves. Projecting a point of view Bush’s Right to Rise political action committee told us they came up with the figure (actually $19.3 billion) using data from Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research. This figure has been cited often by both politicians and the media, but the details are where things get tricky. Without putting you to sleep with nitpicking of revenue projections, this is what Right To Rise did: Using an annual state report called the Fiscal Analysis in Brief, the PAC tallied the total of all revenue changes from legislative changes in each year between the 1999-2000 and 2007-08 fiscal years. Here’s where we come to our first round of caveats. Economic experts told us those revenue changes aren’t all necessarily tax cuts. Each year includes dozens, if not hundreds of different legislative actions, ranging from fee and license changes to sales tax holidays and lottery proceeds. Those aren’t all what we’d consider tax cuts, they’re just changes in how much the state collected. It’s also a good thing Bush used the term ""we,"" because the revenue changes resulted from action by the Legislature. Bush’s influence and his line-item veto power did come into play, but he can’t take credit for all of these measures. He has said, ""I cut taxes to the tune of $19 billion"" before, though. Right to Rise added up those cumulative revenue changes for each year and developed a formula to estimate how much state revenues have been affected since. Our experts told us that’s acceptable, but it makes things more complicated. It means, for example, that if taxes were cut in 1999, Right to Rise counted those revenue changes for each subsequent year through 2007. By the end of Bush’s term, we’re looking at eight years of cumulative tax savings. If you really want to read the fine print, you can see the PAC’s estimates here. The nominal dollars saved using those projections totaled more than $17.6 billion, but the PAC adjusted the estimate into 2007 dollars. That leaves us with the $19.3 billion estimate. Economists told us while it was fine to adjust the projections for inflation, there are limitations to that estimate. That’s mostly because analysts don’t really know what would happen to any given revenue source in the real world. ""I think it’s kind of tough to make this kind of analysis, because the economic impact is listed, but would change as the economy changed,"" Norton Francis, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute, told us. ""They’re basically looking at a point in time, going back and revisiting it."" Two big specifics If you’re still with us at this depth of wonkishness, there’s more to consider. A big chunk of the $19.3 billion in projected tax savings came from the 2001 law to phase out the federal estate tax, which was backed in Washington by Bush’s brother, then-President George W. Bush. The state essentially received a share of this federal tax, but lost that money when the phase-out was complete. According to the PAC’s projections, by the 2007-08 fiscal year that loss of estate tax money cost Florida about $848 million per year. Sources told PolitiFact that it’s not really right for Jeb Bush to take credit for the federal repeal, because the state didn’t do anything. ""It’s not like anyone in Florida got rid of it,"" Francis said. ""The federal government got rid of it."" Bush spokesman Matt Gorman said Bush supported the repeal of the tax as governor, and didn’t push to replace it with a state tax. Several states did enact their own tax to make up for the lost revenue. One review by economist Martin Sullivan, writing for tax news publisher Tax Analysts, omitted the estate tax in his report because it didn’t require legislative action to go into effect. His analysis, which wasn’t adjusted for inflation, tallied the total of Bush-era tax cuts over those eight years at about $13 billion. Of note is where the biggest chunk of Bush’s claimed tax savings came from: A change in the amount the state taxed intangible assets, like stocks, bonds and accounts receivable. Florida made about $600 million per year from the tax, a fair sum for a state with no income tax. Bush pushed hard to trim the tax in 1999 and 2000. He finally succeeded repealing the tax entirely in 2006. Francis said that point gets lost when people use a big number like $19 billion. ""When you’re looking at the intangibles tax, what were the benefits of that?"" Francis said. ""Was any of it good for the average person?"" Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, which supported ending the tax, pointed out that removing it benefitted people with lower incomes and assets for years, because the exemption was gradually increased before the tax was repealed entirely. ""People considered it a benefit for the rich because the income limits were so high at the end,"" Wenner said. ""Really, just about anyone who had any amount saved up saw a benefit."" Sullivan’s analysis provided one answer most people can probably wrap their heads around. He concluded the real Bush-era tax savings by 2006 ended up being about $140 per person, per year. Our ruling Bush said ""for eight years we cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion."" He was citing a projection from his Right To Rise PAC that measured cumulative revenue changes from 1999 to 2007. The total of $19.3 billion is adjusted into 2007 dollars. The analysis includes the federal repeal of the estate tax, for which economists told us Bush couldn’t really take credit. It also includes a big cut to the state’s intangibles tax, which may not benefit your average person much. Experts said there are limits to how economists can estimate the impact of legislative actions, but the PAC’s projections could be considered fair. What’s trickier is whether Bush can take credit for all the revenue changes or even call them all tax cuts. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB6AA80>],/factchecks/2015/jun/11/jeb-bush/Jeb-Bush-says-he-cut-Florida-taxes-by-19-billion/

GOP plan would give Wisconsin weakest standards in U.S. for hiring teachers, Democrat Mike Tate says
","In one of his final public appearances as chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Mike Tate made an observation about the Republican-controlled Legislature and a broad claim about where GOP leaders are taking schools with the 2015-’17 state budget. ""I think you’re beginning to see the beginning of the end of the overreach of the Republican majority in Madison,"" Tate said May 28, 2015 at a WisPolitics luncheon in Madison. Then he flatly stated: ""Just yesterday, you saw slipped into the budget a provision that would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country."" Let’s see if the changes -- which, as we’ll see, apply only to teachers in middle and high school -- would leave Wisconsin with the weakest teacher standards in the country. The budget The day before Tate’s remarks, there were news stories highlighting the Republicans’ proposal on teacher licensing. The proposal had actually been added to the budget eight days earlier, on May 20, 2015, when the Legislature's GOP-run Joint Finance Committee, in a 1:30 a.m. vote, inserted it along with other education provisions. The Legislature is aiming to adopt a budget and send it to GOP Gov. Scott Walker before the end of June 2015. Walker has not stated a position on the teacher proposal but does have the power to veto individual provisions out of the budget. GOP proposal As it stands now, public school teachers in Wisconsin must be licensed by the state Department of Public Instruction. A bachelor’s degree from an accredited university is one of the minimum requirements. Teachers must also pass state tests that assess their knowledge of a subject as well as their skills in teaching. Under the GOP proposal, the Department of Instruction would be required to issue teaching licenses to individuals who are deemed qualified by a local school board to teach in middle or high school (sixth through 12th grade), though the license would be good only for that school district. There would be two major changes under this alternative form of licensing. 1. Anyone with a bachelor’s degree -- in any subject, and from an accredited or non-accredited university -- could be licensed to teach the so-called core subjects of English, math, social studies or science. The only requirement would be that a school board would have to determine that the person is ""proficient in the subject"" and has ""relevant experience"" in the subject. Unlike the standard licensing system, the teacher would not have to pass any state tests to prove his or her subject knowledge or teaching knowledge. The National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research group, and the Education Commission on the States said they did not know how many states have teacher standards like that one. 2. For non-core subjects -- such as health or foreign language --  no college degree, or even a high school diploma, would be required. Again, no state tests would be required, only that a school board determine that a person is ""proficient in the subject"" and has ""relevant experience"" in the subject. A memo on the GOP proposal from the Wisconsin Legislative Council, a nonpartisan research agency that serves the Legislature, says that every state requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree for all grades. The only exception is for technical education. In addition, a spokeswoman for the National Council on Teacher Quality told us it knows of no state that doesn't require at least a bachelor's degree. (The only evidence the Democratic Party cited to us to back Tate’s claim was an Associated Press news article saying Wisconsin may be the first state in the country to certify teachers who don't have bachelor's degrees.) The changes were proposed by state Rep. Mary Czaja, R-Irma. She told us she wants schools to be able to hire teachers who can ""fill a niche"" -- for example, hiring a nurse with a two-year degree to teach health, or a local mechanic to teach auto mechanics -- without having to hire a permanent teacher at a higher salary plus benefits. She said she trusts schools to hire people who are competent. Sungti Hsu, of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, said the Wisconsin changes would be significant. Across the country, requiring a bachelor’s degree to teach ""is pretty much a minimum requirement,"" he said. It’s also important for teachers to be trained in both the subject they will teach and as teachers, Hsu said. ""If Wisconsin changes their requirements,"" he said, referring to the Republican proposal, ""I’m not sure about the weakest, but it certainly would be one of the lowest requirements."" Our rating Tate declared that a Republican budget proposal ""would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country."" If the proposal becomes law, Wisconsin apparently would become the only state not to have a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for teaching some subjects, including health and foreign languages. But that applies only to sixth through 12th grades. And there isn’t evidence to show that Wisconsin’s teacher standards overall would be the weakest in the country.
