Examining the effectiveness of Texas' statewide shutdowns
","Several days after Gov. Greg Abbott declared that he wouldn’t impose ""any more lockdowns"" amid rising coronavirus cases, he defended that decision in a Nov. 19 press conference in Lubbock, where he was promoting the state’s distribution of a new antibody therapy. He gave two reasons for not imposing the sort of shutdown measures he had implemented statewide twice before. First, shutdowns can have severe consequences on the mental, emotional and financial health of people, he said. ""Lesser known, however, is the ineffectiveness of it,"" Abbott continued. ""One thing that we’ve learned over the course of COVID is, one of the most common ways that COVID is spread today is not by someone going to work, but by people gathering together in home settings or in casual settings — after bars close or something like that,"" he said. ""So shutdowns will not lead to the positive results that some people think."" Abbott issued his last statewide order restricting business operations near the end of June, when Texas was reporting what were then record-breaking daily case numbers — over 5,000 new cases for several consecutive days. He ordered bars closed, scaled back restaurant occupancy to 50% and allowed local governments to place restrictions on outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people. In mid-September, as daily cases had dropped to an average of about 3,500, Abbott allowed restaurants, stores and offices to expand to 75% capacity in trauma service areas where COVID-19 patients occupied 15% or fewer of available hospital beds. In mid-October, he gave county officials the authority to allow bars to reopen, again as long as COVID-19 patients occupied 15% or fewer of hospital beds in the area. But by then, daily case numbers were beginning to rise again, and have continued to increase. This past week saw multiple records posted, with 14,600 new coronavirus cases recorded on Wednesday. With such a rapid escalation of transmission across the state, we wanted to know whether statewide shutdowns are ineffective as Abbott says. And have we learned over the course of the pandemic that the virus is not commonly spread in workplaces? It’s difficult to broadly determine the effectiveness of shutdowns without identifying a metric by which to gauge them. Abbott’s office didn’t respond to several inquiries asking for clarification on what he meant by ""ineffectiveness."" But experts say that if effectiveness is measured strictly by case numbers and transmissions, then shutdowns or lockdowns have been shown to be effective in Texas and across the globe. ""If you say we’re just going to look at reducing the number of transmissions and cases, do lockdowns work? Yes they do. We clearly saw that during the spring,"" said Dr. Diana Cervantes, an epidemiologist at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. ""If you're looking at economic factors, social factors, or other factors — like what (shutdowns) mean for the big picture — then that's a different case,"" Cervantes said. ""There are ongoing implications that take longer to see their effects. But in regards to transmission, we know that lockdowns can be effective."" On March 19, as the state was ramping up its testing capacity, Abbott issued the state’s first sweeping executive order, effective April 2, that closed bars, gyms and restaurants for dine-in and ordered people to avoid gathering in groups larger than 10. That same day, 26 new cases were reported statewide. ""Working together, we must defeat COVID-19 with the only tool that we have available to us — we must strangle its expansion by reducing the ways that we are currently transmitting it. We are doing this now, today, so that we can get back to business as usual more quickly,"" Abbott said then. That shutdown lasted until May 1, when the state was reporting between 800 and 1,000 daily new cases with a positivity rate hovering around 10%. About a month later, daily case numbers started to rise precipitously, cresting at nearly 11,000 on July 15. A primary reason that shutdowns were implemented during the early period of the pandemic was to allow government officials and scientists time to better understand the nature of the virus and its spread. ""When it comes to lockdowns, originally the idea was, we’re trying to learn more about the virus and until we get to that point, we need to be as safe as possible,"" Cervantes said. ""Now the idea is, we do know how the virus is primarily transmitted and what those prevention and control measures are."" Furthermore, enforcing a shutdown at this point during the pandemic — as people are more likely to experience shutdown fatigue — is quite different than enforcing one in the pandemic’s early period, said Angela Clendenin, a public health assistant professor at Texas A&M University. The first lockdown certainly slowed the spread, Clendenin said, ""but think about where we were as a population psychologically. All of a sudden we had this new and novel virus where there's no vaccine. … People were scared. They didn’t know what it was. At that point, the fear of the unknown I think made people much more compliant with the idea of a lockdown."" But that fear began waning as the virus was better understood, she said. The diminishment of that fear combined with fatigue with virus restrictions makes lockdown enforcement much more difficult. ""The idea of a lockdown seems intuitively to be a good answer when you're experiencing spikes in cases like what we've been seeing,"" she said. ""In theory they work, but it's implementing them that presents a lot of challenges. … The enforcement of a lockdown sometimes is just not practical."" It’s not clear upon what basis Abbott claims that the virus is not commonly spread in the workplace. While the ability for many employees to work remotely has reduced the number of transmissions borne out of workplace gatherings, many workers don’t have that remote option. One of the most extreme examples was recorded in the Panhandle, when the first wave of the virus struck meatpacking plants and their refugee and immigrant workforce. With people working shoulder to shoulder, the plants became an incubator for the virus’ spread. According to an analysis by the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, 12 meatpacking plants in Texas have reported nearly 1,500 cases and nine deaths. In May, President Donald Trump declared the meatpacking plants essential businesses, which allowed the plants to keep running despite shutdown orders. To Cervantes, Abbott’s comment that ""one of the most common ways that COVID is spread today is not by someone going to work"" ignores people’s limited options when it comes to earning a living. ""There’s a lot of people who don’t have choices and are put in a setting where they have increased exposure and there’s very little that can be done about it,"" she said. On April 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration released guidelines that advise meatpacking plants to stagger shifts, implement social distancing among workers, add hand-washing stations and install plastic barriers. Those guidelines, where implemented correctly, have helped keep the virus under control since those initial outbreaks, although some plants have been accused of violating the protocols. The construction industry also has experienced COVID-19 transmissions and hospitalizations. In April, Abbott declared all construction work permissible statewide, exempting the industry from stay-home orders enacted by cities or counties. In Austin, the stay-home order enacted in late March resulted in an estimated 73% reduction in the rate of local transmissions, according to a study published by the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. However, researchers found that the construction industry’s exemption was associated with an increase of COVID-19 hospitalizations among those workers. From the beginning of the pandemic through mid-August, hospitalization rates of construction workers increased from 0.22 per 1,000 workers to 9.3 per 1,000 workers. ""As the United States navigates relaxing and enacting policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, communities should recognize the disproportionate burden of illness already experienced by workers in low-paying, high-contact industries,"" the study says. However, this multifold increased risk of hospitalizations is estimated to be offset by safety measures, such as cleaning equipment between uses, wearing personal protective equipment and limiting the number of workers on a work site. These precautions were modeled to result in a 50% decrease in transmissions. If these kinds of at-risk industries abide by preventative safety measures, then they can be kept relatively safe, Clendenin said. Rather, it’s the casual at-home settings — where people let their guard down around trusted friends and family — that is most troublesome to public health experts, she said. ""It really is at home in these small gatherings where people are letting their vigilance slip a little bit,"" she said. ""You forget to socially distance and you forget people should be wearing masks or washing hands, and you're laughing and having a great time, and you're propelling those droplets further than 6 feet."" ""It’s a comfort level that drives (transmissions) at those gatherings, more so than at the workplace,"" Clendenin said. Abbott defended his decision to not impose a statewide shutdown in a Nov. 19 press conference, describing shutdowns as ineffective and saying that ""one of the most common ways that COVID is spread today is not by someone going to work."" It’s hard to know by what metric Abbott gauges the efficacy of a shutdown. Experts say that if measuring strictly transmission rates and case numbers, shutdowns have proven to be effective in managing spread. But it’s harder to quantify the efficacy of a shutdown when considering all the social and economic consequences. In Texas, case numbers rose after each time that Abbott lifted shutdowns. Abbott’s comments about workplace gatherings not being a common way for COVID-19 to spread also ignores workplaces where proper precautions can be difficult to achieve. We rate this claim False.","[('KCBD-11, WATCH: Gov.

Did Kyle Rittenhouse use COVID-19 stimulus funds to buy AR-15 used in Kenosha shootings?
","Out of jail for the first time since August, Kyle Rittenhouse is garnering a new wave of attention. The 17-year-old from Antioch, Ill., had been held on a $2 million bond on charges he shot three people — killing two — during the Kenosha unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake. In that time the Illinois teen has become something of a conservative celebrity, generating millions of dollars for his release and the ongoing legal case where his lawyers will argue he acted in self defense. Rittenhouse was released from custody Nov. 20, 2020, but we learned an array of new details the day before in a jailhouse interview with the Washington Post — including how he came by the gun used in the shooting. One widely shared Instagram post honed in on that detail Nov. 20, saying, ""Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting."" Did the gun used in the streets of Kenosha really come from a federally-funded stimulus? The balleralert Instagram account that posted the claim cited the Washington Post as its source, and that is largely what the paper reported. The Nov. 19 story reads in part, ""The Post found that Rittenhouse, who was too young to buy a rifle, had arranged for an adult friend to buy the weapon for him using money Rittenhouse had received from a government stimulus program."" That friend, 19-year-old Dominick Black of Burlington, Wis., purchased the weapon for him at an Ace Hardware store in Ladysmith, Wis., on May 1, 2020, according to a criminal complaint charging Black with two felony counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to someone under 18, resulting in death. The gun was then stored at Black’s stepfather’s house in Kenosha, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Here’s how Rittenhouse described the purchase to the Post. ""I got my $1,200 from the coronavirus Illinois unemployment because I was on furlough from YMCA,"" he said. ""And I got my first unemployment check so I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll use this to buy it.’"" This is where the matter gets a bit muddled. The Post reported generally that stimulus funds were used, while the Instagram post made a more specific reference to ""stimulus checks,"" which would reference the payments of $1,200 per person. And Rittenhouse appears to confuse the two in his statement. The stimulus checks approved by Congress in March were indeed for $1,200, but those are different from unemployment. Stimulus payments went to all adults under certain income limits, while unemployment benefits are paid only to those out of work — as Rittenhouse was, based on his furlough description.  Rittenhouse told the Post he lived with his mother, a circumstance that would typically mean she claims him as a dependent on her taxes. That would make him ineligible for the $1,200 stimulus payment. Instead, it appears Rittenhouse was referencing several weeks of unemployment compensation approved through the CARES Act, said Washington Post Investigations Editor Jeff Leen. He said Rittenhouse’s mother later told the paper that money for the gun came from ""special unemployment"" related to the pandemic. Rittenhouse had noted he was off work, and the act signed into law March 27 provided an extra $600 per week in unemployment through the end of July. Rittenhouse’s attorneys did not return a phone call or email seeking clarification. An Instagram post says ""Kyle Rittenhouse used his COVID-19 stimulus check to purchase the AR-15 he used in the fatal Kenosha shooting."" We don’t have bank records or documents to concretely prove this, leaving us to take Rittenhouse at his word on the source of the funds.  Rittenhouse did tell the Post he used $1,200 in coronavirus funds, but he appears to confuse stimulus and unemployment payments.  It’s more likely Rittenhouse was referring to unemployment than the stimulus program itself, based on his life circumstances and description from him and his mother. That is indeed a ""COVID-19 stimulus,"" but not the one people would think of based on this post’s description. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Instagram post, Nov. 20, 2020', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CH0hJYZL-oF/?utm_source=ig_embed'), ('The Washington Post, Kenosha: How two men’s paths crossed in an encounter that has divided the nation, Nov. 19, 2020', 'No link'), ('Dominick Black criminal complaint, filed Nov. 3, 2020', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/11/19/kenosha-shooting-kyle-rittenhouse-interview/?arc404=true'), (""Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 'I'm going to jail for the rest of my life': What Kyle Rittenhouse told the friend who supplied rifle used in the Kenosha protest shooting, Nov. 20, 2020"", 'No link'), (""Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 'I shot two white kids': New records detail Kyle Rittenhouse's surrender to hometown cops, path of AR-15 rifle used in Kenosha, Oct. 30, 2020"", 'https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20417118-dominick-black-complaint'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Friend who bought rifle for Kyle Rittenhouse charged, Nov. 9, 2020', 'No link'), ('Antioch Police Department, public records request', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2020/11/20/kenosha-protest-shooting-what-dominick-black-told-police-kyle-rittenhouse/6354482002/'), ('Email exchange with Jeff Leen, Washington Post investigations editor, Nov. 25, 2020', 'No link'), ('IRS, Economic Impact Payment Information Center — Topic A: EIP Eligibility, updated Oct. 26, 2020', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2020/10/30/details-rittenhouse-arrest-after-kenosha-shooting-shown-records/6092483002/'), ('The Washington Post, IRS to begin issuing $1,200 coronavirus payments April 9, but some Americans won’t receive checks until September, agency plan says, April 2, 2020', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2020/nov/25/instagram-posts/kyle-rittenhouse-use-covid-19-stimulus-kenosha/

Wisconsin Assembly speaker says state passed one of the first COVID-19 bills, but that’s wrong
","Gov. Tony Evers and Republican legislative leaders are back at the drawing table after months without speaking to each other in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Evers met with Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and incoming Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu on Nov. 20, 2020, to discuss the governor’s proposed COVID-19 relief package. The meeting came days after Vos held a news conference to discuss ""new legislative initiatives."" The talking and jockeying comes as the state’s case counts continue to rise, with daily deaths topping 100 for the first time on Nov. 24, 2020. In a Nov. 22, 2020, interview with WKOW, Vos expressed a desire to find common ground with the governor and put politics behind them. But his comments took a partisan tone as he shifted the blame for months of inaction away from Republicans.  ""We passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov. Evers to act,"" he said.  Is Vos’ recounting of history correct? Evers signed a COVID-19 relief package on April 15, 2020, the day it reached his desk and 14 days after Republicans first began drafting legislation and weeks after the governor offered his own proposal to legislative leaders.  By then, many other states had already begun tackling the pandemic. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 36 states and territories had adopted or enacted 174 COVID-19-related measures by April 14. Nearly 60 were resolutions that didn’t carry the weight of law but handled legislative housekeeping and, in Alabama, urged residents to bump fists instead of shaking hands.  The remainder were bills that governed the pandemic response in the respective states. Alaska and Massachusetts changed rules around unemployment benefits. New Jersey banned evictions during public health emergencies. Minnesota and Vermont enacted comprehensive response packages. Several legislatures moved money around to manage the pandemic, while others addressed specific issues such as student meals, price gouging and coverage for telehealth services. Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed to the database as evidence for the speaker’s claim, but in reality, it undermines his position.   The rest of Vos’ claim suggests the COVID-19 relief package empowered Evers to act. ""The legislation gave the governor broad authority to respond to the coronavirus and ensured that Wisconsin received more federal dollars, especially in the areas of unemployment insurance and health care (Medicaid) funding,"" Beyer said. But this too is off base. The relief package did facilitate the transfer of CARES Act funds, allowing the state to capture additional federal Medicaid dollars. But $25 million in federal funding for unemployment went out the window because lawmakers didn’t pass a piece of legislation quickly enough. What’s more, state statute already granted Evers the authority to declare public health emergencies, issue orders and distribute $2 billion in federal dollars without the legislature’s approval. The relief bill didn’t do any of that. In a recent interview, Vos claimed ""we passed one of the first (COVID-19) bills in the entire country, empowering Gov. Evers to act."" This is wrong on both fronts.  Wisconsin lagged behind many other states in passing COVID-19 legislation, to the point where lawmakers lost out on federal aid for unemployment. And Evers’ ability to manage health emergencies came from state law already in place when the pandemic hit. We rate Vos’ claim False.     ","[('Emails from Kit Beyer, communications director for Speaker Robin Vos, Nov. 23-24, 2020.', 'https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/15/coronavirus-in-wisconsin-first-responders-criticize-relief-bill/2994620001/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Gov.

No, Trump’s sister didn’t tweet her support for the president
","Online misinformation is so pervasive that you can’t even trust your own sister tweeting something nice.  Indeed, President Donald Trump was duped on Nov. 20 when he voiced his gratitude to his sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau, for supporting him.  Trump shared a tweet from Wayne Dupree Media, which had said a day earlier that Trump’s sister Elizabeth ""never speaks about politics, but she felt it was imperative that she show her support for Trump and also call out the 2020 election for what it was…"" The tweet linked to WayneDupree.com, which featured a supposed tweet from Elizabeth Trump Grau in which she said on Nov. 18: ""This election inspired me to break my silence and speak out on behalf of my family.

We are all so proud of him and the job he has done for our country. 4 MORE YEARS!""  Elizabeth Trump Grau, who worked at Chase Manhattan Bank before she retired, has stayed out of the public eye.

Democrats didn't refuse to acknowledge Trump’s 2016 victory
","As the world waits for President Donald Trump to concede defeat, his supporters are spreading a claim on social media that Democrats rejected Trump as president for four years.  ""We’re hearing a lot from Democrats that all Americans need to ‘unify,’"" Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., tweeted on Nov. 12. ""If they truly wanted unity, they wouldn’t have spent 4 years refusing to acknowledge Trump’s 2016 victory.""  The claim has since gone viral as a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In fact, Democrats began acknowledging Trump’s electoral-vote victory in 2016 within hours after it became clear. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote, called Trump on election night to congratulate him and offered to work with him. She also urged her supporters to accept the results and ""look to the future."" ""Donald Trump is going to be our president,"" Clinton said during her concession speech the morning of Nov. 9. ""We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. And we don’t just respect that, we cherish it.""  The Democratic National Committee’s interim chair, Donna Brazile, referred to Trump as the president-elect in a Nov. 9 statement and congratulated him on his win.  Two days after the election, President Barack Obama invited Trump to the White House, where they posed together and shook hands after a cordial meeting. Trump afterward called Obama ""a good man"" and said he’d seek his counsel.  ""We are all now rooting for his success,"" Obama said that day. ""The peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world."" Obama also issued a Nov. 10 statement about a smooth transition of power and what that would look like. The federal government began to engage with Trump’s transition team that same week. The list of Democratic leaders who promptly acknowledged his victory goes on: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Secretary of State John Kerry, who was the party’s 2004 presidential nominee, all congratulated Trump and referred to him as the president-elect. There were some dissidents. Some House Democrats tried to challenge Trump’s Electoral College win when Congress validated the results Jan. 6. Their efforts failed because no senator chose to join them.  Several Democrats boycotted Trump’s inauguration, citing various reasons. One of them, Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, said at the time that he didn’t regard Trump as a legitimate president-elect, citing intelligence reports that Russia played a role in supporting his candidacy and undermining Clinton. The two continued to feud until Lewis’ death in July 2020. We reached out to Hice’s office to find the out the basis for his claim. His office didn’t respond to requests for comment. Despite top Democratic leaders’ calls to accept the results, protests broke out in the days that followed the election and on Inauguration Day. Thousands across the country gathered with chants of ""Not my president"" and, ""We reject the president-elect."" Clinton supporters also took to social media with the hashtags #NotMyPresident and #ImStillWithHer.  The protesters criticized Trump’s rhetoric and policies on immigration, and thousands expressed grief and anger over his win. The message was that Trump didn’t represent their values, not that he hadn’t won the election.  Others responded to the results with calls for election reform. Some progressive groups brought attention to the Electoral College system for allowing presidential candidates to win without the national popular vote, and blamed his win partly on voter suppression. While Trump won states accounting for 306 electoral votes, well over the 270 he needed to win, about 2.9 million more people voted for Clinton. Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of undercutting his 2016 victory with claims of Russian interference in the election, which he has dismissed as a ""hoax.""  But Democrats weren’t the only ones to point to Russian interference in 2016. Intelligence agencies, law enforcement and an independent special counsel all concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to favor Trump. A bipartisan Senate panel in April 2020 backed those findings. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who conducted a two-year probe into Russia’s interference, concluded that the Trump campaign and Russian officials were in contact several times, and that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit from Moscow’s interference. Mueller’s investigation did not establish whether those contacts amounted to a criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination. It’s unclear how much influence Russia had on the election outcome.  Trump and his supporters also point to his 2019 impeachment as evidence of a Democratic effort to erase his election victory. In December 2019, after investigating a whistleblower complaint about a Trump phone call, the Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump on two counts. The first was abuse of power for allegedly strong-arming Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden, and undermining national security. The other article accused Trump of blocking cooperation with Congress over its impeachment inquiry.  The impeachment of Trump, as with President Bill Clinton in 1998, was a constitutional response to alleged misconduct in office, not a refusal to acknowledge his victory. The Senate acquitted Trump. Hice claimed that Democrats have spent four years refusing to acknowledge Trump’s 2016 victory. While there were some dissident voices that questioned the legitimacy of Trump’s election, top Democrats acknowledged Trump’s win and referred to him as the president-elect less than a day after election results became clear. Those leaders included Clinton, Obama, Democratic leaders in Congress and the DNC.  Trump and his supporters have claimed that the investigation into Russian involvement in the election and the 2019 impeachment represented Democrats’ refusal to accept the 2016 election result. The conclusion that Russia interfered in the election was supported by law enforcement, intelligence agencies and a bipartisan Senate panel, not just Democrats. And the impeachment was a response to a whistleblower’s complaint about alleged wrongdoing. Hice goes too far in his claim that Democrats spent four years refusing to acknowledge Trump's victory, and provides no evidence for it. We rate this claim False.","[('Facebook post, Nov. 12, 2020', 'https://archive.is/w9CHW'), ('Email, DNC spokesperson, Nov. 18, 2020', 'No link'), ('CNN, ""4 years ago, Obama invited Trump to the White House to discuss transfers of power.

Trump's Pants on Fire claim about votes exceeding voters in swing states
","In a late-night tweet, President Donald Trump highlighted an election statistic that he thought ought to raise eyebrows. ""In certain swing states, there were more votes than people who voted, and in big numbers,"" Trump tweeted at 11:37 p.m. ET Nov. 22. ""Does that not really matter?"" In certain swing states, there were more votes than people who voted, and in big numbers. Does that not really matter? Stopping Poll Watchers, voting for unsuspecting people, fake ballots and so much more. Such egregious conduct. We will win! There is no reading of this claim that makes it accurate. Trump might be recycling the inaccurate claim that in pivotal states, there were more votes than registered voters. Charges of that sort circulated quickly right after Election Day, and they were simply wrong. Trump didn’t specify which states he had in mind — and our request for details from the White House and the Trump campaign went unanswered. So we focused on the states where Trump’s lawyers have most aggressively challenged results: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In each of those, there are far more registered voters than votes cast. In Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the difference is more than 2 million people in each state. At 387,612, Wisconsin has the narrowest gap, but that doesn’t include same-day registrations, so the exact number will change. In any event, the number of registered voters greatly exceeds the number of votes counted. Trump’s tweet could also be interpreted as him saying large numbers of people voted twice — once by mail, and once in person. But there is no evidence of that happening ""in big numbers"" either. The National Association of Secretaries of State tracks each state’s approach to ensuring one voter cannot cast two ballots. Basically, it all comes down to software that links votes to voters, no matter how a ballot comes in. ""States have databases that record the receipt of a ballot from a voter and mark that voter as having voted,"" said Philip Stark, University of California-Berkeley election security researcher. ""If you vote by mail and your ballot was received, you would not be permitted to cast a vote in person at the polls; you would be marked as having voted already."" There have been instances when voters show up to vote in person before their mailed ballot arrives. The same voter database process works that direction, too. The voter’s appearance at the polling station is recorded and if a mailed ballot appears, it is saved, but not counted. Trump said that in key swing states, there were more votes than people voting, ""in big numbers."" There is zero proof. If he meant there were more votes cast than registered voters, election data show the opposite. In the six key states we examined, there were between several hundred thousand and 2 million more registered voters than votes cast. If he meant that there was a lot of double voting, his lawyers have provided no evidence to back that up. States use careful systems to prevent that from taking place.

Ga. Sen. David Perdue’s claim that Jon Ossoff is a socialist is Pants on Fire
","In one of the two Georgia runoffs that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate, GOP incumbent David Perdue used the S word — socialism — to brand his opponent, Democrat Jon Ossoff. Perdue’s attack came in an interview on a TV show hosted by Mike Huckabee, the Republican former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate.  ""Philosophically, where do you and (Ossoff) differ significantly? What’s the main difference between you?"" Huckabee asked. ""Well, it’s very simple,"" Perdue replied. ""He’s a socialist.""  Perdue has used the term repeatedly about Ossoff, although more often he refers to what he claims is the documentary filmmaker’s support of a socialist agenda. President Donald Trump labeled Joe Biden a socialist — a claim we rated False, but one that some believe helped Trump win Florida in the Nov. 3 election. Much of the evidence Perdue cites about Ossoff’s policy positions is inaccurate. And even if what he cited were correct, it doesn’t amount to Ossoff being a socialist.  Socialism has support among a significant number of Americans, particularly those who see it as promoting equality and more social services. A September 2020 Hill-HarrisX poll found that slightly more Democratic voters view socialism more favorably than capitalism.  Strictly speaking, however, the most narrow definition of socialism refers to ""governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods."" Ossoff has not stated support for such government control.  When Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speak of socialism,  they are referring to expanding the social programs already available, along with potentially higher tax rates to pay for them. But Ossoff opposes Sanders’ Medicare for All and Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. RELATED: PolitiFact fact-checks and articles about the Georgia runoffs Perdue’s campaign said Ossoff’s ""socialist agenda"" includes support for defunding the police, ""government-controlled health care,"" the Green New Deal and ""no borders."" Leaving aside whether any of those positions amounts to socialism, Ossoff has said he opposes defunding the police; opposes Medicare for All and supports private insurance; opposes the Green New Deal; and opposes abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while supporting ""strong border security."" Perdue’s campaign also said Ossoff supports sanctuary cities, higher taxes and changing the makeup of the Senate to ""favor Democrats."" None of those positions is socialism. Ossoff has said, ""I don't think it's the role of local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law,"" but has not stated support for sanctuary cities. He ""supports lower taxes for all but the wealthiest Americans."" Ossoff does support statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which are seen as more likely to elect Democratic senators. Perdue’s campaign also said Ossoff is a socialist because of support from Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and ""California liberals."" But Ossoff doesn’t support Sanders’ Medicare for All, under which a single, national health insurance program would cover everyone who lives in the United States; or Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal, which is centered on climate change, but incorporates everything from racial justice to labor union policy. ""It’s somewhat difficult to classify Ossoff ideologically, as he has never held elective office and has a relatively brief history in the public spotlight,"" said Zachary Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. ""With that caveat in mind, his campaign statements and debate performances are consistent with a middle-of-the-road Democrat."" Jeffrey Lazarus, a political science professor at Georgia State University, also described Ossoff as mainstream. ""Forget for a moment the massive levels of misunderstanding that pervade discourse around the word socialism. Looking just at Ossoff’s policy positions, they’re pretty mainstream Democratic policy positions,"" Lazarus said. ""As far as I can tell, Ossoff isn’t calling for any policy that is particularly left-wing."" Perdue said Ossoff is a socialist. As evidence, Purdue said Ossoff supports policies that Ossoff actually does not support, such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Those policies don’t constitute socialism. Ossoff is not a socialist.

No, George Soros wasn’t arrested in Philadelphia for ‘election interference’

Tom Leppert says he and others brought down Dallas crime rate
","
In his bid to take the seat of Texas’ retiring U.S. senator, businessman Tom Leppert draws on his private-sector background plus nearly four years as mayor of Dallas that ended in February 2011.

""When I came in, the biggest challenge was in public safety -- the crime rate,"" Leppert said in a Jan. 12, 2012, debate held in Austin for the Republican candidates vying to replace Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. ""In the space of the three years, ’08, ’09 and ’10, we brought the crime rate down by 30 percent -- numbers any city would love to have. And the way we did it is we increased the police department by 20 percent.""

We wondered if the rate fell that much -- and if Leppert is justified in taking credit.

Leppert spokesman Daniel Keylin told us by email that Dallas’ crime rate dropped from 78.45 crimes per 1,000 residents in 2007 to 55.67 crimes per 1,000 in 2010, a decrease of 29 percent.

Keylin sent us a 2010 Dallas police report with those numbers and others, including a chart that shows the crime rate per 1,000 residents from 1970 through 2010. The crimes counted are the FBI’s ""index crimes"": murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft.

But the rate started dropping several years before Leppert became mayor in June 2007.

After hovering for several years at around 93 crimes per 1,000 residents, the rate declined in 2004 and each subsequent year through 2010 -- with the rates falling more steeply each year after 2007, according to the department. The 2010 rate of 55.67 crimes per 1,000 was a 30-year low. (Click here to view the chart.) A caveat: Comparing the rates before 2007 to those after 2007 is complicated because Dallas police changed how some crimes were reported.

The post-2007 declines track with crime tallies that the Dallas Police Department reports to the FBI.

Next, we asked Leppert what steps he took or contributed to toward the rate reductions.

Keylin told us that increasing the number of Dallas police officers was a main goal in Leppert’s 2007 mayoral campaign. Soon after his election, Leppert held a City Council retreat during which he advocated expanding the force, Keylin said, and during Leppert’s tenure, the council allocated money in each of four budgets to hire a total 679 additional officers. Keylin also cited the addition of 176 squad cars.

Dallas Morning News stories from January and March 2011 indicate the force had around 2,860 officers in 2000, 2,900 police in 2006, and 3,684 officers at the end of 2010.

The Dallas police sent us figures for net job gains and losses that reflect a considerable increase in hiring during Leppert’s tenure. In 2003-2004, the force saw small losses; then, small gains in net jobs came in 2005-2006. Large gains came in 2007-2010: 168, 203, 208 and 93 net jobs, respectively (after retirement and other departures are subtracted from the number of hires). In 2011 – after Leppert’s exit – the Dallas police lost 179 positions.

We consulted other sources before circling back to Leppert.

According to a July 25, 2007, Morning News article, public safety was a big part of Leppert’s 2007 mayoral bid and of the post-election council retreat he called. However, the article says lowering the crime rate and adding police were already established city priorities.

Shortly before Leppert took office, the News reported that city manager Mary Suhm had drawn up a preliminary budget proposal to hire 200 police officers in each of the next four years. In that June 18, 2007, news story, Mayor-elect Leppert calls the plan ""a good start.""

In a telephone interview, Dallas’ mayor pro tem for 2007-09, Elba Garcia, told us that from at least 2004 on, there was ""unanimous consensus"" among council members that reducing crime was a priority. Garcia, initially elected to the council in 2001, chaired the council’s public safety committee. A Democrat, she is now a Dallas County commissioner.

Garcia said of the crime rate reductions: ""It took the leadership of many people, and the mayor (Leppert) wasn’t there when we started that crime decrease.""

The News reported July 30, 2003 that the city was headed towards its sixth year with the highest crime rate for cities of over 1 million residents as gauged by a national report. Amid public dismay, Mayor Laura Miller met with federal and county officials, and began meeting weekly with police Chief Terrell Bolton, according to the paper, as one council member called for an outside review of the department.

Bolton was fired less than a month later -- partly because of the crime ranking, the paper reported. Under the new chief, David Kunkle, who took the post in 2004, crime rates went down and public trust in the police went up, the News wrote in a Jan. 26, 2011, story.

In 2005, two local leaders cited concern over the city’s crime ranking when they founded Safer Dallas, Better Dallas, a nonprofit group that sought private donations to support Dallas police. That year, they garnered a $15 million gift from the W.W. Caruth, Jr. Foundation Fund, used to start a police leadership academy and purchase police equipment, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Garcia told us that at the July 2007 council retreat, the council vowed to get Dallas out of the No. 1 spot on the big-city-crime list -- a goal achieved in 2009 (and Dallas dropped from No. 2 to No. 3 the next year).

The Morning News said in a blog post Oct. 19, 2010: ""To get out of the top spots, the city has substantially increased the size of its police force.""

In a Jan. 8, 2011, Morning News story about the Dallas crime rate’s ""steady march downward that started seven years ago,"" the paper said police ""credit factors from public surveillance cameras to specialized crime reduction operations to the addition of 750 officers since 2004.""

We wondered how to isolate Leppert’s contributions to the rate decrease on his watch.

In a telephone interview, Leppert acknowledged that Dallas leaders had been talking for years about adding police. But, he said, ""It wasn’t until I came in that we said, ‘We are going to do it. This is going to be absolutely a commitment to it.’ ""

""There was never a commitment to a long-term effort to do it, and they never looked at the way that you finance it, and we did all of those things,"" he said. For those police hires, Leppert said, the city made ""a fundamental shifting of resources"" to public safety, a claim we couldn’t immediately confirm.

""There were a lot of people involved in this. I clearly led the effort,"" he said. ""We worked together, and we made it happen. And I understood where we had to go.""

Still, it’s not clear how much Leppert directly influenced the police force increase that occurred on his watch.

One criminologist told us it takes sustained effort to turn around a city’s crime rate. Speaking to the Dallas turnaround, Melinda Schlager at Texas A&M University-Commerce said in a telephone interview: ""Many of the seeds for change were planted under Kunkle,"" the chief who served from June 2004 through May 2010, ""and if you look at when the decreases in crime began, they began under Kunkle’s watch.""

Dallas’ three-year, 29-percent rate drop seems high, but plausible, criminologists told us, noting that national and state crime rates also dropped. From 2007 to 2010, basically Leppert’s time as mayor, Texas saw an 8 percent drop in statewide FBI index crimes, and nationwide the decline was 10.7 percent; Houston saw a 11.4 percent drop over the same years, Austin a 9.4 percent drop. San Antonio’s rate rose and fell, but the city ended with a net gain of 0.1 percent for the period.

Garcia said of Leppert’s 30-percent debate statement: ""I’m glad he used the word ‘we.’... All that took a lot of people supporting these recommendations, supporting the chief ... It took a lot of people and a lot of leadership.""

We asked Leppert if it’s possible the crime rate would have fallen at a similar pace anyway, considering it was going down before he became mayor and continued to drop after his tenure. ""If they did the same things we did,"" he said. ""I needed the city council, I needed to work with the police department; not only the leaders in the police department but the people who were out on the street doing a great job every single day.""

Our ruling

Leppert’s estimate of a 30-percent, three-year drop is on target, though crime was dropping years before his tenure and factors beyond his influence surely contributed to the drop he touts --  among them private donations before he was mayor and the earlier hiring of a new police chief. Yet the police force grew substantially on his watch.

Will entitlement programs and debt swamp federal revenues in the near future?
","
Members of Congress and politicians like to use dramatic language to describe the nation’s fiscal problems. Federal spending, they say, is like ""a runaway train."" The GOP’s front-runner for president, Mitt Romney, famously said, ""We’re inches away from no longer having a free economy.""

The rhetoric on the nation’s deficit is similar. ""A government that loses its sovereignty to its bondholders cannot long guarantee its people’s prosperity – or secure their freedom,"" the budget written last year by House Republicans said.

Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, is a bit more restrained, though his prediction is equally grim.

""In just a few decades, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, other mandatory spending programs, and paying interest due on the debt will eclipse our entire budget,’’ he says on his congressional website.

""There will be NO money left for defense, Pell Grants, support for K-12 education, police and firefighters, economic development, transportation infrastructure, and everything else which creates and sustains a country for our children,"" he says in words meant to envision a fiscal nuclear winter.

It is grim and dark to be sure.

But is it true?

To answer it, we have to narrow the discussion. Schrader’s assertion that there will be ""NO money left"" for popular programs dealing with education, public safety and infrastructure is impossible to answer because Congress has broad discretion for appropriating dollars to those activities -- or raising taxes to pay for them. And even amid desperate fiscal meltdowns Congress has excelled at finding ways to pay for popular programs.

So let’s examine the first part of Schrader’s claim - that in a relatively short time, the cost of the big entitlement programs - Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - and interest payments on the national debt will ""eclipse our entire budget.""

If you take the statement at its literal meaning, it is false. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest are always part of the annual budget. Just like rent or mortgage, groceries and credit card debt are always part of a household budget. The spending can never eclipse the budget because the items are always contained within the total budget.

Schrader’s staff says the language is imprecise but the meaning isn’t - that entitlements and debt will swamp federal revenues in the near future.

It’s one of those, ""It’s not what we say, it’s what we mean"" moments.

Taken that way there is a lot of data to support the idea. In fact, independent budget analysts using federal data say Schrader is being generous.

According to budget simulations run by the Government Accountability Office, the total cost of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt service would exceed total revenues in 2026 for the first time in history.

The fiscal year 2012 budget released last year by the Republican-controlled House Budget Committee said this: ""In 1970, these major entitlements consumed about 20 percent of the budget – a number that has grown to over 40 percent today. Unless action is taken to reform these programs, they will continue to crowd out all other national priorities until they break the federal budget.""

Other government reports look at individual pieces. But together they reach the same conclusion.

The Congressional Budget Office, for example, noted similar concerns in a long-term outlook released in June. The federal debt is growing, reaching 62 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2010.

The non-partisan budget office noted similar growth trends for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, concluding ""the total amount of benefits scheduled to be paid under current law will grow faster than the economy.""

The numbers are clear as are the trends. With the explosive growth in entitlements and the government’s need to borrow more to keep pace, there is little doubt that the lines will cross soon on the graph of revenues versus spending. The only question is when.

To rule, we need to decide first if the distinction between ""the budget"" that Schrader referred to and total revenues, which includes the debt and all the entitlement programs, is a difference that matters. We think that, while his language could have been more precise, the average person would understand what he was talking about. Context matters in PolitiFact rulings, and in context, his remarks make his meaning clear.

On the math, Schrader’s estimate of ""a few decades"" is very reasonable, under present circumstances. For that reason we rate this claim: True.","[('\nInterview, Joshua Gordon, policy director, The Concord Coalition, Jan. 30, 2012;\n\nCongressional Budget Office, Long-Term Budget Outlook, June 2011;\n\nHouse Republican Budget proposal, ""The Path to Prosperity,"" April 5, 2011;\n\nCongressional website, Rep.Kurt Schrader, ""When Anarchy Wins, Congress and America Lose;"" Feb. 2, 2012\n\nGeneral Accountability Office, Budget Simulation', 'http://www.concordcoalition.org/')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/03/kurt-schrader/will-entitlement-programs-and-debt-swamp-federal-r/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Mitt Romney spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his ""entire presidential run""
","
The night Mitt Romney swept the Republican primary in Florida, Democratic National Committee chair and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz accused him of buying his victory.

""Mitt Romney’s victory tonight in the Florida GOP primary comes as no surprise – Romney and his super PAC outspent his nearest opponent by running 13,000 ads to Newt Gingrich's 200, carpet-bombing the airwaves with negative ads.  In fact, Romney’s campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run,"" said the South Florida congresswoman in a DNC press release on Jan. 31, 2012.

If Wasserman Schultz’s statement is true, that means a staggering amount of money will be spent this year, as the campaign still has nine months to go. We decided to check it out.

We soon realized that there was no way Wasserman Schultz’s statement could be accurate. McCain spent much more in his general election effort than Romney has spent on the primary so far.

Let’s go through the numbers.

McCain’s ad spending in 2008

For an analysis of McCain’s ad spending, we turned to the Wisconsin Advertising Project, now the Wesleyan Media Project. In a report about the 2008 election, the group found the McCain campaign spent about $12 million during the primary season and then more than $162 million from June through November, for a total of $174 million.

The report also shows that a majority of McCain’s ads were negative, as were Barack Obama’s.

""During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had ‘spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,’ while Barack Obama accused Senator McCain of running an entirely negative campaign,"" the report said. ""In a way, both candidates were correct. … At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain’s ads were negative in tone.""

Romney’s ad spending

Next, we looked at what Romney has spent on the primary.

Several news reports have said the Romney campaign and the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future have spent approximately $15.4 million on TV and radio ads in Florida based on data from Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group.

CMAG would not answer our specific questions about their data since PolitiFact is not one of their clients. We could not find a total dollar figure for how much Romney spent through Jan. 31 on negative ads.

However, the president of CMAG, Kenneth Goldstein, told the Daily Beast that the 2012 primary was ""the most negative election ad atmosphere I've ever seen.""

""I have absolutely never seen television advertising so negative in a Republican presidential primary,"" he added.

The Daily Beast reported that 92 percent of spending on behalf of Romney was negative.

What Wasserman Schultz said

Whatever the final spending tally is for the Romney campaign and pro-Romney super PAC, it’s clearly much less than John McCain spent in the general election.

After PolitiFact Florida questioned the numbers, DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse said the press release garbled its talking point.

""Where it says ‘presidential’ it should have said ‘primary,’"" he said.

Our ruling

Wasserman Schultz said that ""Romney’s campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run."" We couldn’t find a precise figure for what Romney spent on negative ads in all the states combined through the end of January, but it’s clearly much less than what McCain spent on his entire general election run. But it was her dramatic contrast between primary spending and general election spending that caught our attention, and that point is clearly wrong.

Comptroller Susan Combs says she ""wiped out"" Agriculture Department's egg inspections at stores
","
Reflecting on her time heading the Texas Department of Agriculture, Susan Combs told a blogger that she shrunk the size of government in 2003 by getting rid of a program to ferret out broken eggs at stores. 
Combs, who has been the state comptroller since 2007, made the statement in an interview with David Bellow, a blogger for the website Texas GOP Vote, who had asked her about remarks she made during a December 2011 meeting of the State Republican Executive Committee. ""You also mentioned ... that people were getting paid to go into stores and open the egg cartons and look at the eggs and make sure none were broken,"" Bellow said. ""How crazy is that?"" 
Combs responded by saying that she didn’t think it made sense for the government to be spending money on such a program. ""It was not a health issue,"" she said. ""If you can’t tell when you open the carton that it’s broken, then you really are going to have some hard time buying the eggs."" Combs then said she tried to end the practice during the 2001 legislative session but wasn’t successful until 2003, when Republicans secured a Texas House majority. 
""I went back to the House Appropriations (Committee) and the Senate Finance (Committee), and I showed them again, and I got it wiped out,"" said Combs, who served two four-year terms as agriculture commissioner, winning election to the statewide office in 1998 and 2002. 
A reader alerted us to the video — which was posted on the Texas GOP Vote website Dec. 6, 2011 — and questioned Combs’ claim that she ended the egg inspections. 
Is that what she did? Not eggs-actly. 
From Agriculture Department officials and documents, we learned that the agency continues to inspect eggs at retail sites like grocery and convenience stories as part of its Egg Quality Program. According to the department’s website, the program’s mission is ""to ensure that the eggs sold to Texas consumers meet (the agency’s) quality standards,"" and to achieve that goal, the agency ""inspects eggs at packing plants, distribution centers, and retail outlets."" 
Agency spokesman Bryan Black told us in emails and interviews that retail egg inspections began in 1957 and continue today. While packing plants and distribution centers are inspected every year, retail sites, which are significantly more numerous, are randomly inspected. 
Black told us that in addition to looking for broken or cracked eggs, inspectors check labels and examine eggs ""for interior and exterior qualities, as well as size."" Inspectors are checking to see whether eggs meet the standards for ""quality, grade and size"" that have been adopted by the USDA and the federal Food and Drug Administration, as required by state law. 
""Qualities such as shell shape, yolk movement, air cell size, shell appearance and shell integrity determine whether the egg is graded as AA, A or B,"" Black said. ""These are factors that consumers themselves cannot verify without the use of specialized instruments to conduct the assessments and extensive training."" 
Black said inspectors also check storage temperatures at retail sites and notify the Texas Department of State Health Services if eggs are being stored at above 45 degrees. Inspectors also notify local health agencies if they ""observe unsanitary conditions during an egg inspection,"" Black said. 
""The reason there are egg inspection programs in Texas and in other state is for consumer protection,"" Black said. ""It is the same reason why we inspect gas pumps and scales. When Texans are purchasing products, it is imperative they get exactly what they are paying for. No one should get ripped off if they are buying fuel, fruit or eggs. We provide oversight to keep businesses honest and make sure the marketplace is fair."" 
Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Department of State Health Services, told us that its inspectors also check eggs at retail sites — including distributors, grocery stores and restaurants — as part of its overall inspections of the facilities. The health inspectors are looking to see that food safety standards are being met. ""We’re looking mainly at storage temperatures and whether (the eggs) are graded,"" Williams said. 
Black told us that the state Agriculture Department has 64 full-time inspectors that conduct egg checks. However, he noted, inspectors have additional responsibilities. According to an undated job posting on the department’s website, an inspector’s duties include becoming ""proficient in accurately conducting a variety of inspections administered by TDA, which may include"" inspecting and grading eggs in retail stores and processing plants, as well as inspecting ""nursery stock and agricultural commodities leaving or entering the state,"" ""growers and/or retailers for organic certification,"" and ""cotton fields for proper stalk destruction to enforce the cotton pest laws."" 
So, what did Combs succeed in wiping out in 2003? 
That was a challenging year for Texas lawmakers, who resolved a $9.9 billion projected revenue shortfall with funding cuts, fee increases, federal aid and other strategies. In her interview with Texas GOP Vote, Combs said she took her idea to cut retail egg inspections to the budget-writing House Appropriations and Senate Finance committees. 
Combs’ spokeswoman, Brooke Botello, pointed us to a March 27, 2003, meeting of the Senate’s finance panel at which Combs testified on her department’s funding requests for the 2004-05 budget, which lawmakers were writing. 
According to video of the meeting, Sen. Kip Averitt, R-McGregor, presented Combs’ recommendations that egg inspections be reduced by about one-third and that the Agriculture Department stop doing inspections at 10 packing plants where the USDA was also inspecting. Averitt said at the hearing that stopping the duplication would save the state about $145,000 a year. 
Although Combs’ recommendations detailed at the meeting did not include ending the Agriculture Department’s egg inspections, one of the senators — we couldn’t identify the speaker in the video — floated that idea while questioning Combs. She replied that the Legislature could certainly pass legislation to do that but said she had not calculated how much money ending egg inspections would save the state. 
The senator then asked whether she thought it would be ""logical"" for the Legislature to consider shrinking the Agriculture Department’s egg inspection duties down to simply checking the 22 packing facilities not being inspected by the USDA — and halting retail inspections. 
Combs’ response: ""Yes, with one observation. When you’re at the point of sale, one of the things that comes up is ‘Are the eggs broken?’ and we talked about the fact that a broken egg is readily ascertainable by the consumer flipping the box. It does not require some kind of arcane testing. … I would say, yes, we could go to the packer-only (inspection)."" 
Ultimately, however, that’s not what happened. Instead, lawmakers that year reduced the number of overall state Agriculture Department egg inspections. When appropriating funding for the department for 2004-05, lawmakers set the target amount of annual ""egg packer, dealer, wholesaler, and retailer inspections"" at 2,000, compared with the 3,500 in the previous budget. That was a decrease of 42 percent. 
According to Black, the department has conducted about 2,100 inspections every year since then. 
Looking specifically at retail inspections, the annual number dropped along with the overall inspection figure, going from 2,746 in fiscal 2003 to 1,455 in fiscal 2004, a 47 percent decline. Retail checks continued while Combs was commissioner, with 1,955 in fiscal 2005 and 2,055 in fiscal 2006, according to data from the Agriculture Department. 
Other changes made in 2003: Black told us that the number of full-time positions devoted to inspecting eggs was reduced by 1.5 and that the department adopted a policy implementing Combs’ recommendation that it stop inspecting egg packing plants already inspected by the USDA. 
Upshot: While the number of annual egg inspections dropped after lawmakers acted, Agriculture Department inspectors continued checking eggs in stores — and still do. Combs’ statement rates False.","[('\nTexas GOP Vote, blog post and video, ""Texas Comptroller Susan Combs says she stopped govt from stealing clouds & monitoring cracked eggs,"" Dec. 6, 2011', 'http://texasgopvote.com/stop-big-government/texas-comptroller-susan-combs-says-she-stopped-govt-stealing-clouds-monitoring-c-003600'), ('\nTexas Department of Agriculture, webpage, ""Egg Quality Program,"" accessed Jan. 30, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nEmail (excerpts) from Bryan Black, director of communications, Texas Department of Agriculture, Jan. 27 and Feb. 1, 2012', 'http://www.texasagriculture.gov/RegulatoryPrograms/EggProgram.aspx'), ('\nInterview with Bryan Black, director of communications, Texas Department of Agriculture, Jan. 31 and Feb. 2, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nTexas Legislature Online, Agriculture Code, ""Title 6: Production, processing, and sale of animal products; subtitle A: Bees and nonlivestock animal industry; Chapter 132: Eggs,"" Jan. 29, 2012', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SjvUxOWB9XSxVHsBO9iqmBuVgUx2il-bVjIL7Rox5uU/edit'), ('\nInterview with Carrie Williams, press officer, Texas Department of State Health Services, Feb. 2, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nTexas Department of Agriculture, job posting, ""Inspector III/IV Job Description Posting,"" accessed Feb. 1, 2012', 'http://www.texasagriculture.gov/About/Employment/InspectorIIIIVJobDescriptionPosting121101.aspx'), ('\nEmail interview with Brooke Botello, communications director, Texas comptroller for public accounts, Jan. 19 and Feb. 1, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nTexas Senate Committee on Finance, video/audio archives, select PM session from March 27, 2003 (Susan Combs testimony starts at 2:01 mark)', 'http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/senate/commit/c540/c540_78.htm#Real')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/03/susan-combs/comptroller-susan-combs-says-she-wiped-out-agricul/
"['Deficit', 'Virginia', 'Randy Forbes']","
Rep. Randy Forbes says national debt comes to $48,700 per person
","
U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes is sounding the alarm on the U.S. debt.

""The national debt is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household,"" Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a January 24 blog post.  ""It is now equivalent to the size of our entire economy.""

Those are some eye-catching numbers, so wanted to see if Forbes was right.

Forbes is referring to gross national debt -- which includes publicly held debt as well as the amount the government owes trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. The gross debt was about $15.2 trillion on the day the congressman made his statement, according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department.

Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, said the congressman used census data to break down the debt load to per-person and per-household shares.

Hack referred us to the U.S. Census population clock, which continuously updates the estimated number of people living in the the nation. On Feb. 1, the clock showed the U.S. population was 312.9 million.

When you divide the amount the U.S. owes creditors by the population,  the national debt equals $48,686. So Forbes, rounding up, is right in saying the debt comes to $48,700 per person.

Now, let’s turn to households. There were 118.7 million of them in the U.S. in March 2011, according to the most current Census Bureau estimate. Doing the math, that means the debt per household comes to $128,378 -- just above Forbes’ calculation of $128,300.

Still, Forbes is comparing a January 2012 debt figure to a March 2011 household number. We found a sure-fire way to make an updated estimate.

The Census 2012 Abstract of the United States shows that the size of the average household was 2.6 people in 1990, 2000 and 2010. So we divided 312.9 million (the Feb. 1, 2012 U.S. population tally) by 2.6, and arrived at 120.4 million households. That would equal $126,585 of debt per household at the of this month -- pretty close to the number Forbes cited.

But if the debt comes $48,700 per person, does that mean each individual in the U.S. would end up paying that amount to make the nation whole?

Bill Frenzel, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the answer is no.

The debt is owed by the U.S. government, which ultimately pays up through its ability to tax, said Frenzel, a former Republican congressman.

""We as individual citizens will pay for that debt in quite differing amounts,"" Frenzel said.

Frenzel, the former ranking member of the House Budget Committee, used multi-billionaire Warren Buffett as an example. The overall amount Buffett would pay in taxes would be much higher than Americans of lesser means, he said.

Breaking down the debt by person and household creates a ""gee whiz"" number aimed at grabbing people’s attention, Frenzel said. ""The problem is that $15 trillion is such a big number that it doesn’t mean anything to anybody,"" he added.

Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, echoed that sentiment. But he said it would be better to measure debt not by its gross total, but rather by the amount of ""publicly-held"" debt.

""That’s how much the government actually owes to outside entities,"" Knudsen said.

On the day Forbes made his statement, publicly-held debt was about $10.5 trillion. Running the numbers again, that would equal to $33,470 per person or $87,023 per household.

Economists have told PolitiFact in recent years that publicly-held debt as well as the gross national debt tally are each valid measures of the nation’s debt load.

What about Forbes’ last contention -- that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the U.S. economy?

Hack cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showing that the average U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the market value of all final goods and services produced -- was $15.1 trillion throughout all of 2011. That’s just below the total debt level of $15.2 trillion.

The BEA data also shows that for the last three months of last year, the GDP came in at $15.3 trillion. Still, when talking about such large numbers, that’s roughly equal to the size of the national debt.

Our ruling:

Forbes said the national debt is equal to $48,700 per person and $128,300 per household. He also said the debt is equivalent to the size as the U.S. economy.

On all three scores, he’s pretty much on target.

We rate the claim True.

"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Jim Whelan']","
United States ranks 26th in school performance in the world, senator says
","
New Jersey students may perform better than their counterparts in many other states, but from a global perspective, students across the United States are falling behind.

State Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) raised that point during a Jan. 9 debate on the Senate floor about the Urban Hope Act. That legislation, passed by the Legislature and quickly signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie, allows nonprofit entities to build and run schools in three failing districts.

Before casting his vote in favor of the bill, Whelan told his fellow legislators that ""we’ve got to change the conversation"" and consider a longer school year.

""Let’s look where we are in the world. We’re twenty-sixth,"" said Whelan, a teacher in Atlantic City. ""United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found the numbers that back up Whelan’s statistic, but due to the margins of error attached to the average test scores, the 26th ranking may not be completely accurate.

Let’s explain the test we’re talking about.

The test -- known as the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA -- is overseen by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The test assesses 15- and 16-year-olds for reading, math and science.

The PISA was administered in 65 countries or economies in 2009, and another 10 participants in 2010. Of those 75 participants, the United States ranks 26 when the mean scores in the three subject areas are averaged out.

Anthony Jackson, vice president for education at Asia Society, a global educational organization, said in an email that such a composite ranking gives a ""broader sense of how student performance in the US (or any nation) compares with that of other nations beyond its performance in any one subject area.""

Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, told us averaging the scores is acceptable, but he cautioned: ""I would still not call this ‘overall performance’ since there are a number of school subjects not measured by PISA (e.g. history, geography or music).""

But rankings may not be as clear-cut when factoring in the margins of error attached to the average scores.

Those margins of error make it difficult to rank countries for both the individual subject areas as well as the composite averages, according to Dana Kelly, co-national project manager of PISA in the United States.

""It may appear that the U.S. average is lower (or higher) than another country when actually there is not a measurable difference in the average scores,"" Kelly said in an email. ""Likewise, countries ‘above’ us may not have measurably different average scores from each other so (it) gets even more difficult to figure out where we are in a ranking.""

""We understand that people want to know where the US stands, but ranking is just tricky,"" Kelly added.

Beth Schroeder, Whelan’s chief of staff, defended the senator in an email:

""The point Senator Whelan was trying to make still stands. By any measure, the United States is lagging behind the rest of the world in school performance. Whether we’re 26th or some other rank once you factor in the margin of error, we should be striving to have the best educational system in the world, and shouldn’t settle for anything but first.""

Our ruling

During a debate on the Senate floor, Whelan claimed the ""United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world.""

Based on the most recent international assessments, the senator’s statistic is on target. After averaging out the mean scores in reading, math and science, the United States ranks 26 out of 75 participating countries or economies.

But since those mean scores are subject to margins of error -- which could alter the rankings -- we rate the statement Mostly True.

Armond Budish says more bills limiting abortion were introduced last year than in any of the previous three General Assemblies
","
Majority Republicans in the Ohio House said the economy would be their chief focus this year, in the second session of the state's 129th General Assembly.

""The focus of this body will be the economy and to help the private sector create jobs,"" Rep. Matt Huffman, the majority floor leader, said at a news conference at the Statehouse to roll out this year’s party agenda.

House Republicans proclaimed the same message last year after they reclaimed the majority in the 2010 fall election.

But state Rep. Armond Budish, the minority leader in the house, would beg to differ. He asserts that House Republicans instead pushed an agenda to diminish workers’ rights, voting rights and abortion rights.

""We've seen more anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of this session than we've seen in the last three General Assemblies,"" Budish said at a Jan. 31 news conference announcing his party's priorities.

PolitiFact Ohio asked Budish's office for the numbers.

They provided a list identifying legislation that would restrict abortion that was introduced last year and from previous General Assemblies. We checked that list ourselves, too, using the search engine for laws, acts and legislation on the legislature's website.

The list, we noted, includes such measures as HB 125, prohibiting abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, and HB 153, the state operating budget, which contained two provisions restricting access to abortion.

It did not include such measures as HB 180, creating the ""Massillon Tiger Football Booster Club"" license plate and prohibiting any money raised by it to go to ""abortion-related activities.""

The list showed 11 bills that would affect abortion rights from 2011, the first session of the 129th General Assembly. That’s more than any of the three previous two-year sessions. There were eight bills in 128th General Assembly, nine in the 127th and six in the 126th.

Deal DUI Super Bowl ad cites good statistic
","
Georgians watching Sunday’s Super Bowl broadcast will be treated to seeing football’s two best teams battle each other, the best commercials to hit television, a halftime show by pop legend Madonna -- and a cameo by Gov. Nathan Deal.

That’s no misprint folks, Gov. Deal.

Deal won’t be tackling anyone or stiff-arming defenders. Instead, he will appear in a 60-second ad urging Georgia motorists to get a ride home if they’ve had too much alcohol on Super Sunday. Of course, there’s an app for that. It’s called Drive Sober Georgia, and it lists phone numbers for programs that drive tipsy motorists home for free.  

""No one wants to stop you from enjoying the game,"" Deal says in the public service announcement. ""However, having too much to drink and getting on the road endangers not only your life, but the lives of others. One out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol.""

PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Did Deal score a truth touchdown with this alcohol fatality statistic or should the governor get flagged for a misleading statement?

We consulted the top authorities on drunken driving data. They all cite numbers from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Its Fatality Analysis Reporting System collects yearly statistics on deadly traffic crashes, including ones involving drunken drivers

The NHTSA defines ""alcohol-impaired"" crashes as those that involve a driver with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher. A sober driver could be at fault.

According to the NHTSA, 10,839 people were killed in crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving in 2009. This accounts for 32 percent of all traffic-related deaths in the United States.  

The percentage dropped slightly in 2010, when 10,228 people died in alcohol-impaired crashes or 31 percent.

Georgia’s percentage of crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving sits well below the national average. In 2010, it was 24 percent, or 298 out of 1,244 fatalities in the state.

The Peach State’s neighbor, South Carolina, had the highest percentage of DUI traffic-related fatalities -- 44 percent.

Although Georgia apparently has a smaller percentage of DUI traffic-related fatalities than most states, some advocates against drunken driving believe the Peach State can do more on the issue.

Mothers Against Drunk Driving advocates were at the state Capitol this week to urge lawmakers to support Senate Bill 41, which would require first-time offenders of Georgia’s DUI laws to have an ignition interlock device in their car for at least six months. Georgia law currently requires the device for repeat DUI offenders. An ignition interlock device works like a Breathalyzer. It measures a driver’s blood-alcohol content and prevents the car from starting if the reading surpasses a certain level.

""MADD believes Georgia can do better,"" said Frank Harris, the group’s state legislative affairs director.

So, back to Deal’s claim. Is he right? Can one out of every three automobile fatalities be ""attributed"" to alcohol?

Deal’s numbers are right. But his language is slightly off.

According to the NHTSA’s definition, the drunken driver doesn’t have to be at fault for the crash to count as an ""alcohol-impaired"" wreck. Deal would have been more accurate to say that one out of every three automobile fatalities involves a drunken driver.

That said, this is a minor point. Deal’s overall point holds.

We won’t dock him on this technicality. He earns a True.","[('\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Impaired Driving fact sheet, accessed Jan. 31, 2012', 'http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html'), (""\nGeorgia Senate Bill 41, accessed Feb. 1, 2012\n\nMADD state-by-state DUI statistics, accessed Jan. 31, 2012\n\nTelephone interview with Frank Harris, Mothers Against Drunk Driving state legislative affairs director, Jan. 31, 2012\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2009 data, accessed Jan. 31, 2012\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, State Motor Vehicle Fatalities, 2010\n\nEmail interview, Harris Blackwood, director, Governor's Office of Highway Safety, Feb. 1, 2012"", 'No link')]",/factchecks/2012/feb/03/nathan-deal/deal-dui-super-bowl-ad-cites-good-statistic/

Rhode Island state Rep. Joseph Trillo says Quonset Business Park contributes nothing to the state besides jobs
","
State Rep. Joseph A. Trillo wants someone to build a ""super-casino"" in the Quonset Business Park. It’s a can’t-miss proposition, the Warwick Republican says. Cruise ships could dock at the Port of Davisville, bringing visitors from afar to a 7.5-million-square-foot facility that would include such amenities as an indoor amusement park and an aquarium.

In recent weeks, Trillo, the House Minority Whip, has been touting his plan through the media, arguing that developing a casino at the former Navy base would maximize the potential of what he sees as an under-performing state asset.

During a debate with state Sen. James Sheehan on Rhode Island PBS’ ""A Lively Experiment"" -- a portion of which aired Jan. 20 -- Trillo voiced his criticism of the state-owned business park.

""We put $45 million into Quonset Point,"" Trillo said. ""We got the place for free and we’re getting zero dollars out of it into the state coffers.""

""That’s not true,"" said Sheehan, a North Kingstown Democrat who opposes a casino in Quonset.

""Zero dollars other than the fact that it produces the jobs,"" Trillo countered. ""We don’t get any money or any profit from 3,300 acres of land that we got given to us.""

We wondered whether Trillo’s claim was true. Does the general fund -- what Trillo refers to as ""state coffers"" -- really get no revenue whatsoever from Quonset?

When we called Trillo, he said he was referring specifically to the operation of the business park, which is actually 3,204 acres and is managed by the Quonset Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency under the authority of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation.

""There is no profit,"" he told us. ""Every dollar they take in goes into operating the industrial park.""

We checked the QDC’s annual financial statements to see for ourselves.

For the most recent fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2011, the QDC had revenues of $8,314,944 and expenditures of $8,310,750 for a net gain of $4,563.

The bulk of revenues -- $5.2 million -- came from rental income on 403 acres that the QDC leases out to private companies.

Another $1.9 million was raised through utility sales to tenants of the park. That includes water and sewage treatment services.

Earnings for the 2010 fiscal year and the three prior fiscal years followed a similar pattern. The QDC had either a small net gain ($369 in 2010 and $4,347 in 2008) or a small net loss ($50 in 2009 and $2,713 in 2007).

In other words, expenditures and revenues have been nearly equivalent in recent years. No profits were channeled into the state’s general fund in all those years -- except one.

In 2008, the General Assembly required the QDC to pay $3.5 million into the general fund to cover debt service on $48 million in bonds for road projects and other capital improvements that were approved in 2004. (The amount of the bond issue was incorrectly referred to as $45 million by Trillo in the debate with Sheehan.) That was the only year that the legislature made the QDC contribute to the general fund.

We contacted David Preston, spokesman for the QDC, who said that the agency generally pours any profits back into improving the park with better roads, railways and piers. For example, in 2011, the agency spent $1.3 million on capital projects.

He also pointed out that in terms of operating expenses the QDC is self-sufficient. It has, however, received taxpayer support for capital projects in the form of the 2004 bond issue and a $22.3-million federal stimulus grant in 2009.

Preston also said there is a reason why the QDC does not generate profits: that’s not its purpose.

""The mission of the QDC is to create jobs and their record of creating jobs is unmatched in the state,"" he said.

Under the 2004 legislation that created it, the QDC is defined as a ""real estate development and management company"" whose objectives are encouraging business development, attracting jobs and promoting ""the economic development of the state and the general welfare of its citizens.""

If the agency does what it’s supposed to do, companies are brought into the business park, jobs are created and revenue flows to the state in the form of taxes. That’s not money coming from the QDC itself but it’s money nonetheless.

According to a five-year progress report released by the QDC in 2010, there are now 168 companies operating in the business park. They include Electric Boat, Toray Plastics America, Ocean State Job Lot and Hexagon Metrology.

The 168 companies collectively employ 8,800 workers. A third of those jobs were created between 2005 and 2009. In the same period, $142.6 million was invested in the park by private companies.

The businesses at Quonset pay corporate income tax to the state and their employees pay personal income tax. Preston said that no studies have been done totaling those revenues, but there are snapshots of the amounts of money that come in through taxes.

When the Gateway project -- a retail and hotel development at Quonset -- was approved in 2007, construction was expected to generate $9 million in sales tax revenue and $3 million in payroll tax revenue for the state, according to the Economic Development Corporation.

In 2008, a consulting firm hired by the QDC estimated that the businesses and workers at the 290-acre Port of Davisville, which is situated inside the park, annually pay the state a total of $3.7 million in corporate income tax, personal income tax, sales tax and excise tax.

When Galaxy Nutritional Foods moved to Quonset from Florida in 2009, the EDC projected that the personal income tax revenue to the state for 26 of the company’s positions would total $261,558 between 2010 and 2012.

Our ruling

During the debate with Sheehan, Trillo was very specific in his criticism of the Quonset Business Park. He said the state doesn’t get ""any money or any profit from 3,300 acres of land.""

On that point, he is technically correct. While the Quonset Development Corporation does collect rent on land in the park, it uses that money for operating expenses and passes none of it on to the state.

Trillo also qualified his statement about the business park by adding that the state gets ""zero dollars other than the fact that it produces the jobs.""

That’s a huge qualification. Although the QDC does not contribute directly to the state’s general fund, the state does benefit financially from the businesses in the park.

Quonset is home to 168 companies that employ a total of 8,800 people. Those companies and their employees pay millions of dollars in taxes to the state.

Trillo chose his words carefully in criticizing the performance of the Quonset Business Park, but he left out important information about its benefits to the state. Because the claim fails to give those details and because it takes things out of context, we rule it Half True.

Knoxville Republican says AIDS came from man having sex with a monkey then with other men
","Of the many controversial claims state Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, made in an interview on satellite radio last week with a gay-rights advocate, none was more sensational than his assertion that AIDS in humans came from ""one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men.""

This came about 12 minutes into an interview that ostensibly was about a bill Campfield has championed declaring that only sexuality involving ""natural human reproduction"" can be addressed in the state’s K-8 public-school classrooms. Campfield calls it a ""Don’t Teach Gay"" bill, but it’s been more commonly called the ""Don’t Say Gay"" bill. Critics say it could open the door to allowing anti-gay bullying and harassment and potentially prevent teachers and administrators from helping students properly deal with sexuality issues.

We’re working on a separate article to post on Sunday that will cover many of the other claims made by Campfield, who also serves as Tennessee campaign co-director for Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign. This item will explore Campfield's specific claim about AIDS entering the human population because ""one guy"" had sex with a monkey and then had sex with men.

Here's the pertinent exchange for this fact check:

CAMPFIELD: Most people realize that AIDS came from the homosexual community.

SIGNORILE: No, it did not. Do you know the history of AIDS?

CAMPFIELD: It was one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men.

SIGNORILE: No, it was not one guy screwing a monkey. It was somebody in Africa. Do you know the history of AIDS? Because I can tell you in a minute? It was somebody in Africa who actually killed a monkey, because they eat the meat of many animals, as I’m sure you do, I’m sure you eat the meat of animals. And they ate the meat of a monkey and the blood, they chopped it up, and it got in a cut and that’s how AIDS then spread among heterosexuals all through Africa, and it is a pandemic around the world.

In the days since the interview, Campfield has done other interviews and put up posts on his blog, adding some caveats and qualifiers to some of his claims.

But in his blog posts, one of which he titled ""More fun than a barrel of monkeys,"" Campfield stuck by his claim of cross-species simian-human sex as the origin of AIDS. He wrote: ""The research on sex with a monkey being the first transmitter of AIDS has not been proven nor firmly dis proven (sic). It is one of about 5 theories I was able to find on the source of AIDS.""

We figured that because the legendary ""Scopes Monkey Trial"" happened in our fair state -- about 80 miles southwest of Knoxville -- PolitiFact Tennessee should examine this theory of evolution.

Consequence of hunting

Signorile had recently interviewed infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist Dr. Jacques Pepin, author of the recently published book, The Origin of AIDS, and Signorile accurately characterized Pepin’s research.

Pepin gave PolitiFact Tennessee an even more precise account. Pepin’s research, which relies on meticulous peer-reviewed studies that include DNA evidence going back decades, concludes that HIV in humans originated in Central Africa, likely sometime in 1921, from a hunter who was exposed to contaminated blood from an ape -- perhaps a chimpanzee -- that was killed for food.

A slow dissemination through Africa followed, Pepin said, through heterosexual transmission, needle injections and blood transfusions. It stayed at a ""low level,"" he says, until 1966 or 1967 when it ""was exported to Haiti"" and ""from there to the United States, probably at the beginning of the 1970s."" Pepin agrees with Campfield on one point: that its spread in North America accelerated through infections transmitted in unprotected sex among gay men.

Apes, not monkeys

We also talked to Beatrice Hahn, a former longtime University of Alabama-Birmingham professor of medicine and microbiology now at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a 2010 research paper, ""Origin of HIV and AIDS Pandemic."" She clued us into a key distinction -- a monkey is not an ape and an ape is not a monkey. But they are both simians, the animal classification for what are known as ""higher primates.""

She has concluded that the form of HIV most prevalent around the world, known as HIV-1 Group M, originated in chimpanzees -- and chimps are considered apes, not monkeys. Figure 1 in her paper, which cites studies from 150 research papers and was written with Penn colleague Paul Sharp (formerly of University of Edinburgh) features pictures of 10 kinds of simians and has arrows showing how SIV -- ""simian immuno deficiency virus"" -- made a path to humans in two major forms, HIV-1 and HIV-2.

Hahn said HIV-1, the most common AIDS virus, has been documented to have emerged following ""four independent transmissions of ape viruses -- not monkey viruses.""

A second human AIDS virus that is largely restricted to West Africa is called HIV-2, and it is declining and being replaced by HIV-1, according to the paper. That less prevalent form has been traced to a monkey called the Sooty mangabey.

Hahn says the mostly likely way that the simian precursors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 entered the human population was from bushmeat hunters who killed simians for their meat. Pepin and other researchers have written the same thing, and we found no serious academic papers mentioning simian-human sex as a possible transmission route.

""Human infection,"" wrote Martine Peeters of the retrovirus laboratory of the Institute of Research for Development in Montpelier, France, ""is thought to have resulted from cutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to infected blood during the hunting and butchering of chimpanzees and Sooty mangabeys for food. Bites from pet animals and possibly contact with fecal and urine samples may have also been involved.""

Pepin’s book covers the same territory in great detail and cites many studies.

Hahn has appeared on panels with renowned primatologist Jane Goodall to discuss the dangers bushmeat hunting poses. Not only does it endanger species of simians like chimpanzees, there is concern the practice could some day lead to other simian viruses getting passed to humans to create a new pandemic. Scientists remain unsure why SIV does not lead to AIDS in some simians, while HIV causes a deadly condition in humans.

Our ruling

Campfield is unable to provide any convincing evidence to back up his claim and we could find none. The overwhelming scientific research shows Campfield is wrong. Experts believe HIV entered the human population through so-called ""bushmeat"" hunting, and, furthermore, that the predominant HIV-1 form has never been shown to be transmitted directly from monkeys to humans.

Hahn emphasized, too, that there is zero evidence to support the cross-species sex Campfield proposes: ""It surely wasn’t transmitted through sexual activity (with simians).""

Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate has gone nearly three years without a budget, GOP Rep. Paul Ryan says
","
The day before President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan took shots at him and other Democrats over federal budget matters.

In a Jan. 23, 2012 news release, the Wisconsin Republican repeated one of his favorite complaints.

""Tomorrow marks the 1,000th day Senate Democrats have gone without any budget at all,"" he said.

Let’s see what Ryan meant by singling out Senate Democrats and claiming they’ve been without a budget for nearly three years. While we’re at it, let’s examine the implications of operating government without a formal budget.

Ryan’s spokesman, Conor Sweeney, said the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution -- a necessary step in adopting the federal budget -- was on April 29, 2009.

A PolitiFact Florida item on a claim similar to Ryan’s confirmed the date.

That means it was 1,000 days from when the Senate adopted the fiscal 2010 budget to Jan. 24, 2012, the date Ryan referred to in his news release.

Of course, since the 2010 budget went through Sept. 30, 2010, the government actually operated without a Senate budget resolution for only 481 days as of Jan. 24, 2012, a point Sweeney acknowledged.

So, Ryan is using language that is a little loose in saying the Senate ""went without a budget"" for 1,000 days. But in interviews, on Twitter, in other statements and in an article he co-authored that was published the same day as  his news release, Ryan has been clear that he means 1,000 days passed without the Senate adopting a budget.

So, how has the government kept running?

Budgets vs spending

Excerpts from a June 2010 PolitiFact National item tell how the budget process is supposed to work:

The Senate and House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it.

If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can adopt appropriations bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes. But the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.

Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate adopted a fiscal 2011 budget resolution, but the Republican-controlled House approved a fiscal 2012 budget resolution.

That gave Ryan more fuel for blasting the Senate Democrats for not adopting one.

The lack of budget resolutions contributed to delays in appropriations to government agencies, said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that analyzes federal spending.

Ellis said no spending bills were approved for fiscal 2011 until after the fiscal year started in October 2010; the remainder weren’t approved until April 2011, halfway into the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, final spending bills weren’t adopted until just before Christmas 2011, nearly three months into the fiscal year, he said.

So, when it lacks a budget for direction, Congress still has the power to spend money and keep government operating, but the process can get mucked up.

Implications of no budget

Does it matter? It does to some people.

Failing to adopt a budget resolution ""is not a fiscal calamity,"" Ellis said, noting there are other methods to set budget levels and even with delayed spending bills the government keeps operating. ""But I would like the Senate and the House to do a budget resolution because that is going to get a better result than ad hoc or other mechanisms to get around it.""

From Ryan’s perspective, as he said in a statement in July 2011, Congress ""has a moral — and legal — obligation to propose and pass budgets that tackle our generation’s greatest challenge."" He added that ""America’s job creators want certainty and confidence in the economy — which requires a credible plan to cut spending, prevent future tax hikes, and reassure our creditors that we’re restoring fiscal discipline.""

But neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions.

Senate Democrats didn’t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because ""Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people’s time with pointless political votes,"" a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told PolitiFact Florida. ""Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people’s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families.""

Our Florida colleagues also foundthat since 1983, the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions.

For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. On three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007), the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.

Our rating

Ryan said ""Senate Democrats have gone without any budget at all"" for 1,000 days.

It hasn’t been quite that long since the last Senate budget resolution expired, but it has been 1,000 days -- and counting -- since the Democrat-controlled Senate adopted a budget.

Republican senator claims Pennsylvania charges top income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware has no state income tax
","
As Democrats and Republicans squared off Monday on Gov. Chris Christie’s proposal to reduce state income taxes, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio reminded his fellow legislators of how taxpayers in Pennsylvania and Delaware are already getting better deals.

Pennsylvania charges a top income tax rate of 3 percent, while Delaware doesn’t collect any state income taxes, according to Pennacchio.

""We’re competing worldwide, but especially we’re competing with our regional states. This has to make us more competitive, because when you take a look at us versus Pennsylvania, it's still three percent in Pennsylvania,"" Pennacchio (R-Morris) said during a Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee hearing. ""When you take a look at us versus Delaware, it's still zero in Delaware.""

In a news release issued following the meeting, Pennacchio repeated the claim: ""A small decrease is a good first step to making New Jersey more competitive with states like Pennsylvania which charges a top rate of 3%, or Delaware which has no state income tax at all.""

Each time, Pennacchio was right about Pennsylvania, but wrong about Delaware. As PolitiFact New Jersey found, both states charge state income taxes.

Pennacchio acknowledged in a phone interview that he was wrong about Delaware, but argued that New Jersey still needs to be competitive with its neighboring states.

""I think the premise is still the same,"" Pennacchio told us.

Here’s the story with state income taxes in Pennsylvania and Delaware:

Pennsylvania charges a flat income tax rate of 3.07 percent on all taxpayers, regardless of income level. Certain individuals or families may qualify for a state program that eliminates or reduces their state income taxes.

So, Pennacchio is correct about the 3 percent rate in the Keystone State.

But Delaware also charges a state income tax. In 2011, that state’s rates ranged from 2.2 percent on taxable income greater than $2,000 to a top rate of 6.95 percent on taxable income greater than $60,000. This year, Delaware’s top rate is decreasing to 6.75 percent.

(For shoppers looking to save some money, Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax.)

These seven states don’t collect any state income taxes: Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Washington, Nevada, Texas and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee impose taxes on interest and dividends income, but not one’s wages.

It’s worth noting that the top income tax rates in Pennsylvania and Delaware still remain below the maximum rate in New Jersey, where individuals with taxable income exceeding $500,000 face a rate of 8.97 percent.

Our ruling

At a Senate committee hearing and then in a news release afterwards, Pennacchio claimed that Pennsylvania imposes an income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware doesn’t collect any state income taxes.

The senator’s on target when it comes to Pennsylvania, where taxpayers face a flat rate of 3.07 percent. But he’s wrong about Delaware, since that state imposes income tax rates ranging from 2.2 percent to more than 6 percent.

We rate the statement Half True.

Newt Gingrich says Mitt Romney cut off Jewish nursing home residents' kosher food
","
Newt Gingrich, campaigning in Florida before the state’s GOP primary, accused Mitt Romney of preventing Jewish nursing home residents in Massachusetts from keeping kosher to save a few bucks. 
""Gov. Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day,"" Gingrich said in a speech in Tampa on Jan. 30, 2011. ""For $5 a day, he said, no, you cannot follow your religious prescription.""

The next day, as Florida voters headed to the polls, robocalls made an even bolder claim. Gingrich’s campaign confirmed it sent the call statewide Tuesday, though the candidate denied he had heard it.

""As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney vetoed a bill paying for kosher food for our seniors in nursing homes,"" the robocall said, according to CNN. ""Holocaust survivors, who for the first time, were forced to eat non-kosher, because Romney thought $5 was too much to pay for our grandparents to eat kosher.""

We wanted to know, did Romney ""cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were Medicaid beneficiaries to save $5 a day""?

Flashback to 2003

We asked Gingrich’s campaign for support for his claim. Spokesman Joe DeSantis pointed us to a New York Post article from Jan. 27, ""Romney rapped for kosher cut."" 
Romney's campaign declined to comment on the specifics of the claim. 
We dug deeper.

Romney was a brand-new governor in 2003 facing a $3 billion budget gap.

The year before he took office, a change in the state reimbursement formula for nursing homes removed extra funding for eight kosher homes, said Jeremy Burton, executive director for the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston.

One nursing home, the Coolidge House Nursing Care Center in Brookline, Mass., decided in November 2002 that it would have to close its kosher kitchen, the Jewish Advocate of Boston reported. Instead, it would bring in kosher meals from outside — bringing food over from a sister nursing home, catering meals or offering prepacked dishes.

Democratic lawmakers wanted to keep nursing homes’ kosher kitchens open. They asked for $600,000 in supplemental funding, an extra $5 a day per kosher diner.

""We in the Legislature felt that a nursing home resident that was observant was entitled to that, even in tight fiscal times,"" said Rep. Ruth Balser, D-Newton, who helped work on the measure. ""... People were definitely alarmed, and we took it very seriously.""

Romney used his line-item veto to scratch the funding, writing that ""it unnecessarily requires an increased rate for nursing facilities,"" the Jewish Advocate reported.

""I guess the governor at the time thought it was supplementary or an optional expense we couldn't afford,"" Balser told PolitiFact. ""... ""It was his intention to cut them off.""

But Democrats, who held a majority in the Massachusetts Legislature, ""overrode it quickly,"" Balser said. Nursing homes got their funding.

""It never came up again, that I'm aware of,"" Balser said.

Neither Burton nor Balser could confirm that any Jewish nursing home residents lost access to kosher food, nor did we find any other information suggesting that kosher meals were ever eliminated for the nursing home residents.

Our ruling

Gingrich claimed that as governor of Massachusetts, ""Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day.""

It’s true that one Massachusetts nursing home said in 2002 that it would close its kosher kitchen. But that decision was made based on a state funding decision before Romney took office. And that nursing home still planned to offer kosher meals to its residents — just not from an in-house facility.

It’s also true that when lawmakers rallied to provide money to make sure nursing homes didn’t have to make that choice, Romney attempted to veto extra funding, saying it would boost nursing home rates. But his veto was quickly overridden. There's no evidence any senior citizens were denied kosher food.

President Obama says Master Lock has brought back jobs from overseas, operating at capacity
","
President Barack Obama hailed the return of manufacturing jobs that had been shipped overseas during his State of the Union speech on Jan. 24, 2012. The president discussed companies that have brought back production after labor problems in China, economic issues and higher shipping rates added to costs.

Obama said:  ""We can’t bring every job back that’s left our shore. But right now, it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive.""

He added: ""A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.""

Master Lock hasn’t had this much publicity since it ran those ""Tough Under Fire"" Super Bowl ads showing their product surviving a sharpshooter’s bullet. Those ads ran for 20 years, starting in the mid-1970s.

So what’s the latest at the company’s huge central city plant?

The lock maker, a division of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., was founded in Milwaukee in 1921.

Fifteen years ago, Master Lock had about 1,154 workers at its Milwaukee plant, 2600 N. 32nd Street, a  sprawling facility that’s been described as the size of seven football fields. That year, Master Lock announced that it would begin importing locks from China, a move that began a string of large job reductions in Milwaukee.

Two years later, the company announced that it would open a lock assembly factory in Nogales, Mexico. Because of the outsourcing and competition from those cheaper locks made elsewhere, employment in the Milwaukee plant fell to about 270 employees in 2003, the company said.

The cost advantages of overseas production began to decline in the late 2000s. By the end of 2010, the company said, several dozen jobs were moved back to Milwaukee. Employment grew to 379, news reports said.

In early 2011, company executives used the ""full capacity"" description of production in a Journal Sentinel story about the return of the outsourced jobs. That message returned at a White House meeting in January 2012, and again in the State of the Union address.

The White House meeting was a ""in-sourcing"" forum. At that event, the president singled out  Master Lock for praise.

The company says employment in Milwaukee is now 412.  Master Lock still operates factories in China and Mexico.

So what does it mean when the company and Obama say that the plant is operating at ""full capacity""? After all, there are nearly 750 fewer people working there than 15 years ago.

Without providing specifics or revenue figures, Master Lock said in a written statement that the Milwaukee plant is a far different operation than it was in 1997.

""The Milwaukee plant is producing parts and components at a much higher volume than in 1997, reflecting our regained market share and Master Lock's overall revenue growth, which is approximately double 1997 revenues,"" the company said. ""Moreover, Milwaukee-made production is now being sold directly to Master Lock customers in China, reflecting its new competitiveness.  

Master Lock said it decided to ""re-size and convert Milwaukee into a more automated and highly efficient manufacturer of parts and components regardless of final assembly destination.""

Such ""lean manufacturing"" efforts have paid off for many companies, said Nick Hayes, a partner with FiveTwelve Group Ltd., a business research and consulting firm in Milwaukee.

Manufacturers can become far more efficient by using automation, high-tech equipment and streamlining the way they move supplies and inventory around a factory, he said.

Hayes offered an example of a factory he worked with that adopted lean manufacturing. The company downsized from a 60,000 square foot factory and 100 workers to one that was two-thirds smaller, with half the work force. Production increased 10-fold.

""The question I would have for Master Lock is how primitive were they before?"" Hayes said.

Consumer demand for the product is another critical factor, he said. And Master Lock indicated that sales had increased.

Without providing specifics, Master Lock said it hoped to continue to add jobs in Milwaukee.

""We plan to invest in the plant this year to add capacity as we in-source more work. We are also investing in training and working with area technical colleges and universities to find and equip skilled workers.""

Our conclusion

Obama singled out Master Lock saying the company brought back outsourced jobs and is operating at capacity for the first time in 15 years. That’s the same thing Master Lock executives said more than a year ago, and they’ve continued to add jobs and said they would continue to do so. It also tracks with their efforts to attract a more highly skilled work force to run an updated operation.

Spin on economy data leads partisans to opposite conclusions
","
Minutes after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week, the Washington chattering class spun like a cartoon Tasmanian Devil.

Republicans took to the airways, grumbling that Obama offered no real solutions to the country’s problems. Democrats cheered and said he had the answers.

Then came the spin typical of any major political event, whirling with facts and figures.  

The economy’s better off since Obama took office, said U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat.

""Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the president’s first year in office to 8.5 percent today,"" Johnson said in remarks posted on Patch.com’s local news site for Stone Mountain-Redan.

No, the economy’s worse, said U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican.

Three years into Obama’s presidency, ""2 million more Americans are out of work,"" Gingrey said in a news release posted on Rome Newswire, an online news site covering the Rome area.  

Can these both be true? Is it possible for unemployment to drop as the ranks of people who are out of work grow?

Because of this conundrum, we’ll depart from our usual Truth-O-Meter format and do a special doubleheader. We’ll check both stats and tell you whether one of them is wrong or whether it’s possible for both to be correct.

First, let’s consider Johnson’s unemployment statistic.

In January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, unemployment stood at 7.8 percent. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, eight months later.  

In December 2011, the rate stood at 8.5 percent.

Johnson’s numbers are accurate, but he runs into trouble when he said that ""it is remarkable what President Obama has achieved in his first three years.""

Labor economists have repeatedly told PolitiFact that it’s hard for any political leader to take credit or blame for something as complicated as the economy.

Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan offered proof to bolster the congressman’s claim that Obama deserves credit for lower unemployment. He cited a November report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews bills that will have an impact on the federal budget. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the stimulus legislation  that Obama backed, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points during the third quarter of 2011, the office determined.

Phelan also cited a 2010 report by a Princeton professor and the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics saying the Recovery Act and monetary policy reduced unemployment.

Still, other factors are at play. For this reason, Johnson’s statement earns a Half True.

Now on to Gingrey’s statement, where he says ""2 million more Americans are out of work.""

Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber pointed us to a July check by our PolitiFact Ohio colleagues. It analyzed a television ad by the Republican National Committee criticizing Obama’s economic policies.

Since he took office, it said, ""2 million jobs. Gone.""

PolitiFact Ohio found that the drop in employment was actually more severe than the ad said. The economy lost 2.5 million jobs between January 2009 and May 2011, according to employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment and other economic data.

But the ad was missing a crucial piece of context. It neglected to mention that the economy gained 1 million jobs in the year before the ad came out. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a Mostly True.

Six months have passed since PolitiFact Ohio’s story ran, so we checked the latest employment statistics to see whether the figures were still correct.

We found that the country’s employment outlook is sunnier.

In December, there were nearly 132 million nonfarm employees in the U.S., down 1.66 million from January 2009. This means that Gingrey’s 2 million figure is some 20 percent too high.

We found a few other problems with Gingrey’s use of employment data.

When the economy loses nonfarm jobs, it does not mean that ""2 million more Americans are out of work,"" as Gingrey said. The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not design this metric to measure how many people have become unemployed.

It’s likely many did get laid off. But others might have chosen to return to school, become stay-at-home parents or leave the workforce for any number of other reasons.

It’s also worth noting that while payrolls have declined since January 2009, they’ve been rising since October 2010, according to BLS data.  

Because Gingrey’s claim cherry-picks unflattering data and his numbers could use some freshening up, we rate his statement Half True.

Now we come to the larger issue at hand. Gingrey and Johnson used valid data to give opposite impressions of the state of the economy. Their interpretations had some shortcomings but weren’t wholly incorrect.

So how is this possible? Can unemployment decline under Obama if payrolls shrank?

Yes. The reason is that Gingrey and Johnson used data from different time periods.

Gingrey chose to consider nonfarm payroll numbers starting in winter 2009, while Johnson started his unemployment count in October 2009.

The economy didn’t post its worst numbers until the latter half of 2009.

Between January 2009 and December 2011, the economy lost jobs. Nonfarm payrolls decreased by some 1.7 million jobs. As you’d expect, unemployment increased during the same time period from 7.8 percent to 8.5 percent.

But from October 2009 to December 2011, the economy gained jobs. Nonfarm payrolls actually rose by about 2.4 million. Unemployment dropped from 10 percent to 8.5 percent.  

It’s easy to cherry-pick data that give opposite impressions of the nation’s economic health. With statistics, the devil’s in the details.","[('\nPatch.com, ""Rep.

Del. Englin says cashier and rich hedge fund manager pay same Virginia income tax rate
","
Del. David Englin says Virginia’s tax code is ""nonsensical"" and in need of reform.

In a Jan. 20 news release, the Alexandria Democrat said the code is fraught with exemptions and inefficient formulas for taxing gas, machinery and business receipts. And Englin said the state income tax is inequitable.

""A cashier earning $20,000 per year pays the same (Virginia) income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning $20 million a year,"" he said.

Would that cashier and that multi-millionaire really shell out an equal percentage of their earnings in state income taxes? We checked.

Englin backed his statement by pointing to a state law that applies a 5.75 percent levy on all taxable income over $17,000.

But does that mean the hedge fund manager earning $20 million annually and the cashier earning one-thousandth of that amount would pay the same tax rate? The answer is no.

That’s because everyone who pays Virginia income tax gets to claim certain deductions and exemptions. Joel Davison, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Taxation, said those reductions would shrink our cashier’s income below the top threshold.

Let’s take the example that would offer the fewest state tax advantages to our cashier: He or she is single, has $20,000 in wages with no other income or federal deductions. The worker could claim a $930 state personal exemption and a $3,000 standard deduction for a single tax filer, leaving him or her with $16,070 in Virginia taxable income.

That means the cashier falls short of the $17,000 threshold for entry into Virginia’s top income tax rate of 5.75 percent, Davison said.

The highest rate the worker would pay on any portion of his or her income would be 5 percent.

Any other scenario would further reduce the cashier’s Virginia taxable income. Our worker, for example, could receive a $930 exemption for each dependent child. If the cashier is over 65, her or she would be entitled to a $12,000 deduction.

To be fair, there is a scenario under which the hedge fund manager would owe no taxes in Virginia. For example, he or she could have cataclysmic business losses or multiple tax credits could lower the tax liability to zero. But Davison pointed out that such occurrences would be ""unlikely.""

Englin made a mistake in the wording of his statement by focusing on the cashier’s gross pay.

He told us in an email that he was referring to the rate on  ""Virginia taxable income"" and that he was assuming, for the sake of argument, the cashier and the hedge fund manager had no deductions or credits.

But this creates a new wrinkle. Even a cashier with taxable income of $20,000 would pay a lower overall rate than a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager.

That’s because the first $17,000 of all Virginians’ taxable income is assessed below the top rate. Virginia imposes a levy  of 2 percent on the first $3,000 of taxable income, then 3 percent on the next $2,000, and 5 percent on taxable earnings from $5,000 to $17,000.

So the cashier with $20,000 in taxable earnings would pay the top 5.75 percent levy on the last $3,000 of that money, but lower rates on the rest.

Overall, a person with $20,000 in Virginia taxable income would pay a ""blended"" tax rate of 4.5 percent, according to Ryan Losi, executive vice president at the Piascik and Associates accounting firm in Richmond.

We also ran the numbers on the overall rate someone would pay if he or she had $30,000 in taxable income. It would be 4.9 percent.

That would still be below the roughly 5.75 percent levy the hedge fund manager would pay on his or her $20 million income, since all but a minute portion of the earnings would be taxed at the top rate.

Our ruling:

Englin said a cashier earning $20,000 a year would pay the same Virginia tax rate as a hedge fund manager who makes $20 million annually.

He’s wrong. Basic deductions and exemptions would lower the cashier’s taxable income to a level below the state’s top rate of 5.75 percent that the hedge fund manager would likely pay.

Englin tells us he intended to say that a cashier with a Virginia taxable income of $20,000 would pay the same rate as the rich hedge fund manager. But in such a case, the worker’s overall state income tax rate would still be lower than the millionaire’s.

We rate Englin’s statement False.
