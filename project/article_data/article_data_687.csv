Obama said he'd pursue it, but opted out
","
""We've made the decision not to participate in the public-financing system for the general election."" Barack Obama, June 19, 2008
 
Sen. Barack Obama's decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics: the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate. Obama's announcement on June 19, 2008, prompted swift criticism from Sen. John McCain's campaign that Obama had flip-flopped.
 
""The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people,"" said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. ""Barack Obama has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics.""
 
The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad. We explore the group's other claims in the ad

in this story.

Here, we'll examine the allegation about public financing.
 
When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct $3 to the fund on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election.
 
To explore whether Obama made a full flip-flop, let's go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy.
 
On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. A month later, the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the contributions separate.
 
The day of the FEC decision, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. ""Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same,"" Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, told the

New York Times.

 
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: ""If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
 
In the fall of 2007, Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network, which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing.""
""Yes,"" Obama said in his response. ""In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
 
The message seemed clear: Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election. But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system.
 
McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries. McCain's private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories, and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system.
 
But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling.
 
Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. ""What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.""
 
In the meantime, Obama's campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions, especially from donors who gave less than $200. The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries, but the donors could be tapped again (and again) before they hit the $2,300 limit for individuals.
 
As they considered their plans for the general election, a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Groups on both sides were expected to spend tens of millions of dollars, but if those contributions were lopsided, a candidate who had accepted public financing could be at a disadvantage because of the spending limits.
 
So as the money flowed in, Obama campaign strategists made a calculation: They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the private system.
 
""It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,"" Obama said in a video to supporters. ""But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.""
He said McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by ""Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs. And we've already seen that (McCain is) not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations.""
 
Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain, the Obama campaign pointed us to

a news account

that said Bob Bauer, an attorney for Obama, met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system.
 
But that account was sketchy and didn't sound to us like the ""aggressive pursuit"" that Obama had promised. The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing, but decided it wasn't in the campaign's tactical interest. So we find the ad's claim to be True.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Let Freedom Ring']","
On the fence . . . consistently
","A new TV ad from the conservative group Let Freedom Ring says Sen. Barack Obama is a flip-flopper.
 
The ad begins with Obama surrounded by newspaper headlines, with the words ""FLIP-FLOPPER?"" on the screen.
 
""People are saying that Sen. Obama's recent changes of position have made him a flip-flopper,"" the announcer says. ""He's not! Flip-floppers only hold one position at a time.""
 
As photos show Obama talking from both sides of the screen, the announcer says ""Sen. Obama is different: He holds two positions at the same time.""
 
The announcer then lists the issues on which Obama has allegedly flipped: ""Both ways on banning handguns . . . Both ways on public campaign financing. ... And now, both ways on withdrawing from Iraq.""
 
The ad concludes, ""He's 'Both Ways Barack.' Worse than a flip-flopper!""
 
We address other claims from the ad in

this article.

Here, we'll address the allegation about flip-flopping on gun control. (Much of our material below comes from

our previous ruling

on Sen. John McCain's flip-flop allegation.)
 
When the Supreme Court in June 2008 ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm and that the Washington, D.C., gun ban is unconstitutional, Obama and John McCain issued statements with their reactions.
 
McCain quickly pronounced it ""a landmark victory for Second Amendment freedom."" McCain noted that while he was among a bipartisan (though mostly Republican) group of congressmen who signed a ""friend of the court"" brief arguing against the D.C. law, Obama did not.
 
""Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness,"" McCain stated, ""today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right — sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly.""
 
Obama said the Supreme Court ruling affirmed what he had been saying all along.
 
""I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures. The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe. Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country.""
 
The McCain campaign responded by accusing Obama of waffling on the issue.
 
""Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban. He has stated his belief that handgun bans were constitutional and he supported them. Then he actually refused to state a position.""
 

Silent on the D.C. ban

 
In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision, Obama did, in fact, skirt the issue of whether he thought the D.C. gun ban was constitutional. He repeatedly said he believed the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to bear arms, but that it does not preclude local governments from enacting ""common sense"" laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
 
The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to possess a firearm, or whether it only protected possession of a firearms connected to service in a militia.
 
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was an individual right.
 
Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the Supreme Court ended up right where Obama was.
 
""Obama has said pretty consistently that he felt the Second Amendment provided an individual right to own a gun,"" he said.
 

McCain's case against Obama

 
But the McCain campaign said Obama has waffled, that he has supported the D.C. gun ban in the past. They provide three main pieces of evidence:
 
• The first is a 1996 voter questionnaire Obama completed while running for a seat in the Illinois Senate. The ""Independent Voters of Illinois"" asked if the candidate supported state legislation to ""ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns."" Obama's answer: ""Yes.""
 
The 1996 voter form surfaced again last year. The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who ""unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position."" The Web site Politico.com investigated and found that while Obama's campaign claimed Obama never saw or approved the responses in the questionnaire, the campaign at the time filed an amended version, which appeared to include Obama's own handwritten notes added to one answer (not the one on gun control).
 
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama's campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, ""He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn't change the fact that some answers didn't reflect his views.""
 
• The second alleged contradiction comes from a

Chicago Tribune

article on Nov. 20, 2007, in which the Obama campaign is quoted as saying Obama ""believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional.""
 
The statement, which came from an unnamed campaign aide, ""was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the senator's consistent position,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton told ABC News.
 
• Lastly, the McCain campaign notes that in a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008, Obama did not dispute a questioner's characterization of Obama's position as supporting the D.C. handgun ban.
 
Here's the text of the exchange:
 
Leon Harris of WJLA: ""One other issue that is of great importance to the people of the district here, is gun control. You said in Idaho here, recently, that ""I have no intention of taking away folks' guns."" But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you've said that it's constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?""
 
Obama responded, ""Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it's important for us to recognize that we've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people — law-abiding citizens use it for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families. We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage. And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying, we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets, we are going to trace more effectively how these guns are ending up on the streets, to unscrupulous gun dealers, who often times are selling to straw purchasers, and cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children, the mentally ill. ...We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respect the Second Amendment and people's traditions.""
 

A look at the votes

 
The National Rifle Association isn't buying Obama's ""election-year rhetoric"" in support of individuals' right to keep and bear arms.
 
The NRA says Obama's voting record — which they have consistently rated an ""F"" — suggests he would be ""a serious threat to Second Amendment liberties.""
 
Here's some of Obama's voting record:
 
As a state senator in Illinois in 2004, Obama voted against a measure to lower the minimum age to apply for a Firearm Owner's Identification Card from 21 to 18. That same year, an Illinois state senator proposed giving people who violate city gun bans the right to use self-defense as a legal argument if they were charged for violating a ban. Obama opposed the measure.
 
As a U.S. senator, Obama voted in July 2005 against a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA contended the bill was designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. McCain voted in favor of the prohibition, which passed 65-31.
 
Obama also voted for an amendment to expand the definition of prohibited, armor-piercing ammunition. The NRA claimed it would have banned much of the rifle ammunition commonly used for hunting. McCain voted against it and it failed.
 
Both Obama and McCain voted in favor of a requirement that manufacturers and importers of handguns provide child safety locks.
 
In 2006, both Obama and McCain voted for an amendment to prohibit the confiscation of a lawfully owned firearm during an emergency or major disaster.
 
According to Obama's campaign Web site, Obama supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent, ""as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets.""
 

On the fence

 
So here's what we have to support the claim of an Obama flip-flop: one answer to a questionnaire in 1996 that Obama claims was completed in error by a staffer; a quote attributed to a campaign aide in 2007, also later disavowed by Obama; and failing to dispute the characterization of his position in a campaign forum in February.
 
It's a bit too convenient for the Obama campaign to dismiss a record it doesn't like by claiming that twice in his career aides misstated his position on gun control. At the end of the day, voters simply have to decide if they believe Obama's explanation or they don't.
 
Finally, there's the question in the forum in which Obama's position was characterized as supporting the D.C. gun ban, and that it was constitutional.
 
Obama's answer seemed like an attempt to cling to his position atop the fence, repeating his belief that the Second Amendment affirms an individual's right to own a gun, but that local governments ought to be able to limit that right.
 
But what about D.C.'s outright ban of guns? Obama not only didn't correct Harris' characterization of support for the D.C. gun ban, his answer seemed to affirm that it was accurate. At the very least, if Harris was wrong, here was the perfect opportunity to set the record straight.
 
By and large, Obama's fence-sitting has been pretty consistent. Still, twice claiming an aide botched your position and failing to go on record even when directly asked about it gives the flip-flopping charge enough ammo to merit a Half True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Let Freedom Ring']","
His tone changed, but not his position
","A new TV ad from the conservative group Let Freedom Ring echoes a charge made by Sen. John McCain's campaign that Sen. Barack Obama has flip-flopped on withdrawing troops from Iraq.
 
The allegation is based on comments Obama made on July 3, 2008, when he discussed an upcoming trip to Iraq and what it would mean for his foreign policy.
 
""I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed,"" he said. ""And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies.""
 
The McCain campaign pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping.
 
""Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately,"" said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. ""Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground.""
 
Let Freedom Ring made the same point in its TV ad. We examined other claims from the ad in

this article.

Here, we'll examine the Iraq charge. (Much of the material below comes from

this previous item

that explored the McCain flip-flop charge.)
 
We examined Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was backtracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates.
 
We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war ""from the start""; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion (""as careful getting out as we were careless getting in""); and that the United States should not have permanent bases inside Iraq.
 
How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says the following: ""Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al-Qaida attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al-Qaida.""
 
The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the ""16 months"" statement as an indication that Obama favors a ""precipitous withdrawal,"" presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked

that claim earlier here

and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2008 statement from Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe.
 
""On Iraq, he has been very clear,"" Plouffe said in March 2008. ""He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops.""
 
Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a ""best-case scenario"" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Sen. Hillary Clinton a ""monster.""
 
But does this mean a 16-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that.
 
For example:
 
• At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H., on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. ""I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there,"" Obama said. ""I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out.""
 
• At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, ""As soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed.""
 
• At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, ""Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief.""

on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought ""a quick withdrawal"" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, ""Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal — one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years.""
 
Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of ""about 16 months"" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized ""16 months"" when speaking to antiwar audiences and ""

about

16 months"" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a ""precipitous"" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security.
 
The Plouffe statement, however, stands out. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a ""rock-solid commitment."" But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground.
 
After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another news conference the same day.
 
""I intend to end this war,"" Obama said. ""My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time.""
 
Weighing all these statements together, we find the McCain campaign and Let Freedom Ring are off-base in saying Obama has changed position. Obama repeatedly said facts on the ground could affect the tactical moves of an overall withdrawal. Obama's position was not an ironclad withdrawal timeline in the first place. We find the charge that Obama has reversed position to be False.

Something for the middle, more for the top
","With energy prices continuing to weigh on Americans' wallets and psyches, Sen. Barack Obama's campaign is stepping up efforts to portray Sen. John McCain as a politician more willing to help big oil companies than consumers.
 
Responding to a McCain television ad seeking to direct anger over rising gas prices at his opponent, the Obama campaign issued a point-by-point analysis that noted, among other things, that the five largest U.S. energy companies would profit handsomely under McCain's economic plan, which would reduce corporate tax rates and allow expensing for some investments.
 
""Sen. McCain's economic plan gives nearly $4-billion in tax breaks to the oil companies but doesn't provide any tax relief to more than 100-million middle-class families,"" Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said July 18, 2008.
 
Though that makes a handy sound bite, Obama's campaign is conveniently picking from among the corporations that would benefit from McCain's plan, while ignoring some of his tax proposals directed at individuals.
 
Obama's campaign derives the ""nearly $4-billion"" figure from an analysis of McCain's plan by the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank headed by John D. Podesta, former President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. We examined that one previously and found that while the nearly $4-billion claim was right, Obama's overall point was

Barely True.

 
In fact, McCain's plan would lower the tax rate on all corporations, not just big oil companies. By focusing on how the proposed tax cut would help a handful of energy giants, Obama's camp makes the plan look like a special-interest package exclusively tailored to the largest energy producers.
 
Obama's campaign also distorts the McCain plan's effect on individuals. Though independent analyses of the income tax provisions have generally concluded McCain's plan would most benefit wealthy Americans, it has provisions that would help individuals with lower household incomes.
 
Chief among these is a proposed increase to the exemption taxpayers may claim for each dependent — currently $3,500 — by $500 each year beginning in 2010 until it would reach $7,000 in 2016, after which it would be indexed for inflation. Under the McCain plan, married couples that file a joint return reporting adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less would be eligible for the $7,000 exemption immediately. So clearly, middle- and lower-income households with children would receive above-average tax cuts.
 
McCain also would raise and index for inflation the threshold for the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a separate income tax that was intended to ensure that people did not use loopholes to avoid paying taxes but that has been ensnaring more and more middle-income Americans. Congress in recent years has extended the AMT exemption for a year or two at a time so that so large numbers of taxpayers don't become subject to the tax.
 
Congress is almost certain to enact another temporary ""patch"" covering the 2008 tax year. But McCain would permanently extend the AMT exemption, index it for inflation and allow individuals to claim personal nonrefundable credits against the AMT. How much this would help middle-class families largely depends on how you define middle class. The Tax Policy Center says it would primarily benefit more affluent households in the 80th to 95th percentile of income — those earning between $111,645 and $226,918 in 2008 dollars, were McCain's plan to be fully phased in next year. Still, households with more modest means would not be subjected to the AMT under McCain's proposal.
 
McCain would also extend President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, currently set to expire at the end of 2010. Those cuts collectively reduced top marginal tax rates on individuals' incomes, cut the rates on capital gains and dividends, expanded the child tax credit and reduced taxes on married couples compared to singles.
 
The Tax Policy Center says McCain's policy proposals collectively would reduce the tax exposure of 60 percent of all American households, though fewer than half of those making between $18,981 and $37,595. The analysis backs up Obama's broad contention that McCain's tax policy is weighted to give the largest benefit to higher-income taxpayers. However, it's wrong to say McCain's plan would provide no relief to middle-class Americans. Its more generous exemption for dependents and lower tax rates would cut across income levels and reduce or eliminate many taxpayers' AMT exposure. For this reason, we rule the Obama campaign's statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'John McCain']","
You didn't actually have to live that long
","Yes, it's a joke.
 
But it's a favorite of Sen. John McCain's on the stump, and it includes a couple of serious claims worth checking.
 
A recent iteration of the gag came during a McCain speech at the Maine Military Museum & Learning Center in South Portland, Maine, after a reference to how the French approach nuclear power.
 
""And by the way, in case you missed it, we now have a pro-American president in France,"" McCain said July 21, 2008. ""Which shows if you live long enough, anything can happen in this world. So — and we're grateful to him.""
 
It's a self-deprecating poke by McCain at his own age. But it's also a jab at France, and it rests on the twin assumptions that the country's new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is pro-American, and that it is new or unusual for the president of France to feel that way.
 
We know where McCain's coming from.
 
There has long been in France, especially in the intellectual class, a resistance to American culture. They like their

boulangeries,

or bakeries, a lot more than the McDonald's we're exporting to them, for example.
 
Sarkozy is different, in some respects.
 
""He likes American culture more than any other former president of France,"" said Jean-Philippe Mathy, French studies professor at the University of Illinois and author of

French Resistance: The French-American Culture Wars.

""He's taking a lot of flak because he's kind of

nouveau riche

and he likes to wear expensive watches and things like that.""
 
He's got a little Hollywood in him. Just check out

his wife

.
 
Sarkozy's open admiration for America has earned him the nickname ""Sarko l'Amricain.""
 
That said, he's not quite as pro-American as McCain implies, nor are past French presidents as anti-American.
 
Sarkozy is an ardent proponent of U.S.-style free-market capitalism — a philosophy that in Europe is called ""liberalism"" but resembles what we call conservatism. He is intent on dismantling portions of France's prodigious welfare state and social security system.
 
But with respect to the most notable policy difference between France and the United States in recent years — the split over the decision to invade Iraq — Sarkozy is only somewhat different from his predecessor, Jacques Chirac.
 
Chirac opposed the invasion before it took place, and in November 2004 said it had ""made the world more dangerous."" Sarkozy has accused Chirac of being ""arrogant"" for the manner in which he voiced his opposition, but Sarkozy did not support the war either, and has let it be known that he too would have declined to send troops to Iraq.
 
In a speech at Columbia University in 2004, Sarkozy said France's opposition stemmed from its violent colonial history in Algeria and Vietnam.
 
""Please don't be angry with us because we remember what happened to us,"" he said. ""Is there ever a single country of the world, at any time of history, that was able to maintain itself in a sustained way in a country that was not its own, uniquely by force of arms? Never, not a single one, even the Chinese.""
 
That follows in a long tradition of French presidents who, while maintaining a close alliance with the United States, have resisted certain aspects of our foreign policy to varying degrees.
 
Franois Mitterrand, a socialist who was president of France from 1981 to 1995, leaned toward the hostile end of that spectrum. On the other hand, his predecessor, Valry Giscard d'Estaing, a probusiness, center-right politician who was president from 1974 to 1981, was widely regarded as very friendly to the United States, experts said.
 
Charles de Gaulle, president from 1959 to 1969, was famously resistant to American influence, and is probably the main source of the stereotype to which McCain was referring, according to Edward Berenson, director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University. He pulled France's troops out of NATO's command structure to signal independence from Washington in 1966, though ultimately he leaned sharply away from the Soviet Union and toward the United States in the Cold War.
 
So yes, a strain of anti-Americanism runs through French foreign policy and culture, flaring up at times and mellowing out at others. But French presidents have long been pro-American in the most important sense, maintaining their alliance with the United States. And if it's France's objection to the invasion of Iraq that McCain's audience is concerned about, he's misleading them to suggest Sarkozy is very different. But Sarko is Amricain in some respects, so we find McCain's claim to be Half True.

"['National', 'Military', 'Republican National Committee']","
RNC goes cherry-picking
","On the heels of a McCain ad attacking Barack Obama for his 2007 vote against war funding, the Republican National Committee has ratcheted up the rhetoric with a

radio ad

that claims Obama voted against helicopers, ammunition and even body armor.
 
""When it came time to act, he voted against critical resources,"" the announcer says about Obama. ""No to individual body armor, no to helicopters, no to ammunition, no to aircraft. The bill Obama opposed even had funding for veterans' medical facilities and rehabilitation programs. And why did he say no? Obama chose Washington politics over the needs of our military.""
 
A casual listener might not notice that the ad's evidence is a single vote — a May 2007 appropriations bill.
 
It's true that Obama voted against that bill, which raises two questions. Did the bill contain the items mentioned in the ad? And were those really what Obama was voting against?
 
On the first question, yes,

the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007

, which Obama voted against, included provisions for purchasing body armor, helicopters, ammunition and aircraft, and for funding veterans' medical facilities and rehabilitation programs.
 
But no, those items are not the reason Obama voted against the bill. As he took pains to explain at the time, he voted against it because it did not include a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq.
 
Congress' power of the purse is a crucial tool of leverage for influencing the president's foreign policy, and with this protest vote, Obama and 13 other Democratic senators sought to push President Bush to draw down troop levels in Iraq.
 
''This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war,'' Obama said at the time. ''Gov. (Mitt) Romney and Sen. McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not.''
 
Implying Obama's vote was specifically against aircraft, veterans' facilities and the like is misleading — about as misleading as it would be to say McCain voted

for

the bill because it funded tornado aid in Kansas and bereavement payments to relatives of deceased congressmen, to name two of the many items in the bill not related to the war.
 
In some ways this ad illustrates the common wisdom that senators don't make good candidates for president, because senators often vote on controversial issues, and any one vote can be pulled out of context. For example, the Obama campaign, in responding to recent attacks, pointed to a 2005 vote to increase funding for armored vehicles. Obama voted to increase funding; McCain voted against it. The vote failed, largely along party lines.
 
The claim in the RNC ad is technically true, but it leaves out important context that it was a single vote, and it distorts Obama's record by making him sound like he advocates cutting off funds for troops in the field.
On several other occasions, Obama has voted in favor of funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier this year, Obama voted for a funding bill that passed 92-6. McCain was absent.
 
In 2006, Obama voted for a war supplemental that passed 77-21. McCain opposed that bill, joining a group of Republicans who felt the legislation contained extraneous and unnecessary spending. In a news report, the

Los Angles Times

noted the Republicans ""risked being labeled as voting against the troops to take a stand against what they considered excessive spending.""
 
Although the ad bases its claims on a kernel of truth — Obama did vote against the 2007 bill — the RNC gives the impression that Obama opposes body armor, helicopters, ammunition and aircraft generally. The RNC ad is misleading enough to merit a label of Barely True.

Ground conditions have changed, too
","Sen. John McCain has praised the surge in Iraq for bringing greater stability to the region, and has reminded voters that he long supported it. But while Iraq was stabilizing, the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating.
 
So on July 15, 2008, the McCain campaign released ""a new comprehensive strategy for victory in Afghanistan"" that applies ""the tried and true principles of counterinsurgency used in the Iraq surge.""
 
His new policy includes sending at least three additional brigades to Afghanistan. ""Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available,"" states the campaign's strategy outline.
 
Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pounced on this news. By the end of the week, spokesman Bill Burton had sent out a memo titled, ""Obama leading on foreign policy, McCain following.""
 
""This past week, Senator McCain changed his position for political reasons, embracing Obama's call for more troops the day after Obama restated it in a

New York Times

op-ed, and almost one year after Obama's initial plan,"" Burton wrote.
 
We reviewed the candidates' past statements to determine whether McCain has changed position to match Obama.
 
Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.
 
The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. ""If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will,"" Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings

here

,

here

and

here.

)
 
But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan.
 
""Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve,"" Obama said. ""As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban.""
 
In the months that followed, Obama repeatedly emphasized his assertion that the United States ""had taken our eye off the ball"" by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan.
 
McCain, meanwhile, has rebutted Obama by saying that Iraq is and should be the central front on the war on terror. We couldn't find examples of McCain specifically rejecting Obama's proposal to send more troops to Afghanistan. Neither could we find examples of him supporting more brigades in Afghanistan, which likely would raise logistical questions about whether there were enough troops for a surge in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, when it came to Afghanistan, McCain emphasized the need for NATO countries to do their part, and for the United States and NATO forces to better manage troop levels and logistics.
 
As recently as July 8, 2008, McCain emphasized these points. During an interview with the

Pittsburgh Tribune Review,

McCain talked at length about NATO, saying only that it was possible the United States might have to add more troops, but not specifically endorsing that position. Here's the exchange:
 
Question: ""Senator, you had called the situation in Afghanistan tough and you said that any failure there could lead — could have dire consequences for the NATO alliance. Beyond Pakistan, what do you think it takes for the U.S. to succeed there? Is more troops the answer?""
 
McCain: ""I think there is a whole lot of challenges that we face. One of them is whether we succeed or not in Iraq. I think that has a direct impact on the region. But I also believe that the Karzai government being more effective, the Pakistan situation as you and I discussed, the economic progress, again this is one of these situations where you've got to maintain the security environment, but then you've got to have the progress where people will have a better life to look forward to. And one of the failures, because of corruption, has been that we haven't made the progress economically in some of these parts of Iraq and we had this window of opportunity and it wasn't as well used as perhaps it could have. But again, I can't tell you that there's one solution to it with the struggle military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, it's all of one and yet it has various aspects. And I just finally would say, and I'm sorry for some wrong answers, but we are in this with other nations. That's important. And I'm glad that Sarkozy is sending additional French troops over there. I'm glad that many of our allies, I wish more of them and I wish the rules of engagement for some of them were better and a lot of things. But the fact is this is a — this is a lot of nations that are in this in a common interest.""
 
Question: ""Do you think more troops should — do you think — some of the military have called for more additional troops ...""
 
McCain: ""I think yes, and I'd love to see our allies to contribute more in a broad variety of ways. I'd love to see that. And we may have to send additional troops. As you know, they just extended the Marine unit there by an additional 30 days. And I think they had — they did that very reluctantly.""
 
A week later, McCain would specifically advocate sending three more brigades to Afghanistan.
 
One point McCain has made again and again on the campaign trail is that, when it comes to foreign policy, he bases his opinions on ""conditions on the ground."" His new policy on Afghanistan can fairly be interpreted as a reaction to those conditions, which have demonstrably worsened in the weeks before his announcement. The Obama campaign has said that McCain has changed position on Afghanistan for political reasons, to follow Obama. We are not ruling on McCain's motivation here; the McCain campaign can just as easily argue that McCain has changed position because circumstances have changed. From a political standpoint, it's certainly inconvenient when ""conditions on the ground"" dictate you dropping your position for your opponent's.
 
Be all that as it may, Obama advocated more troops for Afghanistan about a year ago. McCain only recently embraced the same position. We rule this claim is True.

""For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three,"" he said.
 
We consulted the record to see if Obama had urged more troops for Afghanistan that long.

True on the day the ad was released

about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at the statement that Obama ""hasn't been to Iraq in years.""

McCain cites one protest vote
","An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops.
 
""Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan,"" an announcer states. ""He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working.""
 

See our story for details

about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at Obama's votes on troop funding.
 
The McCain campaign supported its claim that Obama voted against troop funding by citing a May 2007 Senate vote. The campaign is correct that Obama voted against a bill to fund troops, which passed anyway.
 
Obama's vote came after Democrats had sought unsuccessfully to attach a timetable for withdrawing troops. After that language was removed, Obama and several other senators decided to vote against the measure, saying they could not rubber-stamp an open-ended occupation. (See our

previous coverage of this issue

.)
 
""This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war,"" Obama said at the time. ""Gov. (Mitt) Romney and Sen. McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not.""
 
The vote came when the primary contest for both the Democratic and Republican nominations was wide open, seven months before the first primaries. Obama and fellow candidates Chris Dodd and Hillary Clinton voted against the bill; Republicans at the time said the vote showed the three failed to support the troops.
 
Clinton, then the Democratic front-runner, was asked whether the vote would prove troubling later, an idea she dismissed.
 
In 2008, Obama voted for a troop funding bill that passed overwhelmingly, 92-6. McCain was absent.
 
Obama's campaign responded to the attack by pointing to Obama's support for bills that would increase benefits to veterans. McCain opposed the bills because he believed the new benefits would encourage active military to

leave the service prematurely.

 
The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted against the 2007 funding measure. But the ad's statement — ""he voted against funding our troops"" — is phrased with no qualifications or caveats. Actually, Obama has voted for troop funding several times in other measures. So we find the claim in the McCain ad to be Half True.

The campaign trail leaves little time for hearings
","An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops.
 
""Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan,"" an announcer states. ""He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working.""
 

See our story for details

about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at the statement on hearings about Afghanistan.
 
The basis for McCain's attack here is that Obama serves on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and chairs the subcommittee on Europe. You might ask why the subcommittee on Europe should hold hearings on Afghanistan, which is in Central Asia. But we're familiar with this claim because Sen. Hillary Clinton made the same argument during a Democratic debate on Feb. 26, 2008.
 
Obama ""chairs the Subcommittee on Europe,"" Clinton said during the debate. ""It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan.""
 
Obama responded then: ""Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.""
 
Back then, we talked to a spokesman for Sen. Richard Lugar, who served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. Lugar's spokesman said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee. See

our full item

here.
 
The committee is now chaired by Democratic Sen. Joe Biden, who has also said such hearings should happen before the full committee. And Sen. John Kerry has said that if it were to happen at the subcommittee level, it should go to his subcommittee on Near East and South and Central Asian Affairs.
 
About a month after the debate exchange between Clinton and Obama, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened for an afternoon hearing with testimony on Iraq from Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus, which Obama attended. That morning, though, Obama chaired a full committee hearing on nominations for ambassadors to Europe, including Kurt Volker to be the U.S. permanent representative on the Council of NATO. During the hearing, Obama talked in some depth about NATO and Afghanistan.
 
""Afghanistan, NATO's first major mission beyond the borders of Europe, has been overlooked and undermanned by many members of the alliance, including the United States,"" Obama said. ""Success in Afghanistan, I believe, is critical to American national security and to the security of the entire world, and a failure there would not only endanger our nation and global stability, it would cast serious doubt on the ability of NATO's military and political architecture to uphold our security in the 21st century.""
 
When Clinton laid out her argument for why Obama should have held hearings, we found that she had her facts straight and gave her a True rating. McCain's ad, though, doesn't make the detailed case that Clinton did as to why Obama should have held hearings on Afghanistan in the first place. And in the months since Clinton made her claim, Obama did chair a meeting of the Foreign Relations committee in which Afghanistan was discussed at some length (though it arguably was not the primary reason for the meeting; the ambassadorships were).
 
Taking all of this together, we find we have to lay out a number of explanations for McCain's statement on hearings, but in essence, he's right. Obama did not hold hearings that dealt directly with Afghanistan. We rate McCain's statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'John McCain']","
Sure, and blame Obama for bad tomatoes, too
","A new television ad by Sen. John McCain's campaign seeks to exploit anger over gas prices by directing it toward his opponent.
 
""Gas prices: four dollars, five dollars, no end in sight,"" says the narrator in the

advertisement

, which the McCain campaign released July 21, 2008. ""Because some in Washington are still saying no to drilling in America.""
 
Oil drilling goes on all the time in America. What Sen. Barack Obama and others oppose is certain new drilling off the coasts. But let's leave that aside.
 
Some in Washington, the ad continues, say ""no to independence from foreign oil."" Almost no one opposes the notion of independence from foreign oil. The dispute is over how to get there. But let's leave that aside as well.
 
The ad culminates with this question: ""Who can you thank for rising prices at the pump?"" Then we hear a chant familiar to anyone who has watched a fevered Obama rally: ""O-ba-ma! O-ba-ma! O-ba-ma!""
So the central claim of the ad, and the one we decided to check, is that Obama is to blame for rising gas prices.
 
In its news release announcing the ad, the McCain campaign cited everything from Obama's criticism of McCain's electric car contest to Obama's reservations about nuclear power. But in our view those things don't sufficiently back up McCain's sweeping contention that the junior senator from Illinois is to blame for rising gas prices.
 
The main implication of the ad is that the ban on some offshore drilling — a ban that McCain has long opposed,

more explicitly lately

than in the past — has contributed to rising prices, and since Obama supports it, it is fair to blame him for it.
 
The last part is highly dubious. Obama has only been in the U.S. Senate since 2005, and the congressional moratorium prohibiting oil and gas leasing on most of the outer continental shelf dates to 1982.
 
Granted, Congress has renewed it every year since. But there was also a presidential order banning oil exploration off the coasts from 1990, when the first President Bush issued it, until July 14, 2008, when his son lifted it.
 
So even if the ban on offshore drilling contributed to ""rising prices at the pump,"" it would have done so regardless of how Obama felt about it, at least until the very recent past.
 
Now, has the ban in fact contributed to rising prices at the pump? Probably so, though it's impossible to say how much.
 
Currently, drilling is allowed in about 15 percent of federally controlled waters, and those areas are the source of more than one-quarter of the oil produced in the United States, according to Ron Planting, an economist at the American Petroleum Institute. Domestic production accounts for about a quarter of the oil the country consumes, Planting said.
 
It is not likely that all the other offshore areas currently off limits would be as productive as the Gulf of Mexico, where most of today's offshore drilling takes place, Planting said.
 
""The only thing we can say is directional,"" Planting said. ""We'd have more supply (if the moratorium hadn't been in place)] and historically more supply has downward pressure on prices.""
 
But that's really a peripheral issue. Regardless of how the moratorium has affected prices over the years, Obama has not been a key force behind it until very recently.
 
True, he vows to be just that in the future. But how lifting the moratorium would affect future prices is a separate question, (and a tricky one, as we explain

here

).
 
What the ad pins on Obama — and others who are ""saying no to (new offshore) drilling in America"" — are the price increases the country is currently enduring. That saddles the Illinois senator with a lot more influence than he has had. If one were to line up all the leaders in Washington who share some responsibility for the offshore drilling moratorium — the first President Bush, the Republican leadership of Congress, the Democratic leadership of Congress, the Florida delegation — there would be quite a few people ahead of Obama. We find McCain's claim to be False.

Senator, did you check all those State of the Union addresses? We did
","Sen. Barack Obama called on the nation to ""end the tyranny of oil"" in a July 11, 2008, speech on energy security. He said it's an issue we've been talking about for decades.
 
""We have heard promises about energy independence from every single U.S. president since Richard Nixon,"" Obama said in Dayton, Ohio. ""We've heard talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels in nearly every State of the Union address since the oil embargo of 1973.""
 
The first part sounded true enough — what president hasn't waxed poetic about liberating us from foreign oil? But the latter line about fossil fuels struck us as the sort of thing speechwriters might throw in without fact-checking, on the assumption that no one else would be crazy enough to do so.
 
They didn't count on PolitiFact. We scoured the past 35 State of the Union speeches for ""talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels."" It was about as fun as a root canal. But it prompted us to put together

this quiz

showcasing presidents' State of the Union chestnuts. And it enabled us to tell you this about Obama's claim:
 
It's true that the oil embargo of 1973 — when Arab countries cut oil exports to punish the West for supporting Israel in the Arab-Israeli war — prompted serious concern among U.S. leaders about our reliance on oil.
 
Richard Nixon kicked off his 1974 State of the Union speech by commenting on how it was the first of its kind to feature energy as the No. 1 priority. He went on to say that even if the embargo is lifted, ""conservation will continue to be necessary."" And private enterprise will ""develop the new resources, the new technology, the new capacity America will require for its energy needs in the 1980s.""
 
In our view, that constitutes ""talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels."" (Fossil fuels are fuels like coal, oil and natural gas that come from the fossilized remains of plants and animals).
 
Gerald Ford picked up the thread, calling in 1975 for more synthetic fuels, home insulation, efficient cars and the like. And in 1976 he advocated ""technology to capture energy from the sun and the Earth.""
 
Jimmy Carter was an avid conservationist, and talked at length about the subject during his State of the Union speeches, such as in 1981 when he endorsed technology such as ""photovoltaics, which generate energy directly from the sun.""
 
Ronald Reagan? Not so much. His first three State of the Union speeches had only glancing references to the environment, and his last four had nothing even remotely related to curbing fossil-fuel use.
 
President George H.W. Bush had just one reference to new energy sources in his State of the Union addresses, and Bill Clinton omitted the subject from his in 1994 and 1995.
 
Since then, every State of the Union has included talk of new ways to power our cars and homes, culminating in the President George W. Bush's call this year to trust American researchers and entrepreneurs to ""pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology.""
 
The bottom line: 23 of the 35 State of the Union speeches since the Arab oil embargo contained endorsements of the idea of curbing the country's use of fossil fuels. (That's being generous, and including, for example, Clinton's endorsement in 1993 of an energy tax because it ""promotes energy efficiency."")
 
The 12 State of the Union addresses in '82, '83, '84, '85, '86, '87, '88, '89, '90, '92, '94 and '95 — though some had references to air pollution — could not reasonably be considered to contain any ""talk about curbing our use of fossil fuels.""
 
We should note that the first part of Obama's quote — that every president has made promises about energy independence — was startlingly accurate. State of the Union speeches were rife with lines like this one, from Richard Nixon, in 1974:
 
""Let this be our national goal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need.""
 
But what we are evaluating is Obama's claim that ""nearly every"" State of the Union speech since 1973 included talk about curbing fossil fuels. And the fact is, about two-thirds of the speeches in question contained a reference. And that is substantial, but not ""nearly every.""
 
We rule Obama's claim Mostly True.

Paid sick leave policies came to Maryland, D.C. before Austin
","Dallas became the third Texas city to require employers to provide paid sick leave for all employees, after its City Council approved an ordinance slated to go into effect in August. Whether the ordinance will actually be implemented is a different story. State lawmakers in Austin are considering legislation that would kill local mandates like this one and similar policies in Austin and San Antonio. Regardless, Austin City Council Member Greg Casar, the architect of Austin’s policy, celebrated the Dallas news in a tweet. ""Dallas passes paid sick days!!!"" he wrote. ""About 1 year ago, no cities in the South had guaranteed paid sick days. Now, three of Texas’ biggest cities have passed it."" Casar is right, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin have all passed sick leave policies. But is it true that no cities in the South had guaranteed paid sick days a year ago? Definitions of the South vary Braden Latham-Jones, a spokesman for Casar, said the information came from lists maintained by organizations that advocate for paid sick leave policies that show policies in different areas and when they were adopted. He said the information supports Casar’s claim that roughly one year ago, no cities in the ""American South"" had adopted policies guaranteeing paid sick leave for employees. Looking through the source material Latham-Jones provided, there is no question that when Austin adopted a sick leave policy in early 2018, it was among just a handful of states and cities with such requirements in place. But it turns out that the truthfulness of Casar’s claim depends on which states are considered part of the South. Regional divisions maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau show that 16 states and the District of Columbia are considered part of the South: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. This definition stems from before the Civil War, when the Mason-Dixon Line divided slave states from free states and helped establish a clear boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland, with Pennsylvania sitting north of the line and Maryland to the south. But today there are different opinions about which states are in the South, particularly when it comes to Maryland, Delaware and Washington, D.C., which are often classified as being part of the Mid-Atlantic (which the Census Bureau says includes just Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York). Public opinion polls released by FiveThirtyEight and Vox showed that few respondents consider Maryland and Washington D.C. to be in the South. Kelly Kay, an assistant professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the regional divisions outlined by the Census Bureau don’t speak to the culture of an area and are likely based more on population counts. ""They’re the crudest divider,"" she said. ""Regions are not so clear cut and different entities see different distinctions. As a geographer, my expertise is trying to parse the difference between formal boundaries and the way people perceive themselves. Maryland and D.C. are the sort of places that are always disputed."" Why is it worth squabbling over whether these areas are part of the South? Both areas adopted paid sick leave policies before Austin did in early 2018. Advocacy groups side with Casar In 2008, Washington, D.C., became the second city in the country to adopt such a policy, after San Francisco. Montgomery County in Maryland required employers to give workers paid sick leave before the state adopted a policy of its own in January 2018, overriding the governor’s veto to become the ninth state with a paid sick leave law. But it wasn’t until Austin’s policy was adopted in February 2018, that organizations advocating for paid sick leave policies celebrated what they called the first paid sick leave ordinance to be adopted in South. No other areas included in the Census Bureau description of the South have local governments that have adopted guaranteed paid sick leave policies. ""We did not describe D.C. as a Southern city when the District passed its paid sick days law,"" said Alexandra Nseir, spokeswoman for the National Partnership for Women and Families, in an email. ""We didn't compare Maryland and Austin since they are different types of jurisdictions, but we did not describe Maryland as the first state in the South to adopt paid sick days."" Ellen Bravo, executive director of Family Values at Work, said she agreed with Casar’s characterization and said when Austin adopted its paid sick leave policy it represented a unique political victory. ""Few people saw a state like Texas as a place that would be a pacesetter in a policy like this,"" Bravo said, adding that Maryland is seen as ""more of a blue state"" and lawmakers there have adopted other policies that ""have been more difficult to move in Southern states."" Our rating Casar said one year ago, ""no cities in the South had guaranteed paid sick days."" Maryland, a Maryland county and Washington, D.C., adopted policies requiring employers to offer paid sick leave to employees before Austin did. Advocates agreed with Casar, saying they don’t consider Maryland and Washington, D.C., to be situated in the South. The Census Bureau, however, classifies them both as in the South. Given that opinions vary so greatly about which areas are in the South, we looked to the Census Bureau’s divisions in evaluating the truthfulness of this claim. Those boundaries may not account for cultural or political regionality, but they are the most formal regional descriptions that exist. We rate this claim False.","[('Support Paid Sick Days, Current Sick Days Laws (as of June 2018), accessed April 26, 2019', 'http://www.paidsickdays.org/research-resources/current-sick-days-laws.html'), ('Email interview with Braden Latham-Jones, spokesman for Casar, April 29, 2019', 'No link'), ('Family Values at Work, Paid Sick Leave Wins, accessed April 29, 2019', 'http://familyvaluesatwork.org/graphics/fvaw-psd-wins.pdf'), ('A Better Balance, Overview of Paid Sick Time Laws in the United States, Oct. 26, 2018', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, Census Regions and Divisions of the United States, accessed April 29, 2019', 'http://familyvaluesatwork.org/graphics/fvaw-psd-wins.pdf'), ('FiveThirtyEight, Which States Are in the South?, April 30, 2014', 'No link'), ('Vox, Which states count as the South, according to more than 40,000 readers, Sept. 30, 2016', 'https://www.abetterbalance.org/paid-sick-time-laws/?export'), ('National Geographic, United States Regions, accessed April 30, 2019', 'No link'), ('U.

NC education leader tweets doctored rally photo
","The size of a recent teachers rally is in question, and one of the organizers recently tweeted a photo that’s in dispute. The North Carolina Association of Educators on Wednesday marched through downtown Raleigh to advocate for teachers and students. It was the event’s second year. NCAE President Mark Jewell said he thought the crowd was bigger than last year. On Wednesday afternoon, Jewell tweeted his appreciation of advocates who attended the rally. ""Thank you North Carolina. You showed up in mass to insist that the state fund our public school legislative priorities,"" Jewell tweeted, along with two images. The image on the left depicts a mighty crowd on Halifax Mall, the grassy field behind the legislature where ralliers congregated after marching through downtown Raleigh. Hardly any grass can be seen in the sea of red shirts — which was a red flag. On Twitter, Jewell faced almost immediate pushback from some who alleged that the photo was altered. Earlier Wednesday, similar photos were posted (since deleted) on unverified Twitter accounts Organizing Action NC and the Student North Carolina Association of Educators at NC State University. A similar photo — perhaps the same photo — was also posted on the Facebook page for Red 4 Ed NC, a nonprofit group that advocates for educators. The photos were later removed. Given the pushback to Jewell’s photo and how much it was shared on social media, PolitiFact wondered if it was authentic. We reached out to Jewell by email but didn’t immediately get a response. Our review found it shows clear signs of manipulation. Jewell deleted the post Thursday afternoon. ""There was a rally photo circulating yesterday of Halifax Mall that is believed to have been photo shopped according to media reports. I have since removed it from my sites,"" he tweeted. Taken from a legislator The photo appears to have been snapped from the roof of the legislative building. The spot was popular for ralliers, journalists and politicians. News & Observer reporter Dawn Vaughan tweeted video footage of the Halifax mall gathering. Reporter Leigh Tauss took photos of the Halifax mall for a story in Indyweek. Jeff Tiberii, a reporter for WUNC, tweeted similar photos and on Thursday tweeted his concern for altered images circulating on social media. But the photos shared by Jewell and the Red 4 Ed Facebook page show less green space and more people than the photos shared by reporters on the scene — and were likely altered versions of a photo taken and tweeted by NC Rep. Grier Martin. The image shared by Jewell and the photo shared by Martin show ralliers in the same positions. Comparing photos Turn your attention to the white tent. On the left side, a person wearing a red shirt and jean shorts is walking in the same position in both pictures. Near the pole on the right side of the tent, a person in a green shirt, white hat and khaki shorts is also positioned exactly the same in both photos. There are other examples where people are in identical positions, but let’s look now at how Jewell’s image was doctored. Sections of the photo were copied and then duplicated to make the crowd seem larger than it was. At the bottom-right side of the screen, there’s a person in a white shirt and a person in a blue shirt that appear twice in the photo. In the center of the crowd, signs in the same exact size, color and position appear more than once. Christiaan Triebert, a journalist on the visual investigations team at The New York Times, noticed the same similarities as PolitiFact. He said it appears ""that the crowd size was increased using the clone tool in Photoshop."" It’s unclear who doctored it. Martin told PolitiFact that he took the photo at 11:46 a.m. Wednesday and, apart from sharing it on Twitter, didn’t share it with anyone. ""I had no contact from anyone about my photo,"" Martin said in an email. Our ruling Jewell tweeted a photo that showed a sea of red education advocates covering most of the Halifax Mall, located behind the legislature. There was a crowd. However, the photo was altered to make the crowd look larger than it was in reality. We rate the statement False.

Foxconn chairman Terry Gou says extreme weather suspended work last year
","The will they-won’t they Foxconn saga is leading another news cycle, with company Chairman Terry Gou in the United States to meet with President Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, among others. We learned in late April 2019 that the Taiwanese tech giant wanted changes to its $3 billion contract with the state to better reflect the evolving project. The original agreement with the state called for Foxconn Technology Group to build a $10 billion manufacturing and research complex and employ up to 13,000 people across Wisconsin. In return they could get up to $4 billion in state and local government incentives. After meeting with Trump on May 1, 2019, Gou told reporters that Foxconn’s plans in Wisconsin remain unchanged. ""It is not right to say our investment in Wisconsin has changed,"" Gou told Taiwan media, according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review. ""We suspended the work around October, November last year because the weather there was snowy and icy cold. We will continue our work in May when the weather gets warmer."" In some ways, that echoed a statement Foxconn provided to the Wall Street Journal on April 29, 2019, in which the company reiterated its job commitments and referenced the preceding winter. ""After the winter break, which has an impact on construction projects of this scale, we are now looking forward to beginning the next phases of construction on the Gen6 advanced manufacturing facility by Summer 2019 with production expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2020,"" the company said. Construction crews aren’t exactly shocked to experience cold weather in Wisconsin during those months. So was the weather really bad enough, as Gou claimed, to cause a two-month shutdown? We checked it out. The weather Gou’s claim about snow and cold weather doesn’t really fit with weather data maintained by the National Weather Service. The Foxconn complex is in the Racine County village of Mount Pleasant. Records for Racine show it did not snow in October. The average daily temperature was 41.1 degrees for the month, slightly below the norm of 44 degrees. But not exactly ""icy."" In November, it did snow on six days. The snow depth never exceeded 2 inches, but, the total November snowfall of 6.7 inches was well above the historic norm of 1.6 inches. The temperature in November averaged 27.5 degrees, compared to a norm of 33.1 degrees. ""We were actually kind of fortunate throughout October, November, December and even January,"" said Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council. ""It was pretty favorable to get some things done."" The work The suspended work Gou is referencing isn’t really clear, and Foxconn officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for detail on what was shut down and when. But work was clearly happening both months. The company gave reporters a tour of the work site on Oct. 4, 2018, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the scene as ""hundreds of workers on site, a dump truck coming or going every 12 seconds in the middle of the day and a 2- to 3-foot-thick base of aggregate being laid to support a complex of buildings more than a third of a mile long."" The Journal Sentinel was at the work site Oct. 22, 2018 and shot video of work going on beneath sunny skies. The ""Wisconn Valley News"" update published by the state on Oct. 26, 2018 said the site was averaging 128 workers and 100 dump trucks a day as crews prepared two large building pads and finalized the first building on the site. Another ""Wisconn Valley News"" update on Nov. 23, 2018 said about 100 trucks per day were bringing aggregate to the Foxconn site. Our ruling In defending Foxconn’s plans after a White House meeting, Gou claimed the company had suspended work in October and November 2018 because of the ""snowy and icy cold."" Foxconn hasn’t provided detail on what Gou is referring to, but there was clearly work going on at the site throughout that timeframe. And the weather data from those months isn’t consistent with an extreme snowstorm or cold snap that would have caused a multi-month shutdown of a large-scale construction project. We rate Gou’s claim False.","[(""Nikkei Asian Review, Foxconn's Terry Gou assures Trump that Wisconsin plant is on track, May 2, 2018"", 'https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Foxconn-s-Terry-Gou-assures-Trump-that-Wisconsin-plant-is-on-track'), ('Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, ""Wisconn Valley News,"" Oct. 26, 2018', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, ""Wisconn Valley News,"" Nov. 23, 2018', 'https://wisconnvalley.wi.gov/Pages/WisconnVN-Oct262018.aspx'), ('National Weather Service, records for Racine, WI, October and November, 2018', 'No link'), ('YouTube.com, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Fresh drone video of the Foxconn construction site, Oct. 22, 2018', 'https://wisconnvalley.wi.gov/Pages/WisconnVN-Nov232018.aspx'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Up-close view of Foxconn site shows massive project coming into focus, Oct. 4, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Foxconn Technology Group, May 2, 2019', 'https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=mkx'), ('Interview with Mike Fabishak, CEO of the Associated General Contractors of Greater Milwaukee, May 2, 2019', 'No link'), ('Interview with\xa0Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council, May 2, 2019', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpmSoF8rpNQ')]",/factchecks/2019/may/02/terry-gou/foxconn-chairman-terry-gou-says-extreme-weather-su/

Are a quarter of vehicles on Missouri highways defective?
","Missouri is one of 15 states that requires mandatory inspections for non-commercial vehicles. The state requires that vehicles more than 5 years old receive an inspection to renew a vehicle license every two years. With the introduction of House Bill 451, this could all change. The bill seeks to repeal the requirement that all motor vehicles more than 5 years old must obtain an inspection before the vehicle may be licensed. The bill would require inspections for vehicles at least 10 years old or more with 150,000 miles. Rep. Dave Muntzel, R-Booneville, spoke out against the bill on the Missouri House floor. Muntzel said that ""a fourth of vehicles on our (Missouri’s) highways are defective."" He continued, ""So now we’re wanting to take vehicle inspections away and put these vehicles on the road. I don’t want any of them coming down the road at me."" After reaching out to Muntzel, he told us that the figure he claimed came from a report from the Missouri State Highway Patrol. This report came from data collected from all of the inspection stations in Missouri. The report from the highway patrol showing the number of vehicles that passed or failed inspection can be found in the fiscal notes of the bill. Lt. Collin M. Stosberg, director of the Public Information and Education Division of the Missouri Highway Patrol, confirmed the numbers. ""When you look at vehicles 10 to 20 years old, the rejection rate is approximately 25%,"" he said. ""Also, 51 percent of all vehicles registered in Missouri are over 10 years old,"" Strosberg added. According to him, Missouri has a 19% rejection rate for all vehicles statewide that are inspected (which means they are at least five years old). The bill passed the Missouri House of Representatives in March. It has been referred to the Transportation, Infrastructure and Public Safety committee after its second reading in the Senate. As of April 4. there has been no more progress. One of the reasons this bill was introduced was to help those in rural areas of Missouri. There is a current hardship to rural residents in an attempt to fulfill the requirement so regularly that often accounts to a 45-minute or more drive, supporters of the bill say. Muntzel said that one fourth of the vehicles on Missouri highways are defective. That’s leaving out important context. He made it sound like this number applied to all vehicles on the highway. In fact, this figure applies to vehicles that are 10 to 20 years old, which have an inspection rejection rate of 25 percent. Under current law, only vehicles more than five years old require inspection. For vehicles more than five years old that require inspection, 19 percent fail. Furthermore, Muntzel’s claim that one fourth of vehicles are defective wouldn’t be much different under the new bill. This is because the claim is referring to vehicles 10 to 20 years old. Vehicles 10 years and older would still require the same amount of inspections they are currently held to, one every two years, under House Bill 451. Muntzel’s statement needs more context that the vehicles in this figure are more than 10 years old. One fourth of all vehicles on Missouri highways are not defective. We rate this claim Half True.

Do prescription drug monitoring programs leave states ""worse off""?
","Missouri is the only state without a statewide prescription drug monitoring program, or a PDMP. That would change if House Bill 188 is passed. The programs are part of the effort to combat the opioid crisis. They track and distribute prescription data to make sure doctors aren’t overprescribing. They also provide doctors with information on best practices to encourage other methods of pain management. But not everyone is sold on the effectiveness of these programs. In an opinion piece on the Missouri Senate website, state Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin said, ""When comparing state by state, the data clearly demonstrates that over 20 other states with PDMPs are still substantially worse off than Missouri in terms of curbing the effects of opioid abuse."" We decided to see if this was true. We reached out to O’Laughlin and found she got this information from Centers for Disease Control data about drug overdose deaths. This data measures all drug overdose deaths, not just those related to opioids, so we referenced a more specific data set from the Kaiser Family Foundation. According to this table, Missouri was 21st in opioid overdoses in 2017. But the issue is more complicated than that. Although each of the 49 other states has a PDMP, they’re all different, so it’s not easy to make comparisons. There are two different kinds of PDMPs: voluntary and mandatory. States with voluntary programs make the PDMP system available to prescribers, but don’t require them to use it before prescribing opioids. Randall Williams, director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the Missouri bill is proposing a voluntary program, but the CDC cites success in states with mandatory programs. A 2016 study led by Vanderbilt University researcher Stephen W. Patrick found states with more aggressive programs ""including monitoring greater numbers of drugs with abuse potential and updating their data at least weekly had greater reductions in deaths, compared to states whose programs did not have these characteristics."" The academic findings on this topic are mixed. A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found the evidence for PDMP effects is lacking, and even said these programs may have ""unintended consequences"" such as increased rates of heroin abuse. But experts agree that PDMP effectiveness can’t be measured by mortality alone. A CDC study found ""while PDMPs are potentially an important tool to prevent the nonmedical use of prescribed controlled substances, their impact is not reflected in drug overdose mortality rates."" ""It’s very difficult to compare states to each other by any metric because there are so many confounding factors,"" Williams said. He used St. Louis as an example. He said two-thirds of Missouri’s drug mortality is in St. Louis, but he attributes this to the availability of fentanyl, not to doctors overprescribing. State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin said, ""When comparing state by state, the data clearly demonstrates that over twenty other states with PDMPs are still substantially worse off than Missouri in terms of curbing the effects of opioid abuse."" Among the states, Missouri does rank 21st from the bottom in opioid overdose deaths. Equally important, there’s a wide variation in how PDMP programs are structured and can’t be compared directly. Academic studies cite other challenges in judging the effectiveness of PDMPs beyond mortality rates. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Center for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Drug Overdose Deaths,"" accessed March 1, 2019.', 'https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html'), ('Center for Disease Control and Prevention, ""State Successes,"" accessed April 15, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Fink et al., ""Association Between Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and Nonfatal and Fatal Drug Overdoses,"" accessed April 19, 2019.', 'https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/policy/successes.html'), ('Finley et al., ""Evaluating the impact of prescription drug monitoring program implementation: a scoping review,"" accessed April 15, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Opioid Overdose Death Rates and All Drug Overdose Death Rates per 100,000 Population (Age-Adjusted),"" accessed April 30, 2019.', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801093'), ('Patrick et al., ""Implementation Of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Associated With Reductions In Opioid-Related Death Rates."" accessed April 17, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Paulozzi et al., ""A national epidemic of unintentional prescription opioid overdose deaths: how physicians can help control it."" accessed April 15, 2019.', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633638'), ('Phone interview, Randall Williams, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director, April 17, 2019.', 'No link'), (""Email interview, Paul Curtman, Chief of Staff, State Senator Cindy O'Laughlin, District 18"", 'https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-death-rates/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22All%20Drug%20Overdose%20Death%20Rate%20(Age-Adjusted)%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D')]",/factchecks/2019/may/02/cindy-olaughlin/do-prescription-drug-monitoring-programs-leave-sta/

Yes, millions of families spend the bulk of income on housing
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., argued in a CNN town hall that a major sign of inequality can be seen in how much people pay for housing.  ""I believe something is wrong in America today when you've got millions of families paying 40, 50, 60% of their limited incomes to put a roof over their heads,"" Sanders said. Are millions of American families spending more on housing than almost anything else combined? We looked into the burden of housing for American families. Sanders was talking about renters, a spokesperson for the Sanders 2020 campaign told PolitiFact. The campaign cited a study from the National Low Income Housing Coalition that said 10.7 million renter households spent more than half of their income on housing in 2017. In 2016, households that spend over half of their total income in housing included about 11 million renters (out of 43.76 million renting households) and 7.5 million owners (out of 75 million owning households) nationwide, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. The center crunched the numbers from the American Community Survey data. These families are considered ""severely housing cost-burdened"" by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The category of moderately cost-burdened (with 30 to 50% of income spent on housing) families add another 9.8 million to the renter households and 7.5 million to the owner households. HUD uses the 30% threshold to determine if a household is house cost-burdened — a rule long been applied in academic research that families should spend no more than 30% of income on housing. Rent burden, or the share of rent over household income, measures housing affordability and indicates quality of living. The median rent burden for American families was 25.4% in 2014, an analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found. The median mortgage burden is 15.9%. The United States has the 15th highest median rent and mortgage burden among its OECD counterparts. Over the years, the renters’ burden has not improved. Former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan in 2014 pushed for housing finance reforms, saying, ""This is the worst rental affordability crisis this country has ever known,"" according to HousingWire’s reporting. Heavier burden of rent has not only affected lower-income households. More higher-income families have become cost-burdened, according to a report by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Studies by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies suggest that in 2001, 42% of American renter households spent more than 30% of their income to put a roof over heads. In 2016, the percentage of households has grown to 47%. Sanders said that ""millions of families"" are paying ""40, 50, 60% of their limited incomes to put a roof over their heads."" The most recent data shows that he’s right about both homeowners and renters all across the United States: there were about 18.5 million households spending more than 50% of their income on housing alone in 2016.

Trump hits pay dirt with claim on Wisconsin's low unemployment
","If there’s one thing President Donald Trump loves to boast about, it’s jobs, jobs, jobs. During an April 27, 2019 rally in Green Bay, Trump made sure his supporters in Wisconsin knew just how good the state unemployment rate has become. ""The unemployment rate for Wisconsin workers has reached historic lows,"" Trump told the crowd. ""It’s never been this low before, ever, ever, ever."" As of March 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wisconsin had a 2.9 percent unemployment rate. But, was there ever a time in history when it was even lower? We decided to do some digging. The backup Historical data from the BLS shows Wisconsin has been on a downward spiral of unemployment since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. Since then, the highest unemployment rate recorded in Wisconsin reached 9.3 percent with the lowest being where it stands now at 2.9 percent. But, was there a time that it’s ever been below that figure? BLS spokesman Gary Steinberg says it has been close, but the 2.9 percent is the lowest unemployment rate for Wisconsin on record. ""Unemployment rate data for Wisconsin are comparable back to 1976,"" Steinberg said. ""The unemployment rate of 2.9 percent in both January and February 2019 are the lowest on record."" National ranking Nationally, Wisconsin’s 2.9 percent in March 2019 left it tied with Idaho and Virginia. That means Wisconsin ranked eighth in the country. North Dakota and Vermont tied at first with a 2.3 percent unemployment rate. Alaska, meanwhile, was at the bottom with an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent. Wisconsin’s Department of Workforce Development reported the state added 11,400 total non-farm jobs and 19,300 private-sector jobs from February of 2018 to February of 2019. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's labor force participation rate -- a measuring stick that looks at the other side of the equation -- was 67.5 percent in February. That was more than four points better than the national rate. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin had the lowest unemployment rate ever at a recent rally in Green Bay. The available data backs up his claim that Wisconsin hasn’t had a lower unemployment rate to its 2.9 percent.

Booker’s argument for environmental justice stays within the lines
","As part of Sen. Cory Booker’s presidential primary campaign, the New Jersey Democrat talks about ""environmental justice"" — which seems to mean addressing the environmental factors that disproportionately affect people who are low-income and from minority backgrounds. One issue he’s highlighting: the impact of so-called Superfund sites, hazardous waste sites that are especially prevalent in Booker’s home state, and usually located in the same neighborhoods as low-income residents, often African American or Hispanic. In an April 29 interview with MSNBC, Booker cast that issue not only as a challenge for social justice and equality but also as a public health problem. ""We now have longitudinal data that shows that children born around Superfund sites have dramatically higher rates of birth defects, dramatically higher rates of autism,"" he said. This isn’t the first time Booker has made this argument, and it likely won’t be the last. So, we decided to dig in and see how it stands up to scrutiny. First, the data Booker’s press team sent us two Superfund studies: a 2008 paper on the association between toxic landfills and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and a 2011 study probing that association regarding congenital anomalies (the ""birth defects"" Booker mentioned). In the autism paper, researchers mapped the location of New Jersey Superfund sites and almost 500 children diagnosed with ASD from 1998 to 2006, finding that cases appeared in higher frequency closer to the sites. Those researchers also checked for a relationship between higher numbers of Superfund sites in a state and frequency of ASDs. That analysis ""reveal[ed] considerable overlap"" between high Superfund rates and autism diagnoses — though the authors were quick to caution that a correlation didn’t mean one caused the other. The 2014 paper looked at births from 1989 to 2003, near Superfund sites in Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Texas — all of which were cleaned up at some point in that time frame. Before a site was cleaned up, infants were, on average, 20% to 25% more likely to have a congenital birth defect. ""This does suggest that the Superfund sites caused birth defects,"" argued Janet Currie, a study author and professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, in an email to KHN. Both of these are longitudinal studies, meaning the research was collected over time to track patterns and changes.   Booker’s phrasing is quite deliberate – and that matters for his case We spoke to environmental health researchers unaffiliated with the studies. They said it would be very difficult to prove that being born near a Superfund site causes kids to be born with birth defects, or causes autism. It helps that in his statements Booker doesn’t try to make that case. One caveat, though, is that a casual listener could draw that conclusion. The studies he’s working with are ""fairly exploratory,"" said David Savitz, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University’s School of Public Health. While they support the idea of a link between autism and Superfund sites, or birth defects and such sites, they don’t go so far as to support a case for causality. Other factors could contribute, too. ""It’s not hard to imagine all the ways the communities proximal to waste sites may be different — a lot of ways other than just having the waste site,"" Savitz said. But Booker’s comments are rooted in legitimate data sources. Both those studies are peer-reviewed and suggest there could be some kind of relationship. So, the center of his claim — there is data that shows children near Superfund sites having higher rates of congenital abnormalities and autism — does, in fact, check out. Even so, environmental health experts said, much more work is needed to understand the nature of that claim. Risk factors for autism are still not well-identified. And congenital abnormalities can refer to a range of different problems — so research that lumps them together may gloss over important distinctions, especially when it comes to what might cause a specific birth defect. The bigger picture Booker is getting at a larger truth: Many chemicals found at Superfund sites are related to health problems, the experts said. And, those same experts added, his environmental justice framing is one that makes sense, too, given the demographics of those most often affected. From a policy standpoint, Savitz argued, Booker’s bigger point — that cleaning up Superfunds would improve health outcomes, in particular for marginalized people — is clearly true. The only real issue, some suggested, is his use of the word ""dramatically."" The data suggests potential correlation, but whether it’s ""dramatic"" is far from clear. ""Certainly there is evidence to back up his claim,"" said Amanda Bakian, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah, who studies environmental contributors to autism risk. ""There’s been work finding an association, but the relationship is modest. … We do need more research in this area."" Our rating Booker is correct in saying data shows that children born near Superfund sites have higher rates of birth defects and autism. In this statement, he doesn’t specifically say there is a causal relationship — which is important, because the data does not necessarily say Superfund proximity causes those issues, and more research would be needed to support that claim.   The use of the word ""dramatically"" causes a bit of trouble, however. The datasets show statistically significant correlations. But that isn’t the same thing as a ""dramatically higher rate."" The statement is true, but could use more context. We rate it Mostly True.

No, Joe Biden didn’t say the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor
","Former Vice President Joe Biden is officially running for commander-in-chief, and the memes are coming in hot. ""I am an optimist because the American people — given half the chance — have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down,"" reads the text over a picture of Biden that appeared on Facebook on April 29. ""Even after the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor."" This post, which attributes the quote to Biden, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden’s campaign didn’t immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact asking if the quote is authentic. We did not find that it is. Biden has called himself an optimist before. In 2010, for example, as he gave a speech about U.S.-Israeli relations, but he was talking about ""the prospects for peace,"" not World War II. Or in October 2018, when speaking at Youngstown State University in Ohio. ""I am an optimist,"" the Vindicator quotes him as saying. ""I am an optimist because I know the history of the journey of this country … We have always had faith in the ability of ordinary people to do extraordinary things."" But we didn’t find evidence that Biden ever blamed Germany for the Pearl Harbor bombing. (Japan was responsible.) When we searched for the quote in connection with Joe Biden in Nexis, a database of news stories, there were no results. Looking for news stories connecting the former veep to Germany and Pearl Harbor, we turned up instances of other politicians erring on the attack’s history.   In 2012, Keith Ellison, then one of Minnesota’s congressmen, said ""they attacked Pearl Harbor"" on Fox News as Bill O’Reilly talked about Nazi Germany. In 2017, President Donald Trump misquoted Franklin D. Roosevelt, who on Dec. 8, 1941, called the bombing a day earlier ""a date which will live in infamy."" (Trump tweeted, ""‘A day that will live in infamy!’"") That same year, Melania Trump tweeted about the attack and said it occurred in November before reposting the message with the right date, Politico then reported. We also found a 2014 Christian Science Monitor story that wonders if Joe Biden is the John Belushi of the Democratic Party. In it, Washington editor Peter Grier quotes a rousing speech Belushi gives in his oft-quoted role as John ""Bluto"" Blutarsky in the movie ""Animal House."" Writes Grier: With Democrats on the verge of a possibly deflating vote, Mr. Biden played the role of defiant cheerleader this weekend. He sat down with CNN’s Gloria Borger and said he’s not buying all those forecasts that show the GOP making big gains. ""I don’t agree with the odds makers,"" said Biden. ""I predict we’re going to keep the Senate."" OK, so Joe was not as worked up as John Belushi in his famous ""Animal House"" speech. (""Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? (Expletive) no!"")

No, it was not illegal to profit off U.S. healthcare before a Nixon-era law
","An Internet post about the commercialization of American health care misread history by claiming it was illegal for companies to turn a profit until President Richard Nixon signed a law that opened the floodgates. ""Did you know that before 1973 it was illegal in the US to profit off health care?"" the post states. ""The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 passed by Nixon changed everything."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The viral post does contain a kernel of truth: The industry became more commercially driven during this era. But while health care did go from a mostly nonprofit venture to one that was more lucrative as a result of the law, it’s an overstatement to say profit-making was illegal prior to the Nixon era. The definition of what an HMO is has morphed a bit over time. But essentially it’s a company that blends insurance functions and health care functions, said Daniel Polsky, a health economics professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""The HMO act of 1973 promoted the development of HMOs,"" Polsky said. ""After the act, these types of organizations became easier to form and operate."" The early prepaid group practice plans — the prototypes for HMOs — were all nonprofit. But the 1973 legislation unleashed the development of for-profit HMOs, said Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton University. ""Many of the early HMOs were subsequently bought by for-profit insurers,"" said Starr, who authored a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the history of American health care. ""So the industry as a whole has changed quite dramatically."" It’s worth noting the post also claims that Nixon pushed the federal HMO Act as a kickback to his political backer Edgar Kaiser. ""In 1973, Nixon did a personal favor for his friend and campaign financier, Edgar Kaiser, then president and chairman of Kaiser Permanente,"" the post states, adding that the company ""got the first taste of federal subsidies"" as a result of the law. Our friends at Snopes noted this element of the claim — which it calls the post's ""primary emotional hook"" — is false. The fact-checking outlet cited a Kaiser Permanente fact sheet, which notes that due to legislative tweaks, the bill Nixon signed into law ""had been so diluted by the political process ... that Kaiser Permanente, a central model at the outset, did not qualify as an HMO until the act was amended four years later."" While the legislation scrambled the economics of health care, it did not have as dramatic an impact on American law. In short, it was legal to profit off health care before the act — but there’s an important wrinkle to the legal dimension. Allison K. Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies health care, told us the law can be seen as ""part of the tide of the corporatization of medicine that is now fully turned."" ""The HMO act did bring the idea of competition into the spotlight in health care,"" Hoffman said. ""But it neither began this trend nor transformed it from illegal to legal, for the most part."" Hoffman hedged somewhat on that last point — no legal transformation ""for the most part"" — because the Nixon-era act did rejigger the relationship between HMOs and state legislatures. Specifically, the 1973 act made HMOs exempt from state laws that kept medical decisions in the hands of doctors. As a result, the medical practice was subject to more corporate influence. ""That could be characterized as making profiteering legal in health care,"" she said. ""But, even with these laws in place, MDs and hospitals had profit motives well before the HMO Act came to be."" Hoffman added, ""There was clearly profit in health care — and profit motive — before 1973."" Some U.S. health care stakeholders — from insurers to hospital chains — have operated for profit since the 1950s and 1960s — prior to the act’s passage. Others have done so for their entire existence, said Katherine Hempstead, a senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. ""The drug and device industries have always been for profit,"" she said. Internet bloggers said that ""before 1973 it was illegal in the U.S. to profit off of health care."" The legislation did make the industry more commercially driven, but it’s wrong to say profit-making in the U.S. health care sector was illegal prior to Nixon’s signing of the HMO Act of 1973. Insurers and hospital chains generated profits decades earlier, and drug companies and medical device makers have always operated for profit.

Unfounded Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton resurfaces
","There have been multiple scandalous theories attributed to the Clinton family, and one that claims Hillary Clinton is connected to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing has recently resurfaced on social media. The post – which displays an aerial image of the destroyed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and a photo of Clinton superimposed on it – says: ""Reminder: The building in Oklahoma City was blown up and destroyed just 4 days before Hillary Clinton was to be indicted in the Whitewater scandal. All documents lost!"" The meme was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s cut to the chase: There is no evidence to support the suggestion that Clinton, then first lady, was to be indicted in the Whitewater case or had anything to do with the bombing carried out by Timothy McVeigh that killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. Government officials denied that any documents associated with the case were in the Murrah building, according to a 1995 Washington Post article about conspiracy theories surrounding the event. Moreover, according to a report issued after the bombing, the list of government departments with regional offices housed in the Murrah building did not include the Department of Justice. The first version of the conspiracy theory, which came about shortly after the bombing, implicated then-President Bill Clinton, saying he orchestrated the bombing to protect himself from the brewing scandal. The 21-Century meme version redirects the blame toward Hillary. The July 1995 article by the Washington Post detailed many competing conspiracy theories that arose after the bombing, and at one point, discusses one theory that places the blame on President Clinton’s attempts to evade a scandal: ""A common theme is that (Bill) Clinton or rogue factions within the government ordered the bombing to divert attention from embarrassing issues such as the Whitewater probe and the Branch Davidian siege in Waco, Tex.,"" the article states. ""Theorists have speculated that documents related to Whitewater or Waco were kept in the Oklahoma City federal building and destroyed in the blast; the government has denied this. Others believe that Clinton arranged for the death and destruction so he could come across as a strong leader amid the ensuing chaos and boost his sagging popularity."" It is accurate that the Clintons were investigated in the 1990s as part of the Whitewater scandal, a failed real estate investment project they took part in with Jim McDougal, a real estate entrepreneur. The project sank for a myriad of reasons, and while the Clintons invested in a bad land deal, none of the investigations found that they did anything illegal. McDougal, on the other hand, was convicted for crimes that were discovered during the course of the investigation. But nowhere in the investigation files does it say that indictments against Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton were pending but made impossible when incriminating documents were destroyed in the Oklahoma City bombing. As well, the Clintons were actually interviewed for the investigation three days after the bombing occurred. If any part of the claim was true, not only would it have been documented in case files, but it would have been widely reported as a bombshell development in the scandal and the bombing, both of which were closely monitored by the national press. A meme on social media suggests Hillary Clinton had something to do with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing because she was to be ""indicted"" in a scandal four days after the bombing, but the blast destroyed documents related to the case. We could quibble about whether the Clintons were involved in any wrongdoing related to Whitewater, but the meme’s suggestion that Hillary was to be indicted days after the bombing, and that investigation documents related to the scandal were suspiciously destroyed in the event, is false and lacks any supporting evidence.

"['Poverty', 'Wisconsin', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump says Wisconsin poverty rate is lowest in 22 years. It’s not.
","At a April 27, 2019 rally in Green Bay before 10,000 boisterous supporters, President Donald Trump blazed his way through a typical barrage of claims and statistics in a stump speech that stretched well over an hour. After calling Wisconsin — a key state in his 2016 general election victory — a ""special place,"" he threw out two rapid fire claims on the state’s poverty and unemployment levels. We’ll tackle the first of those here. ""The poverty rate for Wisconsin families has reached the lowest rate in 22 years,"" Trump said, a pronouncement greeted by cheers from the Resch Center crowd. His claim is very precise — Wisconsin, families, 22 years. Let’s see if the facts match up. The White House did not provide any supporting evidence when asked for data to support the claim. The U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks poverty through a variety of surveys, recommended using the Current Population Survey for state-level poverty estimates. It’s the only tool that goes back far enough to cover the period in Trump’s claim — 22 years. The CPS family poverty measure shows a 6.1% poverty level for Wisconsin in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. That’s the lowest mark since 2002, a span of 15 years. Going back 22 years from now, as Trump’s claim does, takes us to 1997. The state poverty rate was lower than the current 6.1% four times 1998 to 2002 —  so Trump is not accurate by that measure. Another Census dataset, the American Community Survey, tracks poverty by family and shows several more recent years with rates lower than 2017. The community survey, which began in 2005, puts the 2017 family poverty rate at 7.1% in Wisconsin. The survey reported lower rates in 2005 and 2008. Both surveys say poverty has declined by several percentage points since 2011. That said, the state’s Institute for Research on Poverty warns against drawing conclusions on poverty from those traditional measures alone. The institute is an independent, multidisciplinary group within the University of Wisconsin. The Census assessments compare pre-tax cash income to a set threshold that is adjusted for family size to determine if a family is in poverty. ""The trouble is if you look at the official poverty measure, it doesn’t cover things like the taxes they pay or the cost of going to work, and it doesn’t include the Earned Income Tax Credit or SNAP (food stamps) and other non-cash benefits,"" said Timothy Smeeding, professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former director of the poverty institute. To address that, the institute developed a Wisconsin Poverty Measure — similar to one used at the federal level — that takes into account government programs and subsidies that assist low-income people. That shows poverty has changed little in Wisconsin since the metric was created in 2008. The Wisconsin Poverty Measure rate has ranged from a high of 11.2% in 2008 to a low of 9.7% in 2015. The latest data, from 2016, actually showed an increase — from 9.7% to 10.8%. ""In other words, the idea that we’ve had some big drop in poverty? No,"" Smeeding said. ""This doesn’t jibe with reality. We haven’t done that well in this state. We’re barely treading water … particularly in Milwaukee, which is in terrible shape."" Trump said Wisconsin’s poverty rate for families is at the lowest level in 22 years. Three measurements used by experts say that’s not the case. Indeed, the Census survey that goes back as far as Trump’s claim shows 2017 was just the fifth-lowest rate for individuals in the last 22 years.

President Trump's China trade deficit claim doesn't quite measure up to $500B
","President Donald Trump fired up supporters April 27, 2019, in Green Bay with broadsides against Democrats and the media, as well as statements touting GOP health care plans, lower poverty rates and the American economy. ""We're now the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world and it's not even close,"" the president told the crowd of thousands at the Resch Center. Trump later called the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement ""one of the worst trade deals ever signed in the history of our country"" and said if you ""look around Wisconsin you still see the scars."" Continuing on trade, the president said his administration is ""very close to making a deal with China."" ""We have been losing to China for many years, $500 billion a year,"" Trump said. ""We have rebuilt China. We've given them so much."" Is President Trump right that the U.S. is losing $500 billion a year to China? Not exactly. Trade deficit with China As PolitiFact National has noted, a country’s trade balance is simply the difference between the value of its imports and exports, and a trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. The U.S. trade deficit in goods (i.e. products) with China in 2018 rose to $419.2 billion, up from from the previous record of $375.5 billion in 2017, according to a Commerce Department report. In 2016, the deficit with China in goods was $347 billion. The U.S. Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, documents the U.S. trade deficit in goods with China dating back to 1985, when the deficit was $6 billion.   Our colleagues at PolitiFact National have checked the president’s claim of a $500 billion trade deficit with China at least twice. A 2018 fact-check, one of the most recent that addressed trade specifically with China, evaluated this claim from Trump: ""Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China."" In 2017, the year cited, the value of Chinese goods imported to the United States ($505 billion) exceeded American goods exports to China ($130 billion) by roughly $375 billion. So, at the time Trump's $500 billion figure was off by $125 billion. PolitiFact National surmised Trump may have confused the Chinese trade deficit with the United States’ overall trade deficit, which was $566 billion in 2017, or it’s also possible Trump used the $500 billion figure as a matter of habit. In any case, the claim was rated Mostly False. In his most recent claim, Trump is closer because the deficit has grown -- to $419 billion in 2018. But he is still well off the mark. Foxconn connection A footnote: Though Trump did not mention the planned Foxconn plant in Wisconsin, some analysts believe there is a connection between it and trade negotiations with China. Taiwan-based Foxconn has promised that 13,000 jobs will be created in Racine County at its planned flat-screen manufacturing complex -- though those numbers have long been in doubt. In January 2019, there were reports Foxconn was reconsidering its investment. More recently, Gov. Tony Evers said Foxconn officials said they wanted to rewrite a contract that lays out what size investments Foxconn must make in Wisconsin in order to receive taxpayer subsidies. And on April 30, 2019, Foxconn chairman and CEO Terry Gou visited the White House potentially to discuss the sprawling manufacturing facility the Taiwanese tech giant is building in southeastern Wisconsin. In February, when Foxconn recommitted to the operation, Gou said he and Trump spoke about the big stakes of the U.S.-China trade war. ""U.S. President Trump shared with me yesterday on the phone that the negotiation progress between China and the U.S. is going well, and it is likely that they will come up with an agreement soon,"" Gou said, according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review. At the time, some trade analysts told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they thought Foxconn's promise to build a manufacturing complex in Wisconsin amounts to a bargaining chip in the economic conflict between Washington and Beijing. ""If you think foreign investment is one of the moving pieces (in the trade talks), it absolutely is,"" said Mary Lovely, an economist who specializes in international trade and investment at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. ""It’s pawns on the chess board."" Our rating At a rally in Green Bay, Trump said ""We have been losing to China for many years, $500 billion a year."" While it’s true the U.S. has faced a trade deficit with China for many years, the president’s use of the $500 billion figure is an overreach. To be sure, Trump’s repeated use of the figure is getting closer -- mainly because the trade gap is growing. But it’s still off. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('Factbase: Trump rally transcript, Green Bay, April 27, 2019 at 00:16:54-00:17:33 mark', 'https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-maga-rally-green-bay-wisconsin-april-27-2019'), ('The New York Times, ""In a blow to Trump, America’s trade deficit in goods hits record $891 billion,"" March 6, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Politico, ""U.S. trade gap with China reaches all-time high under Trump,"" March 6, 2019.', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/us-trade-deficit.html'), ('The New York Times ""U.S.-China trade deficit hits record, fueling trade fight,"" Feb. 6, 2018.', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact National ""Did the U.S. have a $500 billion deficit with China in 2017,"" March 28, 2018. \xa0', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/06/us-china-trade-deficit-record-1242498'), ('PolitiFact National ""Trump says that trade imbalance between U.S. and China tops $500B"" Nov. 10, 2015.', 'No link'), ('The New York Times ""Foxconn reconsidering plans for a Wisconsin factory heralded by Trump,"" Jan. 30, 2019. \xa0', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/politics/us-china-trade-deficit.html'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Donald Trump heralds end of ‘collusion delusion’ in return to battleground Wisconsin,"" April 27, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Wisconsin’s high-subsidy Foxconn project seen as ‘pawn’ in U.S.-China trade war,"" Feb. 8, 2019.', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/28/donald-trump/did-us-have-500-billion-deficit-china-2017/'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Foxconn CEO GOU visiting the White House today to discuss Wisconsin facility,"" April 30, 2019. \xa0', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""Foxconn must meet job creation goals to get subsidies.

Elizabeth Warren says she warned about the financial crisis before it happened. That's True
","Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned about the financial crisis of the 2000s before it happened, she claimed during a CNN town hall where she pitched herself as the best option for president in the 2020 election. Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, told an audience of college students that her whole life’s work has been ""about what's happening to working families."" ""And starting in the early 2000s, the crisis was coming. I was waving my arms, ringing the bell, doing everything I could. I said families are getting cheated all over this country,"" Warren said April 22 in Manchester, N.H. ""It started when the mortgage companies targeted communities of color. They targeted seniors. They targeted Latinos. They came in and sold the worst possible mortgages and stripped wealth out of those communities, and then took those products across the nation. I went everywhere I could. I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming."" But nobody wanted to listen, Warren said, ""so the crisis hit in 2007, 2008, and just took us down."" We confirmed that Warren did raise the alarm about the looming housing and financial crisis. She spoke about debt, financial lending practices and other factors affecting families and the economy years before the financial crisis peaked in 2008. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes during the recent Great Recession, generally regarded as happening from late 2007 to mid 2009. Experts say the financial crisis resulted from a number of colliding factors, including an unsustainable housing boom partly driven by an easy availability of mortgages, banks taking on too much risk, government policies and lax regulation. Subprime loans — loans at higher interest rates made to people perceived to be at greater risk for defaulting on loans (including families with low and moderate income and poor credit histories) — played a key role in the housing crisis. Warren’s presidential campaign cited several blog posts and comments to media outlets in 2005 and 2006, and Warren’s 2003 book, ""The Two-Income Trap,"" co-authored with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, as examples of Warren warning about subprime lending and an imminent housing crisis. Warren has represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate since 2013. Before going to Congress, she taught law at the university level for more than 30 years, most recently at Harvard, specializing in commercial law, contracts, and bankruptcy. Subprime lenders defended their business practices by saying they were helping more families own homes, Warren’s book said, but that’s ""little more than public relations hot air."" ""In the overwhelming majority of cases, subprime lenders prey on families that already own their own homes, rather than expanding access to new homeowners. Fully 80 percent of subprime mortgages involve refinancing loans for families that already own their homes,"" Warren said in the book. ""For these families, subprime lending does nothing more than increase the family's housing costs, taking resources away from other investments and increasing the chances that the family will lose its home if anything goes wrong."" In a June 2004 interview with PBS’s NOW host David Brancaccio, Warren spoke about growing household debt, against risky mortgage lending practices and what she regarded as bad advice to Americans by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Warren said Greenspan encouraged families to borrow against their house to pay for basic expenses. ""I think what the landscape shows is the middle class is under assault in a way that has not happened before in our history,"" Warren said. ""Stagnant wages, rising costs, wildly rising debt. It's in everyone's interest to turn that back around."" Warren’s campaign noted that The New York Times quoted Warren in an October 2005 article that said homeowners in suburbs were taking on more and more home-equity debt to stay out of bankruptcy. The article said: ""Professor Warren of Harvard believes that disaster lurks as homeowners borrow against their homes to forestall bankruptcy. When the stock market tumbled five years ago, people in trouble could sell stocks to stay afloat, she said. But home equity doesn't work the same way. As she put it, ‘You can't sell a part of your home like you could a stock in the stock market bubble.’"" Warren told the newspaper that after a new bankruptcy law went into effect that month, filing for bankruptcy would become more difficult: ""And that means more families are set up to lose their homes."" Warren was ""substantially correct"" in her assessment that home prices were going up rapidly relative to incomes (particularly for households with a one wage earner), said Ed Pinto, co-director of the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But Pinto disagrees with Warren about what caused the crisis. Warren ""blames banks and lenders, when in fact Congress and government policies aimed at making homes ‘more affordable’ are the root cause,"" Pinto said. (Check out our 2008 in-depth analysis on the causes of the financial crisis and how that issue was debated in the 2008 presidential campaign. Then, both Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama said they sounded warnings, and both blamed the other for helping cause the crisis.) Warren was also a vocal opponent of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, because she thought the law would hurt consumers, said Deborah Goldstein, an executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, which advocates for consumer financial protections. Rising credit card debt hurt Americans already struggling with mortgage payments. ""I remember (Warren) talking about credit card abuses and how they were harming families,"" Goldstein said. ""People were using credit to manage basic daily expenses."" Goldstein said that her group, also concerned about the imminent financial crisis, in the early 2000s communicated with Warren on what could be done about it. ""I'd give then-professor Warren the credit for banging the drum and ringing the bell early on unfair financial practices,"" said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of the Federal Consumer Program at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Warren was the ""No. 1 go-to academic expert"" in the mid-to-late '90s and 2000s in the debate over changes to the bankruptcy code, he said. Warren in January 2007 testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, saying that the credit card market was broken and hurt consumers. Warren was chosen in 2008 to lead the Congressional Oversight Panel, established by Congress to review the state of the financial markets and the regulatory system. Warren also helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau emerged from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, designed to enforce federal consumer financial laws and protect consumers. In 2013 and 2014, Goldstein's group collaborated with the CFPB in drafting payday lending rules. Speaking of the financial crisis that gained traction in 2007, Warren said, ""I talked about it to anyone who would listen, a crisis is coming."" There is documented evidence that Warren spoke against risky mortgage lending practices, rising debt and other factors that contributed to the financial and housing crisis years before it materialized. We rate Warren's claim True.","[('CNN Transcripts, CNN Presidential Town Hall with Sen.

NY AG emphasizes key fact in citizenship question case
","The Trump administration’s plan to ask about citizenship on the 2020 Census survey form has New York and other states with high immigrant populations worried the question will result in a significant undercount, something the Census Bureau has said would happen. The concern is that many undocumented immigrants, fearful that declaring their status on the Census form will lead to deportation or other negative consequences, won’t respond to the Census at all. Last week, New York brought its case to the U.S. Supreme Court that an undercount would deprive them of federal funds and representation in Congress. The predicted undercount was discussed during oral arguments on April 23 in Department of Commerce v. New York.   Afterward, outside the courthouse, New York Attorney General Letitia James said that an accurate count of everyone living in a state, not just U.S. citizens, is required under the Constitution. ""The enumeration clause speaks to the count of every individual,"" James said. ""And not just Americans, not just citizens. It’s everyone."" Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that an ""actual enumeration"" should be made every 10 years, but we wondered how that has been interpreted by the courts and the government, and whether it is clear that the Constitution mandates that every person be counted. We approached James’ office with this question, and spokeswoman Kelly Donnelly provided copious documentation to support the attorney general’s statement. The first piece of evidence Donnelly sent is a list of 62 facts to which both sides in the court case agree, known as a joint stipulation. The first item on the list is: ""The U.S. Constitution requires the federal government to conduct a Decennial Census counting the total number of ‘persons’—with no reference to citizenship status—residing in each state."" Donnelly also sent references to several court cases that upheld this principle, including Wesberry v. Sanders, in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that apportionment must be based on inhabitants, and linked it to the Census. In another case, Federation for American Immigration Reform v. Klutznick, a three-judge panel in district court of the District of Columbia found that the plaintiffs lacked standing when they argued that non-citizens should not be counted for purposes of apportionment. The lower court’s decision in New York v. Department of Commerce also makes this principle clear. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, in the Southern District of New York, wrote about the enumeration clause in his opening paragraph: ""By its terms, therefore, the Constitution mandates that every ten years the federal government endeavor to count every single person residing in the United States, whether citizen or noncitizen, whether living here with legal status or without."" We also reached out to Census expert Margo Anderson, distinguished professor emerita at the  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and she said that the Census’ goal of counting every person, citizen or not, is undisputed. She directed us to the Census website, which states: ""The apportionment calculation is based upon the total resident population (citizens and non-citizens) of the 50 states."" The transcript of last week's oral argument in the New York case also reflects this. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that a ""maximum need"" of the Census is an actual count of everyone, not collecting data on citizenship. ""The enumeration is how many people reside here, not how many are citizens,"" she said. ""That's what the Census survey is supposed to figure out."" Later, Chief Justice John Roberts responded to New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, who argued that adding a citizenship question will depress the count. ""Well, the principal purpose -- you're -- you're right, the principal purpose is to count the population,"" Roberts said. ""But we've had demographic questions on the census -- I don't know how far back, but, certainly, it's quite common.""   James said that the enumeration clause of the Constitution requires a count of every individual, not only every citizen. There are many sources that give evidence for this claim, including several court cases. The parties in the case before the U.S. Supreme Court also agree that the Constitution requires a count of every individual. The Census website also makes clear that every individual residing in the United States must be counted. We rate James’ statement True.","[('Video of N.Y.
